We thank You for the inspiring memory of Queen Esther who, in \nthe fifth century B.C., threw caution to the wind and interceded with \nher husband, the King of Persia, to save the exiled Jewish people from \npersecution. The words of Mordecai to her, sound in our souls: `` . . . \nYou have come to the kingdom for such a time as this.''--Esther 4:14.\n  Lord of circumstances, we are moved profoundly by the way You use \nindividuals to accomplish Your plans and arrange what seems to be a \ncoincidence to bring about Your will for Your people. You have brought \neach of us to Your kingdom for such a time as this. You whisper in our \nsouls, ``I have plans for you, plans for good and not for evil, to give \nyou a future and a hope.''--Jeremiah 29:11.\n  Grant the Senators a heightened sense of the special role You have \nfor each of them to play in Your unfolding drama of American history. \nGive them a sense of destiny and a deep dependence upon Your guidance \nand grace.\n  Today, during Purim, we renew our commitment to fight against \nsectarian intolerance in our own hearts and religious persecution in so \nmany places in our world. This is Your world; let us not forget that \n``though the wrong seems oft so strong, You are the Ruler yet.''

BLACKBURN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will go into executive session and proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 673, which the clerk will now report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Robert E. Blackburn, of \nColorado, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nColorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I stand before the Senate today to urge \nmy fellow Members to confirm the nomination of the Honorable Robert E. \nBlackburn to the United States District Court for the District of \nColorado. My colleague from the State of Colorado, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, also strongly supports Judge Blackburn's \nnomination to the United States District Court for the District of \nColorado.\n  The nomination of Judge Blackburn is of particular importance to the \nState of Colorado because of a 50-percent vacancy rate on the district \nbench. In the Colorado District today, four judges struggle to do the \nwork of\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nnine judges, nine judges being the demonstrated need for the Federal \ndistrict court. I believe the Senate is going ahead and confirming \nMarcia Krieger who will be sworn in in March, which is a good step \nforward. With the confirmation and support of the nomination of Judge \nBlackburn, that begins to take care of some of the problems we are \nhaving in the court.\n  I hope my colleagues will take this opportunity to continue moving \nforward with judicial nominations in a timely manner--we must work to \nfill judicial vacancies so that the promised justice of our great \nconstitution is not hampered by bureaucracy and politics.\n  Judge Blackburn knows the law, and he knows Colorado. He graduated \nfrom the University of Colorado School of Law, and received his \nundergraduate degree from Western State College--both excellent schools \nin my home state.\n  He was raised on a farm in the proud community of Las Animas, \nColorado--a rural upbringing that helps the Judge keep one foot in the \nreal world while serving on the bench. This strong connection to \nColorado compliments his deep understanding of the law.\n  He has dutifully practiced law as an attorney and judge for over two \ndecades, and comes before the Senate today from state district court, a \npost he has held since 1988. Previously, Mr. Blackburn served as deputy \ndistrict attorney, Bent County attorney, municipal judge and City \nAttorney.\n  In addition to that, he has extensive experience as a business \nowner--an important experience that will serve him well while handling \nthe multiple demands of the federal bench. As an attorney, Mr. \nBlackburn practiced law in his own firm. And, together with his father, \nhe continues to raise registered Black Angus cattle.\n  Judge Blackburn was nominated to the bench with the help of a \nnominations committee. The committee is composed of well qualified, and \nhighly respected attorneys in Colorado. His nomination has gained the \nrespect of many people across the state and country. This nomination \ncommittee was set up by Senator Campbell and myself.\n  An editorial in the Denver Post, upon hearing of Judge Blackburn's \nnomination, proclaimed, ``We are delighted by the White House \ndecision.'' The column went on to praise the extensive experience of \nthe Judge, as well as his solid knowledge of the law and his reputation \nfor fairness.\n  The Denver Post also noted in their editorial that he is widely \nrespected by other judges and by the many lawyers who have appeared \nbefore him. The Post urged the Senate to exercise all reasonable speed \nwith the Blackburn nomination, saying, ``The long overworked federal \ncourt of Colorado needs qualified new judges, and it needs them now.''\n  Lewis T. Babcock, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court, District of \nColorado, believes Judge Blackburn is well qualified, and urges his \nappointment to help fill the district's half-vacant bench.\n  Judge Blackburn is imminently qualified for the U.S. District Court. \nThroughout his great service, Judge Blackburn has cultivated and \nkindled a great passion for our legal system and its constitution. He \nhas represented schools, banks, and departments of social services, \namong a myriad of other cases, both civil and criminal.\n  Madam President, I thank you for allowing me the time to discuss this \nimportant matter, and the nomination of an excellent judge. I urge the \nSenate's favorable consideration.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, the Senate is voting on two more \njudicial nominees. This morning Judge Robert Blackburn was confirmed to \nfill a judicial emergency in Colorado that has been vacant since April \n1998. Cindy Jorgenson will be filling a judicial emergency in Arizona \nthat has been vacant since 1999.\n  Colorado and Arizona are two of the many States with judicial \nemergencies that the Senate has been able to help so far this year. \nWith the confirmation of these two nominees, the Senate will have \nresolved five judicial emergencies since we returned to session just a \nfew short weeks ago and at least 10 since I became chairman this past \nsummer. Since the beginning of 2002 alone, we have filled judicial \nemergency vacancies in Texas, Alabama, and Nevada.\n  Today, we add Colorado and Arizona to that list. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has yet to work with home state Senators to send the Senate \nnominees to 14 other judicial emergency vacancies around the country.\n  With the completion of today's votes, the Senate will have confirmed \n11 judges since beginning this second session of this Congress toward \nthe end of January and 39 judges since the change in majority last \nsummer.\n  The number of judicial confirmations over these past 7 months--39--\nnow equals the number of judicial nominees confirmed during all 12 \nmonths of 2000 and exceeds the number of judges confirmed in all of \n1999, 1997 and 1996. In 7 months we have exceeded the 1-year totals for \n4 of the 6 years in which a Republican majority last controlled the \npace of confirmations.\n  There have been a number of statements from the administration \ncritical of the pace of confirmation during the past 8 months that I \nhave chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have been working hard \nto consider this President's nominees during the past 8 months as \ncompared to the pace set by the committee during its first 8 months of \nRepublican leadership in 1995.\n  Under Democratic leadership, during the past 8 months we have had \nmore hearings, for more nominees, and had more confirmations for both \nthe circuit and the district courts than the Republican leadership did \nfor President Clinton's nominees in 1995. In each area--hearings, \nnumber of nominees given hearings, and number of nominees confirmed--\nthis committee has exceeded the comparable period when Republicans were \nin power.\n  Republicans continue to perpetuate the myth that we are not acting on \njudicial nominations when in fact we are. I would submit that we have \nbeen moving at a strong pace to consider the nominees to the district \nand circuit courts. In fact, in the past 2 months, more judges have \nbeen confirmed than in January and February since 1995.\n  With the confirmation of Judge Blackburn this morning and the \nexpected confirmation of Judge Jorgenson today, 11 judges will have \nbeen confirmed since the beginning of this session of Congress. That \nnumber exceeds the total number of judges confirmed for the past 7 \nyears in January and February. No judges were confirmed in the first 2 \nmonths of the year in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and last year, when \nRepublicans were in the majority.\n  Only five judges were confirmed in January and February in 1998 and \nonly four were confirmed in 2000.\n  So I would say to my colleagues to please take a look at the record. \nI think the record shows that we are working hard to consider and vote \non this President's nominees, and we are making more progress on \nconfirmations than the Republicans did by this point in the year for \nthe past 7 years.\n  I offer my gratitude to the many Senators who have worked hard to \nhelp us confirm these qualified men and women to the Federal bench.\n  Not only have we been able to confirm as many or more judges in a \nshorter timeframe than were confirmed in four of the past 5 years, but \nwe have also done so at a faster pace than in any of the recent 6\\1/2\\ \nyears in which Republicans were most recently in the majority.\n  In fact, from the time the Senate received each nominee's ABA peer \nreview rating, we have been able to confirm judicial nominees in an \naverage of 71 days. We have also been making a great deal of progress \nin terms of the average number of days between nomination and \nconfirmation.\n  Some have asserted that we have been moving too slowly in considering \nnominees, but simply examining the dates of nomination and confirmation\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nshows that under Democratic leadership the Senate has substantially \nreduced the amount of time between nomination and confirmation as \ncompared to the previous five years, even though the ABA evaluation is \nnow being completed after nomination, unlike in previous years. I would \nadd that these dates cannot be manipulated by statisticians.\n  This President's nominees are being confirmed months earlier, on \naverage, than Democratic nominees under Republican leadership. And, the \naverage number of days between nomination and confirmation for judicial \nnominees in the Democratic-controlled Senate has been fewer than 75 \ndays after the receipt of ABA peer review results.\n  This average time is nearly one-third the time the Republicans took \nbetween the nomination and confirmation of President Clinton's nominees \nin his second term, for those nominees who actually received hearings \non their nominations.\n  The 32 judges confirmed to the District Courts have averaged less \nthan 65 days.\n  The seven circuit court judges confirmed so far have been confirmed \nmore than two-thirds faster than the time it took under the previous \nRepublican majority. These figures include recesses, time between \nsessions and the difficult days after September 11.\n  Today, the Senate took final action to fill a longstanding vacancy on \nthe District Court in Colorado.\n  I recall that President Clinton's nominee for this vacancy, Patricia \nCoan, languished for almost 19 months. She was never accorded a hearing \nor a vote by the Judiciary Committee. Had she and more than 50 other \nnominees been acted upon promptly in years past, the emergency status \nof vacancies in Colorado and in other Federal courts around the country \nwould be different today.\n  Unlike Patricia Coan, this President's nominee, Judge Robert \nBlackburn, has been considered promptly and courteously by the Senate. \nHe was nominated in September, received his ABA peer review in \nNovember, participated in the first January judicial confirmation \nhearing in 7 years, was reported favorably by the committee on February \n7, and today he was confirmed by the Senate.\n  When the Senate recently confirmed Judge Marcia Krieger to the other \nColorado vacancy earlier this year, Senator Allard noted that Colorado \nhad not had a Federal judge confirmed since 1984 and that four active \njudges were struggling to do the work of nine. The vacancy that Judge \nRobert Blackburn will fill has been held vacant since 1998. Despite the \ntreatment of qualified nominees in the recent past, the Senate has now \nconfirmed two new judges for Colorado in 2 months.\n  With the confirmation of Judge Blackburn there are no more vacancies \nin the district courts in Colorado.\n  Arizona Superior Court Judge Cindy Jorgenson is the second nominee to \nfill a district court in Arizona to be considered by the Senate since \nthe change in majority last summer. The first was confirmed back in \nDecember.\n  Judge Jorgenson was nominated in September, received an ABA peer \nreview in late November, was included in the initial hearing this year \non January 24, was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee at our \nFebruary business meeting, and is being considered by the Senate today. \nThe judicial emergency vacancy that she will fill has been vacant for \nover 800 days, which is long before the change in majority last summer.\n  A third nominee to a district court vacancy in Arizona participated \nin a confirmation hearing today before the Judiciary Committee. Those \nother two Arizona nominees are among a number of nominees who received \nmixed peer review ratings from the ABA. Members of the committee and \nthe Senate are examining these nominations and have so far determined \nto vote in favor of confirmation.\n  Over the last few years we have created four additional judgeships \nfor Arizona. Judge Jorgenson will fill the third of those new \njudgeships and Mr. Bury may soon fill the last. I have been happy to \nwork with the Senators from Arizona and all Senators in helping fill \nthese new judgeships. It is a shame that the Senate has not seen fit to \ncreate the judgeships needed so desperately in the Southern District of \nCalifornia, however.\n  Of the 39 judicial nominees who will be confirmed since the change in \nmajority, 17, almost 44 percent, come from States with two Republican \nSenators. Twelve of the confirmed judges come from States with one \nDemocratic and one Republican senator. Only 6 of the 39 nominees \nconfirmed by the Senate come from States with 2 Democratic Senators.\n  These figures emphasize the Democratic majority's commitment to \nbipartisanship and to dealing fairly with conservative, Republican \njudicial nominees. It may also indicate that the White House has yet to \nbegin working with Democratic home state Senators to identify and \nnominate consensus candidates.\n  The Judiciary Committee has continued to hold regular judicial \nnominations hearings throughout this session, as we have since the \nshift in majority last summer. We held the first January confirmation \nhearing in 7 years on the second day of this session. Today the \nJudiciary Committee holds its second judicial confirmation hearing in \nFebruary. In 1997, 1999 and 2001, the Republican majority held no \nconfirmation hearings in either January or February.\n  Today's hearing is the 14th hearing involving judicial nominations \nsince the change in majority last summer. That is more hearings within \nthe last 7 months than the Republican majority ever held in any year in \nwhich it was recently in the majority.\n  Today's hearing follows the pattern of including a Court of Appeals \nnominee as well as a number of District Court nominees.\n  Unfortunately, because the White House has been slow to send \nnominations to the many vacancies in the Federal District Courts, the \nFederal trial courts across the country, today's hearing includes a \nfewer number of District Court nominees than the committee was willing \nto consider. Indeed, the committee is virtually out of District Court \nnominees to include at such confirmation hearings.\n  After today, 35 of the 36 District Court nominees with ABA peer \nreviews will have participated in hearings and the most controversial \nnominee is being scheduled.\n  Of course, more than two-thirds of the Federal court vacancies \ncontinue to be on the District Courts and 36 are still without a \nnominee. The administration has been slow to make nominations to the \nvacancies on the Federal trial courts.\n  In the last 5 months of last year, the Senate confirmed a higher \npercentage of the President's trial court nominees, 22 out of 36, than \na Republican majority had allowed the Senate to confirm in the first \nsession of either of the last two Congresses with a Democratic \nPresident.\n  Last year the President did not make nominations to almost 80 percent \nof the trial court vacancies with which we started this year.\n  As we began this session, 55 out of 69 District Court vacancies were \nwithout a nominee. Finally, in late January the White House sent up \nnames for some of those trial court vacancies. Unfortunately, none has \ncompleted the paperwork needed to be included in hearings and none has \nyet received an ABA peer review.\n  Because the White House last year unilaterally changed the practice \nof nine Republican and Democratic Presidents and will no longer allow \nthe ABA to begin its peer reviews during the selection process, ABA \npeer reviews on these new nominations are not likely to become \navailable for some time to come.\n  In the interim, we have already reached the point where the lack of \navailable nominations for District Court vacancies is holding back the \nnumber of judicial nominees the Judiciary Committee and the Senate \ncould be considering. We experienced the same problem when the majority \nshifted last summer and there were not enough District Court \nnominations ready for hearings in July through September last year.\n  After the committee receives the indication that a judicial nominee \nhas the support of his or her home State Senators and after the \ncommittee has received ABA peer reviews, the nomination will then be \neligible to be considered for inclusion in committee\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nhearings. Because the White House shifted the time at which the ABA \ndoes its evaluation of nominees to the post-nomination period, this \nyear's nominees are unlikely to have completed files ready for \nevaluation until after the Easter recess.\n  Of course, even then, over 2\\1/2\\ dozen of the current Federal trial \ncourt vacancies, 36, may still be without nominees.\n  To make real progress will take the cooperation of the White House. \nThat is what I have been urging since the shift in majority. That is \nwhat I, again, called for when I spoke to the Senate on January 25. \nThat cooperation is still not forthcoming.\n  We will make the most progress, most quickly if the White House would \nbegin working with home State Senators to identify fair-minded, \nnonideological, consensus nominees to fill these court vacancies. One \nof the reasons that the committee was able to work as quickly as it did \nand the Senate was able to confirm 39 judges, as it has in the last 7 \nmonths, was because those nominations were strongly supported as \nconsensus nominees by people from across the political and legal \nspectrums.\n  I have heard of too many situations in too many States involving too \nmany reasonable and moderate home State Senators in which the White \nHouse has demonstrated no willingness to work with home State Senators \nto fill judicial vacancies cooperatively. As we move forward, I have \nurged the White House to show greater inclusiveness and flexibility and \nto help make this a truly bipartisan enterprise. Logjams exist in a \nnumber of settings.\n  To make real progress, repair the damage that has been done over \nprevious years, and build bridges toward a more cooperative process, \nthere is much that the White House could do to work more cooperatively \nwith all home State Senators, including Democratic Senators.\n  In addition, as I have noted, the White House could help speed the \ncommittee process if it would restore the ABA peer review participation \nto an earlier stage in the process. For more than 50 years the ABA was \nable to conduct its peer reviews simultaneously with the FBI background \ncheck procedures. This meant that when nominations were sent to the \nSenate, the FBI report and ABA peer review followed very quickly. \nTogether with the endorsement of the nominee's home State Senators, the \nbasic requirements of the nominations file were available to be \nreviewed by the committee much more quickly than they are now.\n  This process allowed hearings to be scheduled soon after nominations \nwere received in many instances. One of the consequences of the White \nHouse's unilateral decision last year to discontinue this longstanding \nbipartisan practice is that nominations are now not available to be \nconsidered or scheduled for hearings until many weeks have passed and \nthese basic background materials can be assembled and submitted to the \ncommittee. That is unfortunate and unnecessary.\n  There were occasions last year when we proceeded with hearings \nincluding fewer District Court nominees than I would have liked because \nrecent nominees' files were not yet complete. I noted in my statement \nto begin this year that I feared that same circumstance being repeated \nthis year. It already is. That is regrettable.\n  I have urged the White House to rethink its recent changes in \ntraditional practices that were initially instituted by President \nEisenhower and worked well for Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, \nFord, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.\n  I suggest that the White House reconsider the delays caused by the \nabandonment of the traditional practice and that this administration \nconsider returning to the tried and true practice of sharing \ninformation with the ABA earlier in the process so that it can begin \nand complete its peer reviews by the time the nomination is made to the \nSenate.\n  Just as no Senator is bound by the recommendations of the ABA, so, \ntoo, the White House can make clear that it is reinstituting the \ntraditional practice not because it intends to be bound by the results \nof that peer review or even take it into account, but solely to remove \nan element of delay that it had inadvertently introduced into the \nconfirmation process.\n  The White House can expressly ask the ABA not even to send the \nresults of its peer review to the Executive Office, but only transmit \nthem to the committee, if it chooses. Whether or not the White House \nconsiders the ABA peer reviews, they are considered by many Senators. \nFor example, a number of Republican Senators cited favorable peer \nreviews for judicial nominations as an indication that they merit the \nSenate's support.\n  On the other hand, the fact that they are not binding on Senators is \nseen from the recent action confirming a nominee who received a ``not \nqualified'' rating from the ABA and the many nominees who have been \nconfirmed with mixed ratings.\n  I appreciate the majority leader and the assistant majority leader \nmoving to consider these additional judicial nominations today.\n  They have worked hard to return the Senate's consideration of \njudicial nominations to a more orderly and open process. Along with our \nSenate leaders, many of us have been working to help move away from the \nanonymous holds and inaction on judicial nominations that characterized \nso much of the period from 1995 through 2000. Since the change in \nmajority last summer we have made a difference, in terms of the process \nand its results.\n  Despite the 31 additional vacancies that have arisen since the shift \nin majority, the Senate has not only kept up with that high rate of \nattrition, but has been reducing the overall number of judicial \nvacancies.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to express my enthusiastic support \nfor Robert Blackburn, who has been nominated to be a U.S. District \nJudge for the District of Colorado, and for Cindy Jorgenson, who has \nbeen nominated to be a U.S. District Judge for the District of Arizona. \nBoth are extremely well-qualified nominees--who are already serving on \nthe bench--and who have distinguished themselves with hard work and \ngreat intellect. They will both do great service for the citizens of \nour country.\n  Judge Blackburn has practiced law for 13 years in private practice \nand has worked as a Deputy District Attorney for 6 years, as a County \nAttorney for 8 years, as a Municipal Judge for 3 years, and as a State \ncourt judge since 1988. With all that experience in the law, there is \nno doubt that he will make a smooth transition onto the Federal bench.\n  Judge Jorgenson's legal experience includes serving as a deputy \ncounty attorney, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and as a Superior Court \nJudge--all in the State of Arizona. She supervised the felony sex \ncrimes and child abuse prosecution unit in Pima County for several \nyears. Then, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, she handled both criminal \nand civil cases. Since 1996, Judge Jorgenson has served with great \ndistinction on the State trial court bench in Tucson, AZ.\n  I congratulate both nominees on their impressive careers and on the \nhonor of being confirmed to the federal district court.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour \nof 10 a.m. having arrived, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert E. Blackburn of Colorado to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Colorado? The yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, we have just received the Shays-Meehan \ncampaign finance reform bill from the House. As I have said before, \nthis bill gives us the first real chance in a generation to limit the \naccess of special interests to the political process.\n  I had intended to ask consent to take up and pass this bill \nimmediately. However, the Republican leader has indicated to me that he \nwas making progress on reaching an agreement on how to proceed with \ncampaign finance reform. Therefore, I am willing to withhold my \nunanimous consent request at this time, pending an update from the \nRepublican leader on how discussions on this issue in his caucus are \nproceeding.\n  As my colleagues will recall, we tried to reach an agreement to take \nup the House-passed bill before the President's day recess. Opponents \nof reform objected, saying that they wanted time to look over the bill.\n  They have now had more than a week. What they have found, I am sure, \nis a bill that is very similar to the McCain-Feingold bill that the \nSenate passed last spring.\n  At the time, we spent 2 weeks on McCain-Feingold. We had a full, \nfair, and open debate, and we passed that bill with a strong bipartisan \nmajority. I see no reason why we can't take this bill up and pass it \nquickly.\n  In fact, the only reason I can think that anyone would oppose consent \nwould be to take one more shot at keeping this bill from becoming \nlaweither by filibustering or by trying to send this bill to a \nconference.\n  And so I say to them: Look what happened in the House. Opponents of \nreform used every conceivable argument and excuseevery \nimaginable ploy to stop this. They failed.\n  This is going to be the year that we pass strong campaign finance \nreform, and put the reins of government back into the hands of all of \nthe people. The sooner we pass this bill, the sooner we can get it to \nthe President for his signature. I look forward to revisiting this \nissue in the near future.\n  I will not, as I say, ask consent at this time, and I appreciate very \nmuch the consultation I have had with the Republican leader in this \nregard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his comments. \nWhile there are some similarities between the two bills--McCain-\nFeingold, which passed the Senate, and Shays-Meehan, which has passed \nthe House--there are some fundamental differences between the two \nbills. Normally, what you do under the circumstances is go to \nconference. But this week we have had to review what was actually in \nthe bill that passed the House. We have now received the conference \nreport. The Senators did just return yesterday--or even this morning. \nThere are discussions among those who are interested in getting a \nresult, not trying to create a problem. If we went right to it at this \npoint, I am sure there would be Senators on both sides who would feel \ninclined to offer amendments, and it could take considerable time.\n  We had indicated we would try to wrap up election reform as soon as \npossible--hopefully today--and that we would get on energy and stay on \nenergy as long as it took to get that completed. I think giving us a \nlittle time for discussions to take place between the interested \nSenators would be constructive and would allow us to go forward with \nelection reform and even get started on the energy bill, recognizing \nthat the majority leader could interject this at any point along the \nway. There is no need and no desire to delay this indefinitely. I think \na little time--a couple days--would be constructive. Maybe we can find \na way to do it in an acceptable way and quicker by doing that.\n  I appreciate the patience of the majority leader. I have found from \npast experience that sometimes patience gives great rewards; other \ntimes, it does no good at all. I hope this time it will be positive in \nits result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can respond to the Republican \nleader, I appreciate his report and agree there are times when patience \nhas shown its reward. I am hopeful this is one of those times. I will \nwork with him.\n  Obviously, patience at some point runs out. That will necessitate \ntaking action as we had originally contemplated, but we certainly want \nto work with the Republican leader and his colleagues in an effort to \nsee whether patience can be a productive experience in this case.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the majority leader \nfor his comments, and I thank the Republican leader for his comments. \nIt sounds as if we may be moving toward a resolution of the campaign \nfinance issue without a filibuster in the Senate. I am actually \nconfident we will prevail if such a tactic is actually employed against \nus, but I do not think the American people will be well served if we \nhave to take a significant amount of time to further debate an issue \nthat we dealt with and essentially resolved last year during a very \ngood 2-week debate process.\n  We passed the McCain-Feingold bill by a vote of 59 to 41. The House \npassed the Shays-Meehan bill by a vote of 240 to 189. These are wide \nbipartisan margins in both Houses.\n  Actually, I disagree with the minority leader. The differences \nbetween the bills are actually very slight. It is not enough to justify \na conference committee which very well may never report a final bill. \nSo Senator McCain and I have endorsed the House-passed bill and will \nask our colleagues to vote for it, rejecting all attempts to amend it, \nhowever meritorious, so we can send this bill to the President. Should \nthere be technical amendments necessary on which we could agree, we \nwill be glad to consider supporting a technical corrections bill after \nthe bill is enacted.\n  I hope the leader's discussion bears fruit and we can come to \nagreement on terms of final debate and a vote on this legislation very \nsoon. We have waited many years for this moment, as you know well \nbecause you have been one of the key leaders on this. The time to\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nact is now upon us. The days of soft money are truly numbered. The \nAmerican people want us to finish this job, and we are going to do it.\n  I again thank the majority leader for his consistent and excellent \nefforts to bring this bill quickly to a conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Wisconsin \nand the Senator from Arizona for their determination and their resolute \ndemonstration again today that we will see a successful conclusion of \nthis legislation.\n  I do not want anybody to be mistaken; this will happen either through \nprocedural motions available to us or with a unanimous consent \nagreement. We will certainly try to take the path of least resistance, \nand if there is a way to reach unanimous consent, I would like to do \nthat. But we must do that this week, within the next day or so, or we \nwill be forced to take the alternative approach. This will happen.\n  I appreciate the patience on the part of my two colleagues in \nparticular who have been very supportive of our efforts to date, and \nhopefully we can see to it that patience is rewarded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Feingold, who have labored so long on behalf of \nthis legislation, if there were an effort to unduly delay the bill, it \nwould probably be led by myself. I do, however, want an opportunity to \ntalk with some of my colleagues who have returned today.\n  We did have an opportunity to take a look at the House-passed bill \nover the past week and discover what is in it; it was a mystery to many \nof us. Once those discussions are complete, I believe we ought to be \nable to come to an agreement on how to complete the bill in an orderly \nfashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1142-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1142-S1149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 565) to establish the Commission on voting \n     Rights and Procedures to study and make recommendations \n     regarding election technology, voting, and election \n     administration to establish a grant program under which the \n     Office of Justice Programs and the Civil Rights Division of \n     the Department of Justice shall provide assistance to States \n     and localities in improving election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to require States to \n     meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \n     administration requirements for the 2004 Federal elections, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Clinton amendment No. 2906, to establish a residual ballot \n     performance benchmark.\n       Dayton amendment No. 2898, to establish a pilot program for \n     free postage for absentee ballots cast in elections for \n     Federal office.\n       Dodd (for Harkin) amendment No. 2912, to provide funds for \n     protection and advocacy systems of each State to ensure full \n     participation in the electoral process for individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       Dodd (for Schumer) modified amendment No. 2914, to permit \n     the use of a signature or personal mark for the purpose of \n     verifying the identify of voters who register by mail.\n       Dodd (for Kennedy) amendment No. 2916, to clarify the \n     application of the safe harbor provisions.\n\n  (The text of amendment 2894, as modified and agreed to on February \n25, is as follows:)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out its duty under section \n     303(a)(1)(G), the Commission, within 6 months after its \n     establishment, shall provide a detailed report to the \n     Congress on the advisability of establishing an election day \n     holiday, including options for holding elections for Federal \n     offices on an existing legal public holiday such as Veterans \n     Day, as proclaimed by the President, or of establishing \n     uniform weekend voting hours.\n       (b) Factors Considered.--In conducting that study, the \n     Commission shall take into consideration the following \n     factors:\n       (1) Only 51 percent of registered voters in the United \n     States turned out to vote during the November 2000 \n     Presidential election--well-below the worldwide turnout \n     average of 72.9 percent for Presidential elections between \n     1999 and 2000. After the 2000 election, the Census Bureau \n     asked thousands of non-voters why they did not vote. The top \n     reason for not voting, given by 22.6 percent of the \n     respondents, was that they were too busy or had a conflicting \n     work or school schedule.\n       (2) One of the recommendations of the National Commission \n     on Election Reform led by former Presidents Carter and Ford \n     is ``Congress should enact legislation to hold presidential \n     and congressional elections on a national holiday''. Holding \n     elections on the legal public holiday of Veterans Day, as \n     proclaimed by the President and observed by the Federal \n     government, or on the weekends, may allow election day to be \n     a national holiday without adding the cost and administrative \n     burden of an additional holiday.\n       (3) Holding elections on a holiday or weekend could allow \n     more working people to vote more easily, potentially \n     increasing voter turnout. It could increase the pool of \n     available poll workers and make public buildings more \n     available for use as polling places. Holding elections over a \n     weekend could provide flexibility needed for uniform polling \n     hours.\n       (4) Several proposals to make election day a holiday or to \n     shift election day to a weekend have been offered in the \n     107th Congress. Any new voting day options should be \n     sensitive to the religious observances of voters of all \n     faiths and to our Nation's veterans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes to review the bidding \nand give our colleagues a status report on the election reform bill--\nwhere we are, what we have accomplished, and what we can look forward \nto during the remainder of the day.\n  This could be a very historic day if we can finish work on this bill \ntoday. My hope is we can. We still have a little less than two dozen \namendments that I know of. A couple of them will require some debate. \nThere are many I think can be resolved without much debate, and many of \nthem could actually be accepted if we can work out some language.\n  After three full days of debate on the bill, over a week ago on \nThursday and Friday and then yesterday, we have disposed of 22 \namendments. To give my colleagues an idea of the bipartisan nature of \nthis measure, we have adopted a total of 16 amendments by voice vote--8 \nby the majority, 8 by the minority--to indicate the balance we have \nbeen able to achieve so far.\n  We will be working through the remainder of these amendments today, \nand my hope is we can finish this bill this evening or by tomorrow--\nhopefully this evening. We still have a couple of very important \namendments that will have to be debated and will probably require roll \ncall votes.\n  It would be my expectation that most of the amendments that are \neither pending or filed can be agreed to perhaps with some minor \nmodifications.\n  I again thank my colleague from Kentucky for his assistance and that \nof his staff in helping us move this product along. I know there are a \nnumber of other measures awaiting Senate action. I encourage my \ncolleagues to complete debate on this bipartisan election reform \ncompromise today so we can get to those other issues, including \ncampaign finance reform and the energy bill.\n  In that spirit, let me, if I may, tell my colleagues what I think we \nwill do. Senator Gramm of Texas has an amendment to which we are going \nto agree. In fact, he has asked me to offer it on his behalf, and I \nwill be happy to do that. Then Senator Dayton has an amendment which he \nis modifying which will be a study amendment, for the information of my \ncolleagues on the other side. He will be coming over with that \namendment. We can adopt the Dayton amendment because I believe by \nmaking this a study, it becomes acceptable to the minority.\n  Senator Harkin has an amendment--I am not sure which one of his he is \nbringing over. It is the pending amendment which may require very \nlimited debate.\n  I know Senator Clinton is presently meeting with the First Lady. She \nwill be back as soon as possible. We then can debate her amendment.\n  My goal is to dispose of as many amendments as we can over the next \nhour and a half, and then if a couple of amendments require debate and \nvotes, we will stack those votes just prior to the respective \nconferences for the traditional Tuesday luncheons. So we may have some \nvotes just prior to lunch, but we will not ask people to break up the \nhearings they are engaged in this morning. We will not interrupt the \nhearing flow that is going on in a number of committees. That is the \ngoal.\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\n  I see my colleague and friend from Kentucky wants to make some \nopening remarks. He can offer the Gramm amendment, or I will be happy \nto do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I reiterate that it is our intention to \nfinish the bill today, and I believe we are on a glidepath to do that. \nI fully support the effort of the chairman to move this along.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2927\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send and amendment on behalf of \nSenators Gramm and Hutchison to the desk. It has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Gramm, \n     for himself, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2927.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we are waiting for Senator Dayton to come \nover with his modified amendment which I hope we can accept, and \nSenator Harkin is coming over with an amendment that requires some \ndebate--not much, but some; he says he can do it in a brief amount of \ntime--and any amendments on the minority side as well, if they have \npeople coming over.\n  I urge those who have filed amendments to offer them. Some Members \napproached me during the vote, and I am going to sit down and see if we \ncan agree to some of these so Members do not have to actually come \nover, and we can offer them on their behalf.\n  Pending the arrival of Senator Dayton, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, this amendment calls for a study of the \ntechnical ability of voting systems to accommodate multiple languages. \nThis bill potentially expands the number of languages which a voting \nsystem must accommodate based on the number of people within a given \njurisdiction who speak those languages. It does not include every \nlanguage, but would recognize certain language groups that current law \ndoes not recognize. It is a slight change from existing law. Obviously, \nin places such as California the number of languages has been \nincreasing. We have all experienced this in our respective States, with \nthe number of immigrants who have come into the country.\n  This is a study proposal that Senator Feinstein suggests. We think it \nis a good amendment. It is something the commission will look at \nanyway. We urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are agreeable to this as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2928.\n  The amendment (No. 2928) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2912\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to amendment No. 2912.\n  This is a very simple amendment, a very short amendment. It is one \nthat is needed to improve full and equal access to the polls for people \nwith disabilities. The election reform bill sponsored by my colleagues \nfrom Connecticut and Kentucky does indeed provide a good first step to \nequal access. It requires every polling place to have at least one \nfully accessible voting machine. That is a good start. What is the \nbenefit of these voting machines if people with disabilities--say, \nthose who are using wheelchairs--cannot get to the machines from \noutside or from a parking lot?\n  We have an anomaly. We have a voting machine that is accessible and \nusable; but what about from the sidewalk to the voting machine, from \nthe parking lot to the voting machine, if that is not accessible? The \nbill requires nothing to ensure this access. Now, the bill does provide \n$100 million in incentive grants. That is better than nothing. But I \nbelieve we need to do more.\n  In each State there are nonprofit agencies called protection and \nadvocacy agencies which have been set up through the law. They work \nwith local communities to provide equal access for people with \ndisabilities in public places. They have been doing this for a long \ntime. Unfortunately, they can only do so much with Federal assistance \nthey receive. Last year, all of the P we call protection and \nadvocacy groups--in the entire United States received $15 million. That \nis for all 50 States. That means they can only focus on a few access \nissues. They do not have the resources to work on training or educating \nlocal election officials on polling access requirements under current \nlaw.\n\n  My amendment simply authorizes $10 million a year to the protection \nand advocacy agencies to give additional focus to voting access for \npeople with disabilities.\n  A GAO report that Senator McCain and I requested found in the 2000 \nelection more than 80 percent of the 496 polling places surveyed had 1 \nor more physical impediments. The GAO said 80 percent of the 496 that \nthey surveyed had 1 or more physical impediments.\n  Consider this: 28 States do not even have curbside voting \nrequirements. If you live in a State that does not have\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\na curbside voting requirement and you have a polling place that has \nseveral physical impediments to get to the polling machine, what good \nis it to have a polling machine that is accessible if you cannot get to \nit and you don't have curbside voting?\n  Even in the States where curbside voting must be an option, the \nrights of people with disabilities are still compromised. Curbside \nvoting does not allow private or independent voting, as it does for the \ngeneral public. For example, a poll worker meets the voter at the car \nor in the parking lot. The poll worker provides the ballot to the \nvoter, or actually fills out the ballot for the voter, and the voter \nmust trust the poll worker to submit the ballot inside. That is an \nunacceptable alternative to getting around current laws that require \nphysical disability access to the polls, unless the voter requests \ncurbside voting.\n  Again, we have a system we are about to vote on and pass that would \ndeny equal access to many people in our communities to vote as we \nvote--in private, ensuring that your ballot is your ballot, making sure \nyou can go in the voting booth like everyone else. We are only setting \naside $10 million, a very small amount of money, to be used by the \nprotection and advocacy groups to work with local officials to help \ntrain and educate them on how you make places accessible.\n  Again, one might ask, why would we need someone from protection and \nadvocacy to meet with local election officials to make sure a place is \naccessible when the local elected officials know how to do that? Maybe \nyes, maybe no.\n  There is a lot of expertise within the protection and advocacy groups \nthroughout the United States as to how to do things, how to make things \naccessible with the least interference with the general public and at \nthe least cost to the taxpayer.\n  I myself have seen instances in my State and others, because of my \nwork in disability rights, where local elected officials think they \nhave to do something that is going to cost several hundred thousand \ndollars, to change this and do all this modification, and the \nprotection and advocacy people come up and say: You do not have to do \nall that. Maybe just for a couple of thousand dollars you can change \nsome things.\n  One classic case that always comes to mind, and this happened some \ntime ago, is where a local school system decided that to be compliant \nwith the Americans With Disabilities Act, they had to change all the \ndrinking fountains in all the public schools, that they would have to \nlower all of the drinking fountains so a kid using a wheelchair could \nhave access to them; all the other ones were too high.\n  This was going to cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in \nall the schools, to go in and do all the plumbing and lower all these \ndrinking fountains. This created kind of a firestorm in the community. \nThey said: My gosh, we are going to have to spend all this money to \nlower these drinking fountains for a few people using a wheelchair.\n  Finally, one of the P groups came through and said: You do not have \nto do that. If you would just set a paper cup dispenser by the water \nfountain with a wastebasket to throw it in, someone in a wheelchair \ncould roll up, take a paper cup, fill it with water, take a drink, and \nthrow the paper cup away, and that would not cost you very much. That \nis what they did. It saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars. These \nare the kinds of things the protection and advocacy groups can do.\n  A lot of local officials might think they have to do so much. Here is \nan example. A local elected official says: We have to make our place \naccessible. And they go to a local engineering group and say: What do \nwe have to do? The local engineering group says: Hey, this is taxpayer \nmoney; we are going to knock out this wall, put in these doors, put in \nthis ramp, do all this; we have to shift this around and maybe take \nthis part of the lot out. All of a sudden you are into hundreds of \nthousands of dollars.\n  A protection and advocacy group, knowing the law and knowing the \nrequirements of ADA, might come in there and say: No, you don't have to \ndo all that. There are other ways you can meet these requirements at a \nmuch cheaper cost, and much more efficacious, not only for people with \ndisabilities but for the general public.\n  This is the experience we have had in the past in many places where \nthey have had problems of accessibility. The P, as we call them, \nhave just been great, working with local officials to train and educate \nthem about how to make places accessible. That is what this amendment \ndoes. I hope the amendment will be accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I regretfully rise in opposition to the \nHarkin amendment. This amendment proposes to add a new grant program of \n$40 million to the cost of the bill over 4 years. Unlike the other \ngrant programs authorized by this bill, this amendment proposes to fund \njust one organization with the $40 million. That one entity is the \nprotection and advocacy system, a federally mandated program currently \nin place and functioning with an office in each State.\n  In Kentucky this office is a division of State government, but I \nunderstand in other States the office functions as a nonprofit \norganization. The protection and advocacy system is a federally \nmandated program that receives funding from several different Federal \nsources as well as funding from each State. This organization has \noffices in each State, and they advocate on behalf of people with \ndisabilities. The protection and advocacy system can mediate, \nintervene, counsel, investigate, and even sue on behalf of those it \nrepresents.\n  I have a couple of concerns about this amendment. First, I can \nappreciate the important work this group does. In fact, there are \nnumerous groups out there that provide important and meaningful \nassistance to people with disabilities. I wholeheartedly support their \nefforts. But the group singled out by this amendment is already well \nfunded by the Federal Government. They receive funding through Health \nand Human Services, the Department of Education, and even the Social \nSecurity Administration. I am not sure giving this particular group \nanother $40 million makes sense when we can just as easily spend $40 \nmillion on numerous other causes that are actually underfunded or not \nfunded at all.\n  The States are in dire financial straits. We could certainly devote \nthis money to helping them make additional election administration \nimprovements and upgrades.\n  Protection and advocacy systems do not need this amendment to broaden \ntheir mandate to encompass accessibility. That is already included in \ntheir broad statutory mandate. This amendment seeks only to increase \nthe funding of one organization, an increase that nearly doubles the \namount this group received last year. But as I said a moment ago, there \nare many worthwhile groups out there that provide services to help \npeople with disabilities. They, too, would like an additional source of \nFederal funding. Some of these groups have contacted my office, and I \nam sure my colleagues have heard from them as well.\n  Other groups that help the disabled are calling my office and asking \nthe question: Why does the protection and advocacy system get \nadditional funding? We do good work, and we could use additional funds \nto help ensure full participation in the electoral process.\n  These other groups are probably right. They do good work and could \nuse additional money. But if we proceed down that road, we will soon \ndeplete all the funds available under this bill. If we increase the \nfunding for every group out there that does good work and may in fact \nneed additional money, we will soon spend the entire Social Security \nsurplus.\n  If we had unlimited funds available, this amendment would be one of \nseveral good uses for that additional money. If we had unlimited funds \navailable, I would propose additional funding for a host of \norganizations that do good works, some of which are in my home State \nand have said they could use the money. But we do not have unlimited \nfunds available, and for that reason I do not think we should earmark \nadditional money exclusively for this one organization, especially when \nthat organization already received millions--millions--in Federal and \nState funds.\n\n  Other disability advocacy groups see this amendment as unfairly \nbenefiting\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\nan organization that is already well funded by the Federal Government \nand already effectively advocates on behalf of those with disabilities. \nIt seems these other advocates of the disabled have a very good point.\n  There is one other concern with the amendment that has been expressed \nby my colleagues and by several election officials. Because the \nprotection and advocacy systems are authorized by Federal statute to \nsue, many are concerned that this amendment would essentially fund \nlitigation against our State and local election officials.\n  There are at least two provisions in the Federal laws governing \nprotection and advocacy systems that govern suits against States. One \nprovision says:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall preclude a system from bringing \n     a suit on behalf of individuals with developmental \n     disabilities against a State, or an agency or an \n     instrumentality of a State.\n\n  The other provision says, in part:\n\n       . . . such system shall have the authority to pursue legal \n     . . . remedies or approaches to ensure the protection of, and \n     advocacy for, the rights of such individuals within the \n     State. . . .\n\n  Now it may be that some protection and advocacy systems do not sue \nthat often. But the fact remains that they can sue and they do sue. In \nfact, their broad authorization allows them to sue a State and an \nagency or instrumentality of a State.\n  Unfortunately, the election officials I have heard from are not \nparticularly comforted by claims that these groups ``don't sue that \noften.'' These groups may very well need the ability to sue when they \nadvocate on behalf of disabled people who face illegal discrimination \nin employment or in housing. But when it comes to elections, this bill \nseeks to help States improve elections systems and comply with the law. \nThis bill makes great efforts to encourage States to upgrade their \nsystems and work in a cooperative manner with the Federal Government.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, we will essentially be giving money \nto the States to help them upgrade their election systems with one hand \nand we will be giving money to an outside group to help them \npotentially sue the States with the other.\n  Of course, States will then have to devote even more resources to \ndefend against lawsuits, and the real cost of this amendment goes even \nhigher. Perhaps we should set up a separate stream of funding for \nStates to use to defend themselves against frivolous lawsuits, or, if \nwe wanted to fund litigation, I am sure my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Missouri, would suggest a few groups that could use some \nFederal money to investigate instances of voter fraud and pursue \nlitigation.\n  As I said earlier, I support the important work done by the States \nfor the disabled, as we all do. I support making voting easier for the \ndisabled, which this bill does. And I think this bill makes great \nstrides for the disabled, thanks largely to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, who is very passionate about this issue. But I \nthink this amendment would do some harm to the delicate balance we have \nachieved with the bill.\n  Folks with disabilities should be able to vote. There are numerous \ngroups out there that provide education and assistance to help make \nthat happen. In fact, this bill makes grant money available that States \ncan use for outreach and education for the disabled. But I do not think \nit is wise to fund one group exclusively when there are so many other \nsimilar groups that could benefit from a special earmark.\n  Nothing in the underlying bill prevents the protection and advocacy \nsystem from consulting with election officials. They can and do already \nconsult with State governments on these issues.\n  For all of those reasons, I hope this amendment will not be agreed to \nwhen we ultimately have the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond a little to the \narguments made by the Senator from Kentucky regarding my amendment.\n  First, the Senator from Kentucky says the P can already handle \ncases dealing with access to places that are already within their \npurview to do so. I would say that is true. There is one P for each \nState and they do receive some state assistance. We gave $15 million \nlast year for 50 States. Even with some of the small amounts they get \nfrom the State or other sources, they have very little with which to \noperate. The average P's budget is $1.2 million. Yet they have to \ncover the entire State in terms of working with local officials on \naccessibility. They have very small staffs.\n  Their purpose is to educate, train, and advocate for compliance under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. There is no extra funding to work \non voting access. They are already strapped. But now we are saying with \nthis bill that we want to have voting access. Again, we have an anomaly \nhere. We have within the bill a requirement that there be at least one \nvoting machine that is acceptable for voting places. But there are no \nminimum standards for accessibility to the machine from the parking lot \nto the sidewalk from the outside. The bill is silent on that. It is \nabsolutely silent.\n  Rather than just setting a minimum standard, which I don't think we \nought to be doing right now, the best thing is to give a small amount \nof funds--this is $10 million a year for all 50 States. An average of \nmaybe $150,000 per P to have them train, educate, and work with local \nofficials on how to make sure the voting place is accessible.\n  Again, the Senator from Kentucky said there are a lot of groups out \nthere that would like to do this. The protection and advocacy system is \nset up under law--one per State. They have been there for a long time. \nThey have the expertise and the history. They are well integrated in \nevery State in terms of the State structure to do this.\n  The Senator from Kentucky went on at great length about litigation--\nthat he didn't want to give resources to P to litigate because that \nwould use money and the States would have to come up with the money to \ndefend it. Again, we have to look at the facts. What P do 99 percent \nof the time is basically train and educate local officials on access \nissues. I mentioned earlier about how we have reams and reams of \nexamples from every State on P, as they are called--protection and \nadvocacy--about how they have been able to help State governments and \nlocal governments meet the requirements of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act at least cost and with the least interference with the \ngeneral public. This is well documented.\n  When people call in, they provide over-the-phone advice. This is \nsomeplace where a local official can be out there, and someone could \ncome and say: You have to do this to make something accessible. The \nlocal official does not know. They pick up the phone. They call the \nP, and they say: I have been told I have to make all of these changes \nto make something accessible. Do I have to do it? What do I have to do? \nThey can get that advice. All the P around the country sit on local \nand State task forces and boards to ensure that accessibility is part \nof all the project planning. Remember that you have public planning for \nparks, recreational facilities, public buildings, courthouses, \nwhatever. They are part of the planning process to make sure that they \nare accessible. They do handle individual cases. We do have data from \nthe 50 States.\n  The P are able to take about 1 of every 10 who ask for assistance. \nFor every 10 people who call up the P and ask for some kind of \nassistance on a personal basis, they can take only 1 of them because \nthey typically don't have the resources. They do not have the staff, \nand they don't have the money.\n  I have a listing of all of the intervention strategies used in \nserving individuals by every State. Again, most of what they do is, as \nI said, education and technical assistance. On a lot of it, they \nnegotiate and go to administrative hearings. But there is a column here \non litigation. Here are the facts:\n  The Senator from Kentucky went on and on about litigation. There were \n43,092 cases that came into the P system last year, 2001. Out of \n43,092 cases, 178 wound up in litigation.\n  And the simple truth is, the P get the most bang for their buck \nthrough education and training and working with officials proactively--\nnot through the courts.\n  The reason they don't litigate is that they do not have the \nwherewithal. I\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\ncan say without any fear of contradiction that each 1 of those 178 \ncases was an egregious case. This is where the P have gone through \nnegotiations, they have gone through mediation, they have gone through \ncounseling, they have gone through administrative hearings, and nothing \ngets done. Yet, at that point in time they litigate.\n  I don't think the Senator from Kentucky would like to take that right \naway from the P on the most egregious cases.\n  The facts belie the fear of this burgeoning litigation.\n  Again, just one of the things that P & A's do is handle individual \ncases. They only take 1 out of every 10 complaints--and then they do \neverything they can which is required by law--to remedy the problem. \nAnd only in those most egregious instances--3 percent of those \nindividual cases--do they consider the courtroom as an option.\n  So again, what my amendment will basically do is give to a nonprofit \ngroup that has a strong record in education, training and advocacy. It \nis a nonprofit entity. It is recognized by the States. As I said, State \ngovernments rely on them. They sit in on State boards and local boards, \nwork with them in the planning process, and give technical assistance \nto help make sure we have accessibility for people with disabilities.\n  Again, my amendment has been pending for over 2 weeks. It has been \nout there during the break and before the break. My amendment has been \nout there. I have not heard one complaint from any group or any \nelection officials that this is a bad amendment. The disability \ncommunity, I can tell you, is united behind this amendment.\n  I think it is a modest approach. As I said, the more drastic approach \nwould be for us to demand a minimum standard on physical accessibility \nto the voting place. Maybe that is what we should have done. But we \ndecided to take the perhaps more cautious approach, one that would \nleave the maximum amount of flexibility for States to do what they \nneeded to do. And the P system can help them do that.\n  The funding will give the P the resources they need to focus on \nvoting accessibility, which they can't do now because of their limited \nbudgets.\n  That is what the P can do. It is not a cookie-cutter approach, but \nto work with local officials, find the lowest cost, least interference \nmethod of making sure we have accessibility for everyone: People with \ndisabilities and people without disabilities.\n  As I said, they have great expertise. They have been doing this for a \nlong time, going back to the 1970s, when they were created. Quite \nfrankly, as the former chair of the Disabilities Subcommittee, and one \nwho has been involved in this ever since, I keep close tabs on the P \nsystem. They are funded under the Appropriations Committee that I am \nprivileged to chair.\n  So we keep pretty good tabs on the P groups in the United States. \nWith a meager amount of money, they do a great job. In fact, I hear \nfrom my secretary of state in Iowa about what a great job they do in \nIowa.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me state for the \nuninformed--and there may not be many on this particular point--there \nhas never been, in my view, a stronger or more articulate advocate on \nbehalf of the disabled in this country than the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin.\n  He and I have known each other for a long time. We have served \ntogether for a quarter century. We arrived on the very same day in the \nHouse of Representatives, back more than 25 years ago. We served \ntogether there and now have served together here for almost two \ndecades.\n  But for his advocacy, but for his determination, millions of \nAmericans who suffer from one form of disability or another would not \nenjoy as many of the opportunities that they do in our country. He has \nmade that much of a difference. When the issue is raised, Can one \nperson make a difference? you need go no further than the name of Tom \nHarkin to answer that question. Truly, for millions of people, his \npresence in public life has made a difference. And he is obviously \nliving up to that reputation by suggesting the amendment he has offered \nto us on the election reform bill. So I commend him immensely for it. \nHe has been a great friend, a great advocate for so many years.\n  I guess sometimes the personal experiences in life are what sort of \ngalvanize one's attention. I know in both of our cases--different kinds \nof cases--siblings of ours have suffered from physical disabilities. We \nboth grew up in a family knowing of the tremendous efforts our parents, \nrespectively, made to see to it that our respective siblings would \nenjoy the full opportunities of life. I do not know of any more \ncourageous a person than my sister. And I am sure the Senator from Iowa \nmight say the same about his brother, God rest his soul, whom the \nSenator lost a couple years ago.\n  So, in fact, had the Senator not come forward and advocated this, we \nmight wonder what was wrong here in some ways. So his standing here \nadvocating these positions is as normal as anyone might expect. I thank \nhim for his kind comments, and the Senator from Kentucky for his \ngenerous comments as well, on what we have tried to do in this bill.\n  I know there will be some efforts, to some degree, to suggest maybe \nwe ought to make these provisions dealing with the disabled less than a \nrequirement. But we did not do that in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act, \nand there are millions of Americans who do not vote because of the \ninaccessibility of the ballot. What we have done in this bill is to \nmake that an accessible ballot for the blind, the manually disabled, \nand others with disabilities. If we did nothing else in this bill but \nthat, I think we can call it a major achievement in providing \nadditional resources to everyone, make polling places more accessible, \ngiven the fact, in many places, there are still polling places that are \nnot accessible. The discretionary grant money of $100 million in this \nbill, which I know the Senator from Iowa appreciates immensely, is \ngoing to help.\n  So I commend the Senator for this proposal and thank him for his \ncontinuing efforts on behalf of millions of Americans who have no \ngreater voice than his in the Congress of the United States, and I \nthank him for that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his very kind \nand overly generous remarks. We have been, as he said, close friends \nfor a quarter century now. We first came to the House together. We were \nsworn in on the same day. But I think the Senator is being overly kind \nin his comments about this Senator.\n  As we all learn, as we go through life, the famous saying, no man is \nan island, around here, no man or woman gets legislation through by \nhimself or herself. It takes a team effort and takes people working \ntogether.\n  On all the legislation we have passed that has made lives better for \npeople with disabilities, Senator Dodd of Connecticut has been in the \nforefront of the fight every single time from day one. We have served \ntogether on the Labor, Health, and Human Resources Committee all these \nyears. He is senior to me on that committee. I have been proud to \nfollow his lead on so many of these issues that make life better for \nour citizens with disabilities.\n  I respond in kind by thanking the Senator from Connecticut. As he \nsaid, both of us, in our own individual families, have had personal \nexperience with siblings who have had disabilities. We bring those \npersonal experiences here. It gives us a better feel for what is \nhappening to a lot of people around the country who want a full and \nfair life, want accessibility, want to be integrated in society, want \neducation and travel, employment, and, yes, one of the most fundamental \nof all rights that make us uniquely American--the right of the secret \nballot.\n  The bill before us that Senators Dodd and McConnell have put together \nis a great bill. But like anything else, there are little parts that \nmay need to be tweaked. This is considered one of those little things \nwe need to do to help ensure that access from the curbside or from that \nparking lot to that voting machine, which they have rightly done in \nthis bill, so there has to be at least one in every voting place. I \napplaud the Senator from Connecticut for taking the lead on that. But \nthis is just something that will help ensure that we are able to have \nthe access at the least cost, least interference, and the best method \npossible.\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership on \nthis issue and for his friendship for a quarter of a century to me \npersonally, but to all Americans with disabilities. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our friend from Iowa.\n  We have a couple of amendments we can work on that may be accepted. \nThere is a possibility that we might have a vote on the Harkin \namendment before we break for lunch. What I would like to do, with my \ncolleague's permission and agreement, is to go into a quorum call.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wanted to make a couple more observations about the \namendment of Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. DODD. I was trying to restrain debate a bit so we might get to a \ncouple other matters.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2869\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I call up amendment No. 2869. I believe that is the \namendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. I \ninquire of the Chair, is that the amendment that is a sense of the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Ms. Landrieu, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2869.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

STUDY AND REPORT ON FREE ABSENTEE BALLOT POSTAGE.\n\n       (a) Study on the Establishment of a Free Absentee Ballot \n     Postage Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Election Administration Commission \n     established under section 301 shall conduct a study on the \n     feasibility and advisability of the establishment by the \n     Federal Election Commission and the Postal Service of a \n     program under which the Postal Service shall waive the amount \n     of postage applicable with respect to absentee ballots \n     submitted by voters in general elections for Federal office \n     (other than balloting materials mailed under section 3406 of \n     title 39, United States Code) that does not apply with \n     respect to the postage required to send the absentee ballots \n     to voters.\n       (2) Public survey.--As part of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1), the Election Administration Commission shall \n     conduct a survey of potential beneficiaries under the program \n     described in such paragraph, including the elderly and \n     disabled, and shall take into account the results of such \n     survey in determining the feasibility and advisability of \n     establishing such a program.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Submission.--Not later than the date that is 1 year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Election \n     Administration Commission shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the study conducted under subsection (a)(1) together with \n     recommendations for such legislative and administrative \n     action as the Commission determines appropriate.\n       (2) Costs.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall \n     contain an estimate of the costs of establishing the program \n     described in subsection (a)(1).\n       (3) Implementation.--The report submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall contain an analysis of the feasibility of \n     implementing the program described in subsection (a)(1) with \n     respect to the absentee ballots submitted in the general \n     election for Federal office held in 2004.\n       (4) Recommendations regarding the elderly and disabled.--\n     The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) include recommendations of the Federal Election \n     Commission on ways that program described in subsection \n     (a)(1) would\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\n     target elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities; \n     and\n       (B) identify methods to increase the number of such \n     individuals who vote in elections for Federal office.\n       (c) Postal Service Defined.--The term ``Postal Service'' \n     means the United States Postal Service established under \n     section 201 of title 39, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for this \namendment. Briefly, the Dayton amendment asks for a study of \neliminating the need for postage requirements on absentee ballots. The \nsuggestion initially had been that it be a pilot program to be \ninstituted at the 2004 elections on a Federal level, utilizing some 3 \nmillion voters to determine whether or not such a pilot would be \nworthwhile. There were concerns which States would be included.\n  The commission, if this bill becomes law, would want to look at this \nissue. By recrafting the amendment calling for a study, it will \nguarantee that will be done. Then we will try and figure out the best \nway to conduct that study. For those reasons, the amendment is \nacceptable, I am told, on both sides.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota. This is a very worthwhile \nsuggestion. It is exactly the kind of issue at which the permanent \ncommission on elections wants to look. Because he has proposed this \namendment the way he has, it will guarantee that will be done. With \nthis modification calling for a study, rather than a pilot program, the \namendment is acceptable by both sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified, of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 2998), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am delighted we finally have the \nopportunity to consider election reform. I am especially glad we are \ndoing so in a way that is probably as close to bipartisan as anything \nwe will work on this year. I commend Senator Dodd. I commend Senator \nMcConnell and a number of other colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nwho have worked diligently for a year now to hammer out this compromise \nwe are considering today.\n  As we all know, the 2002 elections brought to light a number of \nproblems in the way we run elections. While Florida got a lot of \nattention, we found out the problems do not reside solely in Florida \nbut persist in a number of other States as well. The bill that we will, \nhopefully, adopt this week goes a long way toward fixing not all those \nproblems but a number of them. Let me mention a few.\n  This legislation sets strong standards that State voting systems must \nmeet so that all voting technology that American voters use allows them \nto correct mistakes and meet set error rates, acceptable lower error \nrates. This ensures voting machines are accessible to handicapped \nvoters and voters with limited English proficiency. Third, this \nlegislation provides for provisional balloting so voters mistakenly \nleft off official registration lists are still allowed to vote. Fourth, \nthis legislation provides for balanced antifraud measures to ensure \nvoters are not disenfranchised.\n  Fortunately, in my State of Delaware there were few problems on \nelection day in 2002. Delaware has uniform electronic voting machines \nwith good error rates. All of our precincts are called election \ndistricts. The machines were purchased during the time that I served as \nGovernor of our State. Delaware also has a computerized statewide voter \nregistration list put in place under the leadership of our former \nElection Commissioner, Thomas Cook.\n  We have some work still to do in Delaware to assure our machines \nallow the handicapped to vote in privacy and to put a provisional \nvoting system into place. Some States need to do a whole lot more than \nthat. I am happy to see the bill provides the money to enable them and \nDelaware to do the work that needs to be done. This bill includes no \nunfunded mandates. This bill provides $3 billion in grants to pay 100 \npercent of the costs to States for implementing the voting machines or \nprovisional balloting and for antifraud requirements.\n  We must work hard to ensure, however, that the money we are \npromising, the money we propose to authorize, actually gets to the \nStates and that there are enough dollars at the end for the States to \nmeet the requirements we are placing on them, especially now that a \nnumber of States, including my own, are faced with very tight budgets.\n  According to the National Governors Association, combined State \nbudget shortfalls are at $15 billion and could go higher if State \nunemployment, health care, and homeland security costs continue to \nrise.\n  Most States have balanced budget requirements in their constitution \nand face the prospect of having to raise taxes or make budget cuts to \ncover the budget shortfalls.\n  Having said that, this is a good bill. In fact, this is more than a \ngood bill; it is a very good bill. I am pleased to urge my colleagues \nto join me and others to pass it overwhelmingly. I hope at the end of \nthe day if we begin to see in the future that States continue to have \nproblems meeting these new standards for budgetary reasons that emanate \nmore from Washington than our State capitals, we find a way to get \nthose States the resources they need or, if necessary, to amend the \ntiming of requirements so that States can meet those requirements \nresponsibly.\n\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2912, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2912, the Harkin \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending amendment \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I send a modification to the desk on behalf of Senator \nHarkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2912), as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for protection and advocacy systems)\n\n       On page 28 of the amendment, after line 23, add the \n     following:\n       (c) Protection and Advocacy Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to any other payments made \n     under this section, the Attorney General shall pay the \n     protection and advocacy system (as defined in section 102 of \n     the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights \n     Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)) of each State to ensure full \n     participation in the electoral process for individuals with \n     disabilities, including registering to vote, casting a vote \n     and accessing polling places. In providing such services, \n     protection and advocacy systems shall have the same general \n     authorities as they are afforded under part C of the \n     Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act \n     of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.).\n       (2) Minimum grant amount.--The minimum amount of each grant \n     to a protection and advocacy system shall be determined and \n     allocated as set forth in subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5), \n     (e), and (g) of section 509 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     (29 U.S.C. 794e), except that the amount of the grants to \n     systems referred to in subsections (c)(3)(B) and (c)(4)(B) of \n     that section shall be not less than $70,000 and $35,000, \n     respectively.\n       On page 30, strike lines 23 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Protection and Advocacy Systems.--In addition to any \n     other amounts authorized to be appropriated under this \n     section, there are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 \n     for each of the fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, and \n     for each subsequent fiscal year such sums as may be \n     necessary, for the purpose of making payments under section \n     206(c): Provided, That none of the funds provided by this \n     subsection shall be used to commence any litigation related \n     to election-related disability access, notwithstanding the \n     general authorities of the protection and advocacy systems as \n     are otherwise afforded under part C of the Developmental \n     Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42 \n     U.S.C. 15041 et seq.)\n       (c) Availability.--Any amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authority of this section shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and our friends on the \nRepublican side for working out this modification. Senator Harkin \nraises a very good amendment. There was concern raised by Senator \nMcConnell, and\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nmaybe others, that we would be utilizing some of these dollars to \npromote litigation in this bill. That has never been our intent. There \nis nothing in this bill that would do that.\n  Because it was possible that some small percentage of these dollars \ncould be used for that purpose, there were concerns raised by the \namendment. Senator Harkin has modified his amendment with language that \nwould explicitly prohibit any of the funds provided under this bill \nfrom being used for purposes of litigation. It does not, however, \notherwise affect the use of existing funds.\n  That being the case, our friends on the Republican side have \nwithdrawn their objection to this amendment. I urge its adoption as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2912), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I think we have done some good work. I thank Senator \nMcConnell and his staff. We are going to be breaking for the weekly \nluncheons by both caucuses. I think we have adopted some six amendments \nthis morning, debated the Harkin amendment, and modified that. We are \ngetting this list down. I am beginning to think we might actually be in \na position to adopt this legislation by this evening.\n  We are going to be talking over lunch to see if we can't work out \nthese amendments. Staffs will meet over the luncheon period to see if \nwe can resolve some of the differences. But I thank the individual \nSenators for their cooperation. Senator McConnell and I are grateful \nfor their cooperation.\n  When we come back, there will be a special order period between 2:15 \nand 3:15, but after that we will be back on this bill--I believe that \nis the case--in which case we will try to line up some amendments to be \ndebated at that time so we can move the product along a little further.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Arkansas who is here, I believe, \nnot just to listen to the Senator from Connecticut but he may have \nsomething to say. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 2 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hutchinson pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, S. 565 is a very important piece of \nlegislation. It is good work. I thank Senator Dodd and others for their \ngood work. But there are some other issues that are hanging over us \nlike a big cloud.\n  In particular, I am talking about the Federal budget. On February 5, \nthe President sent us a blueprint for this next decade. I have to say \nthat it is a pretty bleak picture. There are cuts in job training \nprograms during hard economic times. There is a 50-percent cut in 7(a) \nprograms to small businesses that leveraged, for example, $1 billion in \nmy State of Minnesota over the last 5 years, in hard economic times.\n  There is an inadequate education budget. I don't know whatever \nhappened to the language ``leave no child behind,'' but I know we are \nnow getting a tin cup budget. We don't have the money for \nprekindergarten. We don't have the money for afterschool programs. At \nthe same time we have the tax cuts for the top 10 percent of families \nwith incomes of $297,000 and over. At the same time we want to \neliminate the alternative minimum tax. At the same time, in the energy \nbill, we want to give tax cuts maybe to the tune of $28 billion to oil \ncompanies that had $40 billion in profits last year.\n  We are going to have to make some choices. Do we put children and \neducation first? Do we put these big corporations and more tax breaks \nand tax loopholes for these big corporations first? Do we put veterans \nfirst? Or are we going to have Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts for the \ntop 1 percent of the population? Are we going to balance the budget to \nbe fiscally responsible, or are we going to be taking the money out of \nthe trust funds?\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 18, 2002]\n\n         U.S. Corporations Are Using Bermuda To Slash Tax Bills\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       A growing number of American companies, encouraged by their \n     financial advisers, are incorporating in Bermuda to lower \n     their taxes sharply without giving up the benefits of doing \n     business in the United States.\n       Insurance companies led the way, but now manufacturers and \n     other kinds of companies are following. Stanley Works, for \n     159 years a Connecticut maker of hammers and wrenches, is \n     among the latest with plans to become a corporation in \n     Bermuda, where there is no income tax. The company estimates \n     that it will cut its tax bill by $30 million a year, to about \n     $80 million.\n       Tyco International, a diversified manufacturer with \n     headquarters in Exeter, N.H., says that being a Bermuda \n     corporation saved it more than $400 million last year alone. \n     Other companies that have incorporated in Bermuda or plan to \n     do so include Global Crossing, a Beverly Hills, Calif., \n     telecommunications company; Ingesoll-Rand and Foster Wheeler, \n     both New jersey industrial manufacturers; Nabors Industries, \n     a Texas company that is the nation's largest oil well \n     services company; and Cooper Industries, a Houston \n     manufacturer of industrial equipment.\n       Becoming a Bermuda company is a paper transaction, as easy \n     as securing a mail drop there and paying some fees, while \n     keeping the working headquarters back in the United States.\n       Bermuda is charging Ingersoll-Rand just $27,653 a year for \n     a move that allows the company to avoid at least $40 million \n     annually in American corporate income taxes.\n       The company is not required to conduct any meetings in \n     Bermuda and will not even have an office there, said its \n     chief financial officer, David W. Devonshire.\n       ``We just pay a service organization'' to accept mail, he \n     said.\n       Kate Barton, an Ernst & Young tax partner, said that \n     incorporating in Bermuda ``is a megatrend we are seeing in \n     the marketplace right now.'' Many corporations that are \n     planning the move have not yet announced it, she said.\n       In a Webcast to clients, Ms. Barton cited patriotism as the \n     only potentially troubling issue that corporations consider \n     before moving to Bermuda, and she said that profits trumped \n     patriotism.\n       ``Is it the right time to be migrating a corporation's \n     headquarters to an offshore location?'' she asked. ``And yet, \n     that said, we are working through a lot of companies who feel \n     that it is, that just the improvement on earnings is powerful \n     enough that maybe the patriotism issue needs to take a back \n     seat to that.''\n       The White House has said nothing about these moves and \n     their effect on tax revenues. Mark A. Weinberger, chief of \n     tax policy in the Treasury Department, said the moves to \n     Bermuda and other tax havens showed that the American tax \n     system might be driving companies to make such decisions. \n     ``We may need to rethink some of our international tax rules \n     that were written 30 years ago when our economy was very \n     different and that now may be impeding the ability of U.S. \n     companies to compete internationally.''\n       But others have expressed concern about the trend. Senator \n     Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the \n     Senate Finance Committee, expressed alarm. ``There is no \n     business reason for doing this, other than to escape U.S. \n     taxation. I believe the Finance Committee needs to \n     investigate this activity.''\n       There is no official estimate of how much the Bermuda moves \n     are costing the government in tax revenues, and the Bush \n     administration is not trying to come up with one.\n       A Bermuda address is being recommended by many legal, \n     accounting and investment advisers. Stanley Works, for \n     example, relied on Ernst & Young for accounting advice,\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\n     Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom for legal advice, and \n     Goldman, Sachs for investment advice.\n       Ingersoll-Rand's top tax officer, Gerald Swimmer, said all \n     of the major investment houses and accounting firms had \n     presented the idea to his company. Ingersoll-Rand expects its \n     worldwide income taxes to fall to less than $115 million from \n     about $155 million annually.\n       Many companies looking for tax havens abroad are choosing \n     Bermuda because it is close, its political system is stable \n     and it uses a legal system similar to that of the United \n     States. But some, like Seagate Technology, the California \n     maker of computer disk drives, have gone to the Cayman \n     Islands and other places.\n       Insurers have also flocked to Bermuda to escape most \n     insurance regulations, including how much money they must \n     hold in reserve to pay claims.\n       Since companies that move to Bermuda usually keep their \n     main offices in the United States, they continue to have all \n     the security provided by the American government, the legal \n     system and the courts.\n       But by moving to Bermuda, their income from outside the \n     United States becomes exempt from American taxes. Also, when \n     the American company borrows from its Bermuda parent, the \n     interest it pays creates a deduction that reduces U.S. taxes, \n     but there is no tax on the interest earned by the Bermuda \n     parent.\n       These companies say they are moving because their worldwide \n     tax rates are higher than those of foreign competitors. \n     Stanley Works expects its worldwide tax rate to fall to 23 \n     percent to 25 percent of profits, down from 32 percent now, \n     said Gerard J. Gould, Stanley's vice president for investor \n     relations.\n       Another company, Cooper Industries, expects to lower its \n     worldwide income tax bill to $80 million from about $134 \n     million.\n       Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers, said that \n     ``any company with a decent amount of foreign income will see \n     its tax rate fall dramatically'' by moving its nominal \n     headquarters to Bermuda.\n       ``But the political considerations sometimes prevail,'' he \n     added, ``and companies are understandably reluctant to do \n     something like this because it will not necessarily be \n     properly construed in the marketplace. It may be seen as not \n     patriotic and in the wake of Sept. 11, that is not a good \n     posture for a company.''\n       Mr. Willens said that he had personally presented the \n     Bermuda idea to some companies and that the idea had been \n     turned down for just that reason. ``The companies most \n     willing to do this are not household names,'' he said, ``but \n     Stanley Works is verging on a household name.''\n       Mr. Gould said Stanley Works, whose products can be found \n     in many home toolboxes, had not received a single complaint \n     that it was being unpatriotic. Only a few shareholders \n     complained, he said, and all were longtime shareholders who \n     will owe taxes on their capital gains if the deal is approved \n     by two-thirds of the Stanley Works shareholders.\n       The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that shareholders \n     must pay taxes on any increase in the value of their shares \n     between the date they bought them and the date the company \n     incorporated in Bermuda, even if they do not sell the shares. \n     The government designed this rule to place a price on what it \n     calls tax-motivated expatriation.\n       With the stock market depressed, Mr. Willens noted, \n     interest in moving to Bermuda is up because fewer \n     shareholders would owe capital gains. And even when a move to \n     a tax haven occurs, the company is not required to report to \n     the I.R.S. on the holdings of each stock owner. Only the \n     integrity of individual taxpayers ensures that the taxes are \n     paid, as is the case with any tax on capital gains.\n       ``I am sure a few get missed,'' Mr. Willens said with a \n     chuckle.\n       Peter L. Baumbusch, an international tax lawyer with \n     Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, said current tax law \n     discriminated against existing multinational corporations \n     with headquarters in the United States.\n       David A. Weisbach, a University of Chicago professor of tax \n     law, said the corporate moves to Bermuda should prompt \n     Congress to review the American corporate tax regime, which \n     was established when American companies sold primarily to the \n     domestic market and few foreign companies had a major \n     presence in the United States.\n       ``Should we be taxing worldwide income or not?'' he asked. \n     ``That is the really hard question.''\n       Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking \n     Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the \n     patriotism question also needed to be debated.\n       ``Some companies flying the Stars and Stripes renounce \n     America when it comes to paying their taxes,'' he said. \n     ``They choose profits over patriotism. So far, the Bush \n     Treasury Department has shown no interest in stopping these \n     corporate moves, or even drawing attention to them. \n     Supporting America is more than about waving the flag and \n     saluting--it's about sharing the sacrifice. That's true of \n     soldiers, citizens, and it should be true of big companies, \n     too.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is in this context that I read from \nthis article of last week about a new Bermuda Triangle for big \nbusinesses where the tax bill goes in, but the check never comes out. \nThe article is entitled, ``U.S. Corporations Are Using Bermuda To Slash \nTax Bills.'' It reveals that a number of prominent U.S. corporations \nusing creative paperwork have transformed themselves into Bermuda \ncorporations purely to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. \nThese new Bermuda companies are purely shell companies. They are shell \ncorporations. They have no staff. They have no offices. They have no \nbusiness activity in Bermuda. They exist for the sole purpose of \nshielding income from the IRS.\n  Let me give you a few examples.\n  Ingersoll-Rand is paying Bermuda approximately $28,000 in fees to \nsave itself $40 million in taxes. Stanley Tools intends to recharter in \nBermuda and save themselves $30 million a year. Tyco International \nsaved $400 million last year in taxes. The list goes on and on.\n  Small businesses in Detroit Lakes, MN, or Mankato, MN, or in \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, MN, or in Duluth, MN, cannot avail themselves of \nthe Bermuda Triangle. They cannot afford the big-name tax lawyers and \naccountants to show them how to do their books Enron style, but they \nprobably wouldn't do it anyway, because the small businesspeople in \nMinnesota do not want to renounce their citizenship, they do not want \nto renounce their patriotism, and they want to pay their fair share of \ntaxes as everybody else does.\n  So I say to Senators, as we look at these budget priorities, we are \ngoing to have to decide what we are going to be doing. Are we going to \ngo after these tax scofflaws? Are we going to have fair tax relief? Are \nwe going to save Social Security or let them get away with this? This \nis really outrageous.\n  I simply say that the priority for me, as a Senator, is to go after \nthis ``Bermuda triangle'' boondoggle. The priority for me, as a \nSenator, is to go after these multinational corporations that will not \npay their fair share of taxes. And the priority for me is to make sure \nthat Senators vote so we can all be on record as to whether or not we \nwant more loopholes, more tax breaks for multinational corporations so \nthey do not have to pay their fair share of taxes, and, as a result, we \ndo not invest in children and education.\n  We say we do not have money for affordable prescription drugs. We say \nthere is no money for affordable housing. That is simply outrageous. We \nsay we cannot help anybody with health security for themselves and \ntheir families.\n  There are three courses of action I will announce in the Chamber \ntoday:\n  No. 1, the letter to the Finance Committee, saying: I call upon you \nto basically do everything you can do to end this outrageous loophole \nof these multinational corporations setting up these sham offices in \ncountries such as Bermuda and not paying taxes.\n  No. 2, I say to Senators that on the budget resolution, which will be \ncoming up maybe this month--certainly next month--I am going to have an \namendment which says: Find the savings from these big corporations that \nare not paying their fair share of taxes and are setting up these sham \noffices in countries such as Bermuda and put it into education and \nhealth care. We will have a straight up-or-down vote on that amendment \nto the budget resolution.\n\n  Then, No. 3, I want to send a Dear Colleague letter out to Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. I definitely will introduce \nlegislation. I do not have all the specifics down right now, but it \nseems to me, at a bare minimum, what we can say to these companies is: \nLook, you can set up some sham office in some other country as a tax \ndodge, but if you are doing most of your business in the United States \nof America, you are going to be taxed on the business you do here.\n  The second thing we can say to these companies is: You get all kinds \nof tax breaks, you get all kinds of Government help, the assumption \nbeing you are investing in our economy. But if you are going to set up \nthese sham offices, if you are going to be involved in this tax \navoidance, then you are not going to get any more of these breaks \nbecause, frankly, you are not being a good citizen corporation; you are \nacting a little bit too much like Enron. You are not being very \npatriotic when you are not willing to pay your fair\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nshare of taxes. And, frankly, as Senators, we are sick of the tradeoff. \nWe do not like going back to our States and saying to law enforcement: \nWe are going to have to cut the COPS Program by 80 percent. We do not \nlike to tell small businesses they are not going to have access to low-\ninterest loans. We do not like telling our schools and our children \nthere isn't going to be the money for education. We do not like telling \nelderly people: God knows for how long all of us who have run for \noffice have promised there will be affordable prescription drugs, but, \nsorry, we do not have any money to do any of that for you. We do not \nlike telling families who have no health insurance whatsoever: We \ncannot do anything to help you because we have some of these big \ncorporations, these multinationals, that have done the opposite of \nbeing good corporate citizens and basically have set up these \nelaborate, disingenuous, dishonest, tax evasion schemes.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, my priority is to make sure they pay \ntheir fair share of taxes. That is the very least we can ask of them.\n  Mr. President, other than that, I do not feel strongly about this \nissue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1151-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The hour of 12:35 p.m. having arrived, under the previous order, the \nSenate will now stand in recess until the hour of 2:15 p.m.\n  Whereupon, the Senate, at 12:35 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. \nCleland).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my old friend and teacher, Mo Udall, \nwrote a book called ``Too Funny to be President'' and dedicated it, in \nhis words, ``to the 3,000 Members of Congress, living and dead, with \nwhom I served for nearly three decades.''\n  It is true. We are all part of a continuum. In the history of our \nNation, only 1,864 Americans have ever served in the Senate. Carved or \npenned into the drawers in our desks are the names of some of the \ngiants--men such as Clay, Webster, Calhoun. But we don't have to open \nour desks or open a book to see one of the greatest Senators ever to \nserve in this body. All we have to do is open our eyes. He is right \nhere, at the same desk he has occupied now for the last 40 years.\n  I have been a Senator for 16 years. I count it as part of my good \nfortune that I have been able to call Ted Kennedy a colleague all of \nthose years. I consider it an even greater privilege to call him my \nfriend.\n  Today it gives me enormous pleasure to join the rest of my colleagues \nin wishing my good friend a happy 70th birthday.\n  In his remarkable 1999 book ``Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography,'' New \nYork Times reporter Adam Clymer recounts a letter an 8-year-old Ted \nKennedy received from his father.\n  It was 1940. Ambassador Kennedy was writing from war-torn London to \nhis young son who had returned to America. He tells Ted that he can \nhear the bombs exploding outside his residence. Then he writes:\n\n       I hope that when you grow up, you will dedicate your life \n     to trying to work out plans to make people happy instead of \n     making them miserable, as war does today.\n\n  Somewhere, I feel certain Joe Kennedy is looking down on his youngest \nson today, as he does every day, smiling. Ted Kennedy has indeed \ndedicated his life to trying to make people happy.\n\n  The great Irish playwright, George Bernard Shaw, wrote that ``this is \nthe true joy of life: to be used for a principle recognized by yourself \nas a mighty one . . .''\n  That is exactly what Ted Kennedy has done. For 40 years now he has \nused his great booming voice to speak for those who have none. There is \nno more passionate or effective advocate in this Senate for good \nschools for every child, decent, affordable health care for every \nAmerican; there is no one in this body who has fought harder or longer \nto improve the living standards of working families and protect the \nbasic civil rights of all Americans. He is a drum major for justice.\n  President Bush says the folks at the coffee shop down in Crawford \nwere surprised to see him praise Senator Kennedy for his invaluable \nhelp in passing the new education reform act. They shouldn't have been.\n  Since the day he arrived, Ted Kennedy has sought out those with views \ndifferent from his own to see if together they could find principled \ncompromise. He has never wavered in his principles. At the same time, \nhe is a pragmatist who wants more than anything to get things done.\n  I remember 5 years ago when we created the Children's Health \nInsurance Program with strong bipartisan support. It was something \nSenator Kennedy had worked on for years. After the vote, he came into \nmy office, as he does sometimes with these victories, beaming. He \nlooked so much like a proud, new father, I thought he might start \nhanding out cigars. To everyone he passed he said, ``Isn't it \nwonderful.''\n  As he spoke about that victory, he didn't talk about how many votes \nhis plan had received. He talked about how many children it would help. \nThat is the kind of man he is. He doesn't care who gets the credit so \nlong as people get the help.\n  Sometimes when I am in this Chamber, I look up to the gallery to see \nthe people who have come here to see this great institution at work. I \ncan always tell from their reactions when Senator Kennedy has walked on \nthe floor without even looking around. People sit up, heads turn. \nAlmost always you see someone lean over and whisper to the person next \nto him or her: Look, Ted Kennedy.\n  He is, undoubtedly, the best known member of this body. Yet he \nremains a modest man--a worker among workers.\n  Within our caucus, he is very often the first one to work in the \nmorning and the last person to leave at night.\n  No job is too small for Ted Kennedy. At the same time, no challenge \nis too big.\n  On civil rights, voting rights, education, disarmament and so many \nother critically important issues, Senator Kennedy has not only picked \nup the fallen standard that his brothers John and Robert once carried. \nHe has advanced that standard. He has done much of the work they hoped \nto do but couldn't.\n  There is another incident in Adam Clymer's book that may explain, in \npart, why Ted Kennedy has achieved so much in this Senate.\n  The year was 1965. Ted and Robert Kennedy were serving together on \nthe Labor and Public Welfare Committee. It was Robert Kennedy's first \nyear in the Senate and Ted's third.\n  One day, after they had waited hours to question a committee witness, \nRobert leaned over and whispered to his brother: ``Is this the way I \nbecome a good Senator--sitting here and waiting my turn?''\n  Ted said: ``Yes.''\n  Robert pressed: ``How many hours do I have to sit to be a good \nSenator?''\n  Ted answered: ``As long as it takes, Robbie.''\n  Ted Kennedy is a patient idealist. He understands that progress is a \nlong march and he is willing to work as long and hard as it takes to \nmove America forward.\n  Carved into the drawer of the desk in which he sits is the name of \nhis other brother, John, who sat there before him and who, like Robert, \nwas taken from him, and us, because of his commitment to public \nservice.\n  Many people--perhaps most people--who had suffered such loss might \nwithdraw from public service in fear or anger. They might conclude, \nrightly, that their family had given enough.\n  But not Ted Kennedy.\n  He has stayed and has done what his father hoped he would all those \nyears ago. He has dedicated his life to trying to work out plans to \nmake people happy.\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\n  Unlike his brothers, he has ``lived to comb his gray hair.''\n  He has received what they did not: ``the gift of length of years.''\n  As we celebrate his 70th birthday, it seems to me that America is the \nreal beneficiary of that great gift.\n  And so, on this happy occasion, I say to my friend, Senator Kennedy, \nThank you. Happy Birthday. And may you have many, many more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator is correct.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be a period for the \ntransaction of morning business not to extend beyond the hour of 3:15, \nwith the time under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Senator \nKennedy's House colleagues be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' patience. I \nhope we will all have a chance to pay tribute.\n  As the majority leader has just said, and as we have learned in \nwonderful stories across the country over the course of the last weeks, \nmy senior colleague and our good friend and colleague to all of us on \nboth sides of the aisle celebrated his 70th birthday on February 22, \nlast week, while we were out of session. But he also records a rather \nremarkable milestone together with a birthday. It is not only a \ncelebration of 70 years of life, but it is also the milestone of 40 \nyears of service to the State of Massachusetts and to his country here \nin the Senate.\n  He started his career by setting an extraordinarily high standard in \nthe very beginning because it was when he reached the minimal \nconstitutional age of 30 that he first came to the Senate--one of only \n16 people in the history of the Senate to reach this institution at \nthat early and tender age. What we celebrate today, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, is not only the awe we have for his lifetime of \nachievement but really the way in which literally almost every single \nyear that Senator Kennedy has been here there has been a milestone \npiece of legislation that has passed either with his significant \nsupport and input or with his outright leadership.\n  The Boston Globe put it best, writing not long ago that:\n\n       In actual, measurable impact on the lives of tens of \n     millions of working families, the elderly, and the needy, Ted \n     Kennedy belongs in the same sentence with Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n  That sentence is not constructed lightly; it is the measure of a \npublic servant who doesn't know the meaning of the words, ``you can't \npass it,'' ``it can't happen,'' or ``impossible.''\n  It is the measure of a Senator who--on every issue of importance, \nfrom health care to children, education, civil rights, choice, and so \non--can always be counted on to be in the lead, challenging on the \nissues and fighting for the principles that guide our party and lift up \nour country.\n\n  As every single one of my colleagues here knows, Ted Kennedy is an \nextraordinary public servant, not only because he knows who he is \npersonally and sticks to his guns, never bending with the political \ncurrents, but because he has in his life and in his career proven again \nand again that progress doesn't happen by accident, that it doesn't \nhappen when you simply stick to the text of the latest opinion poll or \nthe whispers of a morning focus group, it happens when leaders define \nand fight the fights that need fighting and when public servants of \nconscience and conviction refuse to take no for an answer.\n  That is why, for Ted Kennedy, the ``cause'' has not just endured, it \nhas triumphed--again and again.\n  Whether you agree with him or not, we know that Ted Kennedy has never \nbeen afraid to be a majority of one. We know that he has been an \nextraordinary leader because he has excelled while completing his work \nin the Senate, where sometimes others were afraid to begin.\n  Ironically, in being a standard-bearer for an ideal, Ted has become, \nas Clymer wrote in his recent book:\n\n       [N]ot just the leading Senator of his time, but one of the \n     greats in its history, wise in the workings of this singular \n     institution, especially its demand to be more than partisan \n     to accomplish much.\n\n  His partnerships with his fellow Senators are well known and often \nrecited--and sometimes lampooned--from Howard Baker, Jacob Javits, Hugh \nScott, Arlen Specter, Dan Quayle, Orrin Hatch, Alan Simpson, and Nancy \nKassebaum--Ted has never hesitated to cross the aisle in an effort to \naccomplish his goals and to further a common agenda--fighting always to \nprove that ideologies, however incompatible according to conventional \nwisdom, can be put aside for the greater good when it improves the \nlives of our fellow Americans.\n  Ted has always done that--put aside partisanship and reached out. On \na personal note--and I think there are many Senators who would say \nthis--Ted Kennedy is remarkable. There are so many of our colleagues \nwho have been touched in times of loss, times of distress, times of \ndisease or sickness, before an operation, after an operation, when a \nchild was in trouble; it is almost always Ted Kennedy who is one of the \nfirst to pick up the phone and one of the first to offer support.\n  I remember 30 years ago when I came back from Vietnam and a group of \nus ragtag veterans assembled on The Mall here to try to get the country \nto listen to what we thought was the truth.\n  There were not many leaders in the Senate prepared to listen, but Ted \nKennedy was among the first and the few who came down to that \nencampment, sat during the night, listened to the stories of veterans, \nand came back to the floor of the Senate to be an extraordinary witness \nto their truth. He reached out and demonstrated in actions, as well as \nwords, the truth for which those soldiers had fought.\n  Now we see that in so many ways. He goes where his conscience tells \nhim to go. He hears of children who go through their early years \nwithout health care, who come to school unable to learn, and he has \nmade their care his crusade. So millions more children today see a \ndoctor because of Ted Kennedy and millions more will before he is done.\n  He hears of workers sweating it out, punching a timeclock, doing \nbackbreaking work over the course of a lifetime, and he has made their \neconomic security his agenda. And so many millions of workers have seen \ntheir wages increased over the course of their lives, pensions \nprotected where others would have left it to the marketplace, and he \nhas created a safe workplace, and the right to organize has been put \nback on the Nation's agenda. These issues again and again will be \nadvanced by Ted Kennedy.\n  That is the drive, the passion, and the special commitment we \ncelebrate today. This is not a new ideology, it is not a new-age \nvision, but it is an age-old belief that Americans have a \nresponsibility to each other, that America is still in the process of \nbecoming, and that we are privileged to serve here to make that dream \nreal for all Americans.\n  These are the qualities that make our colleague the lion of the \nSenate and make him one of the most prolific legislators in American \nhistory. They also make him what his brother Robert said was some of \nthe most important words in the English language: A great citizen.\n  For that and so much more, we honor our friend and colleague Ted \nKennedy today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                    remarks by representative markey\n\n       This past week, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n     celebrated the 70th Birthday of our senior senator, Ted \n     Kennedy, and a legacy of public service unsurpassed in its\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n     benefit to the people of our state, the country and the \n     world. Of course, his legacy grows day by day, week by week, \n     year by year, and will undoubtedly result in the greatest \n     record of achievement that the United States Senate has ever \n     known.\n       It brings to mind a recent event of importance to all New \n     Englanders. The New England Patriots won the Super Bowl this \n     year, one of the greatest achievements in professional \n     sports. So great is this achievement that our regional team \n     has accomplished this incredible feat just once in its 40 \n     year history. When a professional football team wins more \n     than one championship in a relatively short time frame we \n     proclaim it a dynasty. But what if a professional football \n     team won the Super Bowl for 40 consecutive years? How would \n     we describe such unprecedented success?\n       That is the challenge we face as we celebrate the \n     achievements of Ted Kennedy, for he manages to win the \n     legislative Super Bowl every year. He has many teammates \n     contributing to the success of their mutual efforts from year \n     to year, but they come and go. The one constant is Senator \n     Ted Kennedy, a Senate giant, the quarterback, the leader.\n       Senator Kennedy has provided a powerful and effective voice \n     for those who do not have a high-priced and well-recognized \n     lobby in Washington--the poor and the underprivileged. His \n     legislative accomplishments have enhanced the quality of \n     health care we provide our constituents, the quality of \n     education we provide our children and the quality of life \n     every American family enjoys in this nation by safeguarding \n     our environment and providing protection and equity in the \n     workplace. Collectively, Senator Kennedy's body of work has \n     given every individual in this country an opportunity to \n     reach their ``American Dream.''\n       When Senator Kennedy retires they will place his picture \n     and biography in the dictionary next to the definition of \n     Senator. It will be an abridged version, because they won't \n     have enough room to describe his accomplishments of the next \n     forty years. It is an honor to call Ted my colleague, it is \n     an honor to call him my friend, but most importantly it is an \n     honor to call him my Senator.\n\n\n               remarks by representative michael capuano\n\n       I would like to extend my congratulations and best wishes \n     to Senator Edward Kennedy as he celebrates his 70th birthday.\n       Senator Kennedy's impact on Massachusetts and on our \n     country is immeasurable. His powerful stamp can be found on \n     national legislation and local programs ranging from health \n     care and affordable housing to education. He is a true \n     champion of America's working men and women and is a strong \n     advocate for the needs of children.\n       In Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy's hard work is visible in \n     so many ways. He fights to increase access to public \n     transportation and improve and highway system. He brings \n     federal dollars to every corner of the Commonwealth for \n     after-school programs, teacher training, counseling and a \n     host of important initiatives.\n       I am proud to serve in the Congress with Senator Kennedy \n     and have learned a great deal from him during my short time \n     in Washington. I look forward to serving many more years with \n     the Senator. I know that Massachusetts and our country will \n     continue to benefit from his years of experience.\n\n\n             remarks by representative william d. delahunt\n\n       This month the family, friends and admirers of Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy celebrate two major milestones: his 70th \n     birthday and his 40th year in the Senate. It is a fitting \n     moment to take stock of what his leadership has meant for \n     social policy in this country.\n       Senator Kennedy's legacy in the fields of health care \n     reform, education and civil rights is a testament to his \n     principled commitment to making America a more just society. \n     His success in accomplishing so much of what he has set out \n     to do--whether in the majority or the minority--is a \n     testament to his gift for finding common ground and his \n     mastery of the legislative art.\n       In no area of his work have those twin attributes of \n     principle and pragmatism been so in evidence as in his \n     efforts to improve the criminal justice system.\n       As a local prosecutor for over two decades, I watched with \n     pride as Senator Kennedy fought for sensible crime control \n     policies at a time when many in Congress were running in the \n     opposite direction.\n       As his congressional colleague for the last five years, I \n     have been gratified to be able to collaborate with him on \n     legislation to give local law enforcement officers the tools \n     they need to keep our streets and neighborhoods safe, while \n     also providing resources to community-based prevention and \n     early intervention programs that keep young people from \n     turning to violence in the first place.\n       Ted Kennedy has always understood that government cannot \n     respond effectively to such complex problems if politicians \n     are merely reactive--if they cling to failed policies and \n     discredited theories our of fear that an opponent will label \n     them ``soft on crime''.\n       And no one can call Senator Kennedy soft on crime. He \n     understands--as few people can--the terrible toll that \n     violence has taken on our families, our communities, and our \n     culture. His own experience has made him especially sensitive \n     to the needs of victims of violence in all its forms.\n       Yet the Senator has never wavered in his insistence on due \n     process and his deep opposition to capital punishment. His \n     principles were sorely tested as he watched his brothers John \n     and Bobby cut down in their prime. Few would have blamed him \n     had he sought vengeance against the assassin who took the \n     life of Robert Kennedy. Yet characteristically, he spoke even \n     in his grief not of vengeance but of compassion, asking the \n     Los Angeles district attorney to retrain from seeking the \n     death penalty.\n       Some politicians have been tempted to cast aside the \n     Constitution when expediency demanded it. Not Ted Kennedy. He \n     fought for a balanced crime bill in 1996, yet voted against \n     it when it failed to safeguard the Writ of Habeas Corpus. He \n     has continued to stand up for the rights of immigrants, whom \n     others have far too often found an easy target in times of \n     trouble. He has struggled to pass federal hate crimes \n     legislation that would curb violence and harassment against \n     gays and lesbians--another frequent scapegoat for popular \n     anxieties.\n       The commitment to a just society, that combination of \n     principle and pragmatism, are among the many reasons I am \n     proud to call Edward M. Kennedy my senator. My constituent. \n     And my friend. Happy birthday, Ted.\n\n\n                 remarks by representative barney frank\n\n       The senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, has \n     done more to advance fairness in American life in the past \n     forty years than anyone else in the country. I can think of \n     no group of people suffering from unjustified adversity of \n     whom he has been not simply a champion, but the most \n     forceful, passionate, and, most importantly, the most \n     effective champion.\n       In fact, his extraordinary lifetime work for social and \n     economic justice is not only the most impressive in post-\n     World War II America, it overshadows the work of all but a \n     handful of American public officials who have gone before \n     him.\n       At this point, I encounter a dilemma. Having said this \n     about Senator Kennedy's career, I find myself without \n     anything else to say on this central point--he has been for \n     forty years the best we have at the most important task \n     confronting public policy makers, and there is nothing to add \n     to that in evaluating a political leader. But to end here \n     somehow seems inadequate--if only to guard against \n     misinterpretation of my opinion by those who measure \n     admiration by its length. Fortunately, there is one \n     subordinate aspect of Senator Kennedy's record that I believe \n     calls out for comment--his shattering of a number of \n     stereotypes.\n       One form of shallow analysis that plagues the study of \n     politics in America is that which sets up a series of false \n     choices, and insists that public figures must choose to be on \n     one side or the other of a set of opposites. We are told that \n     effective insiders in Congress who seek to get things done \n     cannot simultaneously be forceful public advocates. We are \n     told that the political world is cleanly divided between \n     idealists, pure but impractical, and pragmatists, ever ready \n     to trade in principle for the sake of a deal. And last in \n     this series, Members of Congress are often divided between \n     those who focus on broad national themes, and their opposites \n     who spend their time and energy working on specific projects \n     for their local constituencies.\n       One of the things that makes me grateful to Senator Kennedy \n     for his unsurpassed legislative work is that he defies every \n     one of these false dichotomies. He has been for Massachusetts \n     an extremely effective advocate without in any way holding \n     back from being our leading national voice for economic and \n     social fairness.\n       Nor does this passionate national advocacy in any way \n     diminish his impact in the Senate, where he is one of the \n     most productive and successful legislators in that body's \n     history. And his impact has come precisely because he is so \n     strongly committed to a set of ideals that he understands \n     that his obligation is to be successful in carrying them into \n     fruition.\n       I believe it is important to admit one's mistakes, even if \n     it isn't a lot of fun. And there is no statute of limitations \n     on this principle. Forty years ago, I opposed Edward \n     Kennedy's candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the \n     U.S. Senate. While I continue to have an enormous amount of \n     respect for the late Edward McCormack, who was then his \n     opponent, I want to say here that I have never been happier \n     to have proven so wrong.\n\n\n               remarks by representative stephen f. lynch\n\n       It is with great honor that I rise today to pay tribute to \n     an extraordinary man and an exemplary public figure. For \n     forty years, Senator Ted Kennedy has given a voice to those \n     without one, and has stood up for all those who need it most. \n     Senator Kennedy has been a leader for Massachusetts, and for \n     our nation, and his work has touched the lives of hundreds of \n     millions of Americans. We all recognize his remarkable \n     efforts in protecting the civil rights of all Americans, \n     improving the quality and accessibility of education, and his \n     undying commitment to extend health care coverage to every \n     American. But I want to pay special tribute to Senator \n     Kennedy's dedication to the working men and women of \n     Massachusetts.\n       As an ironworker for eighteen years, I know firsthand the \n     pride that comes from earning a living with your hands, and \n     the struggles a worker must face to provide for his family on \n     a blue-collar wage. No member\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\n     of the United States Senate understands the reality of \n     working families better, and no member respects them more \n     than Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy appreciates the dignity of \n     teachers, of mechanics, of nurses, and of ironworkers. He \n     recognizes that working Americans aren't just looking for \n     handouts from their government--they're looking for a leg up, \n     to help them ensure that their children have every \n     opportunity to succeed, and they're looking for a safety net, \n     to help them provide for their families during the most \n     difficult times.\n       Senator Kennedy's legislative record reflects those \n     principles, and that is why he has been the single most \n     effective advocate for working Americans in our time.\n       First and foremost amongst Senator Kennedy's legislative \n     achievements is his ongoing fight for workers' rights and \n     protections. One of the most basic principles upon which our \n     nation was founded was fairness, and Ted Kennedy has done \n     everything he can to promote that in the workplace.\n       He has fought successfully to improve workplace safety and \n     conditions, and continues to fight for ergonomics standards \n     today. He has fought successfully to raise the minimum wage, \n     and lift working families above the poverty line. \n     Additionally, he has stood on the lines with workers across \n     the state to demand a fair wage for their work. His \n     reputation as a trusted negotiator with both workers and \n     management has allowed Senator Kennedy to quiet disputes and \n     bring all sides to the table for a fair and equitable \n     resolution during sometimes hostile labor disputes. In 1999, \n     he intervened in the nurses strike at St. Vincent's Hospital \n     in Worcester, and all sides came out winners when the nurses \n     returned to work with new restrictions on mandatory overtime \n     which improved the safety and quality of care for patients.\n       Senator Kennedy has fought to ensure that all workers are \n     paid an equitable wage, regardless of sex, race, or sexual \n     orientation. he fought successfully for passage of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which allows workers to take \n     unpaid leave to care for members of their family when they \n     are ill.\n       Senator Kennedy believes in the power of education, and \n     knows that it is essential to providing children and adults \n     alike with the opportunity to succeed. In today's \n     marketplace, employers require a higher level of skill and \n     training than ever before. That is why Senator Kennedy's \n     efforts to expand opportunities for job training centers and \n     career counseling services have had such an impact for \n     workers who have been laid off, or who are looking to take \n     the next step in their careers.\n       In this time of economic recession, more and more workers \n     are laid off and need a temporary boost to help them continue \n     to provide for their families. It is in times like these when \n     Senator Kennedy's most significant impact becomes clear. \n     Because of his work in championing benefits for the \n     unemployed, and in providing transitional assistance to \n     workers, millions of Americans have the ability to take the \n     time to retrain themselves, and re-enter the workforce \n     sooner. And, because of his work to extend health care \n     coverage to those who have recently lost their jobs, the \n     health and safety of their children need not be put at risk \n     while they're looking for a new job.\n       Senator Kennedy's efforts to protect and support working \n     Americans have been felt far and wide. As a former union \n     president and head of a working family, I cannot express how \n     grateful I am to him for his courage, his voice and for his \n     support. I wish Senator Kennedy all the best on the occasion \n     of his 70th birthday, and hope for all Americans, that he \n     will continue to serve this nation for many decades to come.\n\n\n               remarks by representative james mc govern\n\n       I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion of \n     Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy. As many Members of the \n     House know, the Senator is celebrating his 70th birthday this \n     year.\n       For most of those 70 years, Senator Kennedy has been a \n     voice for the voiceless, a champion of working families, a \n     force for peace and justice at home and around the world.\n       It is nearly impossible to find a major piece of domestic \n     legislation over the past two generations that has not been \n     shaped by the Senator's drive, courage, tenacity and \n     collegiality.\n       From making health care more affordable to raising the \n     minimum wage; from civil rights for all Americans to fair and \n     compassionate treatment of immigrants; from Biafra to \n     Bangladesh to Belfast--Senator Kennedy has led the charge.\n       But though he has reached the pinnacles of power, Senator \n     Kennedy has never forgotten the people of Massachusetts who \n     have elected him over and over again. One only needs to drive \n     through the 3rd Congressional District to see his handiwork. \n     Dozens of economic development projects simply would not have \n     happened without him.\n       The Kennedy name, of course, is synonymous with service in \n     Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy not only survived almost \n     unimaginable personal tragedy, he persevered. He persevered \n     because for him, public service is not a job--it is a \n     calling, a mission, a vocation.\n       And on a more personal level, Senator Kennedy has been an \n     amazingly generous friend to me and my family. I have learned \n     a tremendous amount from him, and I am honored to call him a \n     colleague.\n       I know that all of my colleagues in the House join me in \n     wishing Senator Ted Kennedy a very happy 70th birthday, and \n     many more happy birthdays to come.\n\n\n                 remarks by representative marty meehan\n\n       I rise to honor Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Senator Kennedy \n     celebrated his 70th birthday on Friday, February 22, 2002.\n       For nearly 40 years, Senator Kennedy has dedicated his \n     energies and remarkable abilities to making our communities, \n     our Commonwealth, and our nation a better place to live.\n       The fruits of his efforts are evident throughout \n     Massachusetts' Fifth Congressional District. From the \n     redevelopment of the former Ft. Devens military base to the \n     preservation of the Watt Farm in Harvard, from the \n     construction of a new bus operations and maintenance facility \n     in Lowell to the renovation of the Marlborough Hospital's \n     Emergency Department, from the Merrimack Valley to the \n     Metrowest area, Senator Kennedy has delivered for the \n     residents of the Fifth District.\n       Senator Kennedy's record of accomplishment doesn't end at \n     the borders of the Fifth District or even the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts. In fact, it just begins. On every important \n     fight waged for the working families of our nation, Senator \n     Kennedy has been our leader.\n       He has fought tirelessly for civil rights on the home front \n     and human rights around the globe. He has worked to improve \n     our public schools, to make college more affordable, and to \n     give workers the resources they need to upgrade their skills. \n     He has waged an endless battle to make work pay by pushing \n     for an increase in the minimum wage. And his leadership on \n     health care has made health insurance a reality for the \n     poorest children of our nation and focused us all on the need \n     for meaningful managed care reform. And I believe that when \n     Congress passes legislation to create a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit for seniors, we will have Senator Kennedy to \n     thank for that.\n       On July 15th, 1960, Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy issued \n     a challenge to a generation of young Americans. ``The New \n     Frontier of which I speak,'' he said, ``is not a set of \n     promises. It is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I \n     intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask \n     of them.''\n       On June 6, 1966, Senator Robert Francis Kennedy spoke in \n     Capetown, South Africa about the nature of the challenge his \n     older brother issued our nation: ``Few will have the \n     greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change \n     a small portion of events, and in the total of those acts \n     will be written the history of the generation . . . It is \n     from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human \n     history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an \n     ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out \n     against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and \n     crossing each other from a million different centers of \n     energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can \n     sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and \n     resistance.''\n       That call to service, to courage, to secure universal \n     justice, inspired generations of Americans to change the \n     world around them--including the oldest son of a working-\n     class family on 22 London Street in ``the Acre'' section of \n     Lowell.\n       Along with millions of Americans, my ideals, my values, and \n     my vision for a great and just America were inspired by \n     Senator Kennedy's brothers. I serve in Congress today--and \n     strive to make a difference--because of the Kennedy family.\n       While his brothers continue to inspire us all, it is \n     Senator Kennedy's endless determination, boundless \n     compassion, selfless commitment, and knowledge about how to \n     get things done, that has made their vision a reality. When \n     the history books are written, it is certain that the career \n     of Senator Edward M. Kennedy will stand as one of the most \n     productive and important of all time.\n       Senator, you are one of Massachusetts' greatest treasures. \n     Happy 70th Birthday, and thank you for 40 years of service in \n     the United States Senate.\n\n\n               REMARKS BY REPRESENTATIVE RICHARD E. NEAL\n\n       Twenty two years ago, at a caucus in the Springfield Civic \n     Center, I was elected as a delegate to the Democratic \n     National Convention in New York in support of a candidate for \n     president who had a bold vision for our country. He stood for \n     economic and social justice, affordable health care and \n     improving the quality of education for all. And while that \n     campaign in 1980 proved to be unsuccessful, his message \n     inspired the hearts and minds of countless Americans who were \n     dedicated to making a difference in the lives of others. That \n     candidate's name was Edward M. Kennedy.\n       I share this piece of personal history because Friday was \n     Senator Kennedy's 70th birthday. It also represented the 40th \n     anniversary of his election to the United States Senate. It \n     has been a career of triumph and tragedy, victory and \n     setback. But through it all Ted Kennedy has persevered, \n     continuing to be a strong and steady voice for working \n     families and the less fortunate. At this point in his \n     extraordinary life, he has become a true statesman of the \n     Democratic Party, passionately articulating its values and \n     beliefs to a national constituency.\n       He has displayed that same conviction in his tireless \n     efforts to bring peace and reconciliation to the island of \n     Ireland. While\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\n     many would point to the early 1990's as the beginning of \n     America's involvement in this bitter conflict, Kennedy's \n     interest goes back to the early 1970's. The contribution he \n     and his family have made to the current success of the peace \n     process simply cannot be overstated.\n       But there is another side to Ted Kennedy that I have always \n     found even more appealing. It is one of the primary reasons \n     why I have been such a steadfast and loyal supporter for so \n     many years. And it is what the people of this state have \n     known since his first election in 1962. If it helps people in \n     Massachusetts, no issue is too small or insignificant for \n     Senator Kennedy to embrace and lead the charge. Here is one \n     example.\n       Soon after my election to Congress, Speaker Tom Foley \n     appointed me to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee \n     which has jurisdiction over health related matters. One of my \n     first challenges was a complex Medicare reimbursement issue \n     designed to help Mercy Hospital in Springfield. At my \n     request, Ted Kennedy took up the fight in the Senate and made \n     it a top priority.\n       As the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education and Labor \n     Committee, he was the principal architect for health care \n     reform in the nation. His thoughts on this critical issue \n     lead the network news each night. But unlike most \n     politicians, Kennedy's best work often times goes unseen. He \n     fought long and hard behind the scenes to ensure that the \n     concerns of Mercy Hospital were included in the overall \n     Medicare bill. Throughout this long process, Ted Kennedy \n     displayed his trademark human touch.\n       I can vividly recall him taking time to meet with Sister \n     Mary Caritas, then President of Mercy Hospital, to hear her \n     concerns about the economic impact of this proposal. In the \n     middle of this important national debate, he never forgot the \n     people back home. He took her phone calls personally, and \n     never missed an opportunity to update her on the progress of \n     this technical issue.\n       Not surprisingly, the proposed change to the Medicare \n     program became law and Mercy Hospital was helped a great \n     deal. Even now, many years later, he still asks me in that \n     distinctive voice: ``Richie, how is Sister Caritas?''\n       And this example is not unlike the way he has worked on new \n     projects like Springfield's Union Station, the Federal \n     Courthouse in Springfield, the Pioneer Valley Life Sciences \n     Initiative and countless others across the Second District \n     and beyond.\n       Much has been written about the senior Senator from \n     Massachusetts over the years. As someone who was with him as \n     recently as last week, it is clear that he has not lost the \n     boundless enthusiasm he brings to the job. In a meeting about \n     airport security in my office, he was as energetic and \n     focused as the candidate that I endorsed back in 1980.\n       Senator Kennedy may be known nationally as one the most \n     effective legislators in the history of the United States \n     Senate. He has the well deserved title of patriarch of one of \n     America's most distinguished families. In my 25 years of \n     public service, I think of him simply as one of the best \n     friends the people of western Massachusetts ever had.\n       Happy Birthday Teddy.\n\n\n                remarks by representative john w. olver\n\n       I would like to salute Senator Edward M. Kennedy, on the \n     occasion of his 70th birthday and his 40th year of service in \n     the United States Senate.\n       Senator Kennedy has made it his life's mission to work on \n     behalf of those who are too often overlooked: children, the \n     elderly, individuals with disabilities, the poor and the \n     workers of this nation. From the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act to increases in the federal minimum wage to his advocacy \n     for those infected with HIV and AIDS, Senator Kennedy has led \n     the fight to provide equal opportunities and resources for \n     everyone in America.\n       When I look at the congressional district that I represent, \n     I see Senator Kennedy's influence everywhere. He has helped \n     to build a thriving arts community in Berkshire County, \n     provided critical support for biotechnology investment in the \n     Pioneer Valley, and successfully lobbied for urban \n     redevelopment funding in north Worcester County. Thanks to \n     Senator Kennedy's vision, there are five community health \n     centers serving the uninsured and the underinsured in my \n     district.\n       The list of Senator Kennedy's accomplishments, both in \n     Massachusetts and across the country, goes on and on. His \n     effectiveness as a legislator is unparalleled, and his \n     tireless work over the last forty years is an inspiration to \n     all of us. I feel honored to have worked with Senator Kennedy \n     for the last decade, and I congratulate him on all of his \n     remarkable achievements.\n\n\n               remarks by representative john f. tierney\n\n       I am proud to honor Senator Edward M. Kennedy on the \n     occasion of his 70th birthday. I am pleased to join my \n     colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation in paying tribute \n     to our friend, our leader, our inspiration as he reaches this \n     important milestone in his remarkable life.\n       Senatory Kennedy has accomplished so much for our state and \n     our nation over these past forty years that it is difficult \n     to distill all of his work on behalf of American families \n     into just a few words. He has been, and continues to be, a \n     champion of quality health care for all Americans, a true \n     believer in public education and a fervent advocate of living \n     wages for working people in this country. For all of those \n     reasons and more he enjoys the respect and affection of \n     millions of people all across the country.\n       Two of Senator Kennedy's accomplishments, however, have had \n     particular relevance to my constituents in the Sixth District \n     of Massachusetts: First, he was the primary sponsor of \n     legislation that created the Essex National Heritage \n     Commission, an extraordinary public-private partnership which \n     continues to excel in its mission of educating \n     schoolchildren, residents and visitors alike on the wonderful \n     maritime, industrial and cultural history of our region in \n     the northeastern part of Massachusetts. His continuing \n     advocacy ensures that the rich heritage of the 34 diverse \n     communities that comprise the Essex National Heritage Area \n     will be preserved and passed along to future generations.\n       Senator Kennedy has also been a tireless advocate on behalf \n     of the thousands of Massachusetts families for whom \n     commercial fishing has been both a livelihood and a way of \n     life for almost 400 years. For four decades Senator Kennedy \n     has stood shoulder to shoulder with those families. Through \n     good times and bad, through declining stocks and \n     proliferating regulations, through devastating natural \n     disasters and deep personal losses, he has been a source of \n     strength and hope. Angela Sanfilippo, longtime president of \n     the Gloucester Fisherman's Wives Association, said it quite \n     simply in her birthday tribute to Senator Kennedy in the \n     February 22 edition of the Gloucester Daily Times: ``No one \n     has been more of a friend to us than U.S. Senator Edward \n     Kennedy.''\n       Happy Birthday, Senator. I look forward to serving with you \n     for many years to come.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield such time as the Senator from Nevada might use and \nthen the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Kennedy family has a long, proud, and \nenduring legacy of public service. Senator Kennedy's father, Joseph, \nserved as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and we all know how he \nencouraged his children to pursue public service, and public service \nthey pursued.\n  John Kennedy, of course, became a Senator and then President. Robert \nKennedy served as Attorney General and then as a Senator. Today, \nyounger generations of the family are adding to this record by holding \npublic office and doing noble work in their communities.\n  The Kennedys have made an impact on me. In my office across the hall, \nI have a letter I received from President John F. Kennedy--he was a \nSenator who had just been elected President--congratulating me for \nforming the first Young Democratic organization in the history of Utah \nState University.\n  I never met President Kennedy, but I can remember when I worked here \nas a policeman on Capitol Hill driving home by the White House, looking \nout on the lawn and seeing Macaroni, Caroline's horse. I can remember \nwhen I was a Capitol Policeman and President Kennedy had been \nassassinated. I, of course, knew all the shortcuts through this \nCapitol, and I took them and walked past his casket.\n  Now, many years later, in the same office that I talked about a \nminute ago, there is a plaque on the wall announcing that John Kennedy \noccupied the office from July 13, 1960, when he was nominated for \nPresident, until his inauguration in January of 1961. Every day I see \nthat big bronze plaque. Every day I think of President Kennedy.\n  Robert Kennedy inspired me and millions of young people in my \ngeneration who admired his commitment to helping the poor and \ndisenfranchised and believed we could make a difference. One of my \nfavorite stories about Robert Kennedy recalls a meeting he had with a \nbunch of affluent people. After outlining his vision for our country, \nRobert Kennedy was asked: Who is going to pay for this? Senator Kennedy \ndid not pause a second. He said: You are going to pay for it. That is \nintegrity. That is what the Kennedys have brought to America.\n  As we recognize these contributions, let us also acknowledge the \nKennedy family has made tremendous personal sacrifices for our country. \nThree brothers lost their lives serving our country. Joseph, Jr., was \nkilled in a plane crash while on a dangerous volunteer mission over \nEurope during World War II. He was killed at the age of 29. President \nJohn Kennedy was assassinated at the age of 46. Robert Kennedy was \nassassinated at the age of 42. Of course, sister Kathleen died in a \nplane crash at the age of 28. The Kennedys have been beset by tragedy \nplayed out on the public stage perhaps as no other American family.\n  My first memory of Senator Ted Kennedy dates back to when I was on \nvacation years ago with my best friend\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\nwatching television and Robert Kennedy's funeral was being broadcast. I \ncan remember clearly Ted Kennedy's eulogy. It is something I will never \nforget. One of my sons this past Christmas gave me a compact disc of \nfamous speeches. There were not that many famous speeches on this CD, \nperhaps 20, but one on that CD was the remarks Senator Kennedy gave at \nhis brother Robert's funeral.\n  Over the years, Ted Kennedy has given many great speeches, powerful, \nmoving speeches, but even more significant than his skills as an orator \nis that he has been a voice for those without power. This powerful man \nhas been a voice for those without power and a champion of social \njustice for all Americans.\n\n  As the most prominent surviving member of this great family, it would \nhave been easy, as Senator Kerry and Senator Daschle have both \nmentioned, for him to have become discouraged and to give in to fear of \nbeing a target for more violence. We all would have understood if he \nhad decided to leave the limelight, to withdraw, but he accepted the \nburden and embraced the responsibilities of being a Kennedy, of being \nan American. He has persevered and continues to serve. His \ncontributions are significant, and America is a better place as a \nresult of his contributions.\n  Senator Kennedy has served our Nation for almost 40 years in the \nSenate. He was elected in 1962 to fill the seat of his brother, John F. \nKennedy, who had been elected President. During more than six terms in \nthe Senate, he has accomplished so much. In particular, he has led the \neffort to bring quality health care to all Americans. He sponsored and \nsucceeded in getting passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights that we \nwant to finalize.\n  Senator Kennedy has been involved in so many different aspects of \neducation. He played a key role in enacting education reform \nlegislation, as Senator Daschle said, to help students, to help \nteachers to, in effect, improve the quality of our Nation's schools and \nhold them accountable.\n  He has also taken to the barricades on labor issues, fighting on \nbehalf of America's working men and women. There is no greater hero in \nthe America union movement than Ted Kennedy. He has forcefully \nadvocated for a higher minimum wage many times, and he is now a leading \nproponent for helping workers, especially nurses, to eliminate \nmandatory overtime.\n  We have worked together on some issues since I have been in the \nSenate, issues that maybe he did not have a stake in or at least people \ndid not think so; for example, what should we do about people who have \nrisked their health and even sacrificed their lives to win the Cold \nWar. He became involved in this and helped pass legislation to make \nsure those people who were injured in the Cold War were also recognized \nand compensated. It could not have been done without him.\n\n  Certainly Senator Kennedy has a distinguished record of legislative \naccomplishments, but he has not rested on his laurels. He continues \nevery day to work hard to continue to have a positive impact.\n  I express publicly my gratitude for his help. Senator Kennedy was a \nlegend when I got here. I was so impressed with Senator Kennedy always \nasking: Do you want to go first? Do you want your name first on the \nlegislation? Do you want to speak first?\n  He is a modest man. I will always remember how good he has been to \nme, his continued willingness to set aside personal fame--glory, \nreally, that he already has--and instead lead the charge for us or do \nwhatever is necessary for the good of the team. He has been helpful and \ninspirational to Senator Daschle and Harry Reid. It is easy to say, but \nI can testify to this: He always cares about his Nation first.\n  I thank you again, Ted, for your many contributions and years of \nservice. I wish to thank you and your lovely wife Vicki. I wish you \nboth Godspeed. May you have many more birthday parties such as this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield such time as he will use to the \nSenator from Illinois. I thank him again for this courtesy. If my \ncolleagues would allow, I would like to go to the other side of the \naisle for a moment and come back to Senator Schumer, Senator Clinton, \nand Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 35 years ago as a college student I \nwas seated in this Senate gallery because there was a historic event \nabout to take place. Senator Robert Kennedy, of New York, was to \nannounce a very important statement about the Vietnam war. I sat there \nlate into the evening waiting for this moment and looked down from that \ngallery to see Senator Robert Kennedy come to the floor with his \nbrother, Senator Ted Kennedy. I watched this speech. I listened to \nevery word of it. It had such an impact on me, as I am sure it did on \nmany people across America, these two brothers continuing to serve this \ncountry after their brother, the former President, had lost his life, \ncontinuing to be in the midst of the arena for every important issue. I \nam sure there were many reasons for my being here today, but that \nexperience, watching Senators Bob and Ted Kennedy, was part of that \nprocess of learning and dedicating your life.\n  Ted Kennedy was born to public life. He came to Washington as part of \na family as storied as the John Adams family. He was elected at age 30. \nMany of his critics dismissed him. They believed he was only \ncapitalizing on the most fabled democratic name in the latter half of \nthe last century. Over his Senate career, Ted Kennedy has proven his \ncritics wrong. He stands today as a Senator who was first among equals. \nMany matters come before the Senate. Many issues are debated and voted \non, but you can be certain that every issue which touches the hearts of \nthe American people will bring Teddy Kennedy to the floor, to his feet, \nand to the center of the debate.\n\n  Hubert Humphrey said: You can judge the government by the care it \ngives to those in the dawn of life, our children, those in the twilight \nof life, our elderly, and those in the shadows of life, the disabled \nand the dispossessed.\n  I might add, you can judge the heart of a Senator by his commitment \nto these same voices of needy citizens in America.\n  By that standard, Ted Kennedy's career in the Senate will be measured \nas one of the best. For four decades, hundreds of Senators have come \nand gone, thousands of matters of national importance have been \nconsidered. But there has been one constant. Whether the issue was \ncivil rights or human rights, education, health care for children, \nmental health, the rights of working people, food for our poor and the \npoor of the world, there was one man who could always be counted on to \nmake the fight: Ted Kennedy--on civil rights, on Medicare, on Americans \nwith disabilities.\n  Ted Kennedy has been quite a spokesman and champion throughout his \ncareer for the elderly. Little did he realize that his passion for \nsenior citizens would eventually become a conflict of interest, as he \nnow qualifies for both Social Security and Medicare. But that has not \ndeterred him. He takes to this floor with the charm of the Irish and \nthe tenacity of a bulldog. He can bring us together to think, to laugh, \nto weep, to reflect on the meaning of public life and the meaning of \nlife itself.\n  In many of my campaigns in downstate Illinois as a Congressman and as \na candidate for the Senate, my opponent would go to some well-paid \npollster who would say: What you want to do is say that this Durbin \nvotes a lot like Ted Kennedy.\n  Well, I have never shied away from that accusation. I welcome it \nbecause time and again he has stood for the right causes and for the \nright reasons. I am honored to serve with Ted Kennedy. I am honored to \ncount him as my friend and ally in so many important fights. He has \nmade this Senate and this Nation a better place to serve and live. Ted \nKennedy is the people's Senator.\n  Happy birthday, Ted.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am reminded of a time when I was \nstanding in the Republican cloakroom and someone announced that another \nSenator was having a 70th birthday. Senator Strom Thurmond said: Oh, to \nbe 70 again. I say the same thing to my friend from Massachusetts \ntoday.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have had a friendship that goes back many \nyears,\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nsome 34 years. In January or February of 1969, Senator Kennedy decided \nto take a trip to my State to look into the plight of the Alaskan \nNative people, particularly with regard to education and health \nconditions. We traveled there to small villages from the west coast \ninto the north country, and we had a good trip. We formed a bond then \nthat, despite our differences in the last 34 years--and we have had \ndifferences--we have never had any disagreements. And I will tell the \nSenate why.\n  At one of these small villages we were walking around, it was really \nquite cold. The snow was hard packed on the ground in this small \nvillage. Suddenly, out of a door of a little cabin, a young boy, little \nboy, darted. He just had a top on, as a matter of fact. He somehow or \nother had lost his diapers or whatever he had on the bottom. Senator \nKennedy and I saw that. Ted, with one hand, reached down and scooped \nhim up and with the other hand unzipped his parka and stuffed that kid \nin the parka, and the three of us walked around that village until the \ntwo of us found out where he lived.\n  Ted may not remember, but when we went into that little cabin and \npresented the mother with the boy, there on the wall was a picture of \nhis brother Jack. It was a very interesting day. We went on to other \nplaces.\n  I am here today to wish my friend happy birthday, but also to tell \nhim I have cherished that bond, that friendship. Any man who \nunderstands children that way is a friend of mine. We have worked for \nchildren, for preschoolers, for education, for the health and welfare \nreform of the Native people. They have met him, and they still have \ngreat fondness and love for the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Happy birthday, Ted. Best wishes to you and Vicki. I look forward to \nyou one of these days saying: Oh, to be 70 again.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have admired Ted Kennedy for as long as \nI can remember--as a citizen watching his early days in the Senate, his \nleadership against the Vietnam war and for civil rights, and then when \nI became a Congressman and served on the Judiciary Committee and we \nworked on different pieces of legislation together. I was utterly \namazed at this man. He had the energy and enthusiasm and high spirits \nof a freshman, even though he had been here for 25 years, with the \nwisdom and experience and substantive expertise of a veteran.\n  But, my colleagues--and I am sure every one of you has experienced \nthis--the closer you get, the better Ted Kennedy looks. In the Senate \nhe is just, as my daughters would say, awesome.\n  His compassion drives the man--he cares. This is not just a game for \nhim. This is not just something to go home and talk to the voters \nabout. Every atom of his body breathes help for those who need help, \nand fairness, and having our country live up to its ideals.\n  Every one of us have seen him here in the Senate early in the \nmorning, hard at work going over a speech he was going to give. It is \nno accident that he is the best speaker in the place. He has the \nnatural talent, but then he works at it on top of that.\n  His dedication to the body--I cannot thank Ted enough for the \nguidance he has given me. I need a heck of a lot of it, but we are \nworking on it, and he has provided it better than anybody else.\n  The man, as one of my colleagues said--I think it was the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts--is the lion of the Senate. We admire him; we are \ngrateful for him; we love him. Ted, all of us wish you many more years \nto keep on doing what you have been doing, for us and for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from New York. In deference to the \nfact that she needs to preside in a few minutes, I recognize the \nSenator from Michigan and then the Senator from New York, the junior \nSenator, and then we will go to the other side of the aisle again. I \nyield 2 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend allowing me to \nspeak at this time because of the need for me to preside in a moment.\n  I could not let this time go by without joining my colleagues in \nsaying happy birthday and how I have such respect and admiration for a \ngentleman who is becoming a wonderful friend. I thank him for that.\n  People ask me what is the biggest surprise or what I am most \nimpressed about after a year in the Senate. I always indicate how \nimpressed I am with my colleagues and their hard work, how much they \ncare, and the intelligence that people bring to the job. I say the \nperson I have been most impressed with--and, frankly, surprised about--\nis Senator Kennedy. Not because of his intelligence; we know his \nintelligence. We know he stands up for those who need a voice and for \nprinciple. He is a strong advocate and a wonderful speaker.\n  But what has been a wonderful surprise to me is that this gentleman, \nwho could, essentially, sit in the Senate and have the enjoyment of \nknowing that people recognize his stature, who could speak when he \nwould like or be involved in such legislation as he would like, is a \nSenator who, when the door is closed, is in the room counting the \nvotes, working hard on the nitty-gritty that has to be done beyond the \nglare of the cameras.\n  I have been so impressed with Senator Kennedy's willingness to be in \nthat room. I will never forget, when we were meeting with advocates \nabout the Patients' Bill of Rights; Senator Kennedy was there. He stays \nthere, doing what needs to be done, calling the meeting, putting it \ntogether, talking about amendments, negotiating with people--he does \nthe hard work of legislating. This person whom we know and respect and \nwho comes from such a legendary family is there every minute, getting \nthe job done.\n  I have learned so much in the last year and have been so impressed \nwith the wonderful compassion and leadership this man brings to us.\n  I had an opportunity this weekend to see a movie a lot of people are \nseeing right now, ``John Q,'' a wonderful performance by Denzel \nWashington. I sat there being enraged and yet feeling a great sense of \nurgency that many of us experience about health care. But I walked away \nthinking: Every day, John Q has a fighter for him in the Senate named \nSenator Ted Kennedy. It is because of this gentleman, whom we are \ncelebrating today and thanking today, that I know we are going to be \nable to finally make sure that those represented by the movie ``John \nQ'' will get the health care they need.\n  Thank you and happy birthday.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am grateful to the Senator for her remarks, and I \nrecognize the Senator from New York for such time as she consumes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nnot only for yielding that time but also for giving us this opportunity \nto come to the floor and express our appreciation and gratitude to our \ncolleague.\n  There have been a lot of wonderful words already spoken. There will \nbe many more this afternoon and included in the Record. I think that \nall goes to the point that each of us, Republican and Democrat alike, \nMember of the Senate or the House, citizen of Massachusetts, New York, \nor any State in our Union, shares a common bond of pride in the work \nSenator Kennedy has done over a lifetime.\n  I remember the first time I saw him in action, it was 1978, it was \nthe Democratic Party's so-called midterm convention in Memphis, TN. Ted \nKennedy had come to appear on a panel about health care. The fire and \nthe passion and the extraordinary knowledge he displayed 25 years ago \non that issue is just as prominent in his public pronouncements and \nactions today.\n  Twenty-five years ago he was making the case that, in a country as \nrich as ours, every single citizen should as a matter of right be \nentitled to quality, affordable health care. He laid out ideas then \nwhich he has worked on steadily in the years since.\n  I appreciate the extraordinary guidance and support he gave to me \nwhen I tackled the rather awesome task of working on health care, an \nissue that has certainly brought a lot of humility to my life. In the \nwork that I did, it was Senator Kennedy who understood it intuitively, \nwho absolutely mastered every nuance, and was ready to offer counsel \nand advice about how we should go forward. As everyone knows, that \nwasn't a successful effort. But in\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nsuch a typical fashion that really marks his Senate career, he didn't \nwaste any time regretting what was not done. He immediately got to work \nabout what could be done. As a result, we had the Kennedy-Kassebaum \nbill. We had the great partnership between Senator Kennedy and his \ncolleague and friend, Senator Hatch, on the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Despite the fact that the overall goal could not be achieved, \nmany people were helped because, along the way, Senator Kennedy helped \nto craft legislative solutions to human problems.\n  You can look at the landscape of this country and realize that not \njust in his beloved home State of Massachusetts but in my State of New \nYork and all the way across the country, people have been helped to get \na better wage for the day's work they do, to get access to health care, \nand most recently, with the triumph of his leadership on the Leave No \nChild Behind Act, to look forward to a better public education.\n  There is much that can be said about Senator Kennedy's legislative \nprowess and career. What I want to remark on is his personal interest \nin all of his colleagues, the staff who work here, the people who keep \nthis place going. A very heartwarming and common sight is that of the \nSenator walking down the hallway with his faithful companion, Splash, \nthe most intelligent, creative, energetic dog who has ever walked the \nhalls of the Capitol or probably anywhere else in our country, and to \nsee him waving or saying hello to people, no matter what job they are \ndoing, no matter who they are--because he is no respecter of the \nboundaries that sometimes separate Senators from everyone else. He came \nto do a job 40 years ago. He is just as actively engaged in the pursuit \nof the goals that he not only holds near to his heart but which \nrepresent the best of our country.\n  I was honored to have the Senator campaign for me in my election to \nthe Senate. One memorable day, he and Caroline and his redoubtable \nfather-in-law, Judge Reggie, and I got into a small plane and made our \nway from New York City to Buffalo to Albany. Along the way he warmed up \nthe crowds we brought him to meet. One particular moment that I \nappreciated was how he said he was proud to be in my company because \nnow people were sending out letters against both of us--not just him. I \nwas proud to be in his company, as I am every single day proud to serve \nwith him.\n\n  We rise today to pay tribute to an extraordinary leader and an \nabsolutely unparalleled Member of this body, a Senator for all time--\nnot just this time--and a friend and colleague to all of us.\n  Thank you. Happy birthday, and Godspeed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York for her \nspirited and wonderful comments about our colleague.\n  I yield the Senator from Maryland 4 minutes and the Senator from Utah \n6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues today in paying tribute to Senator Kennedy on the occasion \nof his 70th birthday.\n  A champion of working people, Senator Kennedy has clearly understood, \nfrom the very beginning of his tenure in the Senate, the importance of \na meaningful job in the lives of our citizens. He has consistently \nworked for programs that promote full employment, and that enable \nAmericans to support their families. Senator Kennedy has championed \ntraining programs, summer job programs, and the Summer-to-Work \nOpportunities Act--all designed to enhance the skills of our citizens. \nHe has been our most eloquent advocate for the collective bargaining \nrights of American workers, rights that ensure that our workers are \namong the best trained, the best paid, and the most productive in the \nworld. And, Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with Senator Kennedy \nas he continues to lead the effort for an increase in the minimum wage, \nwhich holds out the promise of a decent living to men and women who, \nthrough hard work, seek to climb the ladder of opportunity.\n  If there is any hallmark of Senator Kennedy's career, I think it is \nhis drive for the full participation in American life for all of our \ncitizens. He has distinguished himself as a champion of civil rights \nand of the neediest and most vulnerable members of our society, who \noften are without a voice in Government. For 40 years in the U.S. \nSenate, he has spoken for working Americans, for the unemployed, for \nthe sick, for the elderly, and for young people.\n  The Women and Infants Program, the Child Nutrition Program, Head \nStart, and so many education programs have Ted Kennedy's imprimatur \nupon them. He has led the successful drive for passage of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act. Today, Senator Kennedy is fighting for a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights and for a prescription drug benefit \nfor our senior citizens. One could go on and on enumerating all of \nthese programs.\n  I want to add one dimension to this. What distinguishes Senator \nKennedy the most in the Senate is his tireless advocacy of the causes \nto which he is committed. He is a tenacious fighter on the floor of the \nSenate, in the committee room, and behind the scenes. He tackles very \ndifficult issues with courage and commitment. Perhaps most importantly, \nhe has maintained a focus on using our Nation's Government as a tool \nfor good in the lives of all Americans, and as an example for the \nentire world.\n  Senator Kennedy has seen history made, and he has made history. It is \nhard to imagine a lifetime of service that has meant more to the \ncitizens of Massachusetts and, indeed, to the people of America. In \nevery fight he has waged to make our Nation more productive, more \ncompassionate, more open to participation, more fair and equitable to \nall its citizens, he has always appealed to the best in us all.\n  It is an honor to be his colleague in the Senate, and to be his \nfriend. It is with great pleasure that I join with my colleagues in \nextending best wishes and congratulations on his 70th birthday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, believe it or not, one of the reasons I \nwanted to run for the Senate 26 years ago was to get the modern-day \nface of liberalism, Senator Ted Kennedy, out of office.\n  (Laughter).\n  As the past 26 years have amply indicated, I have failed. And I have \ncome to appreciate that the country is better for it.\n  In many ways, Senator Kennedy stands for all that my party and my \nstate reject so vehemently:\n  An unabashed reliance on government as the problem-solver of first \nresort;\n  A belief that the Federal coffers can, and must, support those in \nneed, regardless of private, State and local resources;\n  And, indeed a devotion to extending the Federal arm across this great \nNation--whenever, whatever--the concept of Federalism aside.\n  I know full well what President Bush means when he says the fellas at \nthe coffee shop in Crawford find it hard to believe that Senator \nKennedy has some points in his favor.\n  But I have grown to understand, and appreciate, my Massachusetts \ncolleague, for the tremendous passion and dedication he brings to the \njob. I have come to respect his tremendous love for our great country \nand its people.\n  I have come to admire his patriotism and his devotion to national \nservice, that great tradition which is the hallmark of the Kennedy \nclan.\n  And I have grown to recognize that despite our differences on almost \nevery issue, working together, we could find a common ground--that \nspace in the middle from which great legislation is born.\n  Some of my most revered accomplishments are Hatch-Kennedy or Kennedy-\nHatch collaborations.\n  It is a mark of Ted's greatness that he does not care who gets the \ncredit, as long as the job gets done.\n  Starting with our first bill together, the Women in Science \nlegislation in 1978, Senator Kennedy and I have worked together to \nenact legislation that is helping virtually millions of people in this \nnation.\n  I am thinking also of all the critical bills we have enacted \ntogether:\n  The first AIDS research bill;\n  The first AIDS services bill, the Ryan White Care Act; and, the \norphan drug\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\nbill, and home health care. You could go on and on.\n  I am thinking of the Child Health Insurance Program, or ``CHIP,'' \nwhich now is providing health care to almost five million children who \ndidn't have it just a few short years ago--children of the working poor \nwho worked hard but didn't have enough money to pay for health \ninsurance for their kids. It could not have happened but for Ted \nKennedy.\n  And I am also thinking of the many bills we worked on so diligently, \nsuch as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the downwinders \nlegislation that helps so many Utahns in the inner-mountain West, and \nwhich Senator Kennedy helped make possible, and the Job Training \nPartnership Act.\n  Of course, I am also thinking of the religious liberties bills we \nhave put through together, each of us motivated by our strong faith and \nlove of the Lord.\n  But let me hasten to add that sometimes it is just not possible for \nus to find middle ground. For every bill we have promoted together, for \nevery issue on which we have found a common ground, there is another \nissue on which we have fought tooth and nail.\n  Indeed, at times, we have both won and lost.\n  Many times, my side carried. I am thinking back to our earliest fight \nover labor law reform when I first came to the Congress.\n  I am thinking of the battles we had over minimum wage increases and, \nwith due deference to the Senator from New York, over the Clintons' \nHealth Security Act.\n  But to be fair, many times Senator Kennedy's side carried the day.\n  There are numerous provisions in Federal employment law, in health \ncare policy, and despite the fact that he is not on the Finance \nCommittee, sometimes even in the Tax Code, that are directly \nattributable to Senator Kennedy's skills and persistence.\n  It is no secret that many, if not most, of my constituents in Utah \ndisagree with Senator Kennedy on almost every issue.\n  I will never forget a letter I got from one of my constituents many, \nmany years ago. From a senior citizen in Southern Utah, a very \nconservative part of the state.\n  She said,\n\n       Senator Hatch, when we heard you might run for office, we \n     supported you. When you actually ran for office, we voted for \n     you. And when we heard you were friends with Senator Kennedy, \n     we prayed for you!\n\n  (Laughter).\n  Many of my constituents question how I can be such close friends with \na man whose principles vary in so many ways from those of most Utahans.\n  This is what I tell them. In my opinion--and I think I am an \nauthority on this subject--Ted Kennedy is one of the most effective, if \nnot the most effective, legislators in this country. He never quits \nuntil he gets the job done. And I, for one, admire that. When he is \nwith you, there is no more solid ally. And when he is against you, \nthere is no more fierce opponent.\n  We all have to recognize that despite Senator Kennedy's position on \nany particular issue, he is a patriot in every sense of the word. Ted \nKennedy, in the fine Kennedy tradition, is truly motivated by public \nservice, and we all owe him a debt of gratitude for that.\n  And what I did not understand in 1976, but what I know so well now, \nis that Ted Kennedy is willing to come to the middle to get the job \ndone. It is hard for him, sometimes difficult, but he is willing to do \nit. His spirit of bipartisanship is just what the Nation expects during \nthis turbulent time. I just wish I could get him to do it more.\n  It is no secret that Ted and I are close friends, even though I am a \nconservative, he is a liberal; I am a westerner, he is an easterner; I \nam a physical fitness fanatic, he is--well, never mind.\n  As I was saying, it is no secret that Ted and I are close friends. I \nvalue the time I have spent with Ted and his wonderful wife Vicki, \nwhose birthday I understand is today. I wish her a happy birthday and \nthe best, and all of the Kennedy family who have treated me so well \nover the years.\n  For the past 26 years, we have laughed together, we have cried \ntogether, we have sung together, and we have prayed together. We have \nfought and we have made up. But above all, we respect each other's \nabilities. In that trust and alliance, good legislation can be made, \nlegislation that benefits our constituents today and in the future. And \nthat is what we have been sent here to do.\n  Madam President, last year, Senator Kennedy sent my polling numbers \nto the basement when he came over and hugged me in the Senate Chamber. \nToday, I am going to return the favor and offer my dear friend and \ncolleague my best wishes on his 70th birthday. I have done the math, \nTed. If you can get that cloning bill through, there is a great \npossibility that you can still be middle aged when you reach the age of \n140.\n  He is my dear friend. I care a great deal for him, and we will be \nfriends for eternity.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ncomments. Let me say, we on our side will forgive him for his complete \nmisunderstanding and misinterpretation of our party, precisely because \nof his affection and respect for our good friend, Senator Kennedy. We \nthank him for that.\n  I will recognize the Senator from New Jersey for such time as he will \nconsume, and then the Senator from Georgia, and, finally, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. We will close with the Senator from Connecticut. I \nknow we are out of time. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for such \ntime as we need to complete these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the \nopportunity to speak.\n  Madam President, I, too, add my voice to the many others who have \ncome to praise the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Edward \nKennedy.\n  Though the Presiding Officer and I have only been in the Senate for a \nvery short while, in my life outside of the Senate, I have admired \nSenator Kennedy for many years for all of the work and leadership he \nhas brought to the issues that make America great. In my opinion, he is \none of the greatest national leaders not only of this time but of all \ntime. It is an extraordinary honor for me to serve with him in this \nbody.\n  Senator Kennedy is a man of principle who stands up for ordinary \nAmericans and for the values in which I think all of us believe. Time \nafter time, on issue after issue, he has worked to expand access to the \nAmerican promise, the American dream, that drives so many of us in our \npursuits in our lives for ourselves and our families and our \ncommunities, for all of those we care about, regardless of where one \nbegins in life.\n  He has fought to ensure that each and every American has access to \nhigh-quality education, access to quality health care. He has done as \nmuch to help children as anyone could ever dream about. He has worked \nfor the people in the workplace who do not have representatives with \nthe ability to work the Halls of Congress. He has worked to help make \nsure every American has dignity and a minimum wage that is a living \nwage. He is a great voice on the issues that make a difference in \npeople's lives--hard-working Americans.\n  But Senator Kennedy is much more than a champion. He does a lot more \nthan give speeches and issue press releases and help ``rookies'' become \nSenators. He does something I think America admires most, and that is \nto get things done. It is one thing to have great ideas, but it is \nanother to deliver on them. I do not think there is anyone I have seen, \nin the short tenure I have had here, who is a stronger, more \nprovocative, and certain legislator than Ted Kennedy.\n\n  He understands how the Senate works. I have been trying to pick his \nbrain to understand that as my life unfolds here. He knows how to work \nacross the party lines and with Presidents and many folks with whom he \nmay agree or disagree. But he knows how to win on the issues he is \ntrying to fight for; that is, to help the people of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\n  So in every sense he is a terrific leader because he has his values \nand his commitment to the people. He is a man of compassion, and he is \ngreat to those of us who are new in this body.\n  I thank you for your generosity and for your great leadership. I look \nforward to serving with you for a very long time--maybe not 40 years, \nbut we will work as long and as hard as we can. I congratulate you on \nyour 70th birthday. I wish you and your family the very best.\n  God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, it is an honor to be in the presence of \ntrue greatness in the Senate, to be in the presence of one of the great \nSenators we have in this body, Senator Ted Kennedy. May I also say, I \nidentify with Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah that in terms of my service \nwith Senator Kennedy, a lot of my constituents pray for me, too. I \nmight say, though, Senator Kennedy and his family are really the reason \nI got involved in politics.\n  I came to this town as a young 21-year-old and sat in the gallery \nmuch as Senator Dick Durbin said he sat in the gallery and watched \nSenator Kennedy come to the Chamber as a freshman Member of the Senate. \nTo me, that was the ultimate in public service and citizenship at that \ntime. For me, to be a freshman in the Senate, and Senator Kennedy still \nbeing here, is one of the great rewards of my life.\n  It is interesting that we are going to be considering an election \nreform bill in just a few moments. The point is, we are trying to \nimprove the very democracy we have been given by our ancestors. But you \ncannot do that without leaders.\n  Harry Truman once said: A leader is someone who gets people to do \nwhat they ought to do anyway. People in this country ought to register, \nthey ought to vote, they ought to turn out, they ought to be interested \nin politics, but many are not. So we need inspiring leaders.\n  Ted Kennedy, for me, is an inspiring leader. He came to this body \nwhen he was young and has stayed here dedicating his life to this body, \nthis Senate. To me, that is the ultimate in patriotism and the ultimate \nin citizenship. It reminds me a lot of a person who occupied this \nSenate desk and was in the position that I now hold in the Senate, \nSenator Dick Russell.\n\n  They both came to this body at the tender age of 30. Both dedicated \ntheir lives to this body and this country. So it is just an honor to \nserve with Senator Kennedy today. I bring him greetings from the great \nState of Georgia. And, Ted, I wish you many more. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to salute Senator Ted Kennedy on \nhis 70th birthday and to state something that is obvious to everyone: \nIn the course of this country and this Senate, hundreds of men and \nwomen have served, but only a handful are truly great Senators. Senator \nTed Kennedy is one of those great Senators.\n  His greatness is measured by his vision, by his compassion, and by \nhis effectiveness. He is the architect of so much that has improved the \nlives of so many Americans--health care, education, foreign policy, so \nmany things that have made the lives of so many people better. Indeed, \nthe measurement of his greatness is not the votes on this floor or his \nelections in Massachusetts, but it is in the lives of countless \nchildren throughout this country and seniors and working men and women, \ndisadvantaged Americans, dispossessed Americans whose lives are better, \nindeed, who cherish hope because Ted Kennedy served in this body.\n  Ultimately, his great reward and tribute will not come from us but \nwill come years from now, when a child or a senior or a working \nAmerican, not knowing from whence a law evolved but knowing that it has \nmade their life a little better and given them more opportunity, will \nsay ``thank you,'' and that thanks will be to Ted Kennedy.\n  I had the privilege of serving with his son Patrick. I know that his \npassion, his devotion to duty is not exclusive to him alone but is \nshared immensely by his son, my friend, and colleague from Rhode \nIsland.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy, thank you.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to commend \nSenator Kennedy on his 70th birthday and his approximately 40 years in \nthe Senate. I join my colleagues in recognizing and complimenting him \non his unique achievements in the Senate.\n  I was an admirer of the Kennedy family from afar for many years. Then \nI learned a great deal about the Kennedy family under circumstances \nwhich could have been more pleasant. I was one of the young lawyers on \nthe Warren Commission staff investigating the assassination of \nPresident John F. Kennedy.\n  I recall, years ago, a Democratic dinner in Philadelphia. I was a \nDemocratic committee member in 1960 when President Kennedy ran for the \nWhite House. My wife Joan was 8 months pregnant when he came to speak \nat the big dinner in November. There was great enthusiasm and great \nexcitement about Senator John Kennedy's appearance that night.\n  We watched him at the White House in Camelot with great respect, and \nthen the terrible events of November 22, 1963 occurred. Thereafter, I \ngained some greater familiarity with the Kennedy family as assistant \ncounsel to the Warren Commission.\n  Coming to the Senate after the 1980 election, I had an opportunity to \nwork with Senator Ted Kennedy on the Judiciary Committee. His passion \nand his exuberance for the underdog were unmistakable on civil rights \nand voting rights. He is a real leader.\n  I recall one hearing that he wanted to schedule on an occasion when I \ncould be present. It was a voting rights matter where I had \nparticipated, and the hearing was set for 2:30 PM on July 1, 1987. That \nwas the day on which Circuit Court Judge Robert H. Bork was nominated \nfor the Supreme Court. Suddenly, at 2:30 PM, Senator Kennedy was \nabsent. I saw him on the Senate floor, at 2:38 PM, making a carefully \nprepared speech. He was well attuned to the nomination and was talking \nabout the back of the bus. It is all in the Congressional Record. Since \nI have only a few minutes, I will not go into this matter further. \nHowever, that was Senator Kennedy on civil rights.\n  In this Chamber, he is bombastic in his declamations on the subjects \nwhich are near and dear to his heart. He does wear a microphone, but he \nhardly needs one when he speaks in this body. He fills the Chamber with \nhis enthusiasm and his passion.\n  When I chaired the subcommittee appropriating for education, there \nwas no appropriation adequate for Senator Kennedy. However much money \nwe put in, he wanted more. Very often--not always--but very often he \nwas right, and the same was true with health care. On a number of \noccasions when he sought to cross the aisle to seek cosponsors on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, I was about the last person standing on \nmany of those occasions.\n  I was glad to join him as a cosponsor on the hunger legislation, \nwhere it made no sense that people could not get food stamps if they \nhad a car worth, say, $3,500. We fought hard and got the law changed.\n  Then on hate crimes, his was a lonely voice in this Chamber for a \nlong time. I joined him in that endeavor and signed on to an op-ed \npiece he had written, but I had agreed with, that was published in the \nWashington Post. Then, in the year 2000, we carried that Federal hate \ncrime expansion amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2001 in the Senate 57 to 42, with 13 Republican Senators. \nIt was an election year.\n  He has been a great leader in the Senate. He carries on a great \nfamily tradition. He has been a stalwart on some of the most important \nissues confronting America in civil rights, in voting rights, in health \ncare, and in education. So I am glad to lend my voice of recognition \nand commendation of his great service to the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nthis afternoon to pay tribute to Senator Edward Kennedy on his \nbirthday.\n  I am proud to call Ted Kennedy a colleague, a friend, a mentor and a \nneighbor. I arrived in the Senate as the most junior member in 1974. \nTed Kennedy, only a few years my senior, had already been in the Senate \nfor 12 years. He generously provided me with guidance on everything \nfrom policy matters to committee selections.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  Over the course of his career Ted Kennedy has championed the cause of \nthose Americans living on the margins; those individuals in our society \nwho for whatever reasons are denied basic human necessities like safe \nhousing, nourishing food, a steady income, or access to health care.\n  His dedication over the past decades has been unwavering, and as we \nsee every day here in the Senate, continues to be unwavering.\n  Ted and I have worked together on many issues over the years. In fact \nwe still serve together on the Judiciary Committee, which he preceded \nme in chairing at one time.\n  Whether it is in supporting heating assistance for low-income people, \nso essential to surviving the cold winters that we experience in New \nEngland, or in championing nutrition programs, I have always admired \nTed's knowledge of the issues, and his tenacity in pursuing that which \nhe believes is right.\n  Through his service on the Health, Education and Labor Committee, \nwhether as ranking member, or chairman, Ted Kennedy has continually \nstrived to improve Americans' access to health care with the hope that \none day no American will be without the basic services that so many of \nus take for granted.\n  He has fought to improve the education of our children, with the \nknowledge that a good education is the basic building block to their \nfuture success, reducing the chances of living in poverty by ensuring \naccess to quality employment.\n  And he has consistently advocated on behalf of the worker, with the \nunderstanding that no person should have to work 40 hours a week and \nstill live in poverty.\n  I have valued the time that I have served with Ted Kennedy in the \nSenate. Over this period, hundreds of Senators have had the privilege \nof serving their Nation and the people of their state, but few members \nhave achieved the distinction of truly making an impact on the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  Ted Kennedy has done that and oftentimes for those Americans who do \nnot have a powerful voice in Washington.\n  Several years ago, the Washington Post Magazine had a story about Ted \nKennedy that entitled him the ``King of the Senate.'' Our Founding \nFathers tossed off the shackles of the monarchy over 200 years ago but \nit was an appropriate acknowledgement that Ted Kennedy is a lion at the \ngate protecting the interests of working class Americans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I extend my very best birthday wishes to \nthe very senior Senator from the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \nOf course, he has become even more senior now that he is entering his \neighth decade. I am certain, however, that he will find that life has \nbecome even more enjoyable as it is leavened with wisdom.\n  Senator Kennedy is also entering his fifth decade in the U.S. Senate. \nThrough dogged work and passionate beliefs, he has truly become one of \nthe giants in this great institution. Agree or disagree with Senator \nKennedy, but appreciate his effectiveness. I am a Republican and he is \na liberal Democrat. But I can attest to his dogged determination to \nachieve results across the barriers of ideology and party. Whether he's \nfighting for the rights of patients or to make our schools better, \nSenator Kennedy never gives up on issues he deeply cares about.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to wish Ted Kennedy a hearty \nhappy birthday and thank him on behalf of a grateful Nation for his \nlifelong service to our country. I am privileged to call him my \ncolleague and, above all, my friend.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I \nsend belated birthday wishes to my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts. At 70 years old, Ted Kennedy is one of this \ncountry's most effective lawmakers, having served 40 years in the \nSenate.\n  It is difficult for me to think of many major public policy \ninitiatives that Ted Kennedy has not had a hand in shaping. What is \nmost remarkable is that in many cases he has been here for both the \ninception and the reauthorization of some of the most important \nlegislation of our time.\n  When he was elected in 1962, women and minorities did not have equal \nrights under the law. It is fitting that Ted Kennedy's first floor \nspeech was given on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because he helped to \nmake school integration, pay equity for women, and fair housing laws a \nreality. While serving with him on the Judiciary Committee, I have seen \nfirst hand his ability to tap into the needs of disadvantaged \ncommunities and pass meaningful civil rights legislation.\n  When Senator Kennedy was elected to this body, Americans did not have \nequal access to high quality healthcare. With his support, the Medicare \nand Medicaid program were established to enhance the welfare of \nmillions of elderly and disadvantaged Americans. And in his capacity as \nchairman of the Senate Health Subcommittee and later Full Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, he has fought to \npass laws allowing workers greater flexibility in keeping and choosing \ntheir healthcare coverage and making healthcare insurance more widely \navailable to children. More recently, he fought tirelessly to enact a \nPatient's Bill of Rights to make HMOs more accountable to patients and \nless able to interfere with medical decision making. As the result of \nhis efforts, we can now offer health care protections to all 190 \nmillion Americans in private health plans. This was no small feat.\n  Before Ted Kennedy, reforming our country's education systems was an \nissue on the forefront of our minds, but the last item on the Federal \nGovernment's agenda. Not only was he among those to support the \noriginal passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965, \nbut Ted Kennedy spearheaded the fight to pass the reauthorization of \nthis sweeping federal school bill. Senator Kennedy's efforts have been \nparticularly important to the 5.6 million economically disadvantaged \nstudents in my State.\n  In the Senate, Ted Kennedy has been a champion for a society that is \njust, fair, and humane. He has fought tirelessly for working families \nand underserved communities. With passion and pragmatism, he has served \nthis nation and his beloved Massachusetts--breaking down gender, \nracial, class, and religious barriers.\n  On your 70th birthday, I salute you, Senator Kennedy, for your \ndistinguished years of service and wish you continued success in the \nfuture.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear \nfriend and colleague on the occasion of his 70th birthday.\n  Because of Senator Kennedy, our Nation is stronger, fairer, healthier \nand better educated. Because of Senator Kennedy, our Nation's \nopportunity structure continues to be one of our nation's greatest \nstrengths.\n  Senator Kennedy's achievements are remarkable. Increasing the minimum \nwage. Expanding health care. Improving our nation's schools. Creating a \nnational service program. Strengthening our civil rights laws. \nSafeguarding a woman's right to choose. Enabling more people to attend \ncollege, to get job training, and to build better lives for themselves \nand their children.\n  Senator Kennedy is a champion of working Americans, senior citizens, \nchildren--the list goes on and on. This list is of ordinary Americans, \nnot special interests.\n  For 40 years, Senator Kennedy has served in the Senate. Yet he \nretains his passion, his high energy and his enthusiasm for meeting the \nday to day needs of his constituents and the long term needs of the \nnation. He knows that so much remains to be done.\n  The entire Kennedy family has given so much to our nation. With their \nwealth, they could have done anything--or nothing at all. They could \nhave led lives of the idle rich. Instead, they are a family of war \nheroes, Senators, Congressmen--and a President of the United States. \nThey are also defenders of the poor, environmentalists, educators and \nartists. They fight to give every American the opportunity to build \nbetter lives and stronger communities. This commitment to service comes \nfrom their deep faith, their strong family and their patriotism.\n  Many of us in the Senate were inspired to lead lives of public \nservice because of John F. Kennedy. As a young social worker, I felt he \nwas talking to me when he called our generation to\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nservice. He practiced a passionate, active idealism--that was different \nfrom anything we've seen before in politics.\n  Senator Kennedy has continued this legacy. He is one of the great \nSenators in our nation's history. I feel grateful to be his colleague, \nand his friend. I look forward to the battles ahead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute \nto a man who is in many ways larger than life. Today we celebrate the \n70th birthday of Senator Edward Kennedy, someone who personifies public \nservice in our country.\n  Senator Kennedy is a member of a family that has dedicated itself to \npublic service. His entire family has followed the credo that ``One \nperson can make a difference and every one should try.'' Senator \nKennedy truly has made a difference, and he has so often made a \ndifference for the people who work hard day in and day out.\n  Senator Kennedy has been a champion of working Americans since he \nbecame involved in public service. He is today our most outspoken and \neloquent advocate for their causes. He has worked tirelessly for \nincreasing the minimum wage, for quality health care for all Americans, \nand for education reform. He is a leader for civil rights in our \ncountry and for strengthening Medicare and Social Security. Senator \nKennedy has had tremendous accomplishments during his nearly four \ndecades in the U.S. Senate, many more than I can articulate in this \nshort amount of time.\n  Suffice to say, Senator Kennedy has been an inspiration to \ngenerations of Americans. He has been a friend and colleague to all of \nus serving in this body. I am so very proud and honored to serve with \nhim.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those in \nhonor of our good friend and colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, who last \nweek celebrated his 70th birthday.\n  Since I arrived in the U.S. Senate in 1999, I have had several \nopportunities to turn to Senator Kennedy and his staff for advice and \nassistance on a range of issues that are crucial to Arkansas, including \nhealth care and help for the uninsured.\n  For example, I was honored to work closely with Senator Kennedy last \nyear on the education reform bill. When I offered an amendment to \nimprove educational services to language-minority students, Senator \nKennedy offered his assistance by cosponsoring my amendment. It was the \nfirst floor amendment I offered in the Senate that required extensive \ndebate and a rollcall vote. We passed that amendment as a key part of \nthe most sweeping overhaul of American public education in a \ngeneration. The support and assistance I received from Senator Kennedy \nand his outstanding staff is something I will always remember and \ndeeply appreciate.\n  In my time here, I have found Senator Kennedy to be an invaluable \nresource on policy and legislative matters. For nearly four decades, he \nhas exemplified how a Senator can best serve the interests of his own \nconstituents, as well as those of the American people. Through his \nwisdom, experience, and encyclopedic grasp of Senate history and \nprocedure, he has served as an example to us all. It may be that the \ngreatest tribute we can pay Senator Kennedy is to follow that example.\n  Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to Senator Kennedy for the \nfriendship that he and his wife Vicki have extended to me and my \nfamily. I am deeply grateful for their warmth and kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island and \nrecognize the Senator from Connecticut for such time as he may use. I \nunderstand Senator Biden may be on his way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts for orchestrating this event this afternoon on behalf of \nour fellow New Englander and friend and colleague.\n  I can't help but think of that wonderful story written by Mark Twain \nabout Tom Sawyer who, on the reports of his demise, crawled up into the \nchoir loft and listened to the eulogies being given to him. I can't \nhelp but think my friend from Massachusetts may think he is \nparticipating. He is alive and well, let me report to those tuning in. \nThere is a lot of kick left in the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I \nfully expect there will be many more years of his contribution to this \nbody.\n  Our friendship goes back a long way. I don't want to remind him of \nthis, but I was dressed in a white shirt and blue pants sitting on the \nsteps of the Democratic side as a page in the Senate about the time \nthat my friend from Massachusetts entered this body. He had years of \nservice with my own father in the Senate, serving about 8 years with my \nfather; he served with him on the Judiciary Committee back in those \ndays.\n  He liked to tease me all the time that he deeply resented the fact \nthat someone would get elected to public office on the basis of their \nlast name. I return that favor to him today.\n  This is a wonderful relationship. We share a common heritage of deep \naffection for our Irish roots, our beloved New England, the coastline \nof that part of the country.\n  Today is Vicki Kennedy's birthday, as has been mentioned by Senator \nHatch but deserves repeating. This has been a great source of light and \njoy and love in our friend's life, as have his wonderful children as \nwell: Ted Kennedy, Jr. is my constituent living in Connecticut and has \nbecome a friend of mine outside of my friendship with his father; Kara \nKennedy, their children, Ted's grandchildren; Patrick, who is \na wonderful public servant, a great source of pride to his father, who \nfollows him in public life and serves in the House and represents so \nably the State of Rhode Island.\n\n  Then there are his sisters: Eunice, Pat, and Jean, each one of whom \nmakes their own unique contribution to the well-being of this country.\n  On Sunday afternoon I participated in a Special Olympics event in the \nState of Connecticut. About 600 people gathered together to watch young \nchildren with disabilities win gold, silver, and bronze medals. I had \nmy 5-month-old daughter Grace with me presenting little flowers to each \nof the winners.\n  I was thinking of Eunice Kennedy in the backyard of her home in \nMaryland years ago with four or five children beginning what was then \nthe genesis of Special Olympics. Obviously, his brothers: Jack Kennedy, \nour beloved President; Robert Kennedy; Joe, his sister Kathleen, all \nthese people, and his father and mother who have contributed.\n  He will be the first to say no one individual accomplishes what they \ndo in their own right. We are a product of our family and friends, our \nexperiences in life.\n  I join with so many eloquent words spoken, from the majority leader's \nwords to my friend and colleague from Georgia, obviously the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  A couple last points. I identify with and certainly support all that \nhas been said about the Senator's contributions. I bear the \nresponsibility right now of selecting the faces of the caricatures of \nSenators who have been recognized for their contributions. Ironically, \nit was the junior Senator from Massachusetts, Jack Kennedy, who was \nasked a number of years ago to assume the same responsibility when the \nnames of Calhoun, Clay, Webster, Taft, and La Follette were chosen as \nthe pictures in the waiting room of the five great Senators of the 19th \nand early 20th century. We have just chosen two more: Senator Wagner \nand Senator Vandenberg, and have two small ovals.\n  It will not be our responsibility--that will come to a future \ngeneration--to choose the figures of the latter part of the 20th \ncentury that might inhabit unpainted ovals in the reception room. I \nhope that Senators, 50 or 75 years from now, might look back on this \nrecord today as a source of some guidance as to how contemporaries felt \nabout one of their own. And whether you are talking to Senator Byrd \nwho, of course, has more than 50 years of service in the Congress, or \nthose who have arrived only a few short months ago, there is a common \nthread you will hear; that is, that our friend Ted Kennedy certainly \ndeserves to be on any short list of a future generation that makes the \ndecision on who ought to be considered the greatest of those who served \nin the latter part of the 20th century.\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\n  It is because he is a great legislator. We don't cherish or celebrate \nenough legislators. Most of us run for public office promising that we \nwill be our own people, that we will be nobody's man but yours, that \nsomehow we are going to come here and act as if we were an executive \nrather than legislator. Senator Kennedy, regardless of party, embodies \nthe qualities of a legislator. He fights harder than anyone I know for \nwhat he believes. But he also knows at the end of the day in a \nDemocratic process, in the greatest deliberative body in the history of \nmankind, you end up having to work with people with whom you have \ndisagreements. It is more than about giving speeches or introducing \nbills. It is producing at the end of the day a product that improves \nthe quality of life. It may only be an inch. It may not be the miles \nyou intended. But you know that if you can move it an inch forward this \nyear and an inch maybe next year, a little bit further the following \nyear, at the end of a career you can make a huge difference.\n  Because he enjoys and understands the process of legislating, not \nonly has this body been enriched but, as others have said, the quality \nof life for people who may never know his name, do not know who he is \ntoday because his contribution is not confined to the boundaries of \nthis Nation, but there are people in Latin America and Africa and Asia, \npeople who have never heard the name Kennedy, don't know what you are \ntalking about, whose lives today have been enriched and improved \nbecause this one individual has been involved. He defies the notion \nthat one person cannot make a difference.\n  Lastly, I have been raised to believe that character is about what \npeople do in private, not in public. There are not Members who have \nserved with him who have not been the beneficiary of the private \nmoment, of that unexpected phone call, knock on the door, and you open \nit up and there is our friend from Massachusetts. On every single \nlevel, I have often said this is one of my best friends. I am proud to \ncall him such and happy to celebrate with him this great birthday.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nvery thoughtful and personal comments. It is not inappropriate that the \nlast speaker will be one of those other Senators who was among the 16 \nU.S. Senators ever to join this body at the age of 30.\n  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, before I came into the Chamber, I said to \nSenator Kennedy, ``This is discouraging. I am about to be 60 and you \njust turned 70 and I don't like it. I don't like anything about this. \nAs a matter of fact, it drives me crazy.''\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Kennedy, with a much more distinguished \ncareer than me, has suffered through the same illusion and delusion \nthat I have. I got here when I was a couple days younger than he, and \nfor the longest time I was the youngest, and all of a sudden you wake \nup and say, oh, my God. In my case, there are only a total of six \nSenators who have been here longer than me. That is equally \ndiscouraging. In his case, I think only two have been here longer than \nhim.\n  This place has a way of promoting the delusion that you are still \nyoung. One thing about Ted Kennedy, having had the honor--and I mean \nthat sincerely--of working with him for 29 years is that he is still \nyoung. He is younger, I think, than anyone in this Chamber because I \nhave observed, as have we all, that he is still as passionate, as \ndevoted, as committed to the notion that he can change the world as he \nwas when he got elected at 30 years old.\n  My dad is in the hospital and I hope he is watching. He has an \nexpression: ``It is a lucky man or woman who gets up in the morning, \nputs both feet on the floor, knows what they are about to do, and \nthinks it still matters.'' That said, I think Ted Kennedy may be the \nluckiest man I have ever known. He has no doubt. Just watch him; he \nknows and feels it still matters.\n  In his 70 years, Senator Kennedy has enjoyed and shared with us a \nlifetime of public service, a tradition of excellence, a family of \nfaith and courage in the face of extraordinary tragedy, and through it \nall, he has shown an unrelenting resolve to keep moving, keep working, \nand never stop believing in the power of ideas to change the world and \nchange this Nation. In doing so, he has seen to it, as he once said in \nanother context, that the dream will never die.\n  That is Ted Kennedy. That is who he is; it is what he believes, and, \nI suspect, although I have just known him for 30 years, it is what he \nhas always believed. To him, this institution, this democracy, this \nChamber is about honor and tradition. It is about a legacy of hope, of \na proud family, and a grateful Nation. It is about believing in the \nnobility of public service and passing that belief, or, as his brother \nsaid, that ``torch,'' to the next generation of Americans, as it was \npassed to him.\n  As I said, I have had the pleasure to serve with him for 29 years, to \nstand with him, to learn from him, to lean on him, and to watch him in \naction in this Chamber. I have seen him raise his voice time after time \nnot only for his constituency but for every single American. And for \nthose who have no choice, I have heard him shout in this Chamber, and \nother places, at the top of his lungs for justice. For those who have \nbeen wronged, I have heard him demand and stand fast until fairness \nhappened. For women, for minorities, those victims of intolerance and \npersecution for nothing more than the color of their skin, I have seen \nhim fight with every fiber in his body to give them more strength and a \nsense of equity. I have seen him exhausted, angry--a couple times at \nme--but I have never seen him give up or back down from what he \nbelieves is right, fair, and just.\n\n  Everybody today says Massachusetts is an automatic liberal State. I \ncan remember when it wasn't such an automatic liberal State. I argue--\nand I mean this sincerely--the reason Massachusetts, in part, is the \nway it is is because of Ted Kennedy, for when Ted Kennedy spoke out on \nthe things we all take for granted today--and some may say it is easy \nfor him to do that in Massachusetts, but when he started that, that was \nnot the overwhelming view in Massachusetts or any other State.\n  I argue, and I truly believe, that if anybody listening wonders \nwhether or not one man or one woman can change the way people think, \nnot a single vote--not a change in outcome, but change the way people \nlook at a subject, I respectfully suggest that you look at Ted Kennedy. \nTed Kennedy hasn't changed a darn thing that he has said or believed in \nthese issues for 30 years. But the State has changed, the Nation has \nchanged, so I remind everybody that when people say it is OK for Ted \nKennedy to get up and fight for the poor, fight for African-Americans, \nfight for gays, fight for minorities, he can afford it. Well, he can't \nafford it; he made it. He made it acceptable. He made it change more \nthan any other man or woman in this country in the last 30 years.\n  Madam President, I say to the people of Massachusetts and to \nAmericans everywhere, no matter what they believe, whether they are \nleft or right, Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, know \nthat the idea of representative democracy is the very embodiment of Ted \nKennedy.\n  I know people think because we are all his friends we are standing up \nand saying these nice things. Well, I will tell you, if you doubt what \nI am saying, or what anybody else said, after a bitter fight on this \nfloor, after Ted Kennedy nearly breaks his desk in anger or in \nfrustration for what is not happening, watch how passionate he is, and \nthen watch, whether he wins or loses, how he walks across the aisle and \nhe is greeted on the other side of the aisle with a genuine, genuine, \ngenuine respect and friendship.\n  Every time I try to tell anybody, whether I am traveling in another \ncountry, or traveling in my State, or in this country and speaking with \nstudents, or with anybody talking about representative democracy, and I \ngive you my word to this, I want to give an example of how this place \nis so different--and this is one of the things that has changed, \nunfortunately--I tell them about Ted Kennedy. I pick out the guy who \nhas been known as the most liberal guy in the Senate, and I have watch \nhim go against conservatives such as Orrin Hatch, and I say\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\nafter it is all over--it used to always be like this--whether he wins \nor loses, he will invite the person to whom he won or lost to go with \nhim and have a sandwich or a cup of coffee or he will invite them back \nto his office because the fight is over and democracy, whether it was \nthe right decision or the wrong decision, has prevailed. He settles it \nand comes back to fight again the next day.\n  People are always amazed. Why is it that so many conservatives who \nwork with him love Ted Kennedy? It is because he understands the deal. \nHe is like Chris Dodd. He understands the deal. He understands that you \ngive and you take when you make a commitment, and you make a commitment \neven after a while. I say this about my friend from Connecticut as \nwell, who is one of the few people who does this, and the tables change \nand it becomes a political liability to stick with your word--he never \napproaches you and says: You know, Joe, I have a problem. He never says \na word. He just does what he committed to do.\n  I can't tell you that in the 29, almost 30 years I have been here, \nhow that one piece of courtesy is the thing I most regret having been \ndiminished in this place. It used to be you could turn and say that \nabout 80 people here. I should not be saying what I am saying, but it \nis true. And so the fact of the matter is, I have seen him move a \nconcept, as others have spoken--a concept from inception to law with \nthe skill of a surgeon. This guy is good. How does Kennedy win? How \ndoes it happen? No. 1, he is smarter than most of us. No. 2, he knows \nthe process better than anybody. No. 3, he gives and he takes and he \nnever, never stops; and he is always, always honorable.\n  If you were going to point out the persons you think would get the \nmost done--and I do not think anybody's legislative record and \naccomplishments match the Senator; there are great women and men who \nserve here and with whom I have served over the last 30 years. But \nthink about it. The least likely guy to have that happen is the one \nviewed as being the furthest on the party spectrum, not the person in \nthe middle, the so-called--I love these new guys in the parties--\ncentrist. One would think it would be the centrist who would get the \nmost done.\n  In spite of, some might suggest, his incredibly firm convictions and \nsometimes being at the point of the spear, Ted Kennedy gets the most \ndone. If one would ask Republicans, some publicly and 95 percent \nprivately would say the single best legislator in this body--and has \nbeen for some time--is Ted Kennedy.\n  As I said, I have seen him move a concept from an idea to a law. In \nmy view, he is literally the best of his generation. He is the \npersonification of what people talk about in political science classes, \nabout the nobility of a public servant. He makes democracy work for \npeople he represents.\n  One would never know that he is 70 because he has not lost an edge at \nall. As a matter of fact, I remember in a different context when he was \nconsoling me about something, he said there is life after this. And \nobviously he embraced it fully because ironically he has been \nincredibly and increasingly more productive as every year goes by, even \nthough over 50 percent of the people here probably only served with him \n6 years or so.\n  There are two words to describe Ted Kennedy: He is the quintessential \nlegislator, and he is the gentleman in the Senate. His may be the one \nmost powerful voice to echo in this Chamber for those who have not been \nlucky enough to have drawn that long straw. When it comes to health \ncare and workers--others have talked about it, so I will not go into \nit--when it comes to children, equal rights, justice, when it comes to \nspeaking loudly and clearly for those who are weak and small and \naltogether too silent, he is the one legislator who always has been on \ntheir side regardless of the fashion and regardless of the polls.\n  The gift Ted Kennedy has given us every day is far more than we could \never give back in 70 years or 100 years or 170 years. All we are able \nto really say to Ted Kennedy today is happy birthday. But I want to say \none more thing--as they say in this body, a point of personal \nprivilege.\n  We all have had difficult times in our lives, and I have had some \ndifficult times in my life, relating to losses in my family and other \nevents. But from the first time Ted Kennedy came to Delaware as a 39-\nyear-old guy campaigning for a 29-year-old guy before 3,000 people at \nthe final dinner in my State, he stood up and said a lot of nice things \nabout me, but he said: My only doubt is that he may be too young, \nmaking a play on the fact that he had been as young as I was when he \nwas elected.\n  The next day the Wall Street Journal ran in that column they have \nstraight deadpan: Kennedy wonders aloud: Is Biden too young for the \nSenate?\n  Maybe he has tried to make up for that ever since then; I do not \nknow. When my wife and daughter were killed, the first guy there was \nTed Kennedy. When Ted Kennedy's mother was alive, he or she called me \nand invited me to bring my children and go out with them. He did not \nknow me from Adam.\n  Madam President, I will not take any more time to talk about those \npersonal things, but I want you to know they make a difference in this \nplace. They make a gigantic difference. When some doctors told me my \nchances of hanging around were not all that good after a couple \naneurysms, he was the guy who took the time to take the train by \nhimself to Wilmington, DE, the guy who had nothing to do or say but \njust came and made himself available, hung out all day and spent 15, 16 \nhours at my house and in the pool with my kids, in the kitchen with my \nwife, talking about how this was all going to work out, and then \nwithout me knowing it, got on the train late at night and headed back \nand never, never said a word. He was the first guy to ever come to me \nwhen I was down in this place and sat with me when I did not want to be \nhere after 6 months--Ted Kennedy.\n  He is the guy who introduced me to the gym. Ted may remember. He \nwould come by two to three times a week to drag me out of my office. I \nwant to tell my colleagues, I will never forget it.\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues in the Senate, I want to make \none closing remark. My political hero got me involved in politics. \nThere are a lot of great men--and the two Kennedy brothers who are \ndeceased were great--but my personal favorite is Robert Kennedy. I \ncannot believe there is nothing prophetic about what Robert Kennedy \nsaid in a speech and maybe somebody else mentioned this. But it seems \nhe must have had his kid brother in mind when he said:\n\n       Our answer is the world's hope. The cruelties and obstacles \n     of a swiftly changing planet will not yield to the obsolete \n     dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who \n     cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the \n     illusion of security to the excitement and danger which comes \n     with even the most peaceful process. The world demands the \n     quality of youth, not time of life, not but a state of mind, \n     a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, \n     predominance of courage over timidity, of appetite for \n     adventure over the love of ease.\n\n  He was talking about his brother. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nthose special comments. I recognize the Senator from Tennessee for 3 \nminutes and then the Senator from Washington for 2 minutes or such time \nas she may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I should announce we have gone overtime. \nThe Senator from Connecticut needs to move forward. That is where we \nwill wind up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts. \nI did not realize we would have this opportunity today to express our \nfeelings and thoughts toward Senator Kennedy until a few minutes ago. \nWhen I heard about it, I was compelled to come over and say a few \nwords.\n  I am sure for the time allotted that everyone who spoke has pointed \nout the brilliance of the Senator's advocacy, the fact that he is a \nSenator's Senator, and all of the accomplishments he has had since he \nhas been a Member of this body.\n  I simply want to acknowledge the Senator's generous spirit and his \nkindness. I know that I speak for very many in this body and people in \nother places when I say that. He has demonstrated this time and time \nagain.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  His reputation for kindness, his reputation for thoughtfulness--as \nthe Senator from Delaware has just been talking about--is legendary. I \nimagine part of this has to do with the tragedies and losses in his own \nlife in terms of his own family.\n  I suffered a loss of my own recently, as so many of us in this body \nhave. Senator Kennedy went beyond all expectation in expressing his \nconcern for me and my family and made gestures that I will never \nforget. I want to express my appreciation for that. Many of my \ncolleagues have been extremely kind and thoughtful, but I have this \nopportunity because the Senator is having this benchmark in his life \nrecognized--and thank goodness he is--to say that.\n  While the Senator is to be congratulated for his legislative \nachievements, he is to be congratulated for reaching this benchmark. To \nme, he is mostly to be congratulated for realizing that human beings \nand human relations and family are much more important than any of the \nabove.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nwishing the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, a very happy \nbirthday.\n  I grew up in a small town 3,000 miles away from here, a town of 1,000 \npeople, from a family of 9. We did not have very much. Macaroni and \ncheese was standard fare for my family. Times were very difficult. My \nfather was disabled. My mother had to work and raise seven kids and \ncare for my father. We went to church every Sunday. It didn't seem as \nif there was a lot of hope. But there was one word of hope in my home, \ngrowing up in Bothell, WA, 3,000 miles away from here. That word for \nhope was ``Kennedy''--hope for all of us.\n  There was an individual 3,000 miles away in a town only on a map in \nour sixth-grade text book, Washington, DC. This man stood up and fought \nfor the things my family needed so badly--whether welfare reform \nassistance for my mother when she had to go back to work, whether an \neducation for all seven of us kids as we went through school, whether \nit was my ability and my six brothers' and sisters' ability to go on \nand get a college degree because of student loans and grants.\n  There was a man, an individual fighting for us, even though he never \nknew us, and I certainly never thought I would meet him. But his word \nwas magic. His name was magic in my house. The name was Kennedy. We \nknew there was a compassionate advocate for us, every single day, \nspeaking out for the needs of a family many miles away.\n  It is an honor and a privilege for me to be in this Senate, where I \nnever thought I would be, and to have watched him for the last 9 years \nfight for those same people to make sure they have a good education, \nthat they have prescription drug coverage, that their voice is not \nlost, that they have employment insurance when they do not have a job, \nthat they have a voice in a town far away from many cities in this \ngreat country. It is an honor indeed to serve here with this man and to \nknow that he advocates for many people who can never afford to travel \nthis far away to speak for themselves.\n  Senator Kennedy, happy 70th birthday season, and many more. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for setting \naside this time. I am particularly grateful to all my colleagues who \nhave taken part in this special tribute. I am quite confident that my \ncolleague would think otherwise, but I don't think there has been a \nword of excess. There has been an extraordinary commonality in the \ncomments of everybody, a sense of the Senator's instinct for this \nplace, a sense of the Senator's obvious accomplishments through the \nyears he has been here, his commitment, his passion, his effort to \nchange things for the better for other people. But through everybody's \ncomments, in the end I think what is most striking and perhaps most \nimportant, and most important for us to think about as Senators, is the \nhumanity and the way in which he has touched the lives of citizens and \nthe lives of his colleagues.\n  We are very grateful. I am confident all my colleagues will join me \nin saying if you think the last 40 have been pretty terrific, you \nprobably haven't seen anything yet. As Senator Dodd said, there is a \nlot of territory yet to be covered. We are grateful that Senator \nKennedy is going to be there to cover it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the hour is late and the time allotted \nearlier has been exceeded. I did want to take a moment to acknowledge \nthe overly generous comments of my colleagues and true friends.\n  I first of all thank my colleague and friend, John Kerry, who was so \ninstrumental in arranging these few minutes this afternoon in the \nSenate's business. As I have said all across Massachusetts, this is an \nindividual who served our flag and our colors gallantly and bravely in \nVietnam and then came back because of his strong commitment to the \nideals which motivated him in the service of our country--not unlike \nour friend and colleague from Georgia and others--and now continues to \nfight for these matters. He is a person for whom I have enormous \nrespect and admiration. I am enormously grateful to him for this \nopportunity this afternoon.\n  I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, who really is a leader for our \ntimes. I think all who get to know him better and better as the time \ngoes on, and as the American people get to understand and know him \nbetter and better, will understand the true value of his leadership and \nthe difference he is making for this institution and our country. I am \ngrateful to him.\n  I thank my colleagues for all of their comments. I was very touched \nand moved by so many of the stories that were recounted. I am grateful. \nI love this institution. I have friends in this institution who make a \ngreat difference to my life, to me personally, but also in being allies \nin attempting to advance the unfinished business of this country. Many \nspoke today. I am extremely grateful.\n  I was in Massachusetts this last week and was fortunate, as a result \nof my wife Vicki arranging some preliminary birthday celebrations, to \nmeet with many friends. I mentioned at the time when I was in \nMassachusetts that my birthday was a rather unusual birthday because my \nmother entered St. Margaret's Hospital in Dorchester, MA, on February \n12, 1932--that is Lincoln's birthday--then she left the hospital on \nFebruary 18. I had not arrived. She went back in on February 20, and I \narrived on the 22nd, which is George Washington's birthday. My mother \nstayed there until March 16, which is the eve of St. Patrick's Day. So \nif you add Lincoln's, Washington's, and St. Patrick's, you get a \npolitician, the way I look at it.\n  People in Massachusetts wondered how long I was going to serve in the \nSenate. I am asked that question frequently generally by my nephews and \nnieces, and by some others. I said I could run four more times and \nstill be younger than Strom Thurmond. We joked or laughed about that.\n  Nonetheless, I have been enormously blessed with heroes, my heroes \nbeing the members of my family, and by the commitment to public service \nwhich was so strong in our family, and, along with a strong faith, the \nsense that we all should give something back to this country in return \nfor all it has given to us.\n  I have seen the political process work. I believe in the political \nprocess. I have seen it work at the time of the election of a \nCongressman, then a Senator, and then a President, and a President \nmaking a difference in people's lives, President Kennedy. And I have \nseen the process work here. I still believe, as we were brought up to \nbelieve, that politics is a noble profession. It is not always \nrecognized as such in this country, at this time, but I think for all \nMembers in this institution and for all those outside of the \ninstitution who are attempting to gain the opportunity to serve in this \nextraordinary, rare opportunity and extraordinary honor, they recognize \nit as well. I am enormously mindful every day of my life that the \ngreatest public honor of one's life is the service in the Senate. It is \nfor me.\n  I always think the greatest contribution I will have made will have \nbeen my children, but the greatest public\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nhonor will be the service in the Senate representing, in my case, \nMassachusetts, the State I love, which has played such an extraordinary \nrole in this Nation, from the Revolution of this country, to its \nmembers being involved in the Constitutional Convention, to the strong \nsupport by the abolitionists in ending slavery, the support for the \nsuffragettes--by great leadership by Republicans and Democrats. The \npeople of Massachusetts have a high standard for progress to be made by \ntheir Representatives, and it is one that challenges all of us each \nday.\n\n  Let me just say, finally, I don't think people are asking very much \nin our country. They want schools that teach. They want a health care \nsystem, so they can pay into a system but also have a quality health \nsystem that is going to cover themselves and their family. They want \nrespect for their senior citizens. They want good jobs, so they can \nhave a future for themselves and for their families and for their \nchildren. They want to knock down the walls of discrimination. \nAmericans are fair, and they understand that this country has to free \nitself from discrimination in every form and shape we face. They want \ndecent housing, and, as a part of the American dream, they want to be \nable to breathe the air and drink the water that is clean. They want \nsafe and secure neighborhoods, strong defense, and they want us to \nrepresent overseas the best of American values.\n  I came to this body believing that the privileged and the powerful \ncan look out for themselves but that our challenge is to make sure we \nare going to have as even a playing field as we possibly can for all \nAmericans. I think it is something that should get us up early in the \nmorning and have us willing to work long and hard, as long as we are \nprivileged to serve here, to be able to achieve. That is really what \nAmerica is all about: Freeing us from the forms of discrimination, \ncreating an even playing field so that our fellow citizens can be what \nthey truly can be and want to be.\n  I was reminded just the other day of the cartoon ``Peanuts'' by \nCharles Schultze. It gave me some hope because, as Peanuts has said:\n\n       After you go over the top of the hill, you go faster on the \n     other side.\n\n  So I am looking forward, with even greater spirit and greater \ndetermination, to the battles that lie ahead in this Senate Chamber, \nrepresenting my State. I thank all of those who have been a part of \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his long service \nin the Senate.\n  May I inquire, are we prepared to go back on the bill?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1166-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2934\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set \naside. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Ensign, \n     and Mr. Burns, proposes an amendment number 2934.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To apply the election technology and administration \n  requirements to States only after funding is made available to meet \n                           such requirements)\n\n       On page 22, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 105.

Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. \n565, the Equal Protection and Voting Rights Act of 2001.\n  First of all, I thank my friends Senator Ensign and Senator Burns for \ncosponsoring this important amendment. Let me also commend my \ncolleagues, Chairman Dodd and Senator McConnell, for undertaking an \nextremely arduous process leading to consideration today of legislation \nthat is supported by half the Senate. I know this was not easy for the \ncommittee, nor their staffs, and I appreciate the hard work that led to \nthis compromise.\n  That being said, I do have a concern about the impact that enactment \nof this legislation could have on states and localities, most of whom \nare experiencing extreme budget shortfalls. Let me explain.\n  Title I of the Dodd-McConnell bill includes seven new uniform and \nnondiscriminatory requirements for election technology and \nadministration. These are requirements, for example, pertaining to \ncertification of votes cast, audit capacity, and accessibility for \nindividuals with disabilities. If enacted, these requirements would \napply to each voting system used in an election for Federal office. \nObviously, this language has far-reaching consequences.\n  I appreciate the intent underlying the sponsors' legislation, which \nis that the system must be uniform in nature, across the entire \ncountry, if it is to be successful in accomplishing the goal of \nelection reform.\n  I also appreciate the committee's stated desire that the program be \nfully funded. That being said, the question I ask my colleagues is \nthis: ``What if it isn't?'' What if a future Congress fails to provide \nadequate funding for this legislation?\n  That goes to the heart of my amendment.\n  My amendment is simple. It states that only fully-funded mandates \nwill be enforceable. In other words, if Congress does not provide the \nfunding, the States and localities won't be left holding the bag for a \nFederal mandate.\n  Let me hasten to make clear that my amendment does not seek to change \nthe mandates in this title. What it does is ensure State and local \ngovernments that we will keep our commitment in the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995. At that time, we promised the States that we would \nnot saddle them with new mandates without providing them with the \nresources to implement and enforce those laws.\n  While I believe my good friends Senator Chris Dodd and Mitch \nMcConnell are well intentioned in their approach to election reform, as \nnow drafted, this bill fails to protect states and localities from \nunfunded mandates. Adoption of my amendment would guarantee we keep \nthis promise to our States and localities. I also believe that this \namendment seeks to codify the author's intent of meeting our promises \nto the states.\n  Some may argue that the Dodd-McConnell bill will fund every title in \nthe bill. However, this argument does not hold water when weighed \nagainst the text of the bill. This bill authorizes payments to the \nstates. Note the key word--authorizes. It does not appropriate the \nresources to get the job done. Given the numerous competing Federal \npriorities, not to mention the funding required in our fight against \nterrorism, there is good reason to question whether those resources \nwill be available.\n  I have great faith in the future of this country and in our future \nleaders. I do not have faith, however, that future congresses will \nallocate required resources for every State to purchase new equipment \nand to retrofit existing structures where citizens vote. S. 565 sets \nthree hard deadlines, and the States will be held accountable for the \nmandated changes at each of those deadlines. Although the changes will \nbe phased in over 4 years, all States will be responsible for \nimplementing all provisions by 2006.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of the Dodd-\nMcConnell bill at $3 billion. That is billion, with a ``B.'' I know \nthat my friends Senators Dodd and McConnell fully expect this bill to \nbe funded. I truly hope that is the case.\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\n  But let us look at the hard realities. It is ethnical for us, at a \ntime when the majority of our states are facing serious financial \ndifficulties, when some, such as my home State of Utah are cutting off \nhealth care benefits to children and closing prisons, to even suggest \nthey foot the entire bill for these new mandates? I think not.\n  Our amendment simply declares that States will not be held \naccountable for any mandated provisions in S. 565 until sufficient \nfunds have been appropriated. I think it would be prudent, even if we \nare able to fully fund these mandates, to have this provision in the \nbill as a safety net.\n  Let me also note that this amendment has the support of state and \nlocal governments.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from various \nState and local officials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Association of Secretaries of State, National \n           Conference of State Legislatures, and the National \n           Association of Counties\n                                                February 13, 2002.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The national organizations listed \n     above, representing state and local elected officials, \n     express our support for your proposed amendment to ensure \n     that full federal funding accompanies federal election reform \n     legislation.\n       We have reviewed the text of your proposed amendment and \n     endorse it as a mechanism to guarantee that federal mandates \n     be accompanied by full funding. We look forward to working \n     with you to ensure that states and local governments are \n     equipped to provide fair and open elections and to maintain \n     and improve the process by which we conduct elections for \n     local, state and federal office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ron Thornburgh,\n       Kansas Secretary of State, President, National Association \n     of Secretaries of State.\n     Larry Naake,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Counties.\n     William Pound,\n       Executive Director, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    State of Utah,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                            Salt Lake City, UT, February 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to express my support for \n     your proposed amendment to ensure that full federal funding \n     accompanies federal election reform legislation.\n       As you are aware, many states, including Utah, are \n     experiencing budget shortfalls. It would be extremely \n     difficult, if not impossible, to make budget allocations to \n     purchase new voting equipment at this time. Unfunded federal \n     mandates would also place a financial burden on our 29 \n     counties. We are dedicated to providing the best equipment so \n     that every individual has an equal opportunity to vote, but \n     we cannot accomplish this without federal funding.\n       As the Chief Election Official for the State of Utah, I \n     endorse your proposed amendment. I feel that the only way \n     states and localities can accomplish the many aspects of \n     election reform is to provide full funding for all federal \n     mandates. I look forward to working with you to ensure that \n     all elections are fair, open and efficient.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Olene S. Walker,\n                                              Lieutenant Governor.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I urge my colleagues to remember your commitment to your \nState--no more unfunded mandates. I urge an affirmative vote on this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as I understand my colleague--I appreciate \nhis points about what we have tried to do in this legislation, \nobviously. There are some minimum requirements in the area of access, \nto make it possible for millions of disabled Americans who have never \nbeen able to cast a vote in private, independently, to be able to do \nso; the anti-fraud provisions of statewide voter registration; and \nprovisional voting. Those are the three minimum requirements here--and \nfully fund it.\n  I agree with my colleague from Utah. I happen to believe when there \nare mandates such as this, minimum requirements, no matter how minimum \nthey may be, we ought to have the resources to make it possible for our \nStates to do those things.\n  I have committed to my friend and colleague from Utah that we are \ngoing to do everything possible to see to it that is the case. So, in \nterms of the language of this amendment, I inquire of my friend from \nUtah whether or not the understanding is we are going to see to it--the \nPresident has already put $1.2 billion in his budget as a kind of \nindication of the administration's good faith on this issue.\n  I found that to be a remarkable commitment in light of the fact the \nbill has not been adopted yet. Obviously, we don't have the power to \nappropriate as an authorizing committee. But because my friend from \nKentucky, the Senator from Missouri, and the Senator from Illinois--all \nof whom are principal sponsors of this bill--sit on the Appropriations \nCommittee, along with conversations with others, we feel very confident \nthat the resources are going to be there on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2934, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, from our previous conversation, I \nunderstand that the Senator requests that I withdraw this amendment.\n  Let me just say that I am reluctant to withdraw this amendment. I am \nvery concerned that without a concrete assurance in the bill, our \nstates will be saddled with requirements that are clearly out of their \nfinancial reach. I hear what my friend, Senator Dodd, is saying and I \nwould like to believe that there will be adequate funding for all of \nthe provisions in S. 565. On the other hand I have received countless \nentreaties from local governments who are, simply put, skeptical that \nthe federal government will provide them with adequate funding. Without \nthat funding, obviously, an unfunded mandates. That is what I would \nlike to avoid.\n  That being said, Senator Dodd does raise a good point when he reminds \nus that many of the cosponsors of the Election Reform Act serve on the \nAppropriations Committee. On the other side, one of the great fears of \nthose who I represent with this amendment is that future congresses \nwill not share the same commitment. It is my hope and I'm sure the hope \nof all of the cosponsors of this amendment that the appropriators will \nendeavor to fund fully all of the provisions within the bill. I accept \nthe assurances of my colleague address this concern more fully in \nconference. To that end, I'm willing to work with my colleague on this \nissue and modify my amendment. I am sending the modification to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2934), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPLIANCE WITH ELECTION \n                   TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that full funding be provided \n     to each State and locality to meet the requirements relating \n     to compliance with election technology and administration \n     pursuant to this Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this modification expresses the sense of \nthe whole Senate to do what both Senator Dodd and I are so concerned \nabout. It shows that all 100 Senators agree with Senators Ensign, \nBurns, Thomas and me that full funding of this act must be guaranteed \nto states and localities. While this is not the version of the \namendment that I would have preferred, I believe that it will assure \nthe supporters of the original amendment that there will be appropriate \nfunding. I urge adoption of the amendment, as modified.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I agree. I thank my friend from Utah, the \nSenator from Nevada, and the Senator from Montana. Everyone feels very \nstrongly about this in the difficult times for all of our \njurisdictions. That is why we have not made this a percentage mandate \nbut a 100-percent Federal budget, and becoming a far better partner \nwith our States and localities in the conduct of elections.\n  I enthusiastically support this modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2934), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2935\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2935.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment, No. 2935, is printed in the Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted''.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to offer another amendment to the \nbipartisan Equal Protection and Voting Rights Act of 2002. First let me \nthank my colleagues Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond, Schumer, McCain, \nTorricelli, and others for all the hard work that they have put into \nthis bill. I also want to thank Senator Leahy for cosponsoring this \namendment, which will lay the groundwork for integrating new technology \ninto the political process. Senator Leahy's knowledge and support of \ntechnological issues made his input invaluable.\n  As Americans, we have the right to participate in the greatest \ndemocracy in the world, and most will agree that the act of voting is \nthe bedrock of our democratic society. Americans take pride in the role \nthey play in shaping issues and determining their leaders, and yet, we \nsee that voter participation in recent years has decreased among people \nof all ages, races, and gender. I find these statistics both \ndisappointing and tragic because, as Thomas Jefferson stated, ``that \ngovernment is the strongest of which every man himself feels a part.''\n  Why is voter turnout so low? Of the 21.3 million people who \nregistered but did not vote in the 1996 election, more than one in five \nreported that they did not vote because they could not take time off of \nwork or school or because they were too busy. Can technological \nadvances, like the Internet, increase participation in the electoral \nprocess by making voter registration easier or by simplifying the \nmethod of voting itself? As the elected representatives of the people, \nwe should consider every option available that might help involve more \nof our country's citizens in America's democratic process. Federal, \nState, and local governments are duty bound to encourage all eligible \nAmericans to exercise their right to vote.\n  In the past, attempts have been made to increase voter registration \nand turnout. Unfortunately, these attempts have met with limited \nsuccess. The Motor Voter Act of 1993, for example, attempted to \nincrease voter participation by permitting the registration of voters \nin conjunction with the issuance of driver's licenses. According to the \nU.S. Census Bureau, 28 percent of the 19.5 million people who have \nregistered to vote since 1995 have done so at their local Department of \nMotor Vehicles, the single highest method compared to any other form of \nregistration. Notwithstanding this simplified voter registration \nprocedure, voter participation continues to decline. Although \nregistering to vote at the DMV generally is more convenient than other \nmethods of registration, a substantial portion of registered voters \nnevertheless continue to fail to register to vote and fail to go to the \npolls on election day.\n\n  Voting via the Internet has been suggested as one possible solution \nto the problem. The Internet has revolutionized the way people \ncommunicate and conduct business by permitting millions of people to \naccess the world instantaneously, at the click of a mouse. The Internet \nhas already increased voter awareness on issues of public policy as \nwell as on candidates and their views. In the future, the Internet may \nvery well increase voter registration and participation, and thereby \nstrengthen our country's electoral process.\n  As many of us have seen in the recent past, more and more states are \nlooking at ways to utilize the Internet in the political process. \nProposals include online voter registration, online access to voter \ninformation, and online voting. State and local officials around the \ncountry are anxious to use the Internet to foster civic action. I think \nthat this is a positive step. Real questions remain, however, as to the \nfeasibility of securely using the Internet for these functions. How can \nwe be sure that the person who registers to vote online is whom he or \nshe claims to be? How can we ensure that an Internet voting process is \nfree from fraud? How much will this technology cost? There are also \nimportant sociological and political questions to consider. For \nexample, will options such as online registration and voting increase \npolitical participation or could the Internet be equitably used in the \npolitical process? These and other questions deserve our attention.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment addresses these issues in two ways: No. 1, \nit establishes an advisory committee that will provide a necessary \nframework for discussing the possible uses and abuses of the Internet \nin the voting process;\n  And No. 2, it directs the Attorney General to review existing \ncriminal statutes and penalties and to report to Congress and the \nadvisory committee whether additional penalties for interfering with \nonline registration and voting are needed.\n  No American who has exercised his or her rights to vote should ever \nhave to wonder if their properly cast vote will be counted. We must \npreserve the integrity of the voting process and I commend the efforts \nof those who have drafted this bill. The Hatch-Leahy amendment \ncomplements the bill and will help to ensure the legitimacy of the \nvoting process. As we continue to address the current problems with our \nvoting process, we can and should take this opportunity to examine the \nimpact of new technologies on our elections.\n  Many States already allow for portions of the voter registration \nprocess to be completed online. The Arizona State Democratic Party \nallowed online voting in the 2000 presidential primary and nearly \n36,000 Arizona Democrats took advantage of this opportunity. We can \nanticipate that this trend toward online voting will continue. To make \nclear our desire to hold elections free from fraud, this amendment \nrequests the Attorney General to study whether our criminal code \nprovides adequate penalties to punish and deter interference with \nonline registration and voting.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment will also create the ``Advisory Committee \non the Internet and the Electoral Process.'' This committee, comprised \nof federal, state, and local officials, as well as representatives of \nthe high-tech industry and academia, will investigate the practicality, \nfeasibility, and advisability of using the Internet in the voting \nprocess. The report generated by this committee will provide a much \nneeded framework for discussing important issues related to Internet \nvoting. New technology has enhanced many aspects of our lives, and \nperhaps it can be used to enhance our civic lives as well.\n  Can registering and voting online really work? We must carefully \nevaluate the issues that will arise as the civic privilege of voting \nmeets with technological advances. Proponents of ``electronic \nvoting''--so-called e-voting''--contend that there are numerous \nadvantages to this emerging type of ``cyber'' political participation, \nincluding the immediate disclosure of campaign contributions, an \nincrease in the number of grassroots volunteers, and the creation of a \nmore accessible forum for political advertising. Skeptics assert, to \nthe contrary, that e-voting would only serve to decrease ``real'' \nelectoral participation, place personal privacy at risk and pave the \nway for election fraud. The late Senator Sam Ervin opposed simplifying \nvoter registration and voting, stating that he did not ``believe [in] \nmaking it easy for apathetic, lazy people'' to vote. I do not know \nwhether online voter registration and e-voting will halt the decline in \nvoter participation; I do not know whether online voter registration \nand e-voting even is wise. I firmly believe, however, that this issue \ndeserves serious examination as we seek to ensure that our democratic \nrepublic engages as many citizens as is possible.\n  As we seek to ensure equal access to the voting place and the \nintegrity of the voting process, it would be irresponsible of us to \nignore the potential\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\neffects, both good and bad, that new technology will have on the \npolitical process. The importance of the issue demands we take the \nopportunity to explore these possibilities. The Hatch-Leahy amendment \nproposes important forward-looking measures that will ensure our \nability to properly integrate new technology in the political process.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor on this amendment. Then I will \nbring up one more amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, this is a study to be done on Internet \nvoting. As my friend from Utah points out, there are jurisdictions \nwhich are examining how this would work. Obviously, there are some very \nserious problems one might face on privacy issues and the like with \nInternet voting. We have accepted a number of amendments that look at \nstudies to be done to report back to us on this area.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you are willing to accept the amendment, that will be \nfine.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to make sure my colleague from Kentucky is all right \non this amendment. I am fine with it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Shall we wait on that with the understanding you will \ncheck and see?\n  Mr. DODD. Why don't we wait until he comes to the Chamber--I want to \ngive him a chance to respond to this--and temporarily lay this aside?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine.\n  Mr. DODD. And then come back to it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside and I be permitted to bring up one more \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send another amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I discussed with the distinguished \nmanager an opportunity to speak for just a few minutes in morning \nbusiness. I could not be in the Chamber before. So I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, my colleague from Georgia \nhas been very patient. He has an amendment to offer on the bill. Can we \nlimit this statement? How much time does the Senator from Pennsylvania \nneed?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Georgia has decided the 4 minutes is an \nappropriate time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the completion of \nthe remarks of the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Georgia \nbe recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2936\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use one of \nSenator McConnell's relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2936.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To make the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n                               permanent)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MAKING THE PROVISIONS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF \n                   1965 PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) Permanency of Preclearance Requirements.--Section \n     4(a)(8) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973b(a)(8)) is amended to read as follows:\n         ``(8) The provisions of this section shall not expire.''.\n       (b) Permanency of Bilingual Election Requirements.--Section \n     203(b)(1) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973aa-\n     1a(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``Before August 6, 2007, no \n     covered State'' and insert ``No covered State''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Just one moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Is this the amendment on the----\n  Mr. HATCH. Bilingual.\n  Mr. DODD. Could I urge my colleague, on this one, because there is \ngoing to be objection raised by the Senator from Vermont, among \nothers--we have the Senator from Georgia waiting to offer an amendment. \nThis is going to take some work. So I would urge my colleague to maybe \nwithdraw the amendment temporarily.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why don't I make a very short set of remarks, and then you \ncan set it aside, and we can decide what to do later. Is that OK?\n  Mr. DODD. I urge the Senator to withdraw it temporarily so it is not \nhanging out here, so we can try to work on it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me leave it, you can set it aside, and then we will \nwork on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I offer an amendment to a provision \nof the Voting Rights Act that I introduced and we adopted in 1992. That \nlaw required the States to provide for election materials in Spanish, \nAsian languages, as well as Native American languages.\n  I am proud of that law. I am well aware of the excitement that new \ncitizens, often senior citizens, experience on the day they first leave \ntheir home to vote as American citizens for the very first time, \nsometimes accompanied by their English-speaking children and \ngrandchildren. Imagine that, Madam President.\n  But that excitement turns to terrible anxiety when they find that \nthey cannot understand English language instructions that we English-\nspeakers take for granted. Out 1992 amendment changed that for millions \nof our newest Americans of Hispanic and Asian descent, as well as the \ndescendants of our first Americans.\n  The law has worked, and so today I offer an amendment to make \npermanent the requirement of these bilingual facilities, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  Similarly, my amendment also makes permanent provisions of the Voting \nRights Act that have withstood the test of almost 30 years of periodic \nextensions. Rather than extend these civil rights protections \nrepeatedly, I think we should make them permanent.\n  That is all I have to say. I would be happy to have it set aside. We \ncan debate this issue later as necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand this amendment is going to \nbe set aside. I am glad to see that. This amendment is premature. It \nwould be an extension of the Voting Rights Act absent any hearings of \nany sort.\n  We have the current difficulty, as we have seen, of an extremely \nactivist U.S. Supreme Court which basically acts as a kind of super \nlegislature and has been setting aside act after act of the Congress, \neven some that have had years of hearings. I would be concerned that \nwhen they set aside acts of Congress passed by very solid majorities, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, following years of hearings, what they \nmight do on something like this that has not had a hearing.\n  The Supreme Court's 1997 decision in City of Boerne v. Flores \nprovides an instructive example. In that case, the Court distinguished \nbetween the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993--which it \ninvalidated--and the Voting Rights Act. The Court criticized the lack \nof evidence of religious bigotry Congress had adduced to support its \npassage of the RFRA. Conversely, it said, Congress had developed a \nrecord of widespread bigotry to support its passage of the Voting \nRights Act. I believe the Court overstepped its bounds and thwarted \nCongress' will through this decision, and I fear the same could happen \nif we hastily make the Voting Rights Act permanent without establishing \nan ample record of why such a decision is necessary. There is no need \nfor such haste--we should make the Voting Rights Act permanent, but we \nshould do it in a way that would withstand challenge before even the \nmost skeptical court.\n  Am I correct that the amendment has now been withdrawn?\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been withdrawn. The \nSenator from Utah stated that it would be set aside.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am happy to have the amendment set \naside if I could work on it with my colleagues. I am happy to ask \nunanimous consent that it be set aside so that we can work on it with \nour colleagues and resolve any difficulties. I can't imagine any \ndifficulties, but if there are, we will try and resolve them. If not, \nwe will vote on it later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2883\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nalong with my colleague from Georgia, Senator Miller, who is a \ncosponsor to S. 565, as amended by the Dodd substitute. I understand \nthe amendment has been sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland], for himself and Mr. \n     Miller, proposes an amendment numbered 2883:\n       Amend section 1(a) to read as follows:\n       (a) Short title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Martin \n     Luther King, Jr. Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of \n     2001''.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, as read by the clerk, this is a simple \nbut important amendment. This amendment will change the title of the \nEqual Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001 to the ``Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2001.'' I believe \nthat it is appropriate to name this legislation after the man who \nfought for equal voting rights for all Americans, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., a man who had a vast and distinguished record of public \nservice to the American people.\n  As one of the premier champions of basic human rights, Dr. King \nworked tirelessly to combat segregation, discrimination, and racial \ninjustice. In 1963, Dr. King led the march on Washington, DC, that was \nfollowed by his famous address, the ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Through \nhis work and reliance on nonviolent protest, Dr. King was instrumental \nin the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965. Despite efforts to derail his mission, Dr. King acted on \nhis dream of America and succeeded in making the United States a better \nplace.\n  I believe this is an appropriate time and place to honor Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., the foremost leader of the civil rights movement, for \nhis contributions to this Nation in ensuring that all Americans have \nthe right to vote. I would like to thank Senator Miller for his support \nof this amendment, and I thank Senator Dodd for the opportunity to \nspeak about this matter on the floor this afternoon.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and attach Dr. King's \nname to this important bill during the month of February, a time when \nwe recognize the achievements of African Americans in this great nation \nof ours.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2906\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nto the important election bill that is being considered. I note that \nthe Presiding Officer has been deeply involved in the crafting of this \nlegislation, along with Senator Dodd, Senator McConnell, and others. It \ndoes put us in a very good position to be able to tell Americans that \nwe have heard their concerns about our electoral system and we are \nmoving to address them.\n  I applaud the President for putting $1.2 billion in his budget to be \nable to fund the requirements that will fall upon the States as they \nattempt to bring their electoral system in line with what is really \nrequired for a modern Federal election system to function.\n  I have introduced this amendment, referred to as the residual vote \nerror rates amendment, a rather complicated description that I will get \nto in a minute, because I think it is imperative that we address what \nwere the legitimate concerns not only in this last Presidential \nelection, but in elections prior to it, because year after year, not \njust in the year 2000, ballots have not been counted because of what \nare referred to as ``residual votes.'' These are overvotes and \nundervotes, and spoiled votes.\n  According to the definitive Caltech/MIT report:\n\n       Over the past four Presidential elections, the rate of \n     residual votes was slightly over 2 percent. This means that \n     in a typical Presidential election over 2 million voters did \n     not have their Presidential vote recorded for their ballots.\n\n  The percentage of discarded ballots is even higher in Senate \nelections--approximately 5 percent.\n  In other words, almost 5 million votes are not recorded for other \nprominent statewide offices.\n  Now, in the vast majority of these cases, voters actually believed \nthey were recording their votes, even though their ballots were \nultimately discarded.\n  Because of this pattern of discarded votes, so-called residual votes, \nbased on unintentional human error, the Ford-Carter commission, chaired \nby former President Gerald Ford and former President Jimmy Carter, \nrecommended unanimously that Congress focus not just on machine errors \nin improving our election system but on the unintentional human errors \nthat make up the bulk of what denies our citizens their vote from being \ncounted. The commission, acting unanimously--Republicans, Democrats, \nindependents, academics, people with political experience, all walks of \nlife--made this unanimous recommendation because they concluded that \nonly by measuring the rate of residual vote errors will we be able to \nassess effectively whether the voting process as a whole is giving \ncitizens an equal opportunity to have their votes counted.\n  That is why I have offered this amendment, which would require the \nOffice of Election Administration--which is called for in the \nunderlying bill--to set a residual vote error rate standard, or \nbenchmark. In other words, just as we are asking the Office of Election \nAdministration to set a standard for mechanical errors--you know, you \npull the lever, put the punch card in a machine, and something goes \nwrong, and the machine, because of mechanical error, doesn't count your \nvote--in the bill we are asking the Office of Election Administration \nto set a benchmark, so that we will make sure that mechanical errors \nare corrected. Well, similarly, I am asking in this amendment that we \nset such a standard or benchmark for the residual errors, votes that \nare never counted, so that we keep those votes to the barest possible \nminimum.\n  This proposed standard is 100 percent in keeping with the other \nvoting standards in the bill, including the voting system standard that \nrequires the Office of Election Administration to make sure that we \nhave a system nationwide that, in Federal elections, ensures that \nmechanical errors for people in one State are counted in the same way \nas for people in another State. Similarly, these unintentional human \nerrors should be held to the same standard.\n  Now, a mechanical error rate standard, I agree, will certainly be \nhelpful in improving the election system; but, unfortunately, it does \nnot address the most significant cause of discarded votes.\n  Just think back to those weeks, those torturous weeks when we had to \ngo through the recounting of votes to try to determine what was the \nvoter's intent. Most States have such a standard in State law, and the \nStates use their systems to determine the outcome once a challenge is \nmade and\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nthen to figure out how they are going to appropriately address it by \ncounting those votes and trying to meet the standard that the State \nsets.\n  We need a similar standard for Federal elections. This amendment will \nprovide greater assurance that all voters in any Federal election are \nprotected.\n  Some people have said in discussing this amendment with me that this \nmay result in suits being brought against States. As I understand the \nbill, it gives the Attorney General the authority to bring a civil \naction against States that fail to comply with any standard. This \namendment is no different. It does not put an additional burden on the \nStates, nor does it put an additional burden on the Attorney General. \nIn any event, States will have more funding and more than 7 years to \ncomply since jurisdictions that receive grant funds to meet voting \nsystem standard requirements will be deemed in compliance until the \nyear 2010.\n  We are not asking any different process than what has already been \nestablished in the bill for the mechanical error rate.\n  I also think it is important to recognize that this amendment does \nnot address what happened solely in the Presidential election of 2000. \nIn fact, on the contrary, both the Caltech-MIT report and the Ford-\nCarter commission have told us that we discovered a problem that has \nbeen, unfortunately, widespread throughout our country for many \nelections.\n  That is why this amendment is supported by the AARP, the League of \nWomen Voters, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the AFL-CIO, \nthe U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, and many other groups that are concerned that if we leave \nthis particular issue unaddressed, we have not given our citizens the \nassurance they deserve that their votes will count.\n  In closing, I hope we are able to obtain the support needed for this \nresidual vote error amendment so that we can be sure we are not only \ntaking care of the machines that break down, but we are taking care of \nthose unintentional errors that may cause a breakdown in the individual \ncitizen being able to have his or her vote counted.\n  I hope for the sake of all Americans we will ensure that we can have \nthe utmost faith in our election system, and I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in consultation with the two leaders and \nwith my colleague from Kentucky, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate vote in relation to the Cleland amendment No. 2883 at 4:55 p.m., \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to that vote.\n  As a source of information for my colleagues, there will be two votes \nbased on an earlier unanimous consent agreement. There will be a vote \non a judicial nomination immediately following the vote on the Cleland \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. I believe the hour of 4:55 p.m. has \narrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I offer on behalf of myself \nand the Senator from Oregon--joined as cosponsors by the Senators from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray and Ms. Cantwell; my colleague from New York, \nSenator Clinton; the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin; as well as \nSenators Bingaman, Hollings, and Kerry--is a very simple amendment. It \ndeals with the issue of signature on first-time voters.\n  First, before I begin, I commend my colleague, Senator Bond, for his \nefforts to include provisions in this bill that address voter fraud. \nAll of us--Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond, and Torricelli, and I--who \nworked so long and hard on this bill realize that part of the glue of \nthe compromise of this bill was to make sure there were antifraud \nprovisions in it. When an election is tainted by fraud, it not only \ncasts doubt over the outcome and a pall over the victor but, more \nimportantly, it shakes the voters' faith in our system, undermines each \nand every ballot that was cast. I believe that the Senator from \nMissouri--and I know my colleague from Connecticut would join me--\ndeserves a great deal of credit for crafting antifraud provisions. One \nof them has, however, created some real problems that the amendment the \nSenator from Oregon and I have introduced seeks to correct.\n\n  The bill currently requires first-time voters who registered by mail \nto provide either a photo ID or a copy of a utility bill, a bank \nstatement, a government paycheck, or other government document that \nshows the name or address of the voter. On the surface, that sounds to \nbe a very reasonable requirement. But once you begin to scratch the \nsurface, you discover it could easily disenfranchise countless eligible \nvoters.\n  The amendment I offer today, with Senator Wyden, will allow States to \nuse signature verification and attestation, in addition to a photo ID \nand government checks, to verify voters; or a State can opt to only use \na signature verification system, which is what we have done for decades \nin my State of New York with very good results. With these additions, \nwe can be just as tough on voter fraud without turning away eligible \nvoters. And there, my colleagues, is the careful balance of this bill. \nWe do want to come down on voter fraud, but at the same time we must be \nmindful of the fact that the very thrust of this legislation is to make \nsure that every vote counts and to make sure that those who wish to \nvote, and wish to vote properly and legally, are able to do so as \neasily as possible.\n  That is the ultimate balance we seek. We believe this amendment \nrestores that balance. When we don't have that amendment, balance is \nnot restored and we will not do anything further to prevent voter \nfraud, but we will turn away thousands--nay, tens of thousands of \neligible voters in States such as mine that have this system.\n  I have heard from election officials in my State, and I have heard \nfrom other States as well. The current provisions will disenfranchise \nvoters and, at the same time, create an administrative problem for the \nmany States that have used signature or attestation as the way of \nverifying that the person who comes to the ballot, to the polling \nplace, is that person indeed.\n  I have copies of letters from the secretaries of state of Alaska, \nKentucky, and North Carolina, for instance, expressing strong \nreservations about the provisions and urging that they be changed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              State of Alaska,\n\n                                                February 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I understand that the elections \n     reform legislation, S. 565, is currently being debated by the \n     Senate. I have just returned from a meeting of the National \n     Association of Secretaries of State, at which this election \n     reform bill was a major focus.\n       The bill contains many positive provisions. Alaska's \n     election system is well ahead in many areas, and many of the \n     major sections in the bill will not have a great impact on \n     Alaska because we are already in compliance with them.\n       I do have a major concern that I ask you to consider as you \n     and your colleagues work on\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n     this bill. Under the current provisions, the bill would \n     impose federal requirements for verification of voter \n     identification. Verification of some kind is a good idea, but \n     the type of verification should be left up to states so it \n     can be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each \n     state.\n       Let me give two simple examples of how mandated federal \n     requirements could lead to the unintended consequence of \n     discouraging or even disenfranchising voters:\n       S. 565 mandates that voters show photo identification in \n     order to vote. In Alaska, this provision will create an \n     unnecessary burden on rural Alaskans who live in communities \n     with no means of obtaining photo IDs. It will effectively \n     disenfranchise them (even though, ironically, they will \n     almost certainly be personally known to the poll workers).\n       S. 565 would require first-time by-mail voters to send in \n     proof of their identity with their ballot. This provision is \n     likely to cause confusion and result in many ballots being \n     unnecessarily disqualified because first-time voters forget \n     to send in their documentation, or they send it in the wrong \n     envelope. (These are just the kind of voters we want to \n     encourage to participate in the democratic process, yet they \n     are the most likely to be discouraged by this requirement!) \n     There are other, equally effective ways to verify voter \n     identification, such as allowing states to verify the \n     signature on the voting envelope with the original signature \n     on the voter registration form.\n       As I understand it, Senator Wyden may propose an amendment \n     to address this issue. if this is the case, I would \n     appreciate your support for this amendment, and if you can \n     co-sponsor it, that would be even better.\n       I fully support the objective of effectively verifying the \n     identity of voters and even requiring that each state have a \n     system in place to do this, but I ask you to leave it up to \n     states to decide how best to accomplish that. Although well-\n     intended, voter verification mandates in S. 565 will have the \n     unintended consequence of discouraging or even \n     disenfranchising qualified voters, and it will have an \n     especially harsh impact on Alaska.\n       I appreciate your consideration of this matter, and I truly \n     appreciate the time and effort you are devoting to improving \n     election processes throughout the nation.\n       Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this week \n     while I was in Washington. I very much appreciated the \n     opportunity to talk with you about issues of importance to \n     Alaska.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fran Ulmer,\n     Lieutenant Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                             Office of the Secretary of State,\n\n                                 Frankfort, KY, February 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McConnell and Bond: I am writing to express \n     my concern regarding a provision in the substitute to S. 565, \n     the Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act, that you and \n     Senators Dodd and Schumer recently developed.\n       This legislation would require states to set up a photo ID \n     program for individuals who have registered to vote by mail. \n     Such a requirement would be administratively burdensome, \n     could lead to discrimination or charges of discrimination, \n     would undermine voter participation through absentee \n     balloting, and is not the best way to meet the stated goal of \n     preventing vote fraud.\n       The photo ID requirement currently in the legislation would \n     put election workers and election directors in the position \n     of administering the program. They would have to determine \n     what photo IDs are acceptable. They would have to determine \n     which voters would be subject to the requirement. And they \n     would have to administer the program at busy polling places.\n       A photo ID requirement is widely suspect in minority \n     communities. I am concerned that it would result in \n     additional charges of discrimination at a time when we are \n     trying to build greater trust in our election systems. \n     Election officials would be on the front line defending \n     against such charges.\n       It is clear that the photo ID requirement would undermine \n     voter participation through absentee balloting. The \n     requirement would make it more difficult to cast an absentee \n     ballot because copies of IDs, as required for absentee voting \n     under the bill, are difficult for many, including the aged \n     and person with disabilities, to obtain. Vote-by-mail has \n     promise for increasing voter participation, and we believe \n     that concerns about fraud can be dealt with in other ways.\n       I share with the bill's sponsors concern about preventing \n     possible fraud. That is one of the reasons that many states \n     have moved to signature verification systems. I urge you to \n     work with the other sponsors to allow states to accept \n     signatures for verification as part of the ID system. No only \n     are such systems easier to administer at the polling place, \n     they are also consistent with well-run absentee ballot \n     programs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John Y. Brown III,\n     Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Department of the\n\n\n                                           Secretary of State,\n\n                                   Raleigh, NC, February 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McConnell and Bond: I am writing to express \n     some concerns I have regarding a provision in the substitute \n     to Senate Bill 565, the Equal Protection of Voting Rights \n     Act, recently developed with Senators Dodd and Schumer.\n       I share with many the concerns about preventing possible \n     fraud. The photo ID program for individuals who have \n     registered to vote by mail creates not only an administrative \n     burden on election officials, but the overall effect will be \n     a tremendous chill on voting rights. In my opinion, it is not \n     the best way to address the issue of potential voter fraud.\n       The practical application of the ID requirement will create \n     an entirely new layer for misunderstanding, miscommunication, \n     potential discrimination and have serious side effects of \n     suppression of voting in the name of preventing fraud. \n     Election officials should not be in the business of \n     determining what type of photo ID's are acceptable, and what \n     other form of identification will be appropriate.\n       The photo ID requirement will undermine rather than enhance \n     voter participation. Absentee balloting processes would be \n     impeded, especially in elderly communities, disabled \n     communities and others. While many people in this country \n     have home copy machines, many others have no knowledge as \n     where to find a public copy machine, or access to it within \n     their community.\n       The concern about preventing possible fraud is an important \n     one, but there are a number of other ways that fraud can be \n     addressed without requiring election officials to be decision \n     makers in this area.\n       Let me relate a personal story from just this morning that \n     will indicate the photo ID system is certainly not a ``be \n     all, end all'' answer to this issue. Since September 11, the \n     Capital Police Corp of North Carolina government is providing \n     security for all doors into the building that houses the \n     Secretary of State's Office and the Department of Revenue. A \n     new security officer was on the door I used today. This \n     individual asked for my photo ID. I flipped open my case \n     where my photo ID is usually contained, and demonstrated it \n     to the guard who immediately waved me through after looking \n     at the card. As I closed the holder I noticed that my photo \n     ID was not there, because I had used it the prior day for air \n     travel and it was still in a jacket pocket having not been \n     returned to its regular position. In fact, the guard glanced \n     at my social security card with my name printed and a social \n     security number, but no photo whatsoever, and someone who did \n     not know whether I was the elected Secretary of State or an \n     international terrorist waved me on through.\n       As you can see the systems we have in place as operated by \n     humans are ripe with many opportunities for either intended \n     or unintended consequences. Thank you for your work on this \n     very important issue, but the photo ID requirement is a \n     burden that does not need to be placed on the electoral \n     system in this country.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Elaine F. Marshall.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The public also feels strongly about the Schumer-Wyden \namendment, as does the AARP, the League of Women Voters, the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, NAACP, United Cerebral Palsy \nAssociation, and the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, to name a few \nof the many groups that oppose the provision as it stands. I say to my \ncolleagues and those in the civil rights community, I thank them for \nworking so closely with us on this amendment. We believe this \nprovision, unamended, could undo lots of the progress we have made in \nthe last decade to allow people to vote. In many areas, it could undo \nthe significance of the motor voter law which allows people to register \nat their motor vehicle department or other places.\n  Some of the voters who could be disenfranchised by the current \nprovisions include, first, the elderly. Seniors vote in large numbers. \nIn fact, the FEC estimated that, in 1998, 61.3 percent of all Americans \nover 65 voted. However, this provision established real barriers to the \npolls for older Americans. As the AARP explains:\n\n       The bill's photo ID requirements are particularly \n     problematic for many senior citizens. Alternate approaches, \n     such as signature match and verification, already \n     successfully used by the majority of States, could enhance \n     the antifraud provisions without having a chilling effect on \n     voter participation.\n\n  That is from William D. Novelli, executive director and CEO of AARP. \nThe point he makes is well taken. Again, you have lots of people who \ncannot use the provisions in the bill. I know my\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\ncolleague from Missouri will say: It is easy, everybody has a photo ID.\n  Well, not everybody does. Lots of senior citizens don't drive, and \nthere is no other photo ID available. Or some might say that everybody \ncan bring a utility bill. What about two people with different names \nand sharing a house and one has the name on the utility bill? What does \nthe other do? It is not so easy.\n  Again, since in this bill we want to err on the side of allowing \npeople to vote, provided it is done in an honest way--nobody wants to \nsee fraud--we have to have this amendment.\n  How about students? Voting-age high school students may not have a \nphoto ID. They certainly--many of them--would not have a government \ncheck or a utility bill in their name. College students who live out of \nState could be affected by these provisions. Again, with one phone in a \nsuite which six college students are sharing--there is no utility bill, \nno electricity bill in most college dorms. There are lots of students \nwho don't have licenses, particularly in urban areas. What would they \ndo? These are the kinds of people--young people--whom we most have to \nbring into the system and get into the habit of voting. Turning them \naway sends the wrong message at a time we can least afford it.\n  How about the disabled? Don't ask me; talk to the experts. The \nAmerican Association of People with Disabilities explained:\n\n       A photo ID requirement would place an onerous burden on the \n     millions of Americans with disabilities that do not drive--\n\n  Obviously, many don't--\n\n       or do not live independently, and do not have access to a \n     utility statement or bank account with their name on it. \n     Signature verification is needed as an acceptable form of \n     identification for Americans with disabilities to protect \n     their fundamental right to vote.\n\n  That is signed by Andrew J. Imparato, president and CEO of the AAPD.\n  One of the things my colleague from Connecticut has worked long and \nhard on, with great success, is making it easier for the disabled to \nvote. This bill does it. He did a fine job on that. It would be tragic \nto give with one hand and take away with another by not having the \nSchumer-Wyden bill added to the provision.\n  How about those who vote by mail? I am sure my colleague from Oregon \nand my colleague from Washington, who are cosponsors of this amendment, \nwill discuss the impact of this provision on the mail-in voters, in \nwhich their States specialized. I point out that it would make this \nprovision, without the Schumer-Wyden amendment, more difficult for \npeople to vote by mail. In States such as Oregon and Washington, where \nvoter participation has risen following increased reliance on mail-in \nvoting, this provision could cause voter participation numbers to \nslide.\n  Finally, minority voters. Both a Federal court and the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice have held that photo ID requirements adversely \nimpact minority voters. Don't listen to me, or even some of the \nadvocates, if you may be dubious of them. What about a Federal judge \nexamining this issue? Morris v. Lawrence held that:\n\n       The burden imposed by this requirement will fall \n     disproportionately on the Latin American community.\n\n  The Department of Justice, which has examined this issue, while \nenforcing section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, stated:\n\n       The imposition of the driver's license picture \n     identification requirement is likely to have a \n     disproportionately adverse impact on black voters in the \n     State, and will lessen their political participation \n     opportunities.\n\n  I know if you come from a State that doesn't have a large urban area, \nyou may think: Well, what are they talking about? Everybody has a \ndriver's license. Everybody has a utility bill. The only reason to pass \nthis is to allow people to defraud.\n  Absolutely not. Absolutely not. In my own State of New York, I have \nbeen very concerned as we have debated this bill and crafted this bill, \nas my good friend from Missouri knows from the many meetings we have \nhad, that this provision could unintentionally disenfranchise many \nvoters, particularly in a city such as New York City where people are \nless likely to have driver's licenses. Some members of my own staff--\npeople who could not be more involved in the political process--don't \nhave driver's licenses and could be prohibited from voting under this \nprovision.\n  Let me give my colleagues a statistic. Of the 8 million people who \nlive in New York City--obviously, some are underage, but not half, not \nclose to half--only 3 million have driver's licenses. If you want to \nkeep New Yorkers from voting, it is a good provision; otherwise, it \nfails on every level.\n  In fact, we have a system in New York that has been extremely \nsuccessful at deterring voter fraud without creating new barriers for \nvoters. So do many other States. That is why secretaries of state \naround the country are scratching their heads and wondering: Why won't \nwe include signature and attestation as a way to allow voters to show \nthey are the voter? We use signatures everywhere else.\n  When one cashes a check, a bank does not make them send in a utility \nbill or a driver's license. You can, yes. Can some people work and \npractice and try to forge a signature? Yes. We have counterfeiters. We \nhave people who forge checks. But believe me--and I have talked about \nthis with my good friend from Missouri--if someone is really out to \ncreate fraud, they can do it with a photo ID, and they can certainly do \nit with a utility bill.\n  In New York, our system of signature has been more successful, I \nwould argue, than most other systems in preventing fraud. Here is how \nit works. Every voter in New York--not just first-time voters--is \nrequired to go through the following identification procedure--as my \ncolleagues know, the bill only deals with first-time voters: When you \nregister in New York, you must sign the registration materials. They \nare then scanned into a computer. The digitalized signature is then \npasted into the poll roster.\n  On election day, each voter is required to sign the poll roster next \nto, but without seeing, the digitalized signature. Poll workers then \ncompare the signatures, and if there is any question about the \nsignature, the poll worker is authorized to challenge the signature. \nPoll workers do it all the time, and as a result, we have been able to \nprevent voter fraud without preventing eligible voters from exercising \ntheir rights.\n  New York is not alone. According to the GAO, 19 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia use a signature verification or attestation \nprocedure for verifying the eligibility of voters. An additional 22 \nStates--that is 41 all together and the District--use a signature \nsystem in conjunction with something else.\n  This amendment serves a simple purpose. It allows those States to \ncontinue to use the signature procedures that they are effectively \nusing now.\n  I say to my colleagues, this bill has very fine intent. It is to \nprevent the mistakes of 2000. In addition, it is to prevent voter \nfraud. I salute the Senator from Missouri once again--I did earlier \nbefore he was in the room--for working hard on those provisions, but \nits overall purpose is to make sure that people who are eligible to \nvote can vote and have their votes be counted.\n  It would be tragic if all the progress we made with so many of the \nother provisions in this bill were taken back by our failure to allow \nsignature verification or attestation, and so many who want to vote \nwould be refused from voting.\n  I say to my colleague from Missouri, as all of us who are in this \nprofession, I am very interested in polling places, and I am always \ngoing around election time. I see the painful looks on people's faces \nas they wait on line, and in New York, one sometimes has to wait an \nhour to an hour and a half. Our voting machines are outdated, and we \nare trying to correct that in other parts of the bill. But working \npeople have come from work, and I can see on their faces that they have \nto get home to the kids, and they have to wait on line and then they do \nnot get to vote.\n\n  We do not want that to happen. Our amendment prevents that from \nhappening. We do not want people to say because you do not have a \ndriver's license or your own utility bill, when you show up that first \ntime to exercise the very franchise that our ancestors have died for \nyou are turned down.\n  The solution proposed in the Schumer-Wyden amendment of allowing \nStates to use signature verification and attestation is effective, as \nproven by all the States that use it. It prevents fraud just as well as \nthe existing\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\nprovisions in the bill but does not have the very pointed disadvantage \nof preventing many eligible people from voting.\n  This is a bill that moves us two desperately needed steps forward: \nIncreasing accessibility to the polls and preventing voter fraud. It \nwould be a shame to include a provision in the bill that takes us one \nstep back.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a great disappointment that I rise \nto address this amendment. We worked for roughly 6 months in a \nbipartisan manner, which I previously described in this Chamber, to \nachieve a bill that truly does make it easier to vote and tougher to \ncheat.\n  Many of the ideas and concerns my colleague from New York raised were \nraised in those discussions, and we made provision to deal with all of \nthose. It was on the basis of the changes and the agreements that we \nmade that we supported this bill.\n  The Senator from New York has pointed out that maybe people still \ncheat. Frankly, I would like to have more protections, and if the \nSenator is interested in building in more protections against cheating, \nI would be more than happy to work with him on it.\n  Simply put, if this amendment is adopted, this bill will make it \neasier to vote and easier to cheat. Certainly, that is not what we are \nhere to achieve.\n  When the motor voter law became law 8 years ago, one major impact was \nto create the mail-in registration card. This section was part of the \noverall effort to make it easier to get people registered, and it has \nbeen used in many States.\n  However, because of fears even then that registration by mail could \nencourage voter fraud, a provision was also included that granted \nStates the authority to require everyone who registers by mail to vote \nin person the first time after they register. Thus, the motor voter, or \nMVRA, included a provision for first-time voters which specifically \ngranted States the authority to require those who register by mail and \nhave not previously voted in that jurisdiction to vote in person for \nthe first time.\n  To date, several States have used this provision, and now they \nrequire those who register by mail to vote in person the first time \nthey vote.\n  Unfortunately, numerous States have also discovered since the \nenactment of motor voter and its mail-in registration requirement that \na dramatic number of fake names, illegal names, and duplicate names \nhave been registered. Unfortunately, St. Louis, MO, has become the \ncurrent poster child for this abuse, but as I will show shortly, it is \nnot limited to St. Louis or to Missouri.\n  In St. Louis this past March on the final day to register before the \nmayoral primary, 3,000 mail-in registration cards were dropped off. \nHowever, due to the controversies which occurred in the November 2000 \nelection and the overall strain on the election board with just local \nraces on the ballot, election officials did a thorough review of the \ncards. Some cynics say that maybe in St. Louis it is not important if \nyou are voting for a President, a Governor, a Senator, a Congressman, \nbut when you get down to voting for a mayor, that means jobs, and \nnobody wants to see cheats in a mayoral race.\n  Election officials did a thorough review of the 3,000 cards. \nImmediately, one official noted that a deceased neighbor of his was on \nthe list. He subsequently discovered that a very well-known and highly \nrespected former alderman, ``Red'' Villa, who had died 10 years ago, \nwas reregistered, along with the deceased mother of another alderman. \nMight as well get everybody involved. Let's go through the whole ward. \nIt appears that hundreds of the cards were filled out in the same \nhandwriting.\n  If those people had been allowed to vote by signature affirmation, \nguess what. I bet the mail-in vote, the mail-in ballot, would have had \nthe same signature that was on those phony mail-in registration forms.\n  The city attorney was brought in, then the U.S. attorney, as the \nnumber of phony-looking cards jumped into the thousands. The criminal \ninvestigation is ongoing. We hope maybe we will find out just how much \nfraud was attempted in the 2001 mayoral primary.\n  However, big problem: 30,000 cards were dropped off just prior to the \nregistration deadline for the November 2000 election. They received no \npreelection screening, like nearly every other State in the country. We \ndo not know how many additional false names, dead people, duplicate \nnames, and even dogs are registered. We certainly know one famous St. \nLouis dog, Ritzy Mekler, the mixed-breed dog registered to vote several \nyears ago. Here is the registration form: Mekler, Ritzy; with address; \nplace of birth is Los Angeles; a Social Security number; date of \nregistration is 10/4/94; and here is Ritzy's signature.\n  Actually, the Senator from New York goes a little further in saying a \nmark would be good, so Ritzy could just use a paw print. All he would \nhave to do is affix a similar paw print.\n  I have a feeling whoever wrote Ritzy Mekler on that registration form \nprobably could duplicate that Ritzy Mekler signature each and every \ntime they wanted to vote. So Ritzy certainly would be advantaged if we \ngot rid of the requirement that you show proof that you are a live \nhuman being before you are allowed to vote.\n  I tell my colleagues this only to get some perspective as to what it \nis in the underlying Dodd-McConnell amendment, the new requirement that \nthose voters who choose to register by mail must prove, with some form \nof identity, an address. Whether they vote in person or by mail, they \nhave to have some proof. It is not the absolute requirement that they \nvote in person, nor is it the absolute requirement that they provide a \nphoto ID. But what we have learned the hard way in some cases over the \npast 10 years is that registering by mail and then voting by mail is a \nrecipe for vote fraud.\n  Obviously, registration by mail makes it much easier to put \nfraudulent names on the voter lists. Voting by mail makes it very easy \nto vote these names illegally. Thus, after 6 months of work, we \nachieved the McConnell-Dodd compromise which sought to address this \nproblem head on: How can we stop dogs, dead people, and people \nregistering under phony names from registering?\n\n  Section 103(b) of the Dodd-McConnell substitute recognizes the fraud \nrisks of mail-in registration coupled with mail-in voting. Thus, it \ncreates a requirement that any voter who chooses to register by mail \nmust provide some proof of identity at some point in the registration \nvoting process. Proof of identity can be accomplished by any of the \nfollowing: A current and valid photo identification. That could be a \ndriver's license, or what you have to show if you get on an airplane, \nor what you show if you want to buy cigarettes or liquor. Most people \nhave these.\n  But we didn't want to limit it to people who have a photo ID. So, No. \n2, a copy of a current utility bill that shows the name and address of \nthe voter. Or, No. 3, a copy of a current bank statement that shows the \nname, the address of the voter, or a copy of a current government check \nthat shows the name and address of the voter, or a copy of a current \npaycheck that shows the name and address of a voter, or a copy of any \nother current government document that shows the name and address of \nthe voter.\n  Thus, the point my colleague from New York made about the \ndisenfranchisement brought about by requiring a driver's license, a \nphoto ID, is not applicable. That is what we worked 6 long months to \nachieve. A voter who chooses to vote by mail to comply with the \nrequirements, by enclosing a copy of any of the above with his or her \nmail-in registration; or, two, bringing a copy of any of the above to \nthe polling place the first time they vote; or, three, enclosing a copy \nof any of the above with the mail-in absentee vote.\n  Now, it is a backstop. We even went further for voters who show up at \nthe poll who have forgotten their ID. They have not brought anything. \nThey can vote provisionally. They will be able to put in a provisional \nvote so we don't have to guess at the polls. They will cast their \nballot. It will be set aside until it can be confirmed that they are a \nlawfully registered voter entitled to vote from that place in that \nState. When they are, it will be counted.\n  Madam President, we must keep in mind that vote fraud is accomplished\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nin many different ways. Some are very simple. Some have been developed \nto a high art form in St. Louis. You can place false names on the voter \nrolls and vote them absentee. It is the easiest, usually the safest, \nparticularly if the registration and voting are all done by mail. No \nsweat, no problem. Just sign. Have everybody write down their names. \nUnder this system, I could register my colleague from New York. I \ncertainly would not do anything unlawful. But he might wind up as a \nRepublican voter in southwest Missouri with his mail-in registration \nand his signature which will match that registration on every ballot he \ncasts thereafter.\n  Or, second, you can use out-of-date voter rolls and then move people \naround to vote repeatedly, using the names of people who died or moved \nor the false names that have been placed on rolls over time. Or you can \nrun extra blank ballots through the voting machine at the end of the \nday or toss out boxes from key precincts. These are the simple things. \nWe do not deal with all of them here. They are problems that afflict \nour system across the country.\n  For anybody who thinks it is just a Missouri problem, let me assure \nyou the problem goes on nationwide. Let me give a sample of some of the \nthings we have found from news articles. The Palm Beach Post, May 28, \n2001, says that more than 5,600 people appear on a statewide list of \nsuspected felons who voted illegally on November 7, 2000, 766 of them \nvoting in Palm Beach County, 68 percent of whom were registered as \nDemocrats. The Miami Herald, January 19, 2001, reports that 452 felons \nvoted illegally on November 7, 2000; 343 were cast by Democrats, 62 by \nRepublicans. The Miami Herald, January 24, 2001: 90-year-old Cora \nThigpen voted twice in the Presidential election. I bet she would have \nliked to have voted more. I guess she ran out of steam after casting a \nsecond ballot. But hers was one of more than 2,000 illegal ballots cast \nin the election by Floridians who signed affirmations swearing they \nwere eligible to vote but were not. Poll workers never checked, \nignoring county rules that were intended to combat fraud. One poll \nworker pointed out:\n\n       There are really no safeguards. This system is set up to \n     allow people to vote.\n\n  The Florida Sun Sentinel, January 17, 2002, points out that at least \n162 ballots in Duval, 200 in Volusia, 43 in Pinellas County were from \nvoters who were ineligible. The newspaper points out that providing \nfalse information for a vote is a felony but prosecutions are rare.\n  Moving over to Texas, the Houston Chronicle reports that in 1991, a \nspecial election in Harris County revealed that in precinct 85 where \nthe election judge hired six relatives as clerks, 600 ballots were \ncounted even though only 316 voters had signed in to vote. After the \n1992 Presidential election, the vote registrar found that 6,707 illegal \nballots were cast in Harris County. Prosecutors contend that voting \nviolations are almost impossible to prosecute because the law is set up \nonly to encourage participation in elections, not to prevent voter \nfraud.\n  Moving closer to where we are now, in Virginia, the Washington Post, \non November 10, 1998, said 11,000 ineligible felons and nearly 1,500 \ndead people are registered to vote in Virginia, according to State \nauditors. In the previous November's election, 1,700 felons voted along \nwith 144 dead people. That is quite a theological accomplishment for \nVirginia.\n  State and national election specialists were quoted in that article \nas saying that part of the problem in the Federal motor voter law, \nwhich is designed to make it easier to register to vote, is that it \nalso makes it tougher to protect voter lists from fraud and error.\n  In Wisconsin, January 21, 2001, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said \n361 felons were found to have voted illegally in Milwaukee on November \n7. A review found that there were virtually no safeguards or \nnotification requirements to prevent or discourage ineligible voters \nfrom participating. It is basically an honor system. When fraud is \ndiscovered, officials say it is rarely enforced.\n  California has its own problems. I won't go into all of them. \nFebruary 1, 2002, the California Journal noted that north California \nartist Judith Selby, who often scours the beach looking for ingredients \nfor her artwork, found a lid from one of the 63 missing absentee ballot \nboxes. She recognized the importance of it so she turned the castaway \nballot box into an artistic poster entitled, ``Cast Your Vote--Away.''\n  In Colorado, a Saudi man detained by Federal authorities for \nquestioning about the September 11 terrorist attacks voted in Denver \nduring last year's Presidential election, even though he was not a U.S. \ncitizen. The Denver city clerk and recorder said it is hard for \nelection officials to discover if someone lied about their citizenship \nunless someone complains.\n  In North Carolina, a Pakistani man facing a vote fraud charge has \nbeen linked to at least two of the September 11 hijackers.\n  In Indiana, an examination of inaccurate voter rolls shows that tens \nof thousands of Indiana voters appear more than once, according to the \nIndianapolis Star of November 5, 2000. More than 300 dead people were \ndiscovered to be registered. One woman who died in April 1998 was found \nto have voted in the fall election.\n  Motor voter was partially to blame because it allows people to \nregister to vote, but it is far more difficult to rid the rolls of \ninvalid names.\n  Of course, there are our good friends in Alaska. According to an FEC \nreport, Alaska had 502,968 names on its voter rolls in 1998, but the \ncensus estimates that only 437,000 people of voting age were living in \nthe State that year.\n  How would the Schumer amendment work? Let me go through this for you. \nA vote fraud planner fills out numerous false names, uses his or her \nown address as a return address. Typical would have been multiple names \nat the same address in one household. This is a drop-house scheme. It \nis identified by the secretary of state in Missouri as one of the more \nrecently used schemes in Missouri. Eight or more adults registered from \na single family residence makes us a little suspicious that there may \nbe some phony registrations there.\n  Under current law in Missouri, as in most States, these new voters \nrequest absentee ballots, and just like that fraudulent voters are \nregistered and fraudulent votes are cast, with the same person signing \nthe fraudulent registration and signing the absentee ballot. It works \nlike clockwork.\n  Under the original compromise bill, the Dodd-McConnell amendment, \nthis huge loophole is eliminated by the simple proposition that if you \nregister by mail, you need to provide an ID before you vote the first \ntime. You can provide the ID in person or by mail, but you must provide \nan ID. The bill is very careful to provide numerous options for the ID: \nDriver's license, other photo ID, utility bills, bank statements, \ngovernment checks, or other documents--something to show name and \naddress and existence. It is pretty simple, common sense.\n  Is there a real live person behind the name? Or is it a dog? Or is it \na dead person? Or is it somebody conjured up to be a ghost resident in \nyour drop-house location?\n  Under the amendment being offered by the Senator from New York, all \nyou need to do is use the same handwriting you did to register falsely \nand you will be able to vote falsely. As I said, Ritzy Mekler could \nhave done it. She got herself registered. Somebody filled out the card. \nAs long as somebody went to the trouble to get the dog registered, \nfollows up and signs Ritzy's name, pretty much the same way when she \nvotes absentee--no problem. Ritzy's vote counts.\n  Sometimes debates are complicated and intricate. There are provisions \nthat we worked through in this bill that are very difficult. We worked \nhard to straighten them out. But this one is very simple.\n  Vote fraud is occurring. People are trying to cheat to win elections. \nThe Dodd-McConnell bill takes some basic, commonsense steps toward \neliminating some of the most obvious fraud. The Schumer amendment says: \nNo, we need to keep these fraud options open. We need to make drop-\nhouse schemes easy. We need to keep voting franchises available to \ndogs--maybe even cats.\n  For those who wish to protect the status quo, the Schumer amendment \ndoes just that. It guts section 103(b) protections in two ways. First, \nit adds two additional methods to comply with the in-person voting \nrequirements,\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nthus effectively abandoning the voter's responsibility to provide some \nindependent proof of his or her identity. Instead, the Schumer \namendment would simply require the voter to sign an affirmation that \nthey are who they say they are. It would also require the State and \nprecinct to set up a verification system that would compare the \nsignature of the individual with that of his or her registration \ndocument--as another alternative.\n  Ritzy Mekler's signature would be scanned into the machine so we \nwould know that whoever signed Ritzy Mekler was really signing Ritzy \nMekler the next time the dog voted.\n  Second, for those who vote by mail, the voter would have no \nresponsibility to show proof of identity, as none would be required \nfrom the voter. The State would instead have to set up a signature \nverification system that would, again, match the voter's signature on \ntheir ballot with that on their registration card.\n  Taken together, these provisions eliminate the proof of identity \nrequirement which is the backbone of the antifraud protection. But it \nappears to me that the Schumer amendment would actually go beyond \ngutting the identity provisions, as the scheme would roll back the \nefforts by several States to require first-time voters who register by \nmail to only be allowed to vote in person the first time after they \nregister.\n  These States: West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, \nNevada, and Louisiana, will have their efforts completely undercut by \nthe Schumer amendment.\n  Why have we not heard stories from these States that have shown that \nthe groups the Senator from New York mentioned have been so terribly \ndisadvantaged, such as the elderly voting in West Virginia, Virginia, \nTennessee, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, and Louisiana? I think their \nsystem makes common sense. St. Louis City, after the threatened vote \nfraud in the mayor's race in March of 2001, required people to show up \nwith a photo ID with their address on it. Nobody complained. As a \nmatter of fact, the citizens in St. Louis may have had an honest \nelection. It was a show stopper. The media watched closely. They \ncongratulated them, and it worked. I did not hear that people were \ndisadvantaged.\n\n  The Schumer amendment would actually protect the law--the drop-house \nscam, one of the most common vote fraud schemes used today. As I said, \nthis scheme is when one individual fills out registrations for multiple \nnames at one address. Then that same individual requests absentee \nballots for all of those names and votes all of those names in the \nprivacy of his or her own home. How simple is that?\n  The Schumer amendment and those who vote for it are simply saying go \nahead. Drop-house schemes would now be specifically protected under \nFederal law as States would not be required to allow the new mail-in to \nregister to vote in person, nor would they be allowed prior proof of \nidentity. The drop house is free and clear of any commonsense scrutiny \nby speeding that provision into States that now take some steps to \nprevent it.\n  But this is serious business. This amendment makes a mockery of the \nbusiness. Americans across this country follow the rules. They fill in \napplications honestly. They provide an identification. They stand in \nline. They are not afraid of hard work, and they care deeply about this \ncountry.\n  As the Missouri Court of Appeals said when it struck down an illegal \nvoting scheme to keep the polls open after closing time in November of \n2000, it is just as much an important part of your civil right to cast \na vote as to make sure it is not diluted by having your vote canceled \nby somebody who votes illegally.\n  The end does not justify the means. If you think it is important to \nwin an election in any way rather than win it fairly, then maybe this \nis something you want to keep open--these loopholes. I don't.\n  I have listened to an awful lot of people in Missouri who want to get \nout from under the shame of what the media has shown to have occurred \nin our elections.\n  In most of the country, everyday folks--folks you see at the coffee \nshop, the folks you see at the nursing homes--I talk to them. They \nexpress concern. They do not understand when you try to explain to them \nthat it was just too much to ask of a voter who chooses to register by \nmail to actually provide some proof of who they are and where they live \nat some point in the process.\n  So the choice is clear. The choice of the Schumer amendment comes \ndown to the question: Do we want to protect the honest voters from \nthose who would cheat them or do we protect the rights of dogs and the \ndead to register to vote, the people who operate the drop-house \nschemes, the people who operate all the other phony mail-in \nregistration schemes to continue to steal votes? What is the most \nimportant action we take as citizens in a republic? It is to cast our \nvote.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Oregon, my \nfellow sponsor of this amendment, as much time as he may consume.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I never had the chance to negotiate with \nthe distinguished senior Senator from the State of Missouri. But I can \ntell him that despite his strong views on the subject, I never would \nhave agreed to the photo ID provision in any negotiation because I \nbelieve this provision is a poison pill that is going to silence the \npolitical voices of seniors, the disabled, young people, and minorities \nfrom coast to coast.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Missouri talked about \ndiscussing it with nursing home residents. Let us talk about that for a \nmoment.\n  I was director of the Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected \nto the House of Representatives. I served on the aging committee there, \nand I serve on the aging committee here. I have dedicated my whole \nprofessional life to the cause of senior citizens. I can assure the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Missouri that there are not any \nnursing home residents in this country asking to be taken to the copy \ncenter to make Xerox copies of driver's licenses or other documents. \nThat is just not going to happen. Many of the seniors are voting by \nmail because physically going to the polls is hard for them. Forcing \nseniors to get to a library or a copy center to photocopy an \nidentification card would be just as hard as a trip to the polling \nplace.\n  I don't think the principal way to stop voter fraud is to make it \nharder for Americans to vote. The way to deter fraud is to go after it \nearly, when people fraudulently register to vote, and punish it hard. \nThat is what this bill does. That is on what the State of Oregon is \nfocusing. If someone submits a false Federal photo ID or a utility \nbill, or if somebody attempts to register a cat or a dog to vote, the \ntime to catch them is at the beginning, at the point of registration. \nIt will be a lot more difficult once the registration is in.\n  In Oregon, those who falsify their registration face up to a $100,000 \nfine and/or up to 5 years in prison and the loss of their vote. It is a \npretty stiff penalty for registering a dog. There are cases outstanding \nnow from the last election.\n  I tell my colleagues that I think there is also a question, if one \nreally wants to go after fraud. The way my State thinks they can best \ndeter fraud is, Why not figure out a way to make the registration \nprovision kick in in 2002? I think there is a real question about how \nit is that the registration provision really isn't kicking in until \n2004. I think that was an opportunity, had it be sped up, to really \nmeaningfully go after fraud and do it in a way that would not deter \nvoter participation.\n  The new photo ID or proof of address requirement for first-time \nvoters is going to create many more problems than it will solve. How \nwill the election monitors know exactly who is the first-time voter and \nwhom they should ask for a photo ID? What if only 5 people out of 50 in \na line in a polling place are singled out to produce that photo? What \nif the utility bill that Mabel Barnes brings to the polling place lists \nher as ``M. Barnes'' and the election monitor says, How do I know the \n``M'' doesn't stand for ``Mark,'' and they reject the identification? \nWhat if Mabel Barnes is an elderly widow who lives\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\nwith her daughter, has no driver's license, has no accounts in her \nname, and has her Social Security check directly deposited to her \ndaughter's bank account? In that case, Mabel Barnes, the senior \ncitizen, wouldn't meet the necessary requirements for the first-time \nvoter in the bill.\n  I say to my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from \nMissouri, that he may be talking to nursing home residents in his \nState, but I will put my 20 years of working with older people, going \nback to those days of the Gray Panthers, on the line here and say in \nthe most sincere way that I can that I think this bill's photo ID \nprovision is a poison pill. It is going to disenfranchise an awful lot \nof seniors. I do not know of any nursing home residents in this country \nwho would be asking to be taken to a copy center if this were to go \nforward. They are going to be disenfranchised. That is a reality of the \nprovision.\n\n  I would like to take a couple minutes to explain Oregon's pioneering \nvote by mail system so my colleagues will get a sense of why section \n103, if left unmodified, would be so damaging to States such as Oregon, \nand other States that rely on mail-in ballots such as Alaska, New York, \nand Washington.\n  I also say to my colleagues, I guess it is worth noting that I am the \nfirst mail-in U.S. Senator. I am the first Senator ever elected \nexclusively by mail in a campaign that was very close with my \ncolleague, my friend, Senator Smith. By the way, Senator Smith did not \ncite any evidence of voter fraud in that very closely contested \nelection, to his credit. Many certainly pushed him to do it, and he did \nnot because our system is working.\n  Enacted by nearly 70 percent of the voters in the 1998 general \nelection, Oregon's vote-by-mail system does not need fixing by the \nFederal Government. Our voter registration card already includes an \noath swearing the signer is a U.S. citizen. Submitting a false \nregistration is a class C felony carrying a penalty of up to $100,000 \nor 5 years in prison. The same penalties apply to anyone who knowingly \nvotes twice or whose signature cannot be matched with the signature on \nfile with the county clerk.\n  Oregon's counties verify the signature on each ballot return envelope \nto the original signature on the voter registration card. Because \nballots cannot be forwarded, Oregon's voting rolls have been clean.\n  In the 2000 general election, out of 1.9 million registered voters, \nabout 1.5 million cast votes, about 80 percent. Of the 1.5 million \nvotes, the counties referred a number of ballots to the secretary of \nstate, close to several hundred. In five of these cases, there was \nenough evidence for the State to prosecute. The remaining 187 votes \nwere not counted because Oregon requires signature verification for \ncounting the vote.\n  Since the 1996 May primary, 13 cases of fraud have been prosecuted; \nconvictions won in 5, and 8 cases still pending.\n  So we want to make it clear that in our State, which has pioneered \nthis innovative approach so popular with seniors and working families, \nand many who live very hectic and busy lives, the signature \nauthentication system has proven remarkably good at detecting and \ndeterring fraud. Despite that record, this bill, this legislation, says \nthat that system is not good enough.\n  The photo ID requirement would also be expensive for the States that \nuse voter signature. Election officials at home in Oregon tell me they \nknow of no State that has an easier and more inexpensive way to figure \nout just who is a first-time voter.\n  So let's just think about the ramifications. We all--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--want to encourage young people and first-time \nvoters, those who have not participated in the political process, to \nparticipate. So here we are, at a time when it is already difficult, \naccording to the election officials, to try to keep track of who is a \nfirst-time voter, and we now have a bill that will make it even tougher \nto address these issues because of the added expense.\n  If the provision were in effect, each time a new voter registered in \na county, the county clerk would have to call the clerks--at least in \nmy State--in the 35 other counties to determine whether the person was \nstill registered there. Oregon is working to develop a centralized \nvoter registration system, as the bill calls for, by 2004. But it is \ngoing to cost about $7 million to do that.\n\n  So here is what is going to happen this fall at polling places across \nthe country if the poison pill that is this photo ID provision remains \nin the legislation.\n  Millions of first-time voters who register by mail in 28 States will \nget up on election day and go to the polls to vote. They will wait in \nline. And when they finally get to the front, they will be asked for a \ncopy of their utility bill, their bank statement, or a valid photo \ndriver's licence. Suppose they walk to the polls or share an apartment \nwhere the utilities are all under a roommate's name? They will not be \nable to satisfy that new requirement. They will go home. And I think \nany Member of the Senate who thinks those people are going to come back \nis just not talking to those people or to those election officials who \nhave worked closely with them.\n  The photo ID requirement in the bill also applies if you registered \nby mail and you are a first-time voter in any jurisdiction. That means \nthat a voter who lived in a part of Salem, OR, who was in Marion County \nand moved to West Salem and Polk County, and was voting there for the \nfirst time, would have to mail in, with their ballot, a copy of a photo \nID or a bank statement. If they voted at a polling place, they would \nhave to show a proof of identification. Without the photo ID, an \notherwise eligible voter would be turned away and would probably not \ncome back.\n  Some might say not to worry because there is a provisional ballot. \nHowever, every first-time voter who is turned away at the polls this \nNovember is not going to be able to use provisional ballots because \nunder another section of the bill provisional ballots do not take \neffect until 2004.\n  The defenders of this provision claim they want every vote to count, \nbut, in my view, this requirement almost guarantees that seniors, the \ndisabled, minorities, and others are going to be disenfranchised from \ncoast to coast.\n  My colleagues, it seems to me there is a lesson from Florida that is \nrelevant to the debate tonight. What the message from Florida was all \nabout is that the elections process needs to be simplified. It needs to \nbe made less complicated. The photo ID requirement is going to take the \nelections process across this country in just the opposite direction \nand make it more complicated.\n  My State is not alone in its opposition to the photo ID requirement \nbecause of the damage the provision would cause, and cause nationwide.\n  The provision, in my view, is going to work a hardship on minority \nvoters. In fact, last November a Federal court ruled against an \nidentification requirement used at a polling place in Massachusetts, \nfinding that:\n\n       The burden imposed by this photo ID requirement will fall \n     disproportionately on the Latin American community, thereby \n     violating section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  There is a reason that this coalition of groups of seniors and \nminorities and a variety of organizations that have worked to expand \nthe franchise is opposing this legislation. They want to see us expand \nthe franchise. They want to deter fraud, but they do not want to deter \nvoting.\n  I say to my colleagues, supporting this amendment is going to allow \n27 States and the District of Columbia to keep their voters' signature \nor attestation systems, but even more importantly, it is going to \nprotect an approach, a system for voting to which more and more \nAmericans are attracted. More and more Americans like the appeal and \nthe convenience of this way to vote.\n\n  In my view, putting a photo ID system in place at the end of the \nline, at the very end of the process, rather than taking strong steps \nto discourage fraud at the outset of the process, when a voter \nregisters, is not the way to go. We ought to be taking steps that are \ncost effective, that are practical.\n  I know my colleague from Missouri is sincere in his views. I wish I \ncould have been part of the negotiations that took place in committee \nbecause I would have brought to the Senator from Missouri and the \nSenator from Kentucky some of the senior citizens with whom I have \nworked over the years, some of\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\nthe seniors with whom I have worked in the Meals on Wheels programs and \nin nursing homes. They are not going to be able to comply with these \nprovisions. These are folks who are having difficulty reading existing \ngovernment forms.\n  My goodness, we all hear from seniors who are having difficulty \nreading some of what is on a pill bottle. And my colleague has said \nthat these are people who are going to be able to go out and find Xerox \nmachines and copy centers and the like. It is just not going to happen.\n  It is not a debate about my colleague's sincerity. I know he feels \nstrongly about these views. This is a debate about the real-life \nprovisions of this legislation and the hardships that are going to be \ncaused by this photo ID provision. In my view, it is in fact a poison \npill that does great harm to an otherwise very good bill that the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky have put together.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment. It has great \nramifications for the electoral system in our country. I strongly urge \nthe support of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise this evening to oppose the Schumer \namendment. I think my good friend from New York underestimates \nAmericans. The greatest example of why we vote is in his little domain. \nIt is called Ellis Island, a wonderful place to visit. I recommend all \nAmericans do it.\n  See the photographs of people who came from everywhere, some having \neverything they owned in a little bag, not very much money, not \nspeaking the language, not understanding the system, really not knowing \nwhat kind of a land this was. It took a lot of get-up-and-go to do \nthat.\n  The bottom line was freedom--freedom and opportunity. They knew in \ntheir own hearts, after they had not been here very long, that that \nfreedom and opportunity also demanded responsibility. They didn't ask \nif there was a health plan. They didn't ask if there was a minimum \nwage. They didn't ask for anything. They just wanted that freedom and \nopportunity.\n  Here is where I think we underestimate Americans. If you go down and \nwant to pick up tickets to the theater or to a sporting event and they \nare in ``will call,'' they require a photo ID, don't they? We all fly \non airplanes. Yesterday, after Salt Lake City, I don't know how many \nmore lines I want to stand in. But most of us fly on airplanes. If you \ndon't have a photo ID, are you going to get on? No, sir. You step up \nthere. You pull out your little ID before you can even get in to the \ngate area. I did that.\n  We all have new ID cards here. Some of you might have noticed; some \nof you might not. I pulled mine out the other day and gave it to the \none doing the screening. She looked at it. She said: ``I don't \nrecognize that kind of an ID card.''\n  I said: ``Well, it has on there what I do. It has a picture of a \nnice-looking fellow and a number.''\n  ``It doesn't make any difference. I don't recognize it.''\n  I put that one back. I pulled out one for Sam's Club. That one worked \ngood. I went right on through.\n  Most of the seniors I know vote absentee if they can't make it to the \npolls. They preregister. They understand what voting responsibility is \nand how precious most Americans think that right is to vote.\n  By the way, I am getting tired of going through these detectors \nwearing boots because I always have to take them off. They have steel \nshanks. That requirement has cost me seven pairs of socks. I can't have \nholes in them anymore, and they have to match.\n  The seniors in my State of Montana notably have one of the largest \npercentages of votes in every Federal election. They get absentee \nballots. My good friend from Oregon, I am sure, has a mail-in ballot. \nThat is kind of a mail-in absentee. It has to match a registration \nsomewhere. There has to be somebody there.\n  What this bill requires is the validity of a person. I had an \namendment that was rejected by this body--I still think it was a good \namendment--that we could purge our lists every 4 years instead of, as \nthis bill requires, every 8 years. Those counties that have \nuniversities and institutions of higher learning carry an enormous list \nof students who desire to vote in that county, and those names have to \nbe carried for 8 years.\n  I do not have one election administrator in one county out of the 56 \nin Montana who really thinks they can embrace this legislation at all \nbecause there are some mandates in here that maybe we can't comply \nwith.\n  Let me give an example. We don't have electricity or running water at \nevery polling place in Montana. That is hard to believe, is it not? We \nhave old, abandoned country schoolhouses still used for polling places. \nBut they don't hold school there anymore, so they fire up the old stove \nand take their lanterns. That is where they vote. And if something \ncomes up, you know everybody in the county. The county is probably as \nbig as Delaware and only has 1,800 people. Everybody knows everybody \nanyway. There is very little room for fraudulent votes.\n  What we are saying here with this legislation is that we don't quite \ntrust the American people to do some things for the privilege and the \nright to vote. If they really want to participate in the political \nprocess, they will do all the necessary things.\n  You are not registered to vote. Would you like to register to vote? \nWell, I would. So they fill it out. Who mails it in? Usually the guy \nwho is working the neighborhood. That could be me.\n  The seniors I know and the people I know who have a hard time making \nit to the polls vote absentee. We forget about this. We go into this \ndebate every time.\n  I am saying we are talking about something that may be very \nimportant, but I don't think it is important because we have \nunderestimated the American people. You never want to do that.\n  They know what the proposition is. They understand what it is to \nregister to vote. They pay taxes in that county or that township. They \nprotect their right to speak through the polling box. Don't \nunderestimate them.\n  Everything we do, everything we do, from picking up tickets for the \ntheater or a sporting event or anything else, requires that photo ID. I \nwould admonish anyone to go out and tell anybody, from the first-time \nvoter through the oldest voter, that they can't vote, because they can \nfind ways to do it--register by mail, absentee.\n  I have to believe what we are trying to do here is to maintain the \nstatus quo. We leave ourselves open, with these huge lists, to fraud--\nwe invite it, in fact--when it boils down to the responsibility of each \nand every citizen to be in a position to vote.\n  So I ask that this amendment of my good friend from Oregon--and we \nknow each other's States very well, and we also understand the people \nthere very well. I venture to say you would get a higher percentage of \nvoter turnout in eastern Oregon than you do in western Oregon. They \nknow the responsibility, and they understand it, and they welcome it.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote to table or defeat this Schumer \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nhis observations. He certainly makes the point well that what we are \nasking here in the underlying bill--insisted upon by Senator Bond--is \nnot at all unreasonable.\n  I heard the Senator from Oregon talk about the failure to pass this \namendment being a poison pill. Let's make it clear what the poison pill \nis. The poison pill is passing this amendment, which unravels the core \nbill that was negotiated over a lengthy, and sometimes painful, process \nof many months. If the motion to table the Schumer amendment is not \nagreed to, then I fear passage of this bill is seriously in question.\n  As the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Montana have \npointed out, requiring identification is not unusual. I thought I heard \nthe Senator from Oregon talk only about photo ID, and I will defer to \nmy friend from Missouri. Is the Senator from Kentucky correct that a \nphoto ID is only one of a number of different options that could \nsatisfy the antifraud provisions\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\ninsisted upon, and agreed to, in the underlying bill?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to respond to the Senator from Kentucky, \nthis in fact was one of the areas we negotiated for a long time. There \nis no single requirement that you must have a photo ID. We provided all \nof the options for other forms of identification that are set out in \nthe bill. I respond further to the Senator from Kentucky that the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, Assistant Attorney General Carl Thorse, for \nDaniel J. Bryant, advises:\n\n       As to acceptable forms of identification, by the \n     Department's reading, voters lacking photographic \n     identification may nonetheless meet the requirement by \n     presenting utility bills, bank statements, government checks, \n     paychecks, or ``other government documents'' showing the name \n     and address of the voter. Nothing in the Department's \n     preclearance activities or other experience implies that \n     minority voters would be less able than other voters to \n     provide at least one of the documents accepted under this \n     flexible requirement.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Bond: This letter responds to your letter of \n     February 21, 2002, inquiring about the Department of \n     Justice's (``Department'') views on whether a covered \n     jurisdiction, which implemented a change in voting procedure \n     consistent with proposed Section 103(b)(2) of S. 565, would \n     thereby violate Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1973c. We interpret proposed Section 103(b)(2) as \n     requiring persons to provide photographic or other \n     identification, in certain circumstances, as a prerequisite \n     to voting. [See below.] As discussed further below, assuming \n     preclearance were needed for such a change, in the \n     Department's view a change in voting procedure requiring \n     voters to provide documentation of identity does not \n     necessarily have the purpose or effect of denying or \n     abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. Far \n     from automatically violating Section 5, identification \n     requirements can be an efficient and effective means of \n     combating voter fraud.\n       Initially, we assume for the purpose of this letter that \n     Section 103(b)(2) of S. 565 would require a change in pre-\n     existing voting ``qualifications, prerequisites, standards, \n     practices, or procedures'' cognizable under Section 5. It is \n     far from clear that a federally mandated change in voting \n     procedure, which granted the covered jurisdiction little or \n     no discretion in implementing the change, even would be \n     reviewable by the Department under Section 5. See, e.g., \n     Young v. Fordice, 520 U.S. 273, 285-86 (1997). By the \n     Department's reading, proposed Section 103(b)(2) appears to \n     vest almost no discretion in local officials with regard to \n     identification requirements; the forms of acceptable \n     identification, for example, are enumerated in the statutory \n     text.\n       Assuming for purposes of this letter that proposed Section \n     103(b)(2) is even subject to Section 5 review, we first note \n     that, in responding to your letter, we have not examined the \n     voting systems currently in place in all covered \n     jurisdictions, and we reach no conclusions as to whether \n     those systems are now compliant with proposed Section \n     103(b)(2), or whether any change in a particular jurisdiction \n     would require Section 5 preclearance. After reviewing the \n     text of proposed Section 103(b)(2), the Department concludes \n     that, as written, nothing in it would require an objection \n     under Section 5. First, identification is required for all \n     voters, and the accepted forms of identification are \n     designated (Sec. 103(b)(2)(A)(i)). Moreover, provisional \n     balloting is provided for those who lack the required \n     identification on election day (Sec. 103(b)(2)(A)(ii)). As to \n     acceptable forms of identification, by the Department's \n     reading, voters lacking photographic identification may \n     nonetheless meet the requirement by presenting utility bills, \n     bank statements, government checks, paychecks, or ``other \n     government documents'' showing the name and address of the \n     voter. Nothing in the Department's preclearance activities or \n     other experience implies that minority voters would be less \n     able than other voters to provide at least one of the \n     documents accepted under this flexible requirement.\n       Thank you for giving the Department the opportunity to \n     express its views on this important issue. The Office of \n     Management and Budget has advised us that from the \n     perspective of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n       Proposed Section 103(b)(2) of S. 565 states in relevant \n     part:\n       (2) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--An individual meets the requirements of \n     this paragraph if the individual--\n       (i) in the case of an individual who votes in person--\n       (I) presents to the appropriate State or local election \n     official a current and valid photo identification; or\n       (II) presents to the appropriate State or local election \n     official a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, \n     government check, paycheck, or other Government document that \n     shows the name and address of the voter; or\n       (ii) in the case of an individual who votes by mail, \n     submits with the ballot-\n       (I) a copy of a current and valid photo identification; or\n       (II) a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, \n     Government check, paycheck, or other Government document that \n     shows the name and address of the voter.\n       (B) Provisional voting.--An individual who desires to vote \n     in person, but who does not meet the requirements of \n     subparagraph (A)(i), may cast a provisional ballot under \n     Section 102(a)\n       (3) Inapplicability.--Paragraph (1) shall apply in the case \n     of a person--\n       (A) who registers to vote by mail under section 6 of the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg-4) \n     and submits as part of such registration either--\n       (i) a copy of a current and valid photo identification; or\n       (ii) a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, \n     Government check, paycheck, or Government document that shows \n     the name and address of the voter; or\n       (B) who is described in a subparagraph of section 6(c)(2) \n     of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973gg-4(c)(2)).\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. He \npointed out clearly that the photo ID is only one of a number of \nacceptable options. The goal is not to deny people the opportunity to \nvote, but to verify there are actual people who are voting. The notion \nthat somehow it is an onerous requirement to provide photo ID is, \nfrankly, absurd on its face.\n  I have behind me an advertisement that appeared in the Washington \nPost recently. It is an advertisement for a cell phone. It says: ``Add \nNextel to your holiday list.'' In the ad it says: ``In-store purchases \nrequire at least two forms of valid identification.'' That is, to buy a \ncell phone, two forms of valid identification are required.\n  Now the sanctity of the vote, the sanctity of the ballot, voting only \nonce, and being a legitimate voter are considerably more important than \nthe purchase of a cell phone. There is almost nothing of consequence \nyou can do in our society today without providing some kind of ID. The \nSenator from Missouri has been quite generous in providing a number of \ndifferent options, not just a photo option, which obviously would be \nthe clearest way to make certain that the first time registrant was \nindeed a person who did live where he was being registered. But the \nSenator from Missouri was quite generous, I thought, in providing a \nnumber of different options to meet that requirement--short of a \npicture ID.\n  Secondly, referring to another chart, we have a voter in Maryland--\nthese are two long-time registered voters in Maryland. One is a person \nnamed Mabel Briscoe, 82, and the other long-time registered voter in \nHolly Briscoe, her terrier. Mabel finally got caught, and they gave her \ncommunity service instead of jail time because she indicated she was \ntrying to make a point in registering her terrier: that they had an \nabsurd registration system in Maryland.\n\n  Now surely the Senate is not going to pass an amendment that makes it \neasier to register to vote than to buy a cell phone. The sanctity of \nthe ballot is extremely important in this country. As the Senator from \nMissouri said repeatedly, we want to make it easier to vote--but vote \nonly once--and harder to cheat.\n  So this amendment is the poison pill. It is the deal breaker. If this \namendment passes, this bill is in serious trouble. These provisions \nthat the Senator from Missouri negotiated and insisted upon have made \nthis a much better bill and have given it an opportunity to pass on a \nbipartisan basis. To break faith with the core compromise in this bill, \nI fear, renders it unfit for passage. That is how serious this vote is.\n  We are not going to have much time to debate it in the morning. There \nare not many of our colleagues around tonight. But there is no way I \ncan underscore, as somebody who cares deeply about this bill, that it \nshould pass. It bears my name in the second position, along with the \nSenator from Connecticut, and I think it moves us in the right \ndirection. I will be darned if I will be party to unraveling the \ncritical elements of this bill that were negotiated by the Senator from \nMissouri. These elements, which go right to the very\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\nheart of our democracy, are that you are only entitled to vote once--\nand you need to be a person. Nobody has referred yet to ``60 Minutes,'' \nbut they ran a segment within the last year or so. I happened to catch \nit one night when I was watching television. It was about the current \nsituation in California, where there have been a number of different \nanimals that have registered and voted repeatedly under the current \nsystem.\n  We made it a lot easier to vote a few years back. We certainly made \nit a lot easier to register. It didn't have any impact on turnout. So \nnow we have these voluminous voting rolls all across America. It is \npretty hard not to be registered to vote. All the Senator from Missouri \nis asking here is that there be clear evidence that a first-time \nregistrant be a real person who is eligible to vote and actually living \nat the address. I don't think that is asking too much.\n  I certainly hope that tomorrow, when a motion to table is made, it \nwill be successful. Otherwise, we will still be debating this amendment \nfor quite some time.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri again for his important \ncontribution to this bill in the antifraud area. I think it is a core \npart of the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the debate from my \ncolleagues from Kentucky, Missouri, and Montana. I say at the top of \nthis that I respect their views and where they are coming from. I don't \nbelieve there is any ill motivation. Some would say, well, they really \ndon't want people to vote, or whatever else. I don't buy that. I don't \nthink that is fair. But I would make a couple of observations.\n  As I was listening to the debate, something struck me.\n  First, we have a little bit of an obsession of dogs voting. I do not \nthink that is bringing down our system. I say to my friends from \nKentucky and Missouri, if someone wants to go out of their way to sign \ntheir dog's name, they can very easily, under the proposal of the \nSenator from Missouri, put their picture in there. The owner of Ritzy \ncould put his or her--I do not know if it is a his or her, the lone \nRitzy--could put their picture ID in the envelope and then vote.\n  We cannot stop people who are totally committed to being fraudulent \nfrom doing that. There is no system that will stop everybody. Whether \nour amendment is adopted or not, whether even the original amendment of \nthe Senator from Missouri is in there or not, the .001 percent, who for \ntheir own sick reasons want to have two votes or have their dog vote, \nare going to get around this provision, and they can easily get around \nthe amendment of the Senator from Missouri. Ritzy can. This nice lady \nfrom wherever she is can. We know that.\n  Let's not say because there are a few people who are totally driven \nto commit fraud--and they will, and they should be prosecuted. This \nbill, to the credit of the Senator from Missouri, does a lot to \nminimize it, particularly the voting rolls provisions which everyone \nhas talked about but will change in this bill unless it does not become \nlaw. That is the No. 1 way to stop it. We know that some people are \ngoing to commit fraud.\n  What I am befuddled by is the argument that because a few people will \ncommit a ridiculous type of fraud and can whether or not the Schumer-\nWyden amendment is adopted, that we should disenfranchise probably \nmillions, certainly hundreds of thousands of people.\n  I noticed who the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Montana \nwere talking about in their debate: Average folks.\n  I have a cell phone. I shut it off because I am in the Chamber. Sure, \nif I wanted to go to Nextel and get a cell phone, I have two or three \nphoto IDs in my wallet. That is not at whom this bill is aimed. I am \ngoing to be able to vote easily.\n  We are talking about people who have a rough time voting. We are \ntalking about realizing the American dream. We are talking about people \nwho do not go to airports regularly and check in and show their photo \nIDs. Those are not the people who need the help.\n  We are talking about struggling people who cannot afford a car, do \nnot fly in an airplane, do not own a cell phone, and certainly those \nwho do not have their photo IDs, their United States Senate card, which \nis given to us so we do not have to do any work for it. As the example \nmy friend from Montana uses: I got my photo ID. Yes, he does; he has a \nSenate card whether he drives or not.\n  There are millions of Americans--immigrants, poor people, elderly \npeople, disabled people--who do not have that. Should they be \ndisenfranchised because of Ritzy and Ritzy's owner?\n  This is not a zero sum game. That is a bogus argument.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky, to their \ncredit, along with those others of us who were on for the ride, were \nlooking at people who have a rough time voting because they live in the \ncorners of American life, but our Constitution says their vote is every \nbit as important as ours, even if they do not have a cell phone, even \nif they do not fly in a plane regularly, even if they are not a Member \nof the Senate. There are millions of them, not 10, not 20.\n\n  They do not want to vote twice, and they do not want their dogs to \nvote, but they want to vote. That is what we are doing tonight. We are \nallowing them to vote. We are allowing the people in the corners of \nAmerica who struggle, who have enough trouble--they cannot make a \npolitical contribution; oh, no. They cannot travel 30 miles to see \ntheir Congressman, their Senator, their assemblyman, their State \nsenator. Oh, no. They do not have time to sit at a computer and write a \nletter to a newspaper. Oh, no. They are too busy trying to eke out a \nlife, and are we to say to them: We are going to treat you just as the \nguy making $150,000 who flies around the country, who owns two cell \nphones, who has photo IDs in his pocket, we are treating you the same?\n  It is very easy for my good friend from Montana, again with best of \nintentions, to say that it is a responsibility to vote and we should \nput as many barriers in the way as we have to, to eliminate every last \nfraudulent voter before they can vote.\n  That is not the balance this bill seeks, in my judgment. The balance \nthis bill seeks is, yes, prevent fraud and do things that do not \nunnecessarily disenfranchise people. Cleaning up the voter rolls is not \ngoing to disenfranchise people, especially with provisional voting. Do \nnot do things to disenfranchise those who are different because they \nare generally poorer or disabled or older.\n  Let's make no bones about it, the outcry that occurred in Florida was \nnot because of fraud. It was because of disenfranchised voters. For one \nreason or another, they could not vote. It was because we found in so \nmany poor districts a number of people who could not somehow exercise \ntheir constitutional right to vote, every bit as protected by our \nFounding Fathers as yours and mine. They could not vote. That is what \nthis bill is about.\n  When the Senator from Missouri came to us and said: Let's also try to \nknock out fraud because that is important, the Senator from Connecticut \nwisely said: He is right. But there has to be a balance, and if to \nknock out every Ritzy you are going to disenfranchise 100,000 people \nbecause they do not have a cell phone and they do not fly in the planes \nand they cannot just pull out of their pocket a voter ID card, then you \nare creating the wrong balance.\n  I do not think I buy this, but I have heard it from my colleagues and \nmany others, if the Schumer-Wyden amendment is not adopted, the balance \nin this bill is such that a lot of people are saying the heck with it. \nThe Senator from Oregon is right.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said if this amendment is adopted, it will \nslow down the bill. What? We are going to see a lot of amendments to \nslow down the bill? I will tell my colleagues something. The whole goal \nof this bill was not an antifraud bill, it was not to disenfranchise, \nit was not to make it harder to vote, it was to make it easier to vote \nand, at the same time, as a corollary, try to eliminate fraud, not \neliminate fraud and, at the same time, as a corollary, try to make it \neasier for people to vote.\n  Again, the lady in that picture, Ritzy, whom we have heard a lot \nabout,\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nRitzy is going to find a way to vote illegally, incorrectly, whether we \nhave this amendment or not. Again, I repeat, all the owner of Ritzy has \nto do is put a photo ID in that envelope. So do not make it like this \namendment allows that fraud to be created.\n  What allows that fraud to be created is, again, someone resolute on \ndoing it will do it. I think the proposal of the Senator from Missouri, \nagain, done with good intention, throws out the baby with the bath \nwater. It disenfranchises so many who are not typical middle-class \nAmericans, and I ask my colleagues to think about that; not to say, me \nand my 20 best friends, we can vote easily.\n  The only reason we would not want a photo ID is because we would be \ncommitting fraud. That is right, but that is not true of a poor person \nwho does not have a car and does not have a phone and does not own a \nhome. It is not true of a disabled person who cannot drive and cannot \noperate their own bank account. It is not true of an elderly person who \nhas to have most of their things done for them by somebody else.\n  Yet our Constitution--not Chuck Schumer, not Ron Wyden, not Chris \nDodd--says their right to vote is every bit as sacred as ours. And that \nis what this bill seeks to protect.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, I will yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator of New York think there would be \nhundreds of thousands of people, as I heard him say, who would not have \none of the following--he keeps talking about a valid photo ID, but as I \nread the underlying bill, and the provisions by the Senator from \nMissouri, any one of the following would satisfy--and we are talking \nonly about first-time registrants--photo ID, utility bill, bank \nstatement, government check, paycheck, or other government document. \nHow many people in America could there be who would not have one of \nthose things? Who in America would not have had one of the things the \nSenator from Missouri insists be part of the underlying bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. I would answer my good friend, do not ask me, ask \nthe groups that represent them. The AARP says there are lots of their \npeople who do not have any of those provisions. That is why they came \nto us and said do the signature and do the attestation. The groups that \nrepresent minorities in this country say there are lots of their \ncitizens who do not have any of these. These days, I say to my good \nfriend from Kentucky, most welfare checks--I know in my State--are sent \nby wire to an account.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. When I finish. The groups who represent lots of these \npeople, who I daresay know more about their lives and their abilities \nto meet the requirements of this bill than either he or I do, say the \nlengthy list, which the Senator read, does not work. I ask the Senator \nif they believe, which I do, too, that signature, which has worked in \nmy State without any large reports of fraud, will make it easier for \nthese people to vote, these people who live in the corners of America \nto vote, why is adding that in so significant that it would, in the \nwords of the Senator from Kentucky, bring down the bill?\n  Yes, I posit to the Senator from Kentucky that there are lots of \npeople who cannot meet the requirements in this section of the bill. If \nwe did not believe that, we would not be offering this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since the Senator is asserting there are some \nAmericans who would not have a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank \nstatement, government check, paycheck, or other government document, \ncould they not then vote provisionally?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First of all, they cannot vote provisionally in the year \n2002. That is in the bill now. I believe that was insisted on either by \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Missouri, or somebody else, so they will be \ndisenfranchised in this election.\n  Second, I have seen it in the polling places in New York--maybe this \nis not true--I have seen it with first-time voters, the ballot officer \nsays: Here, sign this paper and put it in the box, but it is not going \nto count on the machine. And there are arguments at the polling place, \nparticularly from new immigrants who say: No, I want to be on the \nmachine like everybody else because my vote is not counting there.\n  They come from countries where they do not have the trust we have in \ngovernment. They may come from a Communist country. They may come from \na dictatorship. When they are forced to vote provisionally, they \nbelieve they are being treated as second-class citizens.\n  Now we have put the provisional voting system in as a backup. I would \nnot want to make it the norm because somebody does not have the ability \nto meet the requirements that most middle-class people could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am afraid we have seen a bunch of straw \nmen set up and beaten up talking about all of these people who do not \nhave any of these means of showing their identity. We negotiated 6 long \nmonths, and we had input from all of these people. The various groups \nto which my colleagues from New York and Oregon have referred have \nlooked at this bill, and we came to an agreement. Certainly, we did not \nexpect everybody to have a photo ID. Only about 90 percent of adults \nhave driver's licenses that show the photo ID. So we went down the list \nand found out that the utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or other \ndocuments could show the ID.\n  Provisional voting, yes, we agreed on provisional voting. I did not \nhappen to write the section that made the provisional voting effective \nin 2004. I would be happy to move it to 2002. That does not cause me \nany problem. Let us match them up.\n  As far as somebody not wanting to vote provisionally, we have laid \nout everything in the world that they can bring in to show their \nidentity. That new arrival who just qualified to vote in this country, \nif he or she writes in, sends in a mail-in registration form, he or she \nis going to get a form back saying: OK, the first time you vote you \nhave to have one of these. That is going to be in plenty of time for \nthe person who takes the responsibility to register to vote to find the \nproper means of identification.\n  Now, the Senator from New York talked about how the system worked \njust fine. I was a little concerned, reading the December 2000 article \nin the New York Post--and I do not have it with me, but I will bring it \nin tomorrow--which said they had found that 14,000 people were \nregistered both in New York City and South Florida. I would be \ninterested to find out how many of them voted once or twice. It could \nbe a little problem there.\n  We are not going to solve all the problems. The Senator from New York \nis right. We said we were going to make it easier to vote and tougher \nto cheat. We never said it was going to be automatic that everybody is \ngoing to vote. Nor did we say that we are absolutely going to knock out \nevery cheat. What we need is good prosecution. The Senator from Oregon \ntalked about that. He said there are some prosecutions underway in \nOregon. I sure hope there are because I have not seen it.\n\n  Most of the prosecuting authorities find it is too difficult because \nthey do not have the means to identify the people who voted \nfraudulently. Yes, we need good, strong prosecutions. We also need in \nthe polling place good, strong Republicans and good, strong Democrats \nwatching each other making sure the voters get what they are entitled \nto.\n  Frankly, when the Senator from Oregon said these nursing home \nresidents cannot get up and go to a copy machine to copy a utility \nbill, or even the stub of a government check or a statement from a \nbank--if they get a Social Security check deposited in a bank, they are \ngoing to get a statement. You know what they could do; they do not even \nhave to photocopy. They can send it in after they paid it or after they \nreceived the statement. They could send it in. Maybe somebody is going \nto have to get up in that nursing home and go get them a stamp and then \nget them a notary public. I just bet that person, if they spend enough \ntime, put a little time and effort into it, can get them a photocopy or \nget them one of their ID documents to send in.\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\n  I agree we ought to catch them at the beginning. We ought to catch \nthem when they register. That is the whole purpose of the bill. That is \nwhat we negotiated when we negotiated the Dodd-McConnell compromise. We \nare just going to deal with the people registering the first time and \nsay, yes, you have to prove you are a real live human being, adult \ncitizen meeting the standards of the State registrar. The only thing we \ncan do to prove you are a human being is with one of the multitude of \nprovisions we have for showing that. Provisional voting is the way, if \nthey are knocked out, that they can still come back in. We may not have \nsolved 100 percent of every single problem. This bill certainly does \nnot. It certainly does not prevent 100 percent of the fraud.\n\n  Let me go back to the State of Oregon to talk about percentages. My \nfriend from Oregon believes the antifraud protections included in his \nbill should not apply to Oregon because they have sufficient \nprotections already in place. My colleague from Oregon was elected in \nthe first mail-in election, and I understand there is a court challenge \nto the constitutionality of the system. We will be interested to see \nhow that develops.\n  But it was with great interest I read an article in the Los Angeles \nTimes printed in December 2000 about a range of issues that should give \neveryone pause, particularly the idea that political operatives can act \nas mailmen. Let me read a relative portion of that article.\n  The article is headlined: ``Decision 2000/America waits; A `Modern' \nDemocracy That Can't Count Votes; Special Report: What Happened In \nFlorida Is The Rule And Not The Exception. A Coast-to-Coast Study By \nThe Times Finds A Shoddy System That Can Only Be Trusted When The \nElection Isn't Close.''\n  They say:\n\n       An Oregon practice that many considered foolhardy is \n     allowing anyone, including campaign workers, to collect \n     ballots. Political operatives go door-to-door to gather them. \n     In the crush of election day, people walked away with ballots \n     collected from cars pulling to the curb outside the county \n     clerk's office in Portland.\n       Vicki Ervin, the Multnomah County director of elections, \n     says she has no idea where they were going, but she has no \n     evidence of foul play.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 11, 2000]\n\n  Decision 2000/America Waits; a `Modern' Democracy That Can't Count \nVotes; Special Report: What Happened in Florida Is the Rule and not the \n Exception. A Coast-To-Coast Study by the Times Finds a Shoddy System \n         That Can Only Be Trusted When the Election Isn't Close\n\n       Because ballots can be bought, stolen, miscounted, lost, \n     thrown out or sent to Denmark, nobody knows with any \n     precision how many votes go uncounted in American elections.\n       For weeks, Florida has riveted the nation with a mind-\n     numbing array of failures: misleading ballots, contradictory \n     counting standards, discarded votes--19,000 in one county \n     alone. But an examination by The Times in a dozen states from \n     Washington to Texas to New York shows that Florida is not the \n     exception. It is the rule.\n       State and local officials give priority to curbing crime, \n     filing potholes and picking up trash. That often leaves \n     elections across the country underfunded, badly managed, ill \n     equipped and poorly staffed. Election workers are \n     temporaries, pay is a pittance, training is brief and voting \n     systems are frequently obsolete. ``You know why we never paid \n     attention to this until now?'' asks Candy Marendt, co-\n     director of the Indiana Elections Division. ``I'll tell you: \n     because we don't really want to know. We don't want to know \n     that our democracy isn't really so sacred. . . .\n       ``It can be very ugly.''\n       The examination shows:\n       New York City voters use metal lever-action machines so old \n     they are no longer made, each with 27,000 parts. Similar \n     machines in Louisiana are vulnerable to rigging with pliers, \n     a screwdriver, a cigarette lighter and a Q-Tip.\n       In Texas, ``vote whores'' do favors for people in return \n     for their absentees ballots. Sometimes the canvassers or \n     consultants, as they prefer to be called, simply buy the \n     ballots. Failing all else, they steal them from mailboxes.\n       Alaska has more registered voters than voting-age people. \n     Indiana, which encourages voting with sign-ups by mail and a \n     driver's license bureaus, has jammed its registration lists \n     with hundreds of thousands of people who should not be on \n     them. They include felons, the dead and many who have \n     registered repeatedly.\n       In Oregon, a preliminary survey indicates that more than \n     36,000 of the state's 1.5 million voters may have mailed in \n     ballots this year that were signed by someone else. \n     Some students in Wisconsin say they voted as many as four \n     times.\n       Louisiana's former election commissioner, Jerry Fowler, \n     pleaded guilty 14 days ago to a kickback scheme with a voting \n     machine dealer. Even when relationships are legal, lines of \n     authority blur. In the state of Washington, dealers program \n     vote counters. In Arizona, they go as far as to help feed in \n     the ballots.\n       To many Americans, the right to vote is sacred, a hard-won \n     legacy of the women's suffrage and civil rights movements. \n     Memories of those 20th century struggles remain fresh among \n     voters of the new century. Yet the system that counts their \n     ballots has fallen into disarray and dysfunction.\n       The voting system is so troubled that the National Bureau \n     of Standards, a federal agency now know as the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, said 12 years ago that \n     an election mainstay, prescored punch-card ballots, should be \n     junked--but more than 500 counties throughout the nation \n     still use them.\n       Federal standards for voting equipment took effect in 1990, \n     but they are not mandatory. A number of states, including \n     Florida, have written some or all of the standards into their \n     own codes. But all existing equipment was excepted, meaning \n     that decades-old systems in Florida and elsewhere are exempt.\n       America has learned two things from the 2000 election, says \n     Robert Richie, executive director of the Center for Voting \n     and Democracy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan election watchdog \n     group in the Washington suburb of Takoma Park, Md.: ``Your \n     vote certainly counts.\n       ``On the other hand, your vote may not be counted.''\n\n\n                           Long-Term Neglect\n\n       If the problem were out-and-out fraud, many would recognize \n     it as an object so familiar on the political landscape as to \n     be a running joke. They late Earl Long used to say that he \n     wanted to be buried in Lousiana so he could stay politically \n     active.\n       This year's election did include corruption, but the real \n     problem was less obvious: In almost innumerable ways, the \n     election system that counts the votes has suffered from long-\n     term neglect and mismanagement.\n       Much of the bumbling is caused by inexperience and lack of \n     funding. ``People ask, `If we can put a man on the moon, why \n     can't we have an election system that works?' '' says William \n     Kimberling, a deputy director at the Federal Election \n     Commission. ``I say, `Yes, and it will cost just about as \n     much.' ''\n       The Board of Elections in New York City, for instance, \n     hired 25,000 temporary workers this year. The job pays $130 \n     for a day that stretches from before 6 a.m. until after 9 \n     p.m. ``Would you sit there for 15 hours for $130?'' asks \n     Danny DeFrancesco, the board's executive director.\n       ``Most of the workers can't read the manual,'' sayd Martin \n     Connor, state Senate minority leader and one of New York's \n     leading election lawyers. ``You're not going to get bankers, \n     businesspeople and teachers sitting there.''\n       New York has trouble finding voting machine technicans who \n     will start at $21,000 a year. ``You make more money servicing \n     laundry machines,'' says Douglas Kellner, a commissioner on \n     the election board. As a result, machines break down, voting \n     is delayed and people leave.\n       Some critics blame patronage. Election workers in New York \n     get their job through political leaders. Former Mayor Edward \n     J. Koch calls it ``a terrible system.''\n       But much is ineptitude. Four years ago, Susan Marler, the \n     Yuma County, Ariz., recorder enlisted two female inmates from \n     the Yuma jail to help send out ballots. Some were mailed more \n     than two days late. By that time, says County Supervisor Tony \n     Reyes, many migrant laborers, mostly Latinos, had left to \n     work on farms in California and could not vote.\n       Some places cannot even keep election directors. Several \n     years ago, Tamira Bradley held the job in Longview, Wash. She \n     was paid $1,800 a month. ``I really felt that nobody took me \n     seriously,'' she says, so she quit to become a waitress at a \n     Sizzler. ``I made more money.''\n       Long-term neglect introduces so many errors into voting and \n     counting ballots that it is impossible to know after an \n     election exactly what the totals are and how many people may \n     have been robbed of their votes.\n       Rebecca Mercuri, a computer scientist at Bryn Mawr College \n     in Pennsylvania, and Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan \n     Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, estimate \n     that at least 2 million ballots did not get counted this year \n     across the country.\n       That would disenfranchise a city the size of Houston.\n       But these estimates include deliberate race skipping, when \n     voters do not like any of their choices. Experts do not know \n     how much of that goes on.\n       The only mistakes that can be estimated with any confidence \n     are those committed by vote-counting machines. Providers say \n     the machines have error rates of 0.01% to 0.1%. If that is \n     true, counting machines alone could\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n     have made as many as 100,000 mistakes this year--an average \n     of 2,000 votes per state.\n       That is far more than Texas Gov. George W. Bush's margin in \n     Florida for the presidency.\n       But machine counts do not differentiate race skipping, \n     either, and that makes it impossible, even in the case of \n     machines, to know with any certainty how much voters get \n     robbed.\n       ``Counting votes is like playing horseshoes,'' says Jim \n     Mattox, a former Texas attorney general who investigated the \n     voting machine industry in the 1980s. ``You get points for \n     being close.''\n\n\n                             Weak Equipment\n\n       Voting jurisdictions across the country use five varieties \n     of lever-operated machines, six kinds of punch cards, 10 \n     sorts of optical scanning systems and six types of touch-\n     screen computers.\n       Every system has its weaknesses.\n       In 1998, the most recent year with records available, New \n     York City reported trouble calls on 474--or nearly 8%--of the \n     6,221 metal lever-action machines that it deployed.\n       Each is a 900-pound hunk of metal parts crammed into a gray \n     steel cabinet that stands 6 feet, 4 inches and looks like it \n     dispenses cigarettes. Voters flip toggle switches to choose \n     their candidates, then pull a big lever to record the choices \n     on a mechanical counter.\n       The machines are called Shoups, after the Ransom Shoup \n     family in Pennsylvania that began making them decades ago. \n     They are stored in five warehouses and hauled each election \n     day to 1,300 polling sites from the northern reaches of the \n     Bronx to Rockaway Beach in Queens.\n       For 38 years, these clunky monsters have taken a pounding. \n     ``We had one that fell onto the hood of a Buick,'' says \n     Richard Wagner, a voting machine technician since 1968. ``An \n     automobile has 5,000 parts; a voting machine has 27,000 \n     parts. If a guy drops it from the moving truck, it goes out \n     of alignment. If it's put out of alignment enough, it won't \n     work.''\n       The machines also are comparatively easy to rig. Louisiana \n     changed to a Shoup competitor in lever machines several years \n     ago after state Rep. Emile ``Peppi'' Bruneau showed fellow \n     lawmakers, with coaching from a voting machine technician, \n     how to steel a Shoup-equipped election.\n       With his cigarette lighter, Bruneau softened a lead plug \n     that sealed the machine. With a pair of pliers, he removed a \n     copper wire embedded in the plug. With a screwdriver, he took \n     off the back cover and a Plexiglas lid protecting the vote \n     counting mechanism. With a Q-Tip, he prodded the counter \n     digit by digit, manipulating the vote total as easily as he \n     might reset an alarm clock.\n       Punch card systems that produce chads are particularly \n     prone to problems.\n       Sometimes the chads--tiny rectangular pieces of cardboard--\n     are left hanging. Counting machines force them back into \n     their holes and read what should be a vote as a non-vote.\n       Prompted by problems in last month's election, officials in \n     Wisconsin have decided to scrap their chad-producing systems \n     by the end of next year. The systems deliver votes at only 7 \n     cents a ballot, however, and they remain popular in voting \n     jurisdictions coast to coast. Nine are in California, \n     including Los Angeles, San Diego and Alameda.\n       Optical scanners have their own special problems.\n       They require precisely printed ballots, and they cannot \n     count ballots when voters mark them with Xs, circles or check \n     marks instead of filling in ovals, boxes or arrows. When the \n     scanners fail to count those ballots, election workers in \n     some states may create duplicate ballots or enhance the \n     originals with a small graphite stamp to clarify voter \n     intentions. They are meant to work in pairs with members from \n     competing political parties.\n       Election officials say this system works, but Shawn Newman, \n     an attorney who represents Citizens for Leaders with Ethics \n     and Accountability Now (CLEAN), based in Tacoma, Wash., \n     considers the practice a sham. ``Your ballot can be re-\n     marked, remade totally,'' he says, ``without your knowledge \n     or permission. . . .''\n       More than 8% of counties nationwide have upgraded to fully \n     computerized touch-screen systems, similar to automated \n     teller machines at banks.\n       Apart from their expense--an estimated $100 million to \n     outfit Los Angeles County, for instance--some election \n     officials do not trust them. Some of these systems provide no \n     paper records for recounts or disputed elections.\n       Even those that do, some experts say, might be programmed \n     to lie.\n       Other security concerns are raised by Internet voting. \n     Despite what Arizona Democrats regard as a successful \n     experiment in their primary this year, William Kimberling, \n     the Federal Election Commission deputy director, calls it ``a \n     breeding ground for fraud.''\n       What is never trouble-free is the combination of computers \n     and humans.\n       Four years ago in Yolo County, Calif., a system reversed \n     results between the first- and last-place candidates in a \n     City Council race.\n       Someone had positioned two of the six candidates out of \n     order when the computer was programmed.\n       ``The actual winner knew something was wrong,'' says County \n     Clerk-Recorder Tony Bernhard, ``when he got one vote in the \n     precinct where his mother and father lived.''\n\n\n                           Trouble With Rolls\n\n       Just as troubling is voter registration.\n       Alaska has 38,209 more names on its rolls than it has \n     voting age population. Virginia Breeze, spokeswoman for the \n     state Division of Elections, says the rolls are hard to purge \n     because people come and go. ``Alaska has always been boom or \n     bust.''\n       One of every five names on the Indiana rolls is bogus, \n     according to Aristotle International, a Washington, DC-based \n     firm that helps clean up registration rolls. Indiana \n     officials dispute the number, but most agree it is somewhere \n     between 10% and 20%.\n       Aristotle representatives say six other states have rolls \n     with bogus names of 20% or higher: Arizona, Idaho, Texas, \n     Oklahoma, Utah and Wisconsin. Officials in those states too \n     believe the figure is inflated, but none denies that his or \n     her state has serious problems.\n       In many cases, much of the blame rests with the so-called \n     motor-voter law. Passed by Congress, its provisions were \n     adopted by Indiana on Jan. 1, 1995. Under the law, Indiana \n     makes it possible for voters to register by mail or by \n     filling out a form at any of 3,000 state offices, including \n     every branch of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.\n       During the five years since the beginning of Indiana's \n     motor-voter program, the number of new registrations has \n     increased by 1 million. Tens of thousands, however, are the \n     names of people who have registered more than once. Others \n     are people who no longer live in Indiana. Still others are in \n     prison--or dead.\n       To compound these troubles, Indiana makes it very difficult \n     to remove voters from the rolls. One person might register \n     six variations of his name. On the rolls, he would become six \n     different people. Unless he got caught, he could vote six \n     times.\n\n\n                             Votes for Sale\n\n       Voting repeatedly is one kind of election fraud. Another, \n     says Jack Compton, police chief in Alice, Texas, is hiring a \n     ``vote whore'' to help you win.\n       While they prefer to be called political consultants or \n     canvassers, vote whores are paid by campaigns to do favors \n     for people in return for their absentee votes. ``The last I \n     heard,'' Compton says, ``it was $20 a vote.''\n       Alice is where operatives stuffed Ballot Box 13 with 200 \n     votes to save Lyndon B. Johnson's political career. The extra \n     ballots were cast in alphabetical order and marked in the \n     same handwriting and with the same dark ink. Johnson had \n     planned to abandon politics if he lost his second campaign \n     for the U.S. Senate in 1948, but Box 13 gave him enough votes \n     to win. He went on to become vice president and finally \n     president.\n       Since the bad old days, much of Texas has gone straight, \n     says Buck Wood, an Austin attorney who specializes in \n     electoral law. But South Texas is distinctive, he says, \n     because its vote whores are so integral to its political \n     system. ``They're generally elderly. They're retired. You can \n     make $6,000 or $7,000 a year. Of course, they don't pay \n     income tax on it. That's a lot of money. It's kind of like a \n     little part-time job.''\n       Rick Sisson, an Alice businessman, pushed for a recent \n     investigation. ``They are paid to go out and solicit people \n     for their mail-in ballots. Sometimes they actually pay people \n     for these ballots. . . . The political prostitute comes to me \n     and says, `I will pay you $3, $5. You put your signature, I \n     vote it the way I want. Here's your money.' ''\n       Sometimes they steal votes outright. ``My brother and a co-\n     worker and a lady were stealing ballots from mailboxes to \n     vote for a candidate in 1986,'' says an Alice resident, who \n     declines to be identified. ``My brother wasn't being paid; he \n     just wanted the candidate to win. So they would take the \n     ballots and give them to him. They'd put them in the \n     microwave. The heat would open the envelope. They'd make the \n     vote for whoever they wanted. . . .\n       ``My brother knew when the mailman was coming by. They \n     stole hundreds of ballots. My brother told me about it. He \n     said he was scared.''\n       One woman in the trade describes the people she solicits as \n     ``customers.''\n       The woman, who requested anonymity but agreed to be called \n     Anita, says she actually cares about her customers and does \n     many small kindnesses for them throughout the year. In \n     return, they permit her to request mail-in ballots for them \n     and let her tell them how to vote. Many, she says, also give \n     her ``gifts'' of votes for the candidates of her choice.\n       Anita says each of her candidates pays her $150 a week \n     during the election season. ``By the time the politics is \n     over, you'll have $1,500. I have 167 people on my list.\n       ``There's a girl in my neighborhood that I bring beer to. I \n     see her three times a year. She says, `Oh, it's you! It must \n     be election time.' I go to get her mail-in ballot request, \n     and she says, `Do you have any money?' When I say yes, she \n     says, `Go get me a quart of beer.' So I do, and then I'll \n     request her ballot. . . .\n       ``You keep up with obituaries. If somebody dies, you get a \n     new person.''\n       Students are more straightforward. At Marquette University \n     in Milwaukee, where the campus newspaper polled 1,000 of \n     them, 174 said they voted two, three or four times.\n       One told The Times he voted twice for Bush--once at a \n     polling place on the Marquette campus and then by absentee \n     ballot\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n     in Florida, where he would have been among those who gave \n     Bush his whisper-thin margin.\n       ``It's easy to vote more than once,'' the student said. \n     ``No one seems to care.''\n       But most accounts, however, the preferred way to cheat is \n     with mail-in ballots. And that makes Oregon a target, as \n     well.\n       This was the first presidential election in which all \n     Oregon votes were cast by mail. The ease of send-in voting \n     gave the state an 80% turnout--among the highest in the \n     nation.\n       Part of the concern is about possible intimidation from \n     family or friends when voters mark their ballots at home--or \n     at ``ballot parties,'' where group leaders might pressure \n     others to vote as instructed. But a bigger worry is about \n     forged signatures.\n       It is a felony to sign someone else's ballot. Workers try \n     to match signatures on ballot envelopes with those on the \n     voter rolls.\n       ``I don't have much faith in that process,'' says Melody \n     Rose, an assistant professor of political science at Portland \n     State University.'' I can forge my husband's signature \n     perfectly.''\n       In a pilot study, Rose gathered preliminary survey data \n     this year on voters in Washington County, outside Portland. \n     About 5% of 818 respondents said other people marked their \n     ballots, and 2.4% said other people signed their ballot \n     envelopes. Rose suspects the real number is higher, because \n     people are reluctant to admit being party to a crime.\n       If the trend holds, it could mean that more than 36,000 or \n     Oregon's 1.5 million voters submitted illegal ballots.\n       Bill Bradley, the Oregon secretary of state, says it is \n     troubling if some people are signing other people's ballots. \n     But Bradbury maintains that he still has confidence in voting \n     by mail.\n       An Oregon practice that many consider foolhardy is allowing \n     anyone, including campaign workers, to collect ballots. \n     Political operatives go door-to-door to gather them. In the \n     crush of election day, people walked away with ballots \n     collected from cars pulling to the curb outside the county \n     clerk's office in Portland.\n       Vicki Ervin, the Multnomah County director of election, \n     says she has no idea where they were going, but she has no \n     evidence of foul play.\n\n\n                          turned away at polls\n\n       While some people vote more than once, others are barred \n     from voting at all.\n       Thousands on the mostly African American east side of \n     Cleveland went to vote this year, only to be turned away.\n       Because of a 1996 state law cutting Cleveland precincts by \n     a quarter, their polling places had been changed. The \n     Cuyahoga County Board of Elections says it sent postcards to \n     registered voters telling them of the switch.\n       But of 85 blacks who were asked about the postcards during \n     the 2\\1/2\\ days of interviews in east Cleveland, only one \n     said he received notification.\n       ``I never got a card, never,'' says Francis Lundrum, an \n     east side native. He says he bellowed at an election worker: \n     ``I am a veteran of the United States armed forces! I want to \n     vote!''\n       It did no good.\n       Lundrum and the others who were turned away should have \n     been given provisional ballots, to be certified later. Among \n     those who did not get one was Chuck Conway Jr. ``I think \n     there was some stinky stuff going on.''\n       Sometimes the post office robs people of their votes. In a \n     few counties in Oregon, long and heavy ballots were returned \n     this year for postage due. But the most egregious postal \n     failure came in Washington state.\n       Steven and Barbara Forrest and their 29-year-old son mailed \n     in ballots from Bellevue on election day. Several days later, \n     two of the ballots were found on the island of Fyn, 100 miles \n     from Copenhagen, in Denmark.\n       Brian and Helle Kain of Odense, Denmark, discovered them in \n     a large envelope containing navigational charts they had \n     ordered from a company on Shaw Island, 50 miles north of \n     Seattle. They called the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, which \n     told them not to worry because it was too late to count the \n     ballots anyway.\n       A Danish reporter telephoned Forrest, and he called Julie \n     Anne Kempf, the King County election superintendent. Kempf \n     was miffed. She phoned the embassy. Her country, she said, \n     was far from certifying its election.\n       At last notice, the two ballots were on their way home. But \n     the Forrests have no idea what happened to their son's vote. \n     ``We hope it got counted,'' Forrest says. ``We feel very \n     strongly about voting.\n       ``We told the department of elections that we are upset \n     about it. But I guess if you're going to assess blame, it \n     almost certainly had to go to the Postal Service.''\n\n\n                          Voluntary Standards\n\n       Some of this voting chaos is because there is actually no \n     such thing in this country as a national election. Americans \n     vote in a hodgepodge of 3,141 counties with 10,000 local \n     jurisdictions.\n       Yet, election officials have never come up with uniform, \n     binding rules for voting.\n       Federal standards, now in the process of being updated, are \n     voluntary. Each state, for instance, decides which voting \n     machine systems can be sold within its borders. Then, like \n     patients in a health insurance network, counties and cities \n     make their purchases from the state list.\n       Gary L. Greenhalgh says he favored ``mandatory standards \n     with teeth'' when he directed the Federal Election \n     Commission's national clearing house on election \n     administration from 1975 to 1985, while election rules were \n     under discussion.\n       But Congress did not want to impose new cost requirements \n     on the states, he says, and the standards became voluntary.\n       The Federal Election Commission had no money to enforce \n     standards, and vendors were wary of picking up the cost. So \n     an association of state election directors hired a consultant \n     to find laboratories to test voting systems. The group agreed \n     to medicate among vendors, labs and authorities.\n       It became an example of interdependence between public \n     election officials and private companies that critics say can \n     grow too intimate. In this instance, there was no illegality, \n     not even over-reliance upon the vendors to do official \n     duties--but there was unchallenged secrecy.\n       The first vendor to sign up for testing complained about \n     Election Technology Laboratories, says R. Doug Lewis, \n     executive director of the Houston-based Election Center, \n     which helps administer the program. Among the vendor's \n     concerns was the lab's desire to examine its actual lines of \n     computer programming code.\n       Administrators sided with the vendor, saying they had not \n     intended such a deep level of examination.\n       ``What's going on inside the machine is of no concern,'' \n     said consultant Robert Naegele, who wrote the standards. ``My \n     major concerns were accuracy, reliability and \n     maintainability.''\n       ``That's not rigorous testing,'' counters Arnold B. Urken, \n     a co-founder of the Election Technology lab. Mischief or \n     mistakes could go undetected.\n       ``I'm not saying vendors are evil, but unless you test the \n     code, you don't know,'' Urken says. Cars and airplanes are \n     regulated at that deep level, he adds. ``Why should we demand \n     anything less when we're electing the president of the United \n     States?''\n\n\n            Proposals for Improving National election system\n\n       There is no unanimity on how to fix the myriad problems \n     with the election system nationally that have been \n     spotlighted by the razor-thin presidential vote in Florida. \n     But among the many proposals circulating, the following have \n     been culled from interviews with scores of county, state and \n     federal elections officials, voting equipment vendors and \n     other experts:\n       * Adopt minimum mandatory national standards for voting \n     equipment used in elections for federal offices and provide \n     funds to help counties meet them. This could include \n     hardware, software and ballots that would be phased in.\n       Current standards are voluntary. Congress has been \n     reluctant to intervene in election procedures, which the U.S. \n     Constitution delegates to states.\n       * Require periodic recertification of all voting equipment.\n       Some current equipment, which has never been certified, is \n     decades old and the manufacturers are no longer in business.\n       * Encourage states and counties to upgrade training for \n     county election officials and poll workers. This could be \n     done through federal mandates, federal grants or both.\n       * Urge all states to set uniform standards for how to \n     determine a voter's intent if it is not clear.\n       Many states already do this, but there is no national \n     consistency, as evidenced by various counties imposing \n     different standards in the Florida recount.\n       * Adopt uniform standards and provide funding to help \n     prevent voting in more than one state by purging county rolls \n     of voters who have moved or died.\n       Currently, in many counties, when new residents register to \n     vote, the information is sent back to the county where they \n     previously resided. But the practice is uneven.\n       * Establish an ethics code for county elections officials \n     to prevent revolving-door and conflict-of-interest problems. \n     Set standards as well for gifts from vendors.\n\n  Mr. BOND. In addition to the story about the people coming in with \nballots from who knows where, an even more interesting series of facts \nwas unearthed in a study by Portland State University professor Melody \nRose who did work assessing the potential for fraud and coercion in \nOregon's mail-in voting. Her preliminary data is quite revealing. This \nis a sample, not exact, but she said 5 percent of voters in Oregon had \nsomeone else mark their ballot; 2.5 percent of voters had someone else \nsign their ballots; 4 percent of voters either signed or marked someone \nelse's ballot.\n  In a State such as Oregon with about 1.6 million ballots cast in \n2000, those percentages could equate to fairly high numbers. If the \npreliminary data were to hold up across the entire population, that \nmight mean 80,000 voters had someone else mark their ballots, 40,000 \nvoters had someone illegally sign, and 64,000 voters signed or marked \nsomeone else's ballot.\n  I am not comforted by the assertions that Oregon has everything under \ncontrol and thus should be exempt from antifraud protections in this \nbill. We\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nare not going to get everybody who commits fraud. I certainly hope my \ncolleague from Oregon was correct when he said prosecutions are \nunderway. I feel like ``Waiting for Godot'' to see the successful \nprosecution of election fraud. Too often they find there are better \nthings to do. Colleagues from other States have told me about people \nvoting freely and admitted they voted multiple times and are never \nprosecuted.\n  I mentioned Cora Thigpen who voted twice. She was just getting up a \nhead of steam. I am afraid she will not get prosecuted. We need more \nprosecutions. We cannot do that here. We can assess the penalties. We \nneed strong poll workers watching each other, Republicans watching \nDemocrats. We need strong prosecution. The minimal provisions to \nprotect against drop houses and phony registration--which, yes, \nincludes permitting dogs to register in Missouri and permitting lots of \nother people to vote illegally; there were 3,000 phony ballots for a \nmayor's race; 30,000 uninvestigated ballots before a general election \nin Missouri in November of 2000. We have to do something. We have to \nbegin to get a handle on it and make it more difficult, if not \nimpossible--I wish we could, and I will take any ideas anyone has to \nmake it--impossible to commit fraud.\n  This compromise language we worked on for 6 months was designed to \ntake into account the need of all the special individuals who we want \nto make sure can vote. At the same time, we are providing money and \nresources for voting machines, for voter education. This bill comes at \nall of these problems in a coordinated way and says yes, we have to do \na better job. We have to do a better job making sure that everybody who \nis entitled to vote gets to vote, and to make sure that those who cast \nthe vote are not having their vote canceled or diluted by people \nsetting up drop houses, registering phony names, whether they be \nnonexistent people, dead people, or dogs.\n  The amendment of the Senator from New York undoes the compromise we \nhave reached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes to respond \nto the comments the distinguished Senator from Missouri made about \nOregon and offer up a proposal for how we might avoid the gridlock that \nlooks as if it may be at hand.\n  With respect to vote by mail and how it is working in the State of \nOregon, in the special election held in 1996 where the principal \ncandidates were myself and our colleague, Senator Smith, we had almost \ntwo-thirds of all eligible voters participate in that election. The \nlevel of participation was three times as high as that held in the \nprevious special election for a Senate seat. We in effect broke all the \nrecords for participation in a Senate special election.\n  As I stated earlier, our colleague, Senator Smith, to his credit, \nwhen pressed on the subject, said that there was no evidence of voter \nfraud that he in any way believed affected the election. What we have \nin the State of Oregon is tremendous benefit in terms of voter \nparticipation. The level of participation is three times as high as \nthat seen in the previous Senate special election that certified new \nSenators in this body with my colleague Senator Smith--the person who \nmight well have expressed concerns and did not state any whatever at \nthe time, or since.\n  My sense is that the distinguished Senator from Missouri is basically \nnow saying he is against mail-in voting as well. He has said he is \nfollowing the constitutionality of various issues relating to mail-in \nvoting, and I think this raises again that there is a lot being \npresented to the Senate other than deterring fraud. I am certainly \ninterested in working with our colleagues, Senator McConnell and \nSenator Bond, in particular, on this issue because I think we are in a \nvery difficult position, given the last hour and a half of debate. The \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky has essentially announced if our \nside prevails, if the amendment prevails and the photo ID is struck, he \nwill in effect have to take to the floor for a considerable length of \ntime, and that will obstruct our ability to go forward.\n  I certainly do not want to respond in kind. I have passed on that \neffort up to this point. I was not party to the negotiations that took \nplace in committee. I can tell the President and our colleagues I very \nmuch wanted to put a hold on this bill and would have come to the floor \nand publicly announced that hold in line with the procedural reforms \nthat Senator Grassley and I have advocated, stipulating that all holds \nought to be public, but I didn't do it in deference to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, who made it \nclear he would work with me and others to try to resolve this issue.\n  So there has been a lot of good faith on this side of the aisle. I \nwould offer up the idea, even at this late hour, that rather than \nhaving this sort of mutual assured destruction, where everybody takes \ndown everybody else's work product--and there is so much that can be \nagreed upon--I think we ought to have another round of negotiations. As \none Senator who did not get to participate in the first round, I am \nanxious to meet our colleagues halfway.\n  For example, if our colleagues are willing to talk about getting rid \nof the photo ID, which I and others believe is so onerous for seniors, \nminorities, and others, I think we ought to be looking at ways to \nfigure out how to put the voter registration requirement into effect in \n2002.\n  If we are going to be tough on fraud, let's be tough now rather than \nwaiting to get so far down the road. I know it is difficult to do, but \nI think those kinds of ideas would provide an opportunity for at least \nsome further discussion in an effort to try to work this out.\n  I know there have been months and months of negotiation in good faith \nin the committee. But this Senator, who has a State where vote by mail \nhas worked, a State that has empowered so many through vote by mail, I \ndidn't participate in any of those negotiations. On top of that, I \nprobably, without thinking about Senators Dodd and McConnell, I \nprobably would have put a hold on this bill until this issue had been \nresolved because of my concern for the State.\n  I am anxious to meet my colleagues halfway in an effort to resolve \nthis issue. But I think at the end of the day we have to figure out \nways to make it easier to vote, easier to participate in the political \nprocess, as we deter fraud. The fact is, this is going to make it \ntougher to vote.\n  The hour is very late. I cannot believe the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Dodd, and the distinguished ranking minority \nmember, Senator McConnell, are all that wild about staying here until \nthe wee hours trying to figure out another way to deter fraud without \nhaving this photo ID requirement. But I want to make that offer.\n  This is so important. There is so much good work that has been done \non this issue. Let us try to find common ground on the issue of \ndeterring fraud--that is something both Democrats and Republicans feel \nstrongly about--rather than taking this bill down, which is where we \nappear to be headed tonight.\n  I would like to participate in the negotiations. I have made it clear \nI wish I had the opportunity as a member of the committee to do so. \nThis basically is my first opportunity to have a chance to formally \nparticipate in the discussion. I would like to look at ways to deter \nfraud aggressively. If we are serious about it, we should not be \nwaiting until 2004, we should be trying to do it now. We should be \ntrying to do it for this upcoming election.\n  I think it is just one of several ideas that we might possibly, even \nat this late hour, figure out a way to come together on and make sure \nwe are united in terms of fighting fraud, not going forward with \nsomething which is going to disenfranchise so many voters, which I \nbelieve is the end result of photo ID.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ntemporarily set aside the pending amendment in order to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague wait for a minute or so? Then I will be \nglad to turn to him.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from New Hampshire has been\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nhere quite some time, seated. I want to give him a chance to engage in \nthis.\n  First of all, let me thank our colleague from Missouri and colleagues \nfrom New York and Oregon. They have been engaged in meaningful debate. \nI regret there are not more Members here-- it has been a long day--not \nhere to listen to this, what I think has been a very valuable \ndiscussion. Hopefully, through the vehicles of C-SPAN and other such \nmethods, people in the country have had a good opportunity to hear what \nI think has been a very worthwhile discussion about a very important \nissue.\n  I thank all of them for their very generous comments about the miles \nwe have traveled to get us to this point, which is only a few yards \naway from what could be final passage of a historic piece of \nlegislation. Significant resources are being committed by the Federal \nGovernment to our States and localities to improve what I think the \nSenator from Missouri properly described as a shoddy system, and I \nthink maybe he was being polite about not one State but the entire \ncountry, one which is desperately in need of repair, so that our great \nNation should be a model to other societies on how a great democratic \nsociety chooses its leaders.\n  Certainly anyone who has looked at this has concluded that this is a \nsystem in need of repair. The Senator from Kentucky and I have worked \nvery hard to bring us to this point. We have adopted over 30 different \namendments, in addition to what we tried to do ourselves. We thought we \nwere thinking about a lot of things that people might anticipate. This \nis a subject matter where every Member of this Chamber is an expert. We \nare talking about elections, and everyone had to go through one to get \nhere. So this is not a subject matter about which any Senator believes \nhe or she does not bring something to the table when it comes to a \ndiscussion about how people vote and how those votes are counted.\n  What I would like to suggest--we are planning, obviously tomorrow, \nnow, at sometime around 10 a.m., to have a vote. I am hopeful that \neveryone will try, even at this late hour, the Senator from Oregon has \nraised the prospect, to see if there might not be, despite our efforts \nover the weeks to find a resolution--maybe there is a possibility of \nfinding some common ground that might avoid what I think might be a \nvery close vote on this subject matter.\n  I don't know the votes. I haven't been participating in any vote \ncounts. I haven't called Members. I haven't asked Members how they \nwould vote on this. The leader has done that. I have stayed out of it. \nBut I hope we might find some way to resolve this issue without having \nit come to a vote.\n  Maybe we can't. Every now and then you can try your best to bring \npeople together and ultimately they decide they just want to cast a \nballot. That being the case, and I don't know the outcome, all I want \nto say is that this is how the process works. You have to accept to \nsome degree, I suppose, allowing the process to function. I just hope \nin the passions, the emotions that people feel on this, we would not \nplace ourselves in a situation where we take out literally dozens of \namendments and dozens of ideas in the hopes of crafting something \nworthwhile. So I am hopeful we may work something out.\n  That is all the comment I want to make this evening, except to thank \nthe two Senators who have spoken so eloquently on the subject matter. \nSenator Schumer was involved for a long time and introduced one of the \nfirst bills, with our colleague from Kentucky, on this subject matter \nover a year ago. Senator Wyden cares about it clearly, and his State \nuniquely, along with the State of Washington, is acting as sort of \npioneers in the area of 21st century voting with mail-in voters that \nhas successfully worked in his State. He has very rightly sought, along \nwith his colleague, Senator Smith and others, to see to it that we \nwould not in any way jeopardize his State or the State of Washington \nfrom continuing to pursue some novel, unique, and very worthwhile ideas \non how people can cast their ballots. I thank him and his colleagues \nfor those efforts to bring us to this particular point.\n  Of course, I thank again my good friend from Kentucky. He has a lot \non his mind. He is in the middle of the campaign finance reform debate \nand there has been no more diligent and articulate spokesman for an \nalternative point of view in that debate. I admire his courage. He has \ntaken a real beating around the ears from people all across the \ncountry. While I disagree with him, I admire immensely his guts; that \nhe doesn't back down on something in which he believes.\n  He has been a great ally in this effort. It has not been easy trying \nto juggle a lot of different balls in the air. The one on campaign \nfinance reform is one in which he has been deeply involved, and has \nborne, I think, the brunt of unfair criticism about what he cares \nabout. I didn't want the evening to end without expressing my emotional \nappeal to my colleague from Kentucky that my respect for him is \nunlimited in terms of his commitment to the things and principles in \nwhich he believes. I just hope we might find some way to resolve this \nmatter.\n  Senator Bond was one of the first people I talked to about this bill, \nin addition to my colleague from Kentucky, and about his determination \nto try to reduce and eliminate, to the extent possible, fraud in the \ncountry. My colleagues from New York and Oregon have identified their \nremarks with his ambition to seek a system that would be devoid of \nfraudulent behavior. We deplore it wherever it occurs. But my hope is \nthat with the balance struck between where Senator Bond wants to be and \nwhere others raise legitimate points, there is still room to find \ncommon ground. That is my fervent hope--to the staff, and to others who \nare involved in this--before we cast votes or find ourselves in a \nposition where the middle ground becomes impossible to find or is lost.\n  With that simple plea, let me yield the floor to others who want to \nmake any closing comments. My colleague from New Hampshire has an \namendment he is going to raise. I will certainly be happy to sit here \nand listen to his proposal as he offers it, and then urge our staff, \nSenator Bond's staff, and the staff of Senators Wyden and Schumer to \nmaybe sit down and see if there isn't some common ground, along with \nthe staff of Senator McConnell. We are prepared to stay around as well \nto see if we can help in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his kind remarks, not only on this issue but the other issue that \nhas kept us largely preoccupied in the last few days. Hopefully, we \nwill have a vote in the morning and will know where we stand on the \nfuture of this bill.\n  I commend all of those involved. The Senator from New Hampshire has \nbeen waiting patiently. Therefore, we look forward to what he has to \nsay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Schumer/Wyden \namendment. The 2000 election clearly illustrated that there are \nsignificant flaws in our election system. In many places our systems of \nvoting are antiquated and people are being disenfranchised.\n  The bill we have before us seeks to correct those problems.\n  It improves voting systems, provides a mean for provisional voting, \ncuts down on voter fraud, and provides grants to States so they can \nimprove their methods of voting.\n  The bill is not perfect. During consideration of this bill, I had \nworked with my colleagues on both sides to make sure that the intent of \nthis reform bill is realized.\n  We want fewer people turned away from the polls, and we want to bring \nour states' election systems into the 21st century.\n  In my home State of Washington, 69-percent of votes in last \nNovember's election were cast by mail. Every election that percentage \nincreases, and those numbers are larger for new voters.\n  In the state of Oregon, by law every voter casts their ballot by \nmail. This method has made it much easier for those who lack adequate \ntransportation, or are elderly, or disabled or are single mothers to \nvote. Previously disenfranchised voters now can exercise their most \nimportant civic city because of vote by mail.\n  This legislation has several provisions that make the vote by mail \nprocess more difficult and in some cases could kill this method of \nvoting. Two weeks ago, I worked with Senators\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nCantwell, Dodd, McConnell, Wyden, and others to perfect a provision in \nthe bill that would have placed an undo burden on jurisdictions \nutilizing vote by mail.\n  I thank those Senators who worked on that amendment.\n  There is a remaining obstacle to mail-in balloting in this bill that \nrequires first-time voters to show some identification prior to voting.\n  Many voters don't have access to a polling place because they lack \ntransportation, they are working too hard to provide for their families \nor are elderly or disabled.\n  The ability to vote by mail gives them the opportunity to participate \nin our democracy. These are the voters we cannot abandon as we address \nsome of the obvious deficiencies in our nation's current electoral \nsystem.\n  The provision in the underlying bill places new and cumbersome \nhurdles on these types of voters and could potentially displace many \nnew voters who want to get involved in the election process but could \nnot without vote by mail.\n  I agree with many Senators that we must cut down on voter fraud and \nthis bill does that.\n  In Washington, we run clean elections. We have had some very close \nraces, and the integrity of the system has only been enhanced by the \nway the State has conducted those elections and the professionalism of \nthe individuals involved.\n  I strongly support the Schumer/Wyden amendment.\n  Simply, this amendment would allow States like Washington and Oregon, \nwho have significant numbers of mail-in voters, to create a signature \nverification system where signatures are matched against their \nregistration.\n  This is a common sense approach that will insure that those that vote \nby mail don't have to go through overly burdensome hurdles in \nexercising their civic duty.\n  If we are unable to adopt this amendment, systems like those in \nOregon and Washington could become unworkable and many new voters would \nfind themselves without a say in the election of their public \nofficials.\n  That would be an unacceptable result to this Senator.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for \ntheir courtesy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside for \nthe purpose of offering another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2933\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2933.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON BROADCAST OF CERTAIN FALSE AND \n                   UNTIMELY INFORMATION ON FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\n       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 315 \n     the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 315A. PROHIBITION ON BROADCAST OF CERTAIN FALSE AND \n                   UNTIMELY INFORMATION ON FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\n       ``(a) False Information on Location and Operating Hours of \n     Polling Places.--A licensee who, on the day of a Federal \n     election, knowingly broadcasts using a facility covered by \n     the license any false information concerning the location or \n     time of operation of a polling place designated by the \n     appropriate State authorities for use by electors in such \n     election shall be fined not more than $10,000,000, imprisoned \n     not more than five years, or both.\n       ``(b) Untimely Results of Exit Polls.--A licensee who, on \n     the day of a Federal election, knowingly broadcasts using a \n     facility covered by the license the results of an exit poll \n     or election projection taken within a jurisdiction covered by \n     the license as an actual election result before all polling \n     places in the jurisdiction designated by appropriate State \n     authorities for use by electors in such election have closed \n     shall be fined not more than $10,000,000, imprisoned not more \n     than five years, or both.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I \ndon't want to inconvenience my colleagues for too long. My purpose in \nrising now is to get an amendment in for tomorrow. I will try to keep \nthat in mind and be as brief as possible.\n  I was listening to my colleague, Senator Wyden, talking about getting \nvoters to the polls and encouraging them to go to the polls. One of the \nways to encourage them to go to the polls is to not have the broadcast \nmedia tell the voters the polls are closed before they are. That is \nreally what my amendment is about.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will agree with me and realize it is \nimproper to do that for obvious reasons, and join me in perhaps \nagreeing to this amendment overwhelmingly.\n  I call it the broadcast fraud amendment. It simply prohibits the \nbroadcasting of certain false information on election day. \nUnfortunately, this amendment is necessary to strengthen Federal \nprohibitions on the broadcast of false election information--\ninformation, by the way, that the broadcasters know full well is false \nbefore they broadcast it. It could change the outcome of a Federal \nelection.\n  There are two provisions in this amendment.\n  First, the amendment prohibits a broadcaster from knowingly \nbroadcasting false information concerning the location or time of \noperation of a polling place. In other words, if the broadcaster went \non the air at 6 p.m. saying all the polls are closed when he knew they \nwere actually open until 7 p.m., that act would be a clear violation of \nthis amendment.\n  Second, this amendment prohibits a broadcaster from knowingly \nbroadcasting the results of an exit poll or election projection as an \nactual election result before all polling places in the jurisdiction \nhave closed. That would also be a violation of this amendment. For \nexample, a broadcaster goes on the air saying at 6 p.m. the race is \nover and the winner is candidate A when the polls are actually open \nuntil 7 p.m. It is one thing if the broadcaster says based on exit \npolling, but that is not what we are talking about.\n  So the act of calling the election at 6 p.m. would be a violation of \nthis amendment because that act by a broadcaster would lead thousands \nof voters to not vote because they would believe their vote would not \ncount. If they were being told on the television that the polls were \nclosed over and over again, why would they vote unless they were to \nchallenge the broadcaster and begin to ask questions? Supposedly, the \npress is supposed to be telling you the truth when they talk to you.\n  Let me be clear, because there will be critics, this amendment does \nnot prohibit a broadcaster at any time from saying we have exit poll \nnumbers that show this trend or that trend, and, if the trend \ncontinues, candidate A is supposed to win the race. That is not the \nissue.\n  This amendment only prevents the broadcasting of exit polls that \nproject the actual election results. That is the issue. If they project \nthese results as actual, that is what it precludes; in other words, \nsaying candidate A has won the State when in fact it is only the exit \npolls that say that, not the actual poll.\n  Furthermore, it only prohibits the broadcasting of this sort of \ninformation after the polls are closed. If you want to go on the air \nand broadcast false information to the voters, this amendment allows \nyou to do it, but wait until the polls are closed.\n  Let us say you have exit polls which say candidate A is a winner \nbased on the exit polls. But the polls close at 7, and you have this \ninformation at 6. Wait until 7 when all the polls are closed, and then \nyou can say anything you want. You can say the exit polls say this guy \nwon regardless, and actually won. Then say anything you want. That is \nall we are saying. It is very important to understand that because that \nis a very serious distinction.\n\n  Another serious problem with the premature broadcast of exit polling \nis that on occasion the exit poll is incorrect. Our 43rd President, Al \nGore, and\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nSenator Dick Swett of New Hampshire discovered that they were victims \nof false exit polls, because there was no Senator Swett. He was told he \nwas the winner when in fact he wasn't. And there was no President Al \nGore even though he was told he was President. He wasn't.\n  If the media wants to make a total fool of themselves and say Gore \nwas elected and Swett was elected to the Senate, they can go out there \nand say it. That is fine, but wait until the polls are closed. Then you \ncan say it.\n  That is all we ask. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  Most people do not know too much about my race, although it happened. \nIn Florida, everybody knows about it.\n  I bring it up because it really goes to the heart of the amendment. \nTo understand the ramifications of voters receiving false information \nabout the closing time of the polling place, we need to look no further \nthan the recent Presidential election in Florida. The Florida polling \nplaces closed at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. That meant that in the \nFlorida panhandle, which is in the Central Zone, polling places \nactually closed at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The voters in the \npanhandle had their votes suppressed in that election because the media \nbroadcasted explicit information that the Florida polls had closed.\n  I know some I will say they really didn't say that. I will give you \nthe actual quotes from most of the major networks and anchors in a few \nmoments. This action happened 1 hour before the polls closed in the \nFlorida Panhandle, and it was repeated constantly time after time and \nnetwork after network throughout that final hour. No matter what \nchannel you watched, you were going to hear that the polls in Florida \nwere closed. If you were going to vote or wanted to vote, you were told \nby Peter Jennings or Tom Brokaw that the polls were closed. You would \nbelieve them. That is what they were saying. I will give you the quotes \nin a moment.\n  The suppression of votes could have a dramatic effect on the \nelection. I am not getting into intent. I don't know the intent, but I \ncan show that they knew. The events that transpired in Florida have \nbeen studied to understand how the suppression of a few votes almost \nchanged history.\n  According to the Committee for Honest Politics, there were two \ninterest studies of the Florida Panhandle situation in the last \nPresidential election. At 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, or 6 p.m. \nCentral Time, the major networks stated that the polls in Florida were \nclosed one hour before the polls in the Florida Panhandle actually \nclosed. They said the State of Florida polls were closed when in fact \nonly on the eastern side of the State was that true, and in the \npanhandle it was not true.\n  The major networks went a step further. They called the Florida \nelection for Al Gore as President at 7:50 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, \nten minutes before the panhandle polls closed, and 50 minutes after the \nmajor networks announced that the Florida polls had closed.\n  John McLaughlin & Associates compiled a survey that estimated the \nearly call of the election discouraged more than four percent of \nRepublicans more than Democrats to go to the polls. But that is a \npolitical issue, take it or leave it, like it or dislike it. The real \nissue here is that people were discouraged from voting no matter of \nwhat party.\n  Another study by John R. Lott, Jr. of the Yale Law School estimated \nthe dropoff at about 3 p.m., or a range of 7,500 to 10,000 Republican \nvoters.\n  Why do I say that? Because the Florida panhandle is traditionally \nRepublican.\n  Obviously, when you are talking about a few hundred votes--indeed a \nfew dozen votes at times deciding an election--several thousand is a \nhuge, huge issue.\n  Here are excerpts from affidavits about what happened in the Florida \nPanhandle in 2000. There were some 40 affidavits from poll workers, \npoll clerks, poll inspectors, and bailiffs. This is what they had to \nsay. I will repeat a few of these.\n  A poll worker in Bay County, Precinct No. 23:\n\n       I have been a poll worker since the 1970's. Voting was \n     steady all day until 6:00 p.m. Between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m.--\n\n  This is panhandle time--\n\n       it was very different from past elections. It was very \n     empty. The poll workers thought it was odd. It was like ``the \n     lights went out.'' We joked with the deputy on duty because \n     there was no one in line for the deputy to be placed behind \n     when the polls closed.\n\n  The clerk for elections, Okaloosa County, Precinct No. 37:\n\n       We had over 1,300 people turn out with an average of about \n     100 voters per hour until the last hour.\n\n  This is when the media was on the air saying the polls were closed--\nevery media.\n\n       When the doors were open, there were quite a number of \n     people waiting in line to vote. There was a heavy flow \n     throughout the day. . . . Soon after 6:00, I noticed that the \n     volume dropped to almost zero.\n\n  So those are two poll workers saying that the numbers dropped to \nalmost zero after the broadcasters began talking about this on national \ntelevision.\n  He said further:\n\n       In past elections, there was usually a rush of people \n     coming from work, trying to get to vote [in that last hour] \n     before the polls closed.\n\n  I think we have all experienced that.\n  Clerk of elections, Okaloosa County, Precinct No. 34:\n\n       As the Clerk, my duties included working the books, \n     instructing people to vote, and handling the ballots, and \n     making sure that things go smoothly and courteously. When the \n     doors were open, there were about 50-60 people waiting in \n     line to vote. During the rest of day, there was a constant \n     flow of voters. We were expecting a rush after Hurlburt Field \n     let out about 4:30. I began to get my workers to take their \n     dinner breaks before 6:00 anticipating people coming before \n     the polls closed. Between 6:15-6:20, I looked around and \n     asked, ``Where is everybody?'' My poll workers were just as \n     perplexed as I was. I don't think we had more than five \n     people from 6:15 until we closed at 7:00. We had averaged 80 \n     voters per hour until the last hour.\n\n  Deputy for elections, Santa Rosa County, Precinct No. 34:\n\n       On Tuesday, November 7, 2000, I was on duty and worked at \n     the precinct from 6:00 AM until 8:00 PM. We have the second \n     largest precinct in the county with 4,678 voters. I kept \n     track of the number of voters per hour. There were many \n     voters waiting to vote in the first hour and then there was a \n     steady flow all day. By the last hour, there was a dramatic \n     decline in voters. It is the deputy's job to stand behind the \n     last voter in line at 7:00 PM. Eight years ago in the \n     presidential election, there were so many people in line that \n     the last voter did not vote until nearly 10:30 PM. When I \n     went outside at the end of the day to tell people to hurry \n     along, there was no one in the parking lot.\n\n  Poll inspector, Escambia County, Precinct No. 8:\n\n       I have worked elections for the past three years to include \n     local and Congressional. On Tuesday, November 7, 2000, I was \n     on duty and worked at the precinct from 7:00 AM until 7:00 PM \n     for the general election. We had the usual rush in the early \n     morning, at noon and right after work. There was a \n     significant drop in voters after 6:00. The last 40 minutes \n     was almost empty. The poll workers were wondering if there \n     had been a national disaster they didn't know about. It was \n     my observation that this decline in voters between 6:00 and \n     7:00 was very different when compared to previous elections. \n     The last 30 minutes was particularly empty. There is usually \n     a line after the poll closes. In this election there was no \n     one.\n  I think what the review showed clearly is that all five networks \nannounced to the public, at the top of the hour, that the Florida polls \nhad closed; that is, at 6 p.m. Central Time the polls throughout \nFlorida had closed when, in fact, there was still a full and crucial \nhour of voting left. That is not right.\n  Stated another way, when 361 polling places were open and expecting a \nnormal end-of-the-day voter turnout, the west Florida public was told, \nfalsely, that no voting places remained open.\n  Let me say that again. In the last hour of the election in the \nFlorida Panhandle, 361 precincts were ready to go in that last hour, \nexpecting a rush of people coming home from work, and the public was \ntold, on all of the major networks, that the polls were closed.\n  I am not exaggerating. I am going to show you that in a second. With \nthe exception of Fox, all the other networks repeated the Florida poll-\nclosing information throughout the 7 p.m. eastern time broadcast over \nand over again. They reported that the Florida polls had closed, and so \nimplied by calling the Senate race or discussing exist polling data \nfrom Florida in a way that implied or assumed the polls were closed.\n  We cannot tell what was in the hearts and the minds of the network\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nexecutives and producers who made the decision to air incorrect \ninformation. That is not for me to say. All I can tell you is that the \nfacts are they aired incorrect information. I think, although they will \nsay they did not know because they were never informed, that is not \ntrue. I would like to call your attention to this news release. The one \nthing the press does is they do take a look at their news releases.\n  The election was November the 7th in 2000. This news release is dated \nOctober 30, 2000. It was put out by the Florida secretary of state, \nKatherine Harris. As I say, it was a news release.\n\n       Secretary of State Requests Patience in Predicting Winners \n     of Races.\n\n  This is 8 days prior to the election. The news release says:\n\n       Tallahassee, Fl--Secretary of State Katherine Harris today \n     requested the media to delay predictions of the outcome of \n     elections until after 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Florida \n     has six counties in the Central Time zone and the Secretary \n     wants all Floridians' votes to be cast prior to predictions \n     on the winners of races.\n       With several races too close to call, full voter \n     involvement is imperative for Floridians to participate in \n     the electoral process. ``The last thing we need is to have \n     our citizens in the Central Time zone think their vote \n     doesn't count--because it certainly does!''\n       Waiting until 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time allows all \n     Floridians the opportunity to decide the outcome of races \n     within Florida.\n\n  It is very interesting that is from Katherine Harris because \nKatherine Harris became a very famous person after November 7. But this \nwas 8 days prior to November 7. A lot of people had a lot of things to \nsay about Katherine Harris, but she is not Nostradamus. She had no idea \nhow this election was going to be counted and recounted and overcounted \nor undercounted, and dealing with the chads and all that. She did not \nknow anything about that on October 30. She was trying to point out to \nthe media: Be careful. Central Time is part of Florida and East Coast \nTime is part of Florida. Please be careful and be accurate.\n  That went to every media outlet--every one--and they ignored it. The \nnetworks either ignored it or they did not read it. Now, come on, with \nall the people in every one of these news outlets, are we going to say \nthey did not read it, no one read it? And I can prove to you, in a \nmoment, that they did.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this news release be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Secretary of State Requests Patience in Predicting Winners of Races\n\n       Tallahassee, FL.--Secretary of State Katherine Harris today \n     requested the media to delay predictions of the outcome of \n     elections until after 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Florida \n     has six counties in the Central Time Zone and the Secretary \n     wants all Floridians' votes to be cast prior to predictions \n     on the winners of races.\n       With several races too close to call, full voter \n     involvement is imperative for Floridians to participate in \n     the electoral process. ``The last thing we need is to have \n     our citizens in the Central Time zone think their vote \n     doesn't count--because it certainly does!''\n       Waiting until 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time allows all \n     Floridians the opportunity to decide the outcome of races \n     within Florida.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nplease--I know you get a million pieces of mail, and I know you have a \nlot of things to do--view a 7-minute video that I sent to each and \nevery one of your offices. You all have it. Maybe your staff is hiding \nit from you or maybe they looked at it. I don't know. Maybe they \ndidn't, but it is there. If they lost it, ask me. I will give you \nanother one. It is excerpts of each and every one of these networks \nsaying the same thing, over and over and over again, ad nauseam, \nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock: The polls are closed. Dan Rather: The polls \nare closed. Tom Brokaw: The polls are closed in Florida. Peter \nJennings.\n  If it was not so serious in terms of the consequences, it would be \nfunny; it would be hysterical. When you watch it, you will laugh. But \nnobody was laughing then. It was serious. Think about the pain we went \nthrough in this Nation that night, and for weeks to come, and all the \nway to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I believe, honestly, that all of it would have been avoided had it \nnot been for what the networks did that evening. I think the turnout \nwould have been more and the election would have been decided, I think \noverwhelmingly in favor of President Bush; but maybe it would have been \nthe other way. The point is, it would have been decided. I do not think \nwe would have had all the problems.\n  Let me read this just briefly, and then I will stop. Although I hope \nyou all watch the tape, I have a feeling some of you will not watch the \ntape. So here are a few excerpts from some of the biggest names--the \nbiggest names--in the media. Listen carefully. I am not exaggerating \none word. These are quotes right off the air. And they are on the tape \nif you watch it.\n  This is now between 6 and 7 p.m. Central Time, between 7 and 8 p.m. \nEastern Time; 6 and 7 p.m. panhandle time, with an hour yet to go at \nthe polls. At 7:01 they started.\n  Al Hunt, CNN:\n\n       We now go to our election headquarters in Atlanta where it \n     is 7:00 p.m. in the East. Polls have just closed in Florida, \n     New Hampshire, and Virginia.\n\n  No doubt about that: ``Polls have just closed in Florida, New \nHampshire, and Virginia.'' There is no qualifier. It did not say it was \nopen in the Florida Panhandle.\n  Brit Hume, Fox News:\n\n       All right folks, we're coming up--right now it's 7:00 and \n     we are in position to project a number of races. Looking at \n     the State of Florida, where the polls have just closed, that \n     race remains too close to call.\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about the Senate race of which our colleague, \nBill Nelson, won.\n  Dan Rather, CBS News:\n\n       The polls just closed in six states, with 66 electoral \n     votes including Florida's big 25, but no call yet in what \n     both campaigns say may be the key to this election--Florida.\n\n  Peter Jennings, ABC News:\n\n       And now the polls have closed in six more states, so first, \n     in Florida, in the Presidential race in Florida, we simply \n     believe it is too close to call.\n\n  Tom Brokaw, NBC:\n\n       The polls have just now closed in six additional states \n     representing 66 electoral votes. Let's take you through them \n     now. Look at this, states that are too close to call--even \n     though the polls have closed now. Here we are in Georgia, \n     with 13 electoral votes; New Hampshire, with 4; and a big \n     prize, the brass ring for this evening--to start everything \n     off, the State of Florida [where the polls have just closed].\n\n  Bernard Shaw, CNN:\n\n       At 7:00 the polls have closed in certain states, and CNN is \n     looking at what is going on in Florida.\n\n  I am repeating these because they are saying it over and over again. \nThey are not saying it just once.\n  Dan Rather, CBS, again:\n\n       Also just closed their polls, but the races are too close \n     to call. Look at this--Florida--25. The States in white--\nthese are all the States where the polls have closed, but where it is \ntoo early to make a call. Florida the biggun'.\n\n  Bernard Shaw, CNN:\n\n       For your viewers, watching our coverage, this is the \n     electoral map, every time we call the states, we will tell \n     you what the totals are. What's going on at this hour across \n     this country is a massive ground, war, he talked about \n     Florida, he took it up the east coast, talked about the \n     Republican strength in the panhandle.\n\n  Peter Jennings, ABC:\n\n       But the white states, as they appear on the map at the \n     moment, are too close to call.\n\n  Cokie Roberts:\n\n       The Democrats are hoping to take advantage of some of the \n     new people who have moved into Florida, and to pick up maybe \n     one, maybe two, maybe three Republican held seats in Florida. \n     We don't know the results there, even though the polls are \n     closed.\n\n  Peter Jennings again:\n\n       It's also not true that turnout has been going down \n     steadily over the last few years and that some of the places \n     in Florida in the exit polls we looked at, so far, we don't \n     see necessarily a vigorous turnout by young people. For \n     example, but we do see many young people in that exit poll \n     going for Mr. Gore.\n\n  Dan Rather:\n\n       Hold the phone all these states in gray here, all these \n     states, are places where the polls are still open, and that \n     includes Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes.\n       Where the polls have closed, but no decision is in yet --\n     Florida with 25 electoral college votes.\n\n  Peter Jennings:\n\n       270 electoral votes needed to win, I'm going to say it time \n     and again, and there is our national map. The white are \n     states in which we currently believe it is too close to call.\n\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\n\n  Sam Donaldson, ABC:\n\n       The Democrats have just picked up another important seat in \n     Florida. It is an open seat. Connie Mack, the Republican, was \n     retiring. ABC News projects that Bill Nelson, the insurance \n     commissioner, has won that race.\n\n  Bernie Shaw:\n\n       Where ever you see yellow--that's an ooh-ooh, we can't tell \n     you anything about that state.\n\n  On and on.\n  Cokie Roberts:\n\n       It was called the Senate race for the Democratic candidate \n     there. So these are very important seats for the Democrats. \n     The polls are closed, we don't have any results yet.\n\n  Judy Woodruff:\n\n       We've had polls close in let's see--one, two, three, four, \n     five, six, seven, eight states--eight states so far. We have \n     been able to call George Bush the winner in four of those \n     states.\n\n  Dan Rather:\n\n       It's 7:30 here in the East, and this is the electoral vote \n     right now--with 270 needed to win. Bush 41, Gore 3.\n\n  Jeff Greenfield:\n\n       As we look at the electoral map we are obviously putting \n     none of these states in anybody's column.\n\n  Dan Rather:\n       It's early--don't be misled by the early Bush lead. Right \n     now, the polls have just closed in three more states.\n\n  And on and on. This is about 7:45.\n  Dan Rather again:\n\n       Let me show the electoral map. In Florida, the polls have \n     closed. No decision yet.\n\n  That is a sample of the networks' awareness of the importance of \nvoter turnout which aired between 6 and 7 p.m. central time that night. \nI ask you, if you lived there and you were hearing that, you flip the \nchannel, you go to another channel, flip the channel, you say: Man, I \nthought I got a notice somewhere that the polls were open, and they are \ntelling you they are closed. People believe what they see and hear in \nthe media. They were wrong. They were misled. This was out there. That \nis not the only thing that was out there. I will point that out in a \nsecond.\n  Listen to what else was out there. This is CNN now, the same networks \ncalling the election. Here is what else they are saying:\n\n       The Vice-President and Senator Lieberman we're told are \n     still making calls.\n\n  This is between 6 and 7 p.m. central time. These people are reporting \nthis. And rightfully so, Vice President Gore and Senator Lieberman \nshould be making calls. The election is not over. Guess where they are \nmaking them. Right into the Florida Panhandle.\n\n       The Vice-President and Senator Lieberman we're told are \n     still making calls, satellite interviews, radio interviews, \n     their wives both making calls. Just spoke to a White House \n     official who says the President of the United States has made \n     40 calls himself. Still making some at this hour, trying to \n     turn out the Democratic vote.\n\n  So they are telling everybody on one hand the polls are closed, and \nthey are telling them on the other hand that the Vice President and the \nPresident are making calls to get out the vote.\n  One final piece of evidence: There was further evidence that the \nnational news media--I will be kind and say--recklessly ignored the \nfact that the polls were still open. That is pretty reckless to ignore \nthat. That was out 7 or 8 days prior to the election.\n  Let me read some excerpts from Jeff Greenfield's book ``Oh, Waiter! \nOne Order of Crow!'' This is Jeff Greenfield, a very respected guy in \nthe media. He is basically telling them what they knew.\n\n       At 7:48 p.m., NBC called Florida for Gore, an act that \n     raised the competitive juices at the other networks.\n       So it was that CNN Political Director Tom Hannon, at 7:50 \n     p.m., opened the microphone to the anchor desk and announced \n     in our ears, ``We are calling Florida for Gore--Florida for \n     Gore.''\n       (``I was surprised by the early call for Florida,'' Hannon \n     said, weeks later. ``But it's like a laboratory situation. \n     You look at the numbers, the models, the percentages. There \n     was no reason to assume there was a problem.'')\n       And for the next two hours, our coverage focused on one \n     question: Could George W. Bush win the White House without \n     Florida?\n\n  So they kept right on talking about how Florida was not decided. They \nsaid it was decided, and then told everybody for the next 2 hours, \ncould Bush win the Presidency without Florida, or Gore, for that \nmatter.\n\n       What we did not do was assume that Gore had the race won. \n     What we did do was assume the accuracy of our call, even as \n     the Bush campaign and its partisans were loudly questioning \n     the call--and question it they did--loudly, urgently, almost \n     desperately. In Austin, Bush political strategist Karl Rove \n     was calling correspondents and news executives alike, with \n     one message. Your Florida call is wrong! The polls in the \n     Panhandle are still open! You're gonna have egg all over your \n     faces!\n\n  They dismissed it as partisan rhetoric from partisans, even though \nthey had it in their press releases that the polls were still open. \nStill quoting Greenfield:\n\n       Did anyone at the networks take these complaints seriously? \n     No. After all, what were partisan voices against the cool \n     objective certainty of the numbers and the models and the \n     system that had worked so well for so long.\n\n  Dan Rather, in 1996 on my election, called my opponent and \ncongratulated him on his victory. Then he called me a couple of hours \nlater wanting to know what went wrong. I said: Nothing went wrong, Dan. \nI won. It went right for me.\n  I couldn't figure out how it worked.\n  I said: In New Hampshire, we count the votes before we declare the \nwinner. Maybe that is what you should do.\n  It is pretty telling the kinds of things we have here. I think we \nknow now that the arrogance is unbelievable. They used their polling \nresults. They dismissed entirely people who were telling them over and \nover again, early in the hour, that the polls were still open, not to \ncall the race, but they still did.\n  I want to answer one or two constitutional questions before I stop \nbecause I am going to be told that it is unconstitutional. It is not. \nMy amendment would be constitutional pursuant to the Supreme Court case \nBurson v. Freeman. There is no violation of the first amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution with these commonsense regulations.\n  My amendment creates a new Federal statute to ban false or misleading \ninformation that confuses a voter. The whole issue, rightfully so, by \nthe Democrats in this election was, Were the voters confused by looking \nat these butterfly ballots? That was the whole issue, the whole test.\n  They were confused. They were misled. Yet not a word uttered about \nthe confusion and absolute flat out misleading information put out by \nthe media, not by political operatives. It wasn't Karl Rove on \ntelevision saying the polls were closed or open either.\n  It was Carl Rove trying to get the media to tell the truth. It was \nKatherine Harris trying to get the media to report the truth 8 days \nbefore the election. That is all.\n  In the Burson case, the Court upheld a Tennessee statute that \nprohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of \ncampaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place.\n  The Tennessee statute was subjected to strict scrutiny and the state \nhad to prove that the regulation serves a compelling state interest and \nis necessary to serve the asserted interest.\n  The compelling state interest in my amendment is preventing the \nsuppression of votes.\n  If a broadcast company willfully broadcasts information that it knows \nis incorrect about polling closing times, the broadcast company would \nbe willfully suppressing an individual's right to vote.\n  My amendment provides for criminal penalties for the willful \nbroadcast of incorrect polling information and is the most effective \nmeans to prevent a broadcast company from knowingly and willfully \nchanging the outcome of an election.\n  Mr. President, I have here a memo from Henry Cohen, a Legislative \nAttorney for the American Law Division at the Library of Congress. Mr. \nCohen gives an excellent legal analysis of my amendment and \nspecifically addresses potential first amendment questions.\n  According to Mr. Cohen, it is not even close.\n  He says ``It appears that a court, following the decision in Burson \nV. Freeman would uphold the statute on the grounds that it served ``a \ncompelling interest in protecting the voters from confusion'' and was \nnecessary to serve that interest.\n  He goes even further, citing the dissent in Burson. In his view, even \nunder the dissent in Burson, this amendment would be constitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this memorandum be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 21, 2002.\n     To: Hon. Bob Smith, Attention: Edward Corrigan\n     From: Henry Cohen, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division\n     Subject: Whether Prohibiting Broadcasting False Information \n         About Federal Elections Would Violate the First Amendment\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your question \n     whether there would be a First Amendment problem with \n     Congress's prohibiting, on the day of a federal election, \n     knowingly broadcasting (1) a false statement concerning the \n     location or times of operation of any polling place, or (2) \n     the results of an exit poll, or a projection of the winner of \n     an election, in a manner that could mislead viewers or \n     listeners to believe that the results of the exit poll or the \n     projection of the winner was the outcome of the election \n     itself. We consider only the concept of such a prohibition \n     and not any specific legislation.\n       In Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992), the Supreme \n     Court upheld a Tennessee statute that prohibited the \n     solicitation of votes and the display or distribution on \n     campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to a \n     polling place. The Court recognized that this statute both \n     restricted political speech, to which the First Amendment \n     ``has its fullest and most urgent application,'' and \n     ``bar[red] speech in quintessential public forums,'' the use \n     of which for assembly and debate ``has, from ancient times, \n     been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and \n     liberties of citizens.'' Id. at 196, 197. Further, the \n     statute restricted speech on the basis of its content, as it \n     restricted political but not commercial solicitation, and \n     therefore was not ``a facially content-neutral time, place, \n     or manner restriction.'' Id. at 197.\n       The Court therefore subjected the Tennessee statute to \n     strict scrutiny, which means that it required the state to \n     show that the regulation serves a compelling state interest \n     and ``is necessary to serve the asserted interest.'' Id. at \n     199. Although applying strict scrutiny usually results in a \n     statute's being struck down, in this case the Court concluded \n     ``that a State has a compelling interest in protecting voters \n     from confusion and undue influence,'' and ``in preserving the \n     integrity of its election process.'' Id. A campaign-free \n     zone, the Court believed, would help ``preserve the secrecy \n     of the ballot'' (id. at 207-208) and prevent ``voter \n     intimidation and election fraud'' (id. at 206). The next \n     question, then, was whether a 100-foot restricted zone is \n     necessary to serve this compelling interest. The Court, \n     noting that ``all 50 States limit access to the areas in or \n     around polling places,'' said that, though it would not \n     specify a precise maximum number of feet permitted by the \n     First Amendment, 100 feet ``is on the constitutional side of \n     the line.'' Id. at 206, 211.\n       Turning to your question, a statute that prohibited, on the \n     day of a federal election broadcasting false statements about \n     the location or times of operation of a polling place, or \n     misleading statements about exit polls or election \n     projections, would, like the Tennessee statute in Burson v. \n     Freeman, restrict political speech on the basis of its \n     content, and would therefore apparently be subject to \n     ``strict scrutiny'' if challenged in court. But it appears \n     that a court, following the decision in Burson v. Freeman, \n     would uphold the statute on the ground that it served ``a \n     compelling interest in protecting voters from confusion'' and \n     was necessary to serve that interest.\n       In fact, though Burson v. Freeman was a 4-3 decision, it \n     appears that the constitutionality of the proposal under \n     consideration might be not as close a case. This is because \n     the conduct that was restricted in Burson v. Freeman--\n     solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of \n     campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to a \n     polling place--did not, like the proposal under \n     consideration, involve false or misleading information, \n     which, by its very nature can cause confusion. Rather, Burson \n     v. Freeman involved conduct that merely had the potential to \n     cause confusion.\n       The dissenting opinion in Burson v. Freeman believed the \n     Tennessee statute to be unconstitutional in part because it \n     ``does not merely regulate conduct that might inhibit voting; \n     it bars the simple `display of campaign posters, signs, or \n     other campaign materials.' Sec. 2-7-111(b). Bumper stickers \n     on parked cars and lapel buttons on pedestrians are taboo. \n     The notion that such sweeping restrictions on speech are \n     necessary to maintain the freedom to vote and the integrity \n     of the ballot box borders on the absurd.'' Id. at 218-219. It \n     does not appear that a comparable complaint of overbreadth \n     could be raised with regard to the concept of prohibiting, on \n     the day of a federal election, broadcasting false statements \n     about the location or times of operation of a poling place, \n     or misleading statements about exit polls or election \n     projections. If a statute banned only false or misleading \n     information that can confuse voters, then it would not be \n     overbroad.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This is the first amendment on the right \nof the major media networks to knowingly broadcast false information \nleading to thousands of voters believing their vote doesn't count. In \nthis case, it happened to be a Republican situation. It could be the \nother way around tomorrow. I would say the same thing if it were the \nreverse. It is not about party or about anything other than misleading \ninformation put out in a time zone where the election was still open. \nThe secretary of State made a point of that, having no idea how \nimportant that statement was going to be.\n  Clearly, it should not be allowed under the first amendment. Supreme \nCourt precedents agree with that. I have cited that in my statement. \nThis amendment bans the willful broadcast of false or misleading \ninformation that suppresses potentially millions--in this case \nthousands--of people to believe that they don't have to vote, that \ntheir vote isn't important, they won't vote because they have been told \nthe election is over.\n  I ask the Senate to give serious consideration to this amendment. I \ndon't know what time we will vote tomorrow. That is up to the leaders. \nI ask you to look at the tape, because with me speaking about it, you \ncan say he is putting the inflection wrong. Watch the tape and the body \nlanguage and the way these broadcasters said this. It is very, very \nintimidating. They are basically saying, hey, go home, stop and get a \nbeer, have a hot dog, stop at McDonald's, go home, don't worry about \nvoting because the election is over, the polls are closed. That is what \nthey are saying. I hope that you will watch the tape before the vote \ntomorrow. I can't show it on the floor, unfortunately. I will have it \nin the cloakrooms. I will bring down a copy tomorrow. I ask you to look \nat it before you vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, let me thank our friend and colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for showing patience, first of all, and for staying \naround this evening. I appreciate that immensely. It will help us move \nthe final product along tomorrow because he has taken time this evening \nto discuss it. I, for one, have not seen the tape. I will look for it. \nI haven't been in my office for so many days because I have been \nworking on election reform.\n  Let me suggest that what the Senator has raised in this particular \nfact situation is not the first time. I recall, going back to 1980, \nthere were concerns when there were exit polls that came out to the \nmedia reported before Western States had actually voted. There were \ncolleagues of the U.S. Senate who allegedly lost reelections because \nthe word was that the Presidential race was over. Even before Pacific \ncoast time when literally thousands of people standing in lines walked \nout of line and didn't vote because they were going to vote for the \nPresidential race and decided not to show up.\n  As a result of that, according to many--I am not suggesting this is \nabsolutely the case--many students of previous elections claimed that \nthe decision to announce that exit polls had closed caused other races \nfrom local legislative races, gubernatorial races and Senate races, to \nbe adversely affected. There are other suggestions dealing with the \nexit polls, making announcements about how States are likely to vote \nbased on exit polls in the afternoon.\n  A number of issues were raised about how the media can more properly \nconduct themselves during the election process. The Senator from New \nHampshire, I think, rightly points out the reason that you have these \ncompetitive juices in these control rooms. The media are watching what \ntheir competitors are saying and nobody wants to be left behind. I \nsuspect in some cases they took what otherwise would have been reliable \nmodels and jumped ahead and found themselves saying, as in Jeff \nGreenfield's properly entitled book, ``Oh, Waiter, One Order of Crow.''\n\n  We are not going to vote tonight. I suggest this to my colleague \nbecause he brought up a very valuable point. I understand he has \nattempted to address the constitutional issue. This is a very important \nissue he raised. Thanks to Senator McConnell, we are going to have a \npermanent election commission established in this country. My hope \nwould be--because I have heard at least from the major media outlets \nthat they understand they went over the top on these issues the Senator \nhas raised. We might talk about a way, in the very early consideration \nfor the Election\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\nAdministration Commission, to work out some agreements. There will also \nbe potential challenges in courts.\n  The point he is driving home is we need to come up with an response. \nI think my colleague felt the answer, however arrived at, would be that \nwe never again see what happened in Florida, where you have time \nzones--and he has been going through it, where person after person \nafter person announcing the vote where polls were closed. I don't have \nany doubt that had some effect on the outcome of those areas. We might \nexplore ways in which to avoid the obvious litigation that may ensue \nabout whether or not we can require media outlets to do certain things \nor make it a violation of law to do it. I just raise that as a thought. \nI would like to be supportive of something that this Commission could \ncome back to us, with the media, and say here are the things we are \nconcerned about and these are the things that will never happen again \nbecause we have made certain changes.\n  I thank the Senator for staying around this evening to offer the \namendment.\n  If I can, we have a couple amendments we are going to agree to, so we \nwill temporarily lay the Senator's amendment aside. I encourage my \nstaff to meet with Senator Smith's staff to see if we might work on \nlanguage that will give this issue he raised a prominent position in \nthe bill. We will seek a way to accept it in a bipartisan fashion and \nsee if we can achieve an important issue that needs to be addressed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay aside \nthe Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2938 and 2939 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have two amendments that we have cleared \non both sides which I am going to offer. One is by Senator Sarbanes and \nthe other is an amendment by Senator Sessions. I think both may have \nother cosponsors. If they do, their names can be added later. I will \nbriefly describe to the chair what these amendments do. Then I will \ncall them up.\n  Senator Sarbane's proposal was included already in the House-passed \nHoyer bill. It establishes a program to encourage college students to \nparticipate in the election process in the country. Among other things, \nthe students work as poll workers and the like. It is one that I think \nour colleagues would consider to be a very worthwhile proposal. It \nwould encourage students enrolled at institutions of higher education, \nincluding community colleges, to assist State and local governments in \nthe administration of elections by serving as nonpartisan poll workers \nor assistants, and to encourage State and local governments to use the \nservices of the students participating in the program. In carrying out \nthe program, the commission shall develop materials, sponsor seminars \nand workshops, engage in advertising targeted at students, make grants. \nThe idea is to get as many young people involved in the election \nprocess as possible. It is a worthwhile amendment.\n  Senator Sessions offers a similar approach--one that enjoys terrific \nsupport. I know one of the major newspapers in my State every year \nstrongly advocates mock elections. Others, I know, around the country \nhave called for them. We have actually authorized this program under \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The problem has been that \nwhile we have authorized the funds, we have never appropriated any \nmoney for it. So the program has been sitting over at the Department of \nEducation and never getting the backing at the local level to support \nthis effort. Senator Sessions moves that program from the Department of \nEducation to the new permanent commission we will be establishing with \nhis bill. It becomes an obligation of the commission to see to it that \nwe get these mock elections that Senator Sessions has called for. The \nNational Student/Parent Mock Election is the proper title of the \namendment. It would include simulated national elections at least 5 \ndays before the actual election that permit participation by students \nand parents from each of the 50 States in the United States, its \nterritories, the District of Columbia, and United States schools \noverseas, and consist of school forums and local cable call-in shows on \nthe national issues to be voted upon in an ``issues forum''; speeches \nand debates before students and parents by local candidates.\n  This is a very laudable and it is regrettable we haven't done more \nwith this. We need to do everything we can early on in education to \ninvolve young people in this process.\n  Despite the efforts of those who preceded us in this institution, who \nfought very hard to adopt the constitutional amendment that gave the \nright to vote to 18-year-olds, we all know that the weakest group of \nparticipants in the election process are younger voters. There are a \nlot of reasons for that. There has been a lot of discussion.\n  I am not suggesting these two amendments are going to be the complete \nanswer, but I think they go a long way, to the extent we are willing to \ncommit resources to do everything we can to engage people in the \nexcitement of debate.\n  I am told after the debacle, if you will, of last year, of the 2000 \nelection and the news accounts, the one positive that came out of all \nthat was a heightened degree of interest of young people in the \nelection process. Many became interested because of the nightly news \nstories.\n  I commend Senator Sarbanes and Senator Sessions, cosponsors of these \ntwo amendments. I think they are worthwhile and add considerably to \nthis product. I thank Senator McConnell and others for agreeing to \naccept both of these proposals.\n  Mr. President, I send both amendments to the desk. I ask unanimous \nconsent they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Sarbanes, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2938.\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Sessions, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2939.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2938\n\n   (Purpose: To establish the ``Help America Vote College Program'')\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both amendments \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2938 and 2939) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we did a lot of work today. I know we are \nnot done. I am hopeful by tomorrow we will complete this bill. We are \nworking on a couple of amendments which I did not think could be worked \nout. It may be that we actually work out a couple of amendments that \nlooked as if they clearly were headed for votes. We may have compromise \nlanguage to accommodate Senators. Some Senators have withdrawn their \namendments. Others have changed their amendments to studies, which the \nSenator from Kentucky and I are more than happy to bring into the fold \nand take a look at on the very important issues that have been raised.\n  I think we are very close to final passage. I do not want to \noverstate the case. I know the leaders want to get to the energy bill. \nLast week there was an understanding we would get to the Schumer-Wyden \nproposal and give Senator Bond plenty of opportunity to contest that \namendment and to consider maybe some compromise. I say that again to \ntry and encourage them to resolve this issue.\n  After the completion of the vote tomorrow, my hope is we can move to \nthese remaining few amendments, go to third reading, and get to \nconference. We are not through, obviously. We have to get to conference \nwith the House and work with the White House, obviously, to try to iron \nout any differences before we can bring back a conference report on \nelection reform. Our work is hardly over, even with passage of this \nbill. That will be a major step forward. I thank all for their \nparticipation today.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2865\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in recent months, we in this country \nhave been reminded of the sacrifices that are made every day for our \nNation by the men and women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. We owe a \ndebt of gratitude to the brave individuals that are prepared to lay \ndown their lives in defense of our liberty and the rights which we \nenjoy as citizens of the United States of America. One of the most \nfundamental rights we enjoy in a democratic society is the right to \nvote. No American should be unfairly denied this right, least of all \nthe very men and women charged with defending our way of life. However, \nthis is precisely what happened November 2000 in Florida. I am sure \nthat many senators were as appalled as I was when I learned that \nmilitary ballots received in Florida during the last election were \ntargeted for rejection. Whether the votes of our servicemen and women \nwere not counted because they failed to meet a state postmark \nrequirement or because they arrived too late, it is essential that we \ndo everything in our power to ensure that future ballots cast by \nmilitary personnel overseas are delivered in time and in such a fashion \nthat they will not be rejected.\n  Items mailed from one of our overseas military installations or one \nof our ships at sea is the responsibility of the Department of Defense \nuntil it can be delivered to the U.S. Postal Service. While all the \nblame for uncounted military ballots cannot be laid at the feet of the \nDepartment of Defense, it is only logical that we should fix any kinks \nin the military mail system so that State and local election officials \nhave no reason to reject ballots cast by members of the armed forces \nstationed overseas. My amendment takes some common sense steps to \nimprove the delivery of election mail under the responsibility of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  To start, my amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to implement \nmeasures to ensure that absentee ballots collected at U.S. military \nfacilities or vessels overseas are postmarked. The lack of a postmark \nor proof of mailing date was one of the excuses used in the Florida \nelection to reject overseas absentee ballots cast by military \npersonnel. Second, my amendment requires the Secretary of each military \nservice to notify servicemembers stationed at an installation of the \nlast date before a general election that absentee ballots should be \nmailed in order for them to arrive in time to state and local election \nofficials back home. A soldier or sailor overseas can't know how long \nit will take from the time he or she drops a ballot in the mail until \nit arrives in their home State and guessing wrong could result in a \nlate arrival and votes not being counted. Finally, my amendment \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress about the \nmeasures he will take to ensure the timely transmittal and postmarking \nof voting materials and identify the persons who will be responsible \nfor implementing these measures. Any shortcomings in the handling of \nmilitary mail are not because of poor intentions, but rather lack of \naccountability for failures in the system. The requirement of a report \nto Congress ensures accountability for the implementation of the \nmeasures Congress has spelled out for the proper handling of voting \nmaterial.\n  I don't pretend that this amendment is the only solution to the \nproblems that have surfaced with military overseas voting or that \nstates shouldn't be asked to do more to ensure that military absentee \nballots are treated fairly. But, shouldn't we do everything we can to \nmake sure that the votes or our men and women in uniform arrive in the \nhands of election officials so they can be counted? My amendment seeks \nto do just that so that our forces overseas are able to enjoy the very \nrights they protect for those of us back home.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the \nelection reform legislation we are considering today. The election of \n2000 lay bare many problems in our election system and highlighted some \nof the barriers to voting which have kept too many from the polls over \nthe years. If we are to eliminate these barriers and conduct federal \nelections which truly ensure equal access to the polls and protect \nvoters' rights, as already required by law, we need to have consistent \nstandards for voting systems and the administration of elections. And, \nif we are sincere about instituting reforms then it is not enough for \nus to set standards. We must also provide the funding to help implement \nthese standards. Fortunately, the bipartisan substitute amendment to S. \n565 authorizes $3.5 billion over the next five years for grants to \nstates and localities to do just that.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  While the Justice Department will have a prominent role in the \nimplementation of this election reform legislation, the bill before us \nalso creates a new federal agency, the Election Administration \nCommission. This Commission will administer voting system standards, \nprovisional voting requirements, the establishment of computerized, \nstatewide voter registration systems, and grant programs and it would \nassume the functions of the Office of Election Administration of the \nFederal Election Commission. The new Commission will conduct studies on \nelection technology and administration and submit a report to Congress \nand the President with recommendations for administrative and \nlegislative action.\n  I am especially pleased we are directing the Commission to study and \nmake recommendations for us to consider future reforms because I \nbelieve that there are other reforms worth considering and \nimplementing. One such reform I have advocated for many years now is to \nchange our election day, and I was pleased to join with my colleagues \nin offering an amendment which addresses this issue.\n  Senators Hollings, Reid, and I offered an amendment which was adopted \nlate yesterday which directs the Election Administration Commission to \nstudy the viability of changing the day for congressional and \npresidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to a holiday \nor the weekend, with the possibility of looking at Veterans Day or the \nfirst weekend in November. Last year, and earlier back in 1997, during \nthe 105th Congress, I introduced legislation that would move federal \nelections to the weekend.\n  The legislation already directs the new Commission to study the \nfeasibility and advisability of conducting elections for federal office \non different days, at different places, and during different hours, \nincluding the advisability of establishing a uniform closing time and \nestablishing election day as a federal holiday. Our amendment requires \nthat they complete such a study within 6 months after the establishment \nof the Election Administration Commission.\n  Last year, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, \npresented its recommendations to the President on how to improve the \nadministration of elections in our country. One of the Commission's \nrecommendations was that we move Election Day to a national holiday, in \nparticular Veterans Day. As might have been expected, this proposal was \nnot well received by veterans groups who rightly consider this a \ndiminishment of their service and the day that historically has been \ndesignated to honor that service. While I agree with the Commission's \ngoal of moving election day to a non-working day, and I am interested \nin exploring the possibility of moving election to an existing Federal \nholiday such as Veterans Day, I believe we can achieve all the benefits \nof holiday voting without offending our veterans by moving our \nelections to the weekend.\n\n  My weekend voting proposal, which I hope the Commission will consider \nin its study, would call for the polls to be open the same hours across \nthe continental United States, addressing the challenge of keeping \nresults on one side of the country, or even a State, from influencing \nvoting in places where polls are still open. Moving elections to the \nweekend will expand the pool of buildings available for polling \nstations and people available to work at the polls, addressing the \ncritical shortage of poll workers. Weekend voting also has the \npotential to increase voter turnout by giving all voters ample \nopportunity to get to the polls without creating a national holiday.\n  Weekend voting would have polls open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time on Saturday and Sunday. Polls in other time zones would also \nopen and close at this time. Election officials could close polls \nduring the overnight hours if they determine it would be inefficient to \nkeep them open. Because the polls are open on Saturday and Sunday, they \nalso would not interfere with religious observances.\n  Amidst all the discussion about election reform, there is growing \nsupport for uniform polling hours. The free-wheeling atmosphere \nsurrounding election night in November 2000, with the networks calling \nthe outcome of elections in States when polling places were still open \nin many places, and in some cases even in the very States being called, \ncannot be repeated. While it is difficult to determine the impact this \ninformation has on voter turnout, there is no question that it \ncontributes to the popular sentiment that voting doesn't matter. At the \nend of the day, as we assess how to make our elections better, we are \nnot only seeking to make voting more equitable, we are also looking for \nways to engage Americans in our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I come from the business world where you had a perfect \ngauge of what the public thought of you and your products. If you \nturned a profit, you knew the public liked your product; if you didn't, \nyou knew you needed to make changes. If customers weren't showing up \nwhen your store was open, you knew you had to change your store hours.\n  In essence, it's time for the American democracy to change its store \nhours. Since the mid-19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land-\nowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. Sixty percent of all \nhouseholds have two working adults. Since most polls in the United \nStates are open only 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have \nonly one or two hours to vote. As we saw in this last election, even \nwith our relatively low voter turnout, long lines in many polling \nplaces kept some waiting even longer than 1 or 2 hours. If voters have \nchildren, and are dropping them off at day care, or if they have a long \nwork commute, there is just not enough time in a workday to vote.\n\n  We can do better by offering more flexible voting hours for all \nAmericans, especially working families.\n  Since I introduced my weekend voting legislation in 1997, a number of \nStates have been experimenting with novel ways to increase voter \nturnout and satisfaction. Oregon conducted the first Presidential \nelections completely by mail, resulting in impressive increases in \nvoter turnout. Texas has implemented an early voting plan which also \nresulted in increased turnout. And California has relaxed restrictions \non absentee voting, and even had weekend voting in some localities. \nAlthough there are security concerns that need to be ironed out, \nInternet voting has tremendous potential to transform the way we vote. \nIn Arizona's Democratic primary 46 percent of all votes came via the \nInternet. The Defense Department coordinated a pilot program with \nseveral U.S. counties and the Federal Voting Assistance Program to have \noverseas voters, primarily military voters, cast their votes via the \nInternet. It is becoming increasingly clear that these new models can \nincrease voter turnout, and voters are much more pleased with the \nadditional convenience and ease with voting.\n  For decades we have seen a gradual decline in voter turnout. In 1952, \nabout 63 percent of eligible voters came out to vote; that number \ndropped to 49 percent in the 1996 election. We saw a minor increase in \nthe 2000 Presidential election with voter turnout at 51 percent of \neligible voters, however, not a significant increase given the \ncloseness of the election. Non-Presidential year voter turnout is even \nmore abysmal.\n  Analysts point to a variety of reasons for this dropoff. Certainly, \ncommon sense suggests that the general decline in voter confidence in \ngovernment institutions is one logical reason. However, I would like to \npoint out, one survey of voters and nonvoters suggested that both \ngroups are equally disgruntled with government.\n  Thus, we must explore ways to make our electoral process more user \nfriendly. We must adjust our institutions to the needs of the American \npublic of the 21st century. Our democracy has always had the amazing \ncapacity to adapt to the challenges thrown before it, and we must \ncontinue to do so if our country is to grow and thrive.\n  Of 44 democracies surveyed, 29 of them allow their citizens to vote \non holidays or the weekends. And in nearly every one of these nations, \nvoter turnout surpasses our country's poor performance. We can do \nbetter. That is\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nwhy I believe we should consider weekend voting.\n  Mr. President, I recognize a change of this magnitude may take some \ntime. But the many questions raised by our last election have given us \na unique opportunity to reassess all aspects of voting in America. We \nfinally have the momentum to accomplish real reform. How much lower \nshould our citizens' confidence plummet before we adapt and create a \nmore ``consumer-friendly'' polling system? How much more should voting \nturnout decline before we realize we need a change?\n  Weekend voting will not solve all of this democracy's problems, but \nit is a commonsense approach for adapting this grand democratic \nexperiment of the 18th century to the American family's lifestyle of \nthe 21st century.\n  I am pleased that the Senate saw fit to adopt our amendment and I am \nlooking forward to hearing the views of the new Election Administration \nCommission on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1196-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Although we have the pressure of other bills--\ncampaign reform and so on--I hope we move, as was promised, to energy \nlater on this week so that we can move forward.\n  We need this policy out there. The President has put forth a policy. \nThe House has passed a policy. We need to deal with the situation with \nregard to oil and gas, and of course the opportunity to increase our \nproduction domestically so we are not as reliant as we have become on \nforeign imports. We need to look, obviously, to a balanced bill and \ndifferent energy sources such as renewables. We need to do more \nresearch in terms of coal, and clean coal, and using those resources \nwhich we have in abundance.\n  We haven't yet really, it seems to me, defined where we want to go, \nparticularly with the electric component of energy, but I have to tell \nyou that I think it is very important. People are certainly touched as \nmuch by electric energy as any other source. The issue to a large \nextent is transmission and transportation.\n  As we develop more and more opportunities to generate electricity, it \nhas to be moved where the market is. Of course, selfishly, in my State, \nan energy-producing State, the problem is being able to move that \nenergy to where the markets are.\n  I hope we will try to get together to act. I am afraid we are going \nto get all wrapped up in Enron, and so on, which has very little to do, \nfrankly, with the energy aspect of it. But we can take a long look at \nthat and take action that will help us more efficiently use those \nenergies that are available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1196-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1196-S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HADASSAH INTERNATIONAL'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are all, by now, too familiar with \nreports of cowardly terrorist attacks in the streets of Jerusalem. With \neach of these terrible attacks, we also hear amazing stories of \nheroism.\n  I recently read a powerful account of the health care professionals \nwho cared for the victims of the bombings on Ben Yehudah Street last \nDecember. It was written by Barbara Sofer, and it featured the work of \nthe doctors and nurses of the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem who saved \nthe lives of dozens of young people under the most trying \ncircumstances.\n  Two things were clear from the account. First, the contributions of \nHadassah members make an undeniable difference in improving lives \naround the world. Second, in our international war against terrorism, \nthe compassion and dedication personified in Hadassah will defeat \nterrorists whose only interest is destruction.\n  Today Hadassah celebrates 90 years of excellence in health care and \nsocial justice. Hadassah started as a movement to bring health care to \na poor people in a troubled land. It has become much, much more. \nHadassah has energized women for nine decades. It helped build modern \nIsrael. It has created world-renowned medical and education \ninstitutions in Israel, which provide trained medical experts not only \nfor Israel, but for countries the world over. In fact, Hadassah-trained \nhealth professionals have responded to health care crises in Rwanda and \nBosnia.\n  We have felt the impact of its excellent work right here in America, \nas well, on issues of concern to women and to the American Jewish \ncommunity. Hadassah has over 300,000 members in 1500 chapters across \nour Nation, and its work has benefitted Americans of all backgrounds.\n  We are reminded day in and day out that there are forces who want to \ndestroy Israel, weaken America and destabilize the world. But Israel is \nmore secure, America stronger, and the world more stable because of the \nwork of Hadassah. It is only fitting, therefore, that we celebrate \nHadassah International's 90 years of excellence.\n  I extend my congratulations to Bonnie Lipton, National President of \nHadassah, and the women who serve on the Hadassah Foundation's Board of \nDirectors. To each of them, and to each of the 300,000 members in this \ncountry, I say, thank you.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this month, Hadassah, the Women's \nZionist Organization of America, will celebrate its 90th Anniversary. \nHadassah is a unique organization, which has distinguished itself in \nmany arenas over nearly a century. With priorities that range from \nwomen's advocacy to developmental health care, Hadassah has \nconsistently made significant contributions around the globe.\n  I take great pride in the Baltimorean, Henrietta Szold, who founded \nHadassah in 1912. Henrietta Szold was a remarkable woman, a person not \nonly of high principles, great intelligence and inexhaustible energy, \nbut someone with the rare and precious ability to translate principles \ninto reality. It was she who set out for Jerusalem in 1918 with staff \nand supplies for a 50-bed hospital. Today that hospital is known as the \nHadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem; it cares annually for more \nthan 600,000 patients, sets standards for excellence in health care, \nteaching and research both in Israel and around the world, and opens \nits doors to everyone in need.\n  Henrietta Szold's greatest contribution may not have been her own \ndevotion to her community, but the framework she instituted for \nHadassah members under which they could carry on the principles that \ninspired her--service, generosity of spirit, human kindness, and \ncommitment. Hadassah members have acted on these principles, over the \npast nine decades turning Hadassah into the largest women's group and \nlargest Jewish membership organization in the United States, with \nnearly 1,650 chapters and a membership of over 300,000.\n  In Baltimore alone, Hadassah has contributed to health education and \ncommunity outreach through a number of award-winning programs. These \ninclude Check it Out, a program to increase breast cancer awareness and \nprevention; Act Against Osteoporosis, a campaign to teach prevention \nand promote the early detection of osteoporosis; Prostate Cancer \nAwareness Program, a program to educate men about early detection and \nawareness of prostate cancer; and the 5K Race for Research, an annual \nrace for breast and prostate cancer research. Hadassah has also \ncontributed greatly to education and advocacy in Baltimore through \nprograms like Reach Out and Read, a program in which volunteers read \naloud to children in the pediatric offices at Sinai Hospital, Read, \nWrite, Now! an elementary school tutoring program, and Lunch and Learn, \na weekly women's study group. Baltimore Hadassah also offers a number \nof programs for Jewish youth, including Al Galgalim (Training Wheels), \nWheeling On and Young Judaea, exceptional programs designed to foster \nan interest and devotion to Zionism and Jewish heritage.\n  The welcome evidence of Hadassah's efforts is everywhere around us. \nThe work of Hadassah has contributed very\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nsignificantly to the vibrancy and vitality of Jewish life in America \nand Israel and has strengthened the bonds between our two countries. It \nhas done this by expanding educational opportunities, funding advanced \nresearch and health care facilities, establishing youth programs and \nactivities and defending democratic freedoms and social justice around \nthe world.\n  It would be impossible to pay adequate tribute to all of Hadassah's \nachievements contributions over the years. But as Hadassah enters its \ntenth decade, I want to commend this organization for its broad and \nabiding commitments. In areas from humanitarian relief, education and \nwomen's health, to their partnership with Israel, Hadassah is always \nready to lend a hand, open a door, or inspire a young mind. I look \nforward to celebrating many more years of Hadassah's impressive \nachievements.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Hadassah, \nthe Women's Zionist Organization of America, who, in addition to having \nthe privilege of sharing its name with my beautiful wife, have worked \ntirelessly over the past 90 years, leaving an indelible mark on Israel \nand the American Jewish community. From a small group of women who \nfirst gathered in February 1912, Hadassah has grown into the largest \nwomen's and largest Jewish membership organization in the United \nStates. Today, comprised of 1500 chapters and more than 300,000 \nmembers, who can be found in every congressional district nationwide, \nHadassah remains committed to the worthy mission of its founders: \npromoting education, health care, and social justice to Israel and \nAmerican Jewish women and their families.\n  Today, I take a few moments to pay tribute to this institution on its \n90th anniversary by sharing with my colleagues a little bit about its \nfounder. Henrietta Szold was born in Baltimore, MD on December 21, \n1860. The eldest of eight children, her father, Rabbi Benjamin Szold, \nraised Henrietta to be a scholar. After graduating high school, she \ntaught French, German, botany, mathematics, and other subjects at the \nMisses Adam's School for Girls in Baltimore. At the same time, she \ntaught bible history classes for adults and youth Sunday school classes \nat her father's synagogue. In 1893, she moved to Philadelphia to become \nthe secretary-editor of the Jewish Publication Society. In 1902, after \nthe death of her father, she moved to New York City with her mother \nwhere, in 1907, she joined the Hadassah Study Circle, a women's Zionist \ngroup.\n  In 1909-1910, Henrietta and her mother visited what was then known as \nPalestine--a trip that would change her life. Over the course of 6 \nmonths, she was moved by what she witnessed, especially the absence of \nbasic medical care. Her mother suggested that Henrietta get her study \ngroup involved in health work in Palestine. Greatly affected by her \nmother's suggestion, Henrietta posed this idea to her group and, in \nFebruary 1912, the Hadassah Chapter of the Daughters of Zion adapted \nthis mission, dedicating themselves to the improvement of health care \nin Palestine and the promotion of Jewish education in the United \nStates. Because they initially met on Purim, the group took the name of \nthe holiday's central figure, Queen Esther, who's Hebrew name is \n``Hadassah.''\n  Today, Hadassah's achievements in advancing health care are evident \nthroughout Israel. Hadassah Medical Organization supports the most \nadvanced medical center in the region, comprised of two hospitals, 90 \noutpatient clinics, and numerous health centers. Each year, the \norganization provides health care to over 600,000 patients a year and \nparticipates in global outreach programs to developing countries.\n  In the United States, Hadassah has taken on a broad range of \ninitiatives on behalf of women and the Jewish community. From the \nWomen's Health department's ``Check It Out'' breast cancer detection \nand awareness campaign to the family programs sponsored by the Jewish \nEducation department Hadassah provides the American Jewish community \nwith countless services and educational opportunities. Furthermore, the \nGovernment Relations Unit provides members and the general public with \neducation and promotes widespread civic participation on public policy \nmatters such as American-Israeli relations, church-state separation, \nand women's health.\n  Additionally, Hadassah funds and maintains four other major programs \nin Israel and the United States: Hadassah Israel Education Services \nwhich gives Israeli citizens vocational and technical training; Youth \nAliya which provides disadvantaged Israeli and immigrant youth with \neducation and housing; Young Judea, which helps American teenagers \nbuild connections to Israel and Jewish life through clubs, camps, and \nprograms in Israel; and the Jewish National Fund which works to \npreserve Israel's ecology and natural resources.\n  Nine decades after a group of 38 women first met in New York City to \nestablish a social action group, Hadassah has grown into a nationwide \norganization providing much needed services and support to Israelis and \nthe American Jewish community. I am pround to wish them congratulations \non their 90th anniversary and extend my appreciation for all their \nimportant work, which can best be summed up in the traditional words, \n``Mazel tov.''\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nfounding of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America. \nNinety years ago on the holiday of Purim, Henrietta Szold founded \nHadassah, a volunteer women's humanitarian organization that is 300,000 \nmembers strong and one I am honored to have worked with on many an \noccasion. Hadassah's President, Bonnie Lipton has been a great leader \nand a friend.\n  The holiday of Purim celebrates the story of Esther, who saved the \nJews from annihilation by the Persian King Ahasuerus. Esther was \nAhasuerus' wife, and when she learned that Ahasuerus' advisor, Haman, \nconvinced him to kill the Jews, at great personal risk she intervened \nto save the Jewish people. In celebration of this event, Esther, whose \nJewish name was Hadassah, instructed the Jewish people to give gifts to \nthe poor. It is appropriate that Henrietta Szold created an \norganization dedicated to Esther, Hadassah, and Purim: ensuring Jewish \ncontinuity and giving the gift of a better life to the poor.\n  Ms. Szold was inspired to create Hadassah when she learned of the \nconditions of impoverished Jews living in the slums of Turkish-ruled \nJerusalem in 1912. By convincing nurses in New York to help in pre-\nstate Israel, Henrietta Szold created a women's institution dedicated \nto public service and community responsibility. Hadassah continues \ntoday to help bring hope to the less-fortunate across the United States \nand abroad.\n  Through educational programs, including vocational training and \nexposure to the arts and athletics, Hadassah helps disadvantaged youth \nrealize their dreams and potential. Hadassah's Youth Aliyah program \noffers teenagers from around the world who are struggling with \ndepression solace, support and hope. Hadassah members also work with \nlocal elementary schools to help ensure that children are given every \nopportunity and helping hand to learn to read.\n  Hadassah offers a positive experience for its members and those who \nthey help. They volunteer their time to assist in soup kitchens, \nnursing homes, day care centers, libraries, hospitals, clinics, \ndomestic violence shelters, schools, and synagogues. Its members \nrecognize the importance of mentoring and provide many opportunities \nfor young women to learn about the importance of commitment, charity, \nleadership, community, and individualism, qualities of character that \nour children need to learn.\n  Beyond its charitable mission, Hadassah has been a key advocate of \nwomen's health issues and led efforts to warn Congress of the dangers \nof genetic testing. Best known for its medical facility in Jerusalem, \nHadassah offers the most advanced medical care in the Middle East, to \nJews and Arabs alike, and has helped build hospitals in the poorest of \ncountries. Hadassah has been a leader in medical research, especially \nin women's health.\n  For years Hadassah was prevented from gaining special consultative \nstatus with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC. I \nam happy to say that Hadassah was finally admitted in May 2001. This \n``status'' should have been a simple thing. ECOSOC oversees the World \nHealth Organization, UNICEF, UNESCO, the\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nCommission on the Status of Women, and the Human Rights Commission. It \nseemed logical that Hadassah would gain this status, routinely given to \nmany organizations, given its leadership for 90 years in medicine, \neducation, welfare, and women's rights abroad. Hadassah, however, had \nto fight a long battle with the anti-Semitism present in the United \nNations in order to gain this status.\n  I salute Hadassah for its 90 years of charity and leadership as a \nhumanitarian organization both in America and Israel and look forward \nto continue to working closely with its membership.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Hadassah, the Women's Zionist \nOrganization of America, a wonderful organization that exemplifies a \nspirit of volunteerism and commitment to others is celebrating their \n90th anniversary. With more than 300,000 members nationwide, Hadassah \nis one of the largest women's and the largest Jewish membership \norganization in America.\n  Hadassah was founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold as a group of women \n``interested in the promotion of Jewish institutions and enterprises in \nPalestine.'' What began as an attempt to provide health and social \nservices to both Jews and Arabs in Palestine has grown into myriad \nundertakings.\n  Today, Hadassah's major activities in Israel and in the United States \nspan the arenas of health, education, social services, and \nenvironmental preservation. For instance, the Hadassah Medical \nOrganization supplies quality medical care to individuals in the Middle \nEast, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. The Youth Aliya \nProgram provides housing and support for disadvantaged and immigrant \nyouth in Israel.\n  Additionally, the Jewish National Fund helps to build parks and \npreserve Israel's natural resources, while Young Judea helps U.S. \nteenagers build connections to Israel and Jewish life. In all of its \nendeavors, Hadassah has fulfilled its mission to promote a peaceful and \nprosperous Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, pursue social justice, and \nprovide for the health, education, and well-being of individuals both \nin Israel and in America.\n  Over its 90 years of existence, Hadassah has touched the lives of \nmillions of individuals in a tangible manner. In a time when the Middle \nEast remains embroiled in controversy and violence, it is comforting to \nfind a group whose commitment has not changed over time. Even today, \nHadassah provides lessons that we can all learn from. I am proud my \nhome state of California boasts more than 25,000 members, people \ndevoted to improving the world around them. As a lifetime member, I \nwould like to thank Hadassah for its efforts, and look forward to \ncelebrating future milestones with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1198-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF MARIE E.

Mr. President, since 1998, Americans have celebrated \n``Read Across America'' in March to honor Dr. Seuss' birthday. Millions \nof Americans take part in this nationwide effort to promote reading \namong our children while paying tribute to Dr. Seuss' great legacy.\n  It is hard to imagine our childhoods without the delightful books of \nDr. Seuss. Such classics as ``The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and \nHam'' taught us life lessons we will never forget. My personal favorite \nis ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!'' because it encourages children to \nreach for their dreams. I loved reading the book to my children, and \nnow read it to my grandson. I also enjoy reading it to students while \nvisiting schools in California.\n  Schools throughout the Nation hold special events to celebrate ``Read \nAcross America.'' This year, schools plan to have breakfasts of green \neggs and ham, reading relays, birthday parties for Dr. Seuss, choral \nreadings and museum exhibits. Celebrities and elected officials will \njoin in the fun by reading books to children.\n  ``Read Across America'' is a day to celebrate the joy of reading and \na return to our childhood, but it also provides an opportunity to \naddress a very important issue: children's literacy in the United \nStates. It has been proven that if children read more at home, they \nwill do better at school. ``Read Across America'' can help prepare our \nchildren for success.\n  I take great pride in celebrating the fifth anniversary of the \nNational Education Association's ``Read Across America.'' Books \nintroduce children to a wealth of knowledge and a world of imagination. \nLast year, celebrations took place in every State in the Nation, \ninvolving more than 35 million people. This year, NEA expects an even \nbigger turnout.\n  I extend my best wishes to participating schools, and encourage all \nAmericans to get involved in this wonderful celebration of reading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1198-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 28, \n1993 in Watsonville, CA.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the greatest \nsource of strength of our military forces engaged in the war on \nterrorism--the support they receive from the American people. Over \nThanksgiving, Senator Warner and I traveled to Central Asia to visit \nwith our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines serving in Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Nothing lifted our spirits more than sharing \nThanksgiving with these wonderful troops. Nothing lifted their spirits \nmore than our message that the American people totally support their \nmission and are deeply grateful for their service.\n  We have seen that support on display in countless ways in recent \nmonths. Americans from every corner of our country have reached into \ntheir hearts and reached out to our men and women in uniform, \nespecially over the holidays. One particular story came to my attention \nthat I think captures the American spirit at this time in history.\n  Just before Thanksgiving, Kasi Brannan of Covington, LA, decided to \nsend a simple holiday card to her son, AT3 Eric Lepkowski, who was \nserving on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Arabian \nSea. When\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\nfamily, friends, and members of the community learned of her effort, \nthey wanted to add their wishes as well. When a television station and \nnewspaper from New Orleans reported the story, people from all over \nLouisiana wanted to add their appreciation. And when other families and \nfriends of sailors abroad the Theodore Roosevelt heard the news through \nthe Internet and e-mail, they wanted to include wishes to their own \nhusbands, wives, sons, brothers, sisters and friends. As the news \nspread across the Nation, even total strangers wrote in to express \ntheir thanks to our servicemen and women.\n  What started out as a simple holiday message to one sailor had \nquickly grown to a greeting card from all America--a 75-foot banner \nwith more than 1,000 stars, each containing the holiday wishes from \ngrateful Americans from nearly every state and at least three \ncontinents. Among them were several families from my home state of \nMichigan. Those wishes made all the difference to the 5,000 men and \nwomen of the Theodore Roosevelt, who displayed the banner in one of \ntheir hanger bays as a reminder of home and a daily inspiration.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in celebrating the spirit of \nAmerica's unity embodied in Kasi Brannan and all our military families \nwho endure separation from their loved ones and who sacrifice in ways \nthat most Americans will never know.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in acknowledging the \ncommitment of our senior military leaders to the morale and welfare of \nour forces, as evidenced in the efforts of Vice Chief of Naval \nOperations Admiral William Fallon and U.S. Fifth Fleet Commander Vice \nAdmiral Charles Moore Jr. to quickly transport the 1,000-star banner to \nthe Theodore Roosevelt in time for the holidays.\n  Finally, I know my Senate colleagues will also join me in honoring \nthe service of AT3 Eric Lepkowski and all the brave, dedicated and \nskilled men and women serving in the armed forces to keep this Nation \nfree.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMichigan in thanking Kasi Brannen for her strong patriotism and undying \nsupport for our men and women deployed to the theater of conflict.\n  Kasi Brannen's son, AT3 Eric Lepkowski, serves aboard the aircraft \ncarrier USS Roosevelt in the Arabian Sea. When she began assembling a \nChristmas card for him, she asked friends and family in her hometown of \nCovington, Louisiana, to contribute well wishes and greetings. Soon, \nword got out in Convington that she was going to send a card to the \nRoosevelt and messages poured in from all over town. Then word spread \nthrough the entire Northshore, and then to New Orleans, and to Baton \nRouge, and then all over the country. Kasi's Christmas greetings to \nEric became the opportunity for the entire country to send its thanks \nand their holiday blessings to all the men and women serving overseas \nto protect America. These messages came not just from Navy families, \nbut from scores of Americans who wanted to express their support for \nour troops. A simple Christmas card turned into a 75 foot banner with \nover 1,000 messages on it.\n  Getting this banner to the men and women of the Roosevelt was no \nsmall feat. December had rolled around and people, known and unknown to \nKasi, still desired to add their message to the banner. Kasi was \nwondering if she could get the package to the Roosevelt in time for \nChristmas. When the Navy found out about Ms. Brannan's project, the \nVice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral William J. Fallon, and the \nCommander of the Fifth Fleet, Vice Admiral Charles W. More, offered to \ntransport the banner personally.\n  The 5,000 men and women serving aboard the Roosevelt received the \nbanner in time for Christmas and delighted in reading the messages from \nhome. We can only imagine the effect that these messages had on the \nsailors of the Roosevelt. When our sailors go on deployment, they live \nin cramped quarters and go without the usual creature comforts. This, \ncombined with the isolation and loneliness of combat can take its toll \nand easily diminish morale. When one of our sailors receives a letter \nfrom home, it reconnects them with their families and friends and \nreminds them just what they are fighting for.\n  When our nation goes to war, it is fought on many fronts in many \ndifferent ways. First and foremost, it is fought by the Soldiers, \nSailors, Airmen, and Marines who are constantly in harm's way. But \nthese men and women are fully supported by their families and friends \nat home. I think the spouses and children of all of our fighting men \nand women know their duty in keeping up morale, and they will follow \nthrough.\n  I am extremely proud of all fighting men and women from Louisiana. \nOur State is home to thousands of service-members, and they are part of \nthe overall force which protects this great nation. I am also extremely \nproud of our citizens who support these men and women in uniform. The \nefforts of Kasi Brannen are truly superb and are deserving of great \nrecognition.\n  I want to join my good friend from Michigan in praising Kasi Brannen \nand the hundreds of other Americans who contributed to her project. I \nalso want to commend the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral \nWilliam J. Fallon, and the Commander of the Fifth Fleet, Vice Admiral \nCharles W. More for their extraordinary efforts in keeping up the \nmorale of our fighting men and women. I know that my colleagues in the \nSenate join me in commending the husbands, wives and family back home, \nour service men and women deployed abroad, and the commanders who lead \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMFIRMATION OF RICHARD J. LEON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR DC\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Richard \n``Dick'' J. Leon, the new U.S. District Judge for the District of \nColumbia. I have known Dick for many years, and I was pleased that the \nSenate unanimously confirmed him on February 14, 2002.\n  Dick has all the key qualities necessary to be a fine a District \nJudge. He is bright, thoughtful, and ethical. He is a personable \nindividual, who cares deeply about the law. I first worked with Dick in \n1987, when I was serving on the Senate/House Select Iran-contra \nCommittee. He had been a distinguished Federal prosecutor for the \nJustice Department, when our ranking Republican on the committee, Dick \nCheney, hired him to serve as our deputy counsel. His performance on \nour staff was outstanding and his legal skills as an investigator, \ncounselor, and examiner of witnesses were critical to the work of the \nselect committee.\n  Dick Leon has distinguished himself as a counselor, handling complex \ncriminal and civil litigation. But, his commitment to legal education \nis also noteworthy. Over his 28 year career, Dick has served in various \npositions helping teach others about law. He was a full-time law \nprofessor for 4 years at St. John's University Law School in New York, \nand he currently serves as an adjunct law professor at both the \nGeorgetown University and Catholic University law schools in \nWashington, DC.\n  From time to time, Dick has been called to assist Congress with \nhighly sensitive matters. Whether it has been counseling a bipartisan \ntask force or serving on a congressional commission, he always has \nconducted himself with the utmost integrity. Dick Leon has earned the \nrespect of both Republican and Democratic Members alike.\n  I have every confidence that Dick is fully prepared for the \nchallenges of being a U.S. District Court Judge. I congratulate him on \nhis new assignment and wish him; his wife, Christina; and their son, \nNicholas, all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1199-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1199-S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF BRAVO COMPANY, FIRST BATTALION, TWENTY-THIRD MARINES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, for more than two centuries, the U.S. \nMarine Corps has exemplified the highest virtues of loyalty, service, \nand sacrifice. From the walls of Tunn Tavern during the Revolution to \nthe far reaches of the Pacific, from the jungles of Vietnam to the vast \nexpanse of the Arabian desert, and from the walls of Camp Rhino and the \nsand of the Kandahar Airport to Guantanamo Bay, America's Marines have \nshown the world the meaning of ``Semper Fi.''\n  Through the long march of our history, few military organizations \nhave been held in such high esteem as the\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\nU.S. Marine Corps. Our Marine Corps is composed of men and women of \ngreat character. They are smart, tough, dedicated, and faithful, truly \nthe best America has to offer. For 226 years, they have stood for all \nthat is great about this Nation: honor, courage, and commitment. Their \nvalues, sense of courage, and quiet, steadfast character remain \ntimeless and valuable commodities for a time in which our Nation faces \nthe greatest challenge of a generation. I have seen our Marines in \naction, and I am confident that no obstacle can block their determined \npath to victory.\n  Through their great history, Marines have protected America's \ninterests, struggled against our country's foes, and remained at the \nforefront of our nation's efforts to maintain global peace and \nstability. In hundreds of distant lands, from Nicaragua to Lebanon, \nfrom Saudi Arabia to Somalia, and from Afghanistan to Cuba, Marines \nrestored and maintained order, aided people in distress, provided \nprotection for the weak, and upheld the values that have come to define \nour country on the world stage. Many made the ultimate sacrifice in the \nservice of their country, and we honor their memory.\n  I am proud to represent the State of Louisiana, a land which is \nsteeped in Corps history. When the British attacked American forces on \nthe fields of Chalmette outside of New Orleans, a contingent of Marines \ncontributed to an ultimate American victory. This engagement came to be \nknown as the Battle of New Orleans, and served as a powerful statement \nof American boldness on the battlefield.\n  It gives me great pride to have the city of New Orleans host the \nheadquarters of the Fourth Marine Division which commands more than \n104,000 Reserve Marines nationwide. I am truly grateful for the \nservices that our reserves perform every month. A Marine Corps \nreservist serves his country an average of 36 days a year. These men \nand women are of a truly superior caliber, as they dedicate over a \nmonth of the year to national service while working hard in the private \nsector, getting an education, and raising their families.\n  I would like to extend my personal commendation to the Marines of \nBravo Company, First Battalion, Twenty-third Marines as they conclude \ntheir deployment to Guantanamo Bay. I want to assure you that the \nmembers of the U.S. Senate and the Senate Committee on Armed Services \nare personally grateful for your service. Our Nation's freedom was won \nthrough the toil and sweat of thousands of volunteers who dropped their \nplows and left their families during the revolution. After they had \nproved themselves in the realm of battle, they went back to their \nfields and their families and created our civic institutions. You \nMarines are the rightful heirs to their tradition, and I trust that our \nNation can rely on you to defend our freedom.\n  As we set out in this new century, the importance of our Marine Corps \nhas never been more clear. Tomorrow, as today and for generations past, \nthe razor sharp readiness of the United States Marine Corps serves as a \nbeacon to America's friends and a warning to our enemies, promising \nswift action, great victories and richer traditions yet to come.\n  On this day, I offer my warmest gratitude to Bravo Company, First \nBattalion, Twenty-third Marines and all who wear the eagle, globe and \nanchor, and to the families who also serve by supporting them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1200-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF DR. LEE TODD\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to one of Kentucky's \nfinest citizens, Dr. Lee Todd. On Friday, February 15, Dr. Lee Todd was \nofficially inaugurated as the University of Kentucky's 11th President.\n  In 1968, Lee Todd completed the first stage of his relationship with \nthe University of Kentucky when he received his Bachelor of Science \ndegree in electrical engineering. After completing his undergraduate \nstudies at UK, Dr. Todd earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical \nengineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During his \ntime as a graduate student, he amazingly received six U.S. patents for \nhis innovative work in the area of high-resolution display technology.\n  Dr. Todd's professional career officially began in 1974 when he \nembarked on the second stage of his UK relationship by becoming a \nprofessor of electrical engineering. During his nine- year tenure as a \nprofessor, Dr. Todd published various research articles spanning \nnumerous topics, gave multiple conference presentations, and won \nseveral teaching accolades including the prestigious UK Alumni \nAssociation Great Teacher Award. He also served on the University \nSenate for seven years; served on the President's Advisory Committee \nthat established the first Selective Admissions policy; and chaired the \nCollege of Engineering Dean Search Committee. In 1981, he temporarily \nleft UK and founded Projectron, Inc., a manufacturing company \nspecializing in the production of cathode ray tubes for the flight \nsimulation industry. The Projectron picture they developed was \nsuccessfully used in nearly 90 percent of commercial flight simulators \nas well as numerous military simulators.\n  Besides his work with Projectron, Inc., Dr. Todd has been \nsignificantly involved with various programs attempting to educate the \nKentucky citizenry on the areas of economic development and \ntechnological advancement. He cofounded a not-for-profit organization \ncalled the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation, which aims to \nincrease university research capacity and develop science and \ntechnology education programs encouraging an entrepreneurial economy in \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky. He has been appointed to statewide \ncommittees related to education and economic development by various \nGovernors, even serving as the chair for Governor Collins' Governor's \nCouncil on Science and Technology. He also is a proud member of UK's \nEngineering Hall of Distinction. Dr. Todd recognizes the rapid pace at \nwhich the country and the rest of the world is progressing and \nunderstands that Kentucky cannot afford to be left behind clinging to \nthe ways of the past.\n  Throughout his entire life, Dr. Lee Todd has tirelessly and \nselflessly worked toward the betterment of Kentucky. He possesses the \ndesired knowledge, vision, and strength to help further advance the \nUniversity of Kentucky's standing in the academic as well as the \nathletic community. He has experienced what the University has to offer \nfrom the standpoint of a student, teacher, and now president. He is \nmore than prepared to meet head on the various challenges involved in \nsuccessfully managing UK.\n  I applaud Dr. Todd's lifelong commitment to the education of \nKentucky's future political, economic, and social leaders. Finally, I \nthank him for accepting the challenge of leading the University of \nKentucky into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1200-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1200-S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF OSCAR MICHEAUX\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, on April 23, 1941, the United \nStates was at peace, although Europe and Asia were not. Citizen Kane \nwas to open and be hailed as the best American film ever. A new \nbaseball season was just underway and would see Joe Dimaggio hit safely \nin 56 straight games. On that day, Bertha Glotzback reported to work at \nthe Department of Labor.\n  Here it is almost 61 years later and Ms. Glotzbach, a native of \nTopeka, KS, is ending her career in Government service. For most of her \ntime in Government Ms. Glotzbach has worked as a secretary for the U.S. \nAgency for International Development and its predecessor agencies. Ms. \nGlotzbach was there almost at the creation--joining the Economic \nCooperation Agency less then a year after it was establish to implement \nthe Marshall Plan. Through the years she has worked diligently and \ntirelessly in a number of different offices within USAID, most often in \nthe Office of the General Counsel.\n  Ms. Glotzbach is a special person--a person whose dedication and \ndevotion to her work has demonstrated the best of what we should expect \nfrom public servants. Over the course of her valuable service to her \ncountry she has earned the respect and affection of all who have worked \nwith her. She has made their lives easier by the way she has carried \nout her responsibilities.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to reflect on \nthe work of California Speaker Robert M. Hertzberg, who has left the \npost of Speaker after presiding over the Assembly for 2 extraordinary \nyears.\n  Most of all, Bob Hertzberg will be remembered as a leader at a time \nof crisis, first with the State's energy crisis, and then the aftermath \nof the September 11 attacks.\n  When California came face-to-face with its energy crisis, Bob worked \nto identify the problems and craft legislation to solve them. Bob's \nleader ship and unwavering commitment helped California to avoid \nblackouts and control utility costs.\n  On September 11, we experienced events that changed our Nation \nforever. Bob Hertzberg swiftly established a State Task Force on the \nImpact of Terrorism on California to assess what California needed to \ndo to protect itself from future terrorist attacks. The task force \nheard testimony from law enforcement officials, business leaders, \neconomists and health officials, and drafted thorough reports for the \nState Legislature.\n  Bob Hertzberg is a leader to create a better future for our children. \nIn 1998, he helped pass, with the help of former Speaker Antonio \nVillaraigosa, what was the largest school construction bond in \nAmerica's history. The $9.2 billion bond included record funding for \nschools, colleges and universities. This funding helped construct more \nthan 500 schools and modernize more than 2,000 existing schools \nthroughout the State. On December 14, 2000, Bob introduced the \nKindergarten, University, Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2002, \nan even larger bond that would allocate $12 billion for the \nconstruction and modernization of elementary schools, colleges and \nuniversities. Similar to the previous measure, it would help schools \nmeet the needs of a rapidly growing student population.\n  Bob Hertzberg is a great representative of the San Fernando Valley \nand a leader for all of California. He has been a strong leader when we \nneeded it the most. I thank Bob for his great contributions to our \nState over the years, and wish him well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1201-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNINETIETH ANNIVERSARY OF HADASSAH, THE WOMEN'S ZIONIST ORGANIZATION OF \n                                AMERICA\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge the 90th anniversary of Hadassah, the \nWomen's Zionist Organization of America.\n  With over 300,000 members and 1,500 chapters across the country, \nHadassah is the largest Jewish women's membership organization in the \nUnited States. Hadassah's mission is to promote a prosperous and \npeaceful Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, pursue social justice, and \nprovide for the health, education, and well-being of American Jewish \nwomen and their families.\n  I would also add that Hadassah plays a central role in reinforcing \nthe close and intimate bonds of friendship, solidarity, and shared \nvalues between the United States and Israel.\n  Hadassah was founded in 1912 by educator and visionary Henrietta \nSzold, who had long been committed to the ideal of a Jewish homeland \nand the Jewish imperative for social justice. After her first visit to \nPalestine, Szold transformed her small women's study circle into a \ndynamic social action committee dedicated to meet the challenges of \npoverty, filth, and disease in Palestine. In 1913, two American nurses \nset up community health and maternity care stations in Jerusalem. These \nhealth centers became the foundation of Israel's medical \ninfrastructure.\n  Today in Israel, Hadassah supports the most advanced medical center \nin the region, comprised of two hospitals, 90 outpatient clinics, and \nnumerous community health centers. Hadassah Medical Organization, HMO, \nits flagship project, provides state-of-the-art health care to 600,000 \npatients a year regardless of race, religion, or creed, and often \ntreats the most critically wounded in the region's ongoing conflicts.\n  Through the Congressionally-funded American Schools and Hospital \nAbroad, ASHA, program, HMO stands ready to serve American military \ntroops should such a need ever arise. HMO sites have been visited by \nnumerous heads of state, American Congressional delegations and \nadministration officials, state and local leaders, and other public \nopinion makers.\n  In addition to Hadassah Medical Organization, Hadassah funds and \nmaintains four other major programs in Israel and the United States:\n  Hadassah Israel Education Services, which provides cutting-edge \ntechnical training, retraining, and vocational guidance for all Israeli \ncitizens;\n  Youth Aliya founded to bring children of the Holocaust to Palestine, \nnow provides housing, education, and support to disadvantaged Israeli \nand immigrant youth;\n  Young Judaea, which includes clubs, camps, and programs for American \nteenagers to build connections to Israel and Jewish life; and\n  The Jewish National Fund, which supports the building of parks, \nplants and trees, and other initiatives to preserve Israel's ecology \nand natural resources.\n  As part of its global humanitarian commitment, Hadassah provides \nmedical personnel and training and relief services during international \nhealth crises, including those in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda.\n  Throughout the United States, Hadassah members are engaged in a wide \nrange of educational, advocacy, and community service initiatives. \nHadassah's education services include women's health seminars and \nHebrew language classes. Hadassah members also help to shape public \nopinion and policy through advocacy work on issues ranging from United \nStates-Israel relations to first amendment protections to women's \nrights and health concerns. In communities across the United States, \nHadassah members have also launched many projects aimed at improving \nthe lives of women and their families. Hadassah's members are \nrepresented in every Congressional district in the United States.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to acknowledge the \ncontributions that Hadassah has made to the promotion of humanity, \ncompassion, and community, in Israel, the United States, and \nworldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1201-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1201-S1202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the nine \nelementary schools throughout Maryland that were selected as Blue \nRibbon School Award winners in 2001. These schools\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nare among only 264 elementary schools nationwide to be honored with \nthis award, the most prestigious national school recognition for public \nand private schools.\n  According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbons Schools have \nbeen judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, State, and \nnational goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence \nthat are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of \nthe next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have \nstrong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared \nby all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, \nup-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe \nenvironment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to family \ninvolvement; evidence that the school helps students achieve high \nstandards; and a commitment to share the best practices with other \nschools.\n  After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the \nDepartment of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nand the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School \nnominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel \nof outstanding educators from around the country then reviewed the \nnominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations \nto the Secretary of Education.\n  The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of \nthe successful practices that enable the students of these schools to \nsucceed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment \nto visit the Blue Ribbons Schools in my State and have always been \ndelighted to see first hand the interaction between parents, teachers, \nand the community, which strongly contribute to the success of the \nschool. As I complete my visits to each of these schools, I look \nforward to personally congratulating the students, teachers and staff \nfor this exceptional accomplishment.\n  The nine winning Maryland elementary schools include:\n  Benfield Elementary School. Located in Anne Arundel County, Benfield \nElementary was ranked 7th in Maryland on the Maryland School \nPerformance Assessment Program, MSPAP, in 1996 and noted as one of the \nfastest improving schools in Maryland. The Baltimore Sun recently \nrecognized Benfield's reading program as one of the most effective in \nthe State. The Washington Post also recognized its character-building \nprogram, ``No Putdowns,'' as a valuable asset to the school community. \nBenfield was one of two elementary schools selected to send their \nexperiments aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis and also has two award \nwinning after school programs focusing on science and Spanish language.\n  Beth Tfiloh Community School. Beth Tfiloh of Baltimore, MD, has \ndedicated itself to creating a vibrant educational community that \ntouches the minds and hearts of Jewish children. The school's \nadministration and leadership are committed to meeting the needs of \neach individual student through continued innovation, both as an \ninstitution of learning and as a guarantor of Jewish culture. The \nschool has recently received recognition as a Good Neighbor School, \nMaryland Character Education School of the Year, and a Baltimore \nBusiness Journal Innovation in Technology School. Beth Tfiloh graduates \nhave been accepted by the top colleges, universities, and religious \nseminaries in the United States and Israel and have assumed Jewish \nleadership roles on their college campuses and in their communities.\n\n  Bodkin Elementary School. Bodkin Elementary, located in Anne Arundel \nCounty, has had some of the highest test scores in Maryland over the \npast 2 years. The school has been awarded the Chesapeake Cup for \noutstanding participation with the Anne Arundel County Public Library \nand many of its staff members have earned State and county awards for \ntheir teaching skills. Bodkin's theme, ``A Recipe For Success,'' \naccurately reflects that the special ingredients of a supportive school \ncommunity, enthusiastic teachers and eager learners work to make it an \neducational star.\n  Charlestown Elementary School. Charlestown Elementary strives to live \nup to its motto, ``Success for all students, whatever it takes.'' As a \ntitle I school, it successfully provides numerous programs for students \nof its rural community in Cecil County, including after-school \nenrichment programs, student support programs, and parent/student \nvolunteers. Scores on the MSPAP have increased for the last 5 years. \nThe committed staff, hard working students, and involved community all \ncontribute to Charlestown's success.\n  Darnestown Elementary School. Darnestown Elementary is committed to \nan educational program that recognizes the unique value, needs, and \ntalents of the individual student. Located in Gaithersburg, MD, \nDarnestown is a school with steadily increasing test scores. Over the \npast 4 years, Darnestown's composite MSPAP score has increased from 60 \npercent to 82 percent. The school has received Maryland's Recognition \nSchool monetary award for 2 consecutive years. The staff and community \nare also proud to be the first recipient of the Marriott ``Spirit to \nServe'' award, recognizing Darnestown's involvement in numerous \ncommunity service projects to support the homeless.\n  Fort Foote Elementary School. At Fort Foote Elementary, outstanding \nMSPAP test scores validate the academic achievement of the students, \nparents, and teachers. The children of this Fort Washington, MD, school \nembrace the concept of a Community of Caring through the school's \nnationally recognized character education program. With a 97 percent \nminority population, the school coordinates a kindergarten through \nGrade 6 program with an early childhood special education program and \nHead Start. Combining innovative assessment techniques such as the \nComer School Development Program, team instructional planning, shared \ndecisionmaking, and community partnerships have proven effective for \ntotal school success.\n  Ocean City Elementary School. Ocean City Elementary is located close \nto the resort town, for which it was named, in Ocean City, MD. the \nteachers and community strongly believe it is their responsibility to \nexpand the number of life choices a child has upon graduation from high \nschool. Ocean City has an excellent reputation of having high \nbehavioral standards as well as reaching academic achievements that \nhave been recognized statewide. The vision behind the school is to make \nall students academically successful, as well as productive members of \nsociety. The dedication of the students, teachers, and parents of Ocean \nCity Elementary truly represents their school motto: I can be anything, \nI can learn anything if I believe in myself and work hard.\n  Saint Bernadette School.

Saint Bernadette's parents and students \ncontinue to distinguish themselves year after year, demonstrating that \ntheir dedication and commitment is a true formula for success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1202-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1202-S1203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF CAROL CURTISS\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nfellow Texan Carol Curtiss, who has recently made a truly remarkable \nand unprecedented achievement. She is a Merchant Mariner who is the \nfirst woman ever to earn both a Chief Engineer's license and an \nunlimited Master's license. The U.S. Coast Guard has determined that \nshe is one of only three merchant mariners in the country to achieve \nboth these distinctions. Those who complete and accomplish the rigorous \ntraining and sea time required for gaining such status, are forever \nknown as Master Mariners.\n  Carol entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY in \n1976, which was the School's third year accepting women. She was \nattracted to the Merchant Marine Academy because of her love of travel, \na love developed\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\nas a child when her family lived overseas while her father served in \nthe Air Force.\n  Women normally pursued careers on the deck side. However, Carol \nstrove to be in the engine room, and decided to defy convention and \nmaximize her talents in the Academy's arduous dual license program. \nMost participants in the dual program focus on a single department, \ndeck or engine, but Carol earned her degree on a variety of \ntechnologies. She graduated as a Third Engineer and Third Mate in 1980, \nwith honors.\n  Soon after, she became a member of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial \nAssociation and started a long and successful career sailing as both an \nengineer and mate, on a variety of vessel types. Last year, Carol \nearned her Master's license, enabling her to captain a ship of any \nsize. This year, she gained entry to an even more elite group when she \nsuccessfully earned her unlimited Chief Engineer's license.\n  In addition, Carol and her husband are both volunteer firefighters. \nAt sea, Carol is the on-scene commander during all emergency \nsituations. She felt that if she was accountable for training seamen \nhow to fight fires, it would be best to have firsthand experience, not \njust training.\n  Carol has ascended to the pinnacle of her profession after two \ndecades of seafaring, a rare achievement reserved for an exceptional \nperson and first-class marine officer. I congratulate Carol for earning \nsuch a high and honorable status in her career and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1203-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CALVIN JAMES\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, recently our State of Kansas lost \na giant within our political system with the unexpected passing of our \nRepublican National Committeeman, Calvin James of Jewell, KS.\n  All those involved in public service in Kansas, regardless of party, \nmourn his loss. Calvin James was a textbook study in the pursuit of \npolitics for the public good, not personal gain\n  I endeavored to capture what Cal James has meant to his hometown, his \nState, and our nation and to his family and friends with an article and \neulogy published in the Salina Journal last week. I extend the \nthoughts, prayers and best wishes of Calvin's many friends to Betty, \nhis wife, and to his daughter Susan and her family. I ask the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n       With the death last week of Republican National \n     Committeeman Calvin James, Jewell, Kansas lost a giant of \n     politics. He is remembered not only for what is good about \n     Kansas politics, but also for what is great about Kansas \n     communities.\n       For me, Calvin James was a mentor, a friend, my strongest \n     supporter and my sharpest critic. He smoothed the ups and \n     downs of winning and losing. He set a high standard, but he \n     was gentle in reaching for it.\n       At his funeral Saturday, a warm February afternoon, the \n     Methodist Church in Jewell overflowed with friends and family \n     from across the state. Among those attending were a sitting \n     governor and two former governors, two U.S. Senators, a \n     Congressman, the Speaker of the House, the Secretary of \n     State, legislators and political officials--a virtual who's \n     who of the contemporary Kansas GOP.\n       It was the kind of gathering that happens only rarely in \n     rural communities. It signifies the esteem in which Calvin \n     James was held statewide.\n       Calvin was remembered for commitment to family, to his \n     community and to his state. Quietly, behind the scene with \n     his yellow legal pad, Calvin was a key advisor to governors, \n     senators and congressmen. He believed strongly in the two-\n     party political system and in the role political parties play \n     in good government.\n       In an era of impersonal media campaigns, he was a people \n     politician. He scouted candidates and recruited precinct \n     committee men and committee women the old fashioned way--by \n     getting in his car and driving from county seat to county \n     seat and talking to people up and down main street.\n       He worked tirelessly in their campaigns and, once elected, \n     he expected them to remain accountable to grassroots Kansas.\n       Calvin knew that to get the votes, you first had to count \n     the votes. He was good at it. In his own race for National \n     Committeeman he had the final vote counted exactly--the day \n     before it was taken.\n       He believed in consensus, in detail and in organizations \n     well run. As Republican Chairman in the first Congressional \n     District of Western and Central Kansas, Calvin made the \n     rounds by car and by phone every two years to build consensus \n     ahead of party elections, which he expected to operate \n     smoothly.\n       A few years ago in Great Bend, he was challenged by a \n     delegate with different ideas: ``This appears to be a \n     railroad operation,'' the delegate said.\n       ``If it is, I am the conductor,'' Calvin retorted.\n       It is a direct result of Calvin's work over three decades \n     that First District Republicans are more activist, more \n     interested and more involved than their counterparts in other \n     parts of the state.\n       Calvin was born in Jewell and he died there. He left only \n     twice, once as a young man for a job in a larger Kansas \n     community and once to serve in the Army in Korea. On that \n     first job, in a drug store, African Americans were not to be \n     served at the counter. Outraged, Calvin did so anyway--then \n     walked out before he could be fired.\n       Calvin was once asked if he had considered moving to a \n     larger community. ``Why?'' he answered, ``I have everything I \n     need here.''\n       ``Everything'' especially included his wife, Betty, and \n     daughter, Susan.\n       He believed in the worth of Jewell and his family and \n     neighbors and he worked to make the place better. From the \n     school board to the church board, he applied the same energy \n     he applied to politics.\n       The first stop for every new Methodist minister in Jewell \n     was Calvin James, who ``educated'' him as to the proper way \n     to draft, present and implement a church budget in order to \n     build consensus and lower controversy.\n       He brought government officials to Jewell and Beloit to \n     ``educate'' them on the need for low income housing, elderly \n     housing, rural water infrastructure, highways and, lately, \n     broadband internet capability.\n       He built James Clothing, with stores in Jewell and Beloit, \n     selling in recent years to his younger partner and protege. \n     He was a self-described ``rag merchant.''\n       In retail clothing as in retail politics, there are certain \n     individuals you would rather not see walk through the front \n     door.\n       Those are the folks, Calvin often said, who you must \n     ``smother with the milk of human kindness'' in order to make \n     the sale, secure the vote, cement the support.\n       Calvin James is a textbook study in the pursuit of politics \n     for the public good, not personal gain. He did not get rich \n     at it. He did not use his many connections to those in \n     politics to accrue personal power.\n       Rather, he used it for the benefit of his community, his \n     state and his nation.\n       That is a legacy worth renewing as the torch of political \n     leadership passes to a new generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1203-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1203-S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LILLIAN CIUFO\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, I stand today among my \ndistinguished colleagues to congratulate the students, administration, \nand faculty of Daviess County High School for winning a Preparing \nAmerica's Future Award from the U.S. Department of Education.\n  This recent accolade is just one in the line of many bestowed upon \nthe diligent students and devout faculty of Daviess County High School. \nIn 2001, the U.S. Department of Education selected Daviess County High \nSchool as a 1999-2000 National Blue Ribbon School shortly after the \nCommonwealth awarded them with a Kentucky Blue Ribbon award.\n  The prestigious Preparing America's Future prize is presented to six \nhigh schools throughout the entire nation that have taken significant \nstrides in improving their academic standards for all students. Daviess \nCounty High School was among this elite group based specifically upon \ntheir reputation for excellence and a rigorous evaluation of their \nprogress in 12 key school improvement strategies. The review showed \nabove all else that the school is accurately meeting the needs and \nexpectations of today's students. I would like to offer a special \nthanks to Principal Brad Stanley for his inspiring leadership and \nrobust commitment to the education of our nation's and the \nCommonwealth's future. With this competent captain at the helm, Daviess \nCounty High School will surely experience smooth sailing ahead.\n  I hope Daviess County High is as proud of this accomplishment as I \nam. This award highly reflects upon not only the students and faculty \nbut also the overall community and its dedication to its children. I \nthank you all for working towards a better educated Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1204-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM GRAHAM\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \noutstanding public service contributions of Windham County Sheriff \nWilliam Graham, who retired on Friday, February 1, 2002. For 33 years, \nGraham, who is now 70 years old, has run his department efficiently and \nwith fiscal accountability to the taxpayers.\n  Since the attacks in New York City and at the Pentagon last \nSeptember, many Americans have realized how important honest and hard-\nworking law enforcement personnel are to our Nation and our \ncommunities. People from around the U.S. watched the police forces in \nNew York and Virginia exhibit an integrity that all Americans \nappreciated. But I suspect that for the Vermonters of Windham County, \nin southern Vermont, they have always known this lesson: a trustworthy \nand reliable police department is indispensable to a community's \nhealth.\n  In 1969, William began his work as sheriff in a department in which \nhe was the only full-time employee. Since then, the department has \ngrown to 20 full-time and an equal number of part-time employees. In \nVermont, sheriffs' departments are responsible for transporting \nprisoners to and from criminal courts and with the paperwork from civil \ncases. But it hasn't been the duties that have given this sheriff's \ndepartment distinction. Instead, Sheriff Graham's lengthy time in \noffice has given his constituents the reliable and competent public \nservice they deserve.\n  Even before being selected sheriff, William worked as a state police \ntrooper and a parole officer. All-in-all, his work in law enforcement \nhas spanned 48 years. I wish Sheriff Graham all the success in his \nretirement that he enjoyed during his long career. And especially so \nduring hunting season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/26/senate-section/article/S1204-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO KARYN BYE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to make a \ngrant to the Hubbard Museum of the American West in Lincoln County, New \nMexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \nwhich authorizes the expansion of the Hubbard Museum of the American \nWest in Lincoln County, NM. Specifically, this bill would allow the \nSecretary of Interior to make a grant of up to $4.5 million dollars to \ncover the Federal share of the museum's expansion.\n  The Hubbard Museum of the American West has been serving the public \nsince 1993. Opened that year under the name of The Museum of the Horse, \nthe museum welcomed 25,000 visitors in its first full year of \noperations. Current annual attendance is 130,000 visitors at three \nlocations and one special event within Lincoln County.\n  As attendance and programs have grown, the museum no longer has the \nspace or facilities to meet the needs of expanded exhibitions and \nprograms. In addition, the Hubbard museum's recent affiliation with the \nSmithsonian Institute allows the museum to receive artifacts and other \ncollections from the Smithsonian that can be exhibited for the benefit \nof the public. The Hubbard museum cannot fully serve the visitors or \nexpand its exhibitions and programs without additional space.\n  The Hubbard Museum of the American West seeks to dramatically expand \nits facility in order to increase tourism and job development in \nLincoln County, NM. This expansion will allow the museum to fully take \nadvantage of its affiliate status with the Smithsonian, address \nadditional needs for collection storage and collection preservation, \nthrough climate control, and will provide permanent jobs for an \neconomically challenged region. Early estimates indicate that the \nproject will bring 25 short-term construction jobs and 15 full time \nmuseum jobs to Lincoln County. In addition, the expanded tourist \nattraction will allow an estimated 100 additional jobs to be created \nthroughout the community.\n  Lincoln County is consistently ranked in the bottom third for income \nlevels in New Mexico, a State that is ranked at the bottom of most \nincome level charts. The citizens of Lincoln and northern Otero \ncounties include Native American, Hispanic Americans, and Anglo-\nAmerican ethnic groups. It is estimated that one third of the new \nmuseum employees will come from each of these ethnic groups. Of special \nconcern is the hiring of a Native American who will act as a curator \nfor the\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\nextensive Native American artifacts that the museum owns and cares for. \nThe museum also plans to add Hispanic staff members to its visitor \nservices division as Spanish speaking visitors make up an estimated 20 \npercent of the annual visitation. Additionally, the museum plans to \nwork with the New Mexico Department of Labor to identify individuals \nwho can be brought off welfare or less meaningful employment to work \nfor the museum.\n  The Hubbard Museum has a long history of providing free consulting \nand operating help to museums and not-for-profit organizations in \nLincoln County. It is a true asset and I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat will help continue these worthwhile efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HUBBARD MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN WEST, NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, the Secretary of the Interior shall make a \n     grant to the Hubbard Museum of the American West in Lincoln \n     County, New Mexico, to pay the Federal share of the cost of \n     expanding the museum.\n       (b) Federal Share.--The Federal share shall be 75 percent.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $4,500,000 for \n     fiscal year 2003, to remain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE.\n  S. 1965. A bill to meet the mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment needs of incarcerated children and youth; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Mental \nHealth Juvenile Justice Act of 2002. As many of my colleagues know, \nincreasing numbers of children with mental disorders are entering the \njuvenile justice system. Each year, more than one million children come \ninto contact with the justice system, and twenty percent of those who \nare incarcerated have a serious mental illness. Many of these children \nare, in effect, dumped on the justice system because of cuts in mental \nhealth services in the community. These children are overwhelmingly \npoor, a disproportionate number are children of color, and most come \nfrom troubled homes.\n  Contrary to what many believe, most children who are locked up are \nnot violent. Justice Department studies show that only one in twenty \nchildren in the juvenile system has committed a violent offense. Most \nchildren with mental disorders have committed minor, nonviolent \noffenses or status offenses, such as petty theft or skipping school. \nStill others have simply run away from home to escape physical or \nsexual abuse from parents or other adults. Whenever possible, these \nchildren should be diverted from the juvenile justice system and toward \ncommunity-based services, including mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment as needed. Because some children with mental disorders commit \nserious and violent offenses, it is not always possible to divert them \nfrom incarceration. Nevertheless, these children need treatment for \ntheir disorders to aid in their inevitable return to the community.\n  Children with mental illness are largely untreated in the current \nsystem, although this may contribute to the child's delinquency. The \ndifficult and sometimes deplorable conditions that prevail in detention \ncenters and youth prisons exacerbate the problems of these children. \nMental health services both prevent them from committing delinquent \noffenses and from re-offending. If appropriate mental health care is \nnot provided, our country will pay a higher price in repeated \nincarcerations, substance abuse, and even suicides.\n  The Mental Health Juvenile Justice Act of 2002, if enacted into law, \nwill go a long way to help address the needs of these children. This \nmeasure outlines a comprehensive federal strategy for providing \ncritical assistance to children with mental illness in our juvenile \njustice system. It would:\n  Train state judges, probation officers, and others on the \nidentification and need for appropriate treatment of mental disorders \nand substance abuse, and on the use of community-based alternatives to \nplacement in juvenile correctional facilities;\n  Provide block grant funds and competitive grants to the states and \nlocalities to develop mental health diversion programs for children who \ncome into contact with the justice system, by strengthening the \ncollaboration of community agencies serving troubled children, and to \nprovide mental health treatment for incarcerated children with \nemotional disorders;\n  Establish a Federal Council on the Criminalization of Youth with \nMental Disorders to report to Congress on proposed legislation to \nimprove the treatment of mentally ill children who come into contact \nwith the justice system; and\n  Remove the most damaging provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct of 1996, by giving back to the federal courts important tools to \nremedy abusive conditions in state facilities under which juvenile \noffenders and mentally ill prisoners are being held.\n  We can no longer ignore this tragedy. The neglect of youth with \nemotional disturbances in our prisons must end. We as a society have \nthe moral obligation to see that they get the help they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN.\n  S. 1966. A bill to educate health professionals concerning substance \nabuse and addiction; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the problem of substance abuse in our country.\n  Last year the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation called substance abuse \nAmerica's number one health problem. I don't think that overstates it.\n  Most of us know someone, a family member, maybe a neighbor, a \ncolleague, or a friend, who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. In fact, \n14 million people in this country abuse alcohol or are alcoholics. \nNearly 15 million use drugs. And nearly four million are in need of \ntreatment but not receiving it.\n  Drug and alcohol abuse has far reaching consequences. It exacerbates \nsocial ills. It's a public safety problem. It's a public health \nproblem. It's a public expenditure problem. There is an undeniable \ncorrelation between substance abuse and crime. Eighty percent of the \ntwo million men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and \nalcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime. \nIllegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. They \nfuel the spread of AIDS and Hepatitis C. They contribute to child \nabuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. And we all pay the price.\n  It costs this Nation almost $276 billion in law enforcement, criminal \njustice expenses, medical bills, and lost earnings each year. That \nmeans that preventing and treating substance abuse makes sense. It \nmakes good criminal justice sense. It makes public health sense. It \nmakes budgetary sense. Not to mention the fact that it's the right \nthing to do.\n  Yet there remains a reluctance to recognize substance abuse as a \nhealth issue. There's a reluctance to accept addiction as a disease. \nIt's a reluctance that has kept public policy from asserting that \naddicts should be in treatment. Whether addicts are in prison or out, \nit seems to me, treatment is the only legitimate choice.\n  Not only must we authorize it, we must take full advantage of the \ntreatments that have been developed.\n  For too long, access to effective therapies, such as methadone and \nLAAM for heroin addiction, has been strangled by layers of bureaucracy \nand regulation. The result is that only 22 percent of opiate addicts \nare now receiving pharmaco-therapy treatment.\n  Yet, when I introduced a bill during the last Congress with Senators \nHatch, Levin and Moynihan to help improve access by allowing qualified \ndoctors to prescribe certain anti-addiction drugs such as buprenorphine \nright from their offices, just like other medicines, the bill initially \nmet with resistance.\n  But, because the facts about addiction are finally beginning to sink \nin, 69 percent of Americans now support treatment instead of jail as \nthe primary focus for drug abusers, and because we were frustrated \nenough to be\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\npersistent, the bill eventually passed and President Clinton signed it \ninto law.\n  But it's not only about increasing access to treatment. It is also \nabout moving treatment into the medical mainstream. Unless family \ndoctors, nurses, physician assistants and social workers can identify \naddiction when they see it, unless they know how to intervene, we will \nnever make any real progress.\n  That aspect of the challenge came into sharp focus for me when I read \na report a few years ago by The National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA.\n  That report said that fewer than one percent of doctors presented \nwith the classic profile of an alcoholic older woman could diagnose it \nproperly. Eighty-two percent mis-diagnosed it as depression, some \ntreatments for which are dangerous when taken with alcohol. A follow-up \nstudy showed that 94 percent of primary care physicians fail to \ndiagnose substance abuse when presented with the classic symptoms. And \n41 percent of pediatricians fail to diagnose illegal drug use in \nteenage patients.\n  No one recognizes this problem better than the doctors themselves. \nFewer than one in five, only 19 percent, feel confident about \ndiagnosing alcoholism. And only 17 percent feel qualified to identify \nillegal drug use. Having said that, even if they diagnose it, most \ndoctors don't believe that treatment works.\n  Among practitioners, as well as policy makers, we need to get the \nmessage out. It needs to be loud and clear. Addiction is a chronic \nrelapsing disease, and as with other such diseases, while there may not \nbe a cure, medical treatment can help control it.\n  The medical professionals have to be educated to recognize the signs \nof substance abuse and to pursue the effective therapies that are \navailable. That is why I am introducing legislation to create a grant \nprogram to train medical professionals to prevent and recognize \naddiction and refer patients to treatment if they need it. \nRepresentative Patrick Kennedy will introduce companion legislation in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Like treatment, training works.\n  According to a study published in the Brown University Digest of \nAddiction Theory and Application, 91 percent of health professionals \nwho took part in training on addiction at Boston University were using \nthe techniques they learned one to five years later.\n  Every family doctor does not need to be an addiction specialist, but \nthey do need to be able to recognize the signs. And they need to know \nwhat help is available.\n  It's another step, and, in my view, a crucial one, to help bridge the \ndivide between research and practice. It will help chip away at the \nincredible substance abuse-related costs we face each year in human as \nwell as monetary terms.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me to support this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Illegal drugs and alcohol are responsible for thousands \n     of deaths each year, and they fuel the spread of a number of \n     communicable diseases, including AIDS and Hepatitis C, as \n     well as some of the worst social problems in the United \n     States, including child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual \n     assault.\n       (2) There are an estimated 14,800,000 current drug users in \n     America, more than 4,000,000 of whom are addicts. An \n     estimated 14,000,000 Americans abuse alcohol or are \n     alcoholic.\n       (3) There is a significant treatment gap in the United \n     States. Nearly 4,000,000 drug users who are in need of \n     immediate treatment are not receiving it. This includes more \n     than 1,200,000 children ages 12 to 25. These numbers do not \n     take into account the number of alcoholics in need of \n     treatment.\n       (4) There are more than 28,000,000 children of alcoholics \n     in America, almost 11,000,000 of whom are under 18 years of \n     age. Countless other children are affected by substance \n     abusing parents or other caretakers. Health professionals are \n     uniquely positioned to help reduce or prevent alcohol and \n     other drug-related impairment by identifying affected \n     families and youth and by providing early intervention.\n       (5) Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. As with \n     other chronic relapsing diseases (such as diabetes, \n     hypertension and asthma), there is no cure, although a number \n     of treatments can effectively control the disease. According \n     to an article published in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association, treatment for addiction works just as \n     well as treatment for other chronic relapsing diseases.\n       (6) Drug treatment is cost effective, even when compared \n     with residential treatment, the most expensive type of \n     treatment. Residential treatment for cocaine addiction costs \n     between $15,000 and $20,000 a year, a substantial savings \n     compared to incarceration (costing nearly $40,000 a year), or \n     untreated addiction (costing more than $43,000 a year). Also, \n     in 1998, substance abuse and addiction accounted for \n     approximately $10,000,000,000 in Federal, State, and local \n     government spending simply to maintain the child welfare \n     system. The economic costs associated with fetal alcohol \n     syndrome were estimated at $1,900,000,000 for 1992.\n       (7) Many doctors and other health professionals are \n     unprepared to recognize substance abuse in their patients or \n     their families and intervene in an appropriate manner. Only \n     56 percent of residency programs have a required curriculum \n     in preventing or treating substance abuse.\n       (8) Fewer than 1 in 5 doctors (only 19 percent) feel \n     confident about diagnosing alcoholism, and only 17 percent \n     feel qualified to identify illegal drug use.\n       (9) Most doctors who are in a position to make a diagnosis \n     of alcoholism or drug addiction do not believe that treatment \n     works (less than 4 percent for alcoholism and only 2 percent \n     for drugs).\n       (10) According to a survey by the National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University \n     (referred to in this section as ``CASA''), 94 percent of \n     primary care physicians and 40 percent of pediatricians \n     presented with a classic description of an alcoholic or drug \n     addict, respectively, failed to properly recognize the \n     problem.\n       (11) Another CASA report revealed that fewer than 1 percent \n     of doctors presented with the classic profile of an alcoholic \n     older woman could diagnose it properly. Eighty-two percent \n     misdiagnosed it as depression, some treatments for which are \n     dangerous when taken with alcohol.\n       (12) Training can greatly increase the degree to which \n     medical and other health professionals screen patients for \n     substance abuse. It can also increase the manner by which \n     such professionals screen children and youth who may be \n     impacted by the addiction of a parent or other primary \n     caretaker. Boston University Medical School researchers \n     designed and conducted a seminar on detection and brief \n     intervention of substance abuse for doctors, nurses, \n     physician's assistants, social workers and psychologists. \n     Follow-up studies reveal that 91 percent of those who \n     participated in the seminar report that they are still using \n     the techniques up to 5 years later.\n       (13) According to the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol \n     and Drug Information, drug and alcohol abuse account for more \n     than $400,000,000,000 in health care costs each year. Arming \n     health care professionals with the information they need in \n     order to intervene and prevent further substance abuse could \n     lead to a significant cost savings.\n       (14) A study conducted by doctors at the University of \n     Wisconsin found a $947 net savings patient in health care, \n     accident, and criminal justice costs for each individual \n     screened and, if appropriate, for whom intervention was made, \n     with respect to alcohol problems.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n     identify and assist their patients with substance abuse;\n       (2) improve the ability of health care professionals to \n     identify and assist children and youth affected by substance \n     abuse in their families; and\n       (3) help establish an infrastructure to train health care \n     professionals about substance abuse issues.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation and coastwise trade endorsement for the \nvessel The Islander; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct \nthat the vessel The Islander, Official Number SC9279BJ, be accorded \ncoastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, of the U.S. Code.\n  The Islander is a commuter launch vessel that is intended for \ncommercial use. It is 40 feet in length, and 13 feet in breadth, has a \ndraw of 3 and one half feet, and is self-propelled.\n  The vessel was purchased by Robert ``Scott'' Fales of Charleston, \nSouth Carolina, who purchased it with the intention of using it for the \ntransportation of passengers. However, proof of the origin of this \nvessel is unknown, and it did not meet the requirements for coastwise \nlicense endorsement in the United States. Such documentation is \nmandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel for its intended \npurposes. The ship was bought from a boatyard and was built by the \nWyman Company. Although records show that the Wyman Companies were \nbased in New Haven, CT, Mr. Fales has been unable to provide conclusive \nproof that the vessel was U.S. built. He has invested a considerable \namount of money in the vessel, and without a Jones Act waiver for the \nship, he will be forced to sell it.\n  Mr. Fales is seeking this waiver because his plans to use the vessel \nfor the transportation of passengers. This usage will not adversely \naffect the coastwise trade in the U.S. waters. If he is granted this \nwaiver, it is his intention the comply fully with U.S. documentation \nand safety requirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1969. A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional protections to participants and beneficiaries in individual \naccount plans from excessive investment in employer securities and to \npromote the provision of retirement investment advice to workers \nmanaging their retirement income assets, and to amend the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 to prohibit insider trades during any suspension \nof the ability of plan participants or beneficiaries to direct \ninvestment away from equity securities of the plan sponsor; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senator Lott and Senator Gregg which will protect the \nsecurity of American workers retirement plans without chilling their \ngrowth. The Pension Security Act of 2002 is based on President Bush's \nproposal for pension reform made earlier this month. The President's \nproposal enhances protections for the 401(k) investments of 42 million \nAmerican workers by providing individuals with better information about \ntheir accounts and significantly more control over their funds.\n  The success of private pension plans has transformed worker \nretirement in America. Today, because of these\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\nplans, the majority of retirees can experience the comfortable \nretirement that was once available only to few. But as the Enron \nsituation has shown us, there are flaws in the system. When Enron stock \nplummeted 98.8 percent in one year, thousands of workers lost their \nretirement nesteggs.\n  What could have prevented such massive losses? For some workers, \nbetter information about the wisdom of a diversified investment \nstrategy would have prevented such heavy investment in company stock.\n  Our bill will give employees better investment information in two \nways. First, it will require plans to send quarterly benefits statement \nto plan participants. This statement will include easy-to-understand \ninformation about the importance of a well-balanced and diversified \nportfolio and the risk of holding a substantial portion of the \nportfolio in one security. Second, our bill amends complex and outdated \nlaws, although intended to protect workers retirement funds, actually \nprevent them from obtaining affordable financial advice. This \nlegislation will help employers to provide their workers with access to \nprofessional investment advice. This benefit would require full \ndisclosure of any fees or potential conflicts and put strict safeguards \nin place to ensure that workers receive advice solely in their best \ninterests.\n  What else could have prevented the loss of so many Enron employees' \nretirement savings? Many were unable to control what was in their \nportfolio. Even when they wanted to sell off their company stock, they \ncould not. Our bill addresses this problem as well. Under our proposal, \nworkers could no longer be locked into a portfolio half-filled with \ncompany stock until retirement age. Rather, employees would be allowed \nto control 100 percent of their investment once they have participated \nin their plan for three years.\n  Some Enron employees could not diversify their stock when they wanted \nto because of the well-publicized ``black-out'' or ``lockdown'' period. \nThe Department of Labor is investigating several aspects of the \npractice of instituting black-out periods for necessary record-keeping \nadjustments and improvements. However, what has become obvious is that \nthis practice needs legislative guidance. Our bill provides that \nguidance by requiring 30 days prior notice of any black-out period and \ncodifying definitions associated with the practice. We are also \nproposing another measure to give workers more control over their \ninvestments. During these black-out periods, the law will place the \nentire burden of liability on the plan. This means that the plan \nproviders would be personally liable for losses to the place caused by \na breech of fiduciary duty, and this will be a powerful incentive to \nkeep black-out periods as short as possible.\n  One of the most infuriating spectacles of the Enron disaster was the \nEnron executives selling off their own personal shares of company stock \nwhile employees were prevented from doing the same during the black-out \nperiod. This was unconscionable, and our bill will put a stop to it. If \nthis bill is enacted, what is good for the goose will be good for the \ngander. If workers cannot control their retirement investments due to a \nblack-out period, neither can the company's owners, directors or \nofficers purchase, acquire, transfer or sell company stock. That change \nwill be a major incentive for companies to keep the necessary periods \nof time when employees do not control their investments as short as \npossible.\n\n  The proposal we are introducing here today will give workers better \ninformation, more choice in their investment options, and more security \nwith their retirement funds. In order to prevent a knee-jerk reaction \nto the Enron tragedy, which could cause more harm than good, the \nPresident has given us a plan which makes retirement savings more \nsecure while also preserving the ability of individuals to make their \nown choices, based on their own situation, when investing for their \nretirement. This bill not only preserves this right, it enhances it.\n  Finally I would like to thank my colleagues Senator Gregg and Senator \nLott for joining me in introducing this bill. This bill is important, \nand we will work tirelessly to see that America's workers and their \nretirement security are protected. I thank the President for his \nleadership on this issue and I commend Congressmen John Boehner and Sam \nJohnson for introducing this bill in the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1969\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
