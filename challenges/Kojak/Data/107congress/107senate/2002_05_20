Madam President, I will not be taking the full half hour. \nSo the Senator from Nevada, if he wishes to make comments, might want \nto make comments following mine.\n  It was 140 years ago today that the original Homestead Act was signed \ninto law. I want to comment for a moment about that act and about \nlegislation that was introduced in the Congress.\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\n  Here is a copy of the stamp that was issued in 1962--a postage stamp \ncommemorating the original Homestead Act. A sod house from North Dakota \nwas commemorated on that postage stamp.\n  President Lincoln signed the Homestead Act into law. The purpose of \nthat was to encourage people who wanted to seek new opportunity to \npopulate the middle part of our country--the heartland of our country. \nAnd people did go to the heartland of America.\n  My great-grandmother, a Norwegian immigrant who lost her husband to a \nheart attack, along with her six children, got on a train and went to \nHettinger County, ND, and pitched a tent. She raised her family, built \na home, started a farm, and ran a family farm.\n  That courageous Norwegian immigrant widow did what many Americans \ndid. They just made an opportunity out of something that was there for \nthem--the Homestead Act.\n  Then she had a son. That son had a daughter and that daughter had me. \nAnd that is how I came from Hettinger County, ND.\n  A lot of Americans have a similar story in their background about how \nthey are living in this country.\n  But the Homestead Act was successful in moving people out to start \nfarms, ranches, and small communities in this country.\n  One-hundred forty years later, this is what is happening to our \ncountry. You will notice that in the middle of our country--in the \nheartland of America--we are being systematically and relentlessly \ndepopulated once again. As you will see, North Dakota has a substantial \nloss of population in almost all of its rural counties. In North \nDakota, the chart shows what is happening. Ninety-one percent of our \ncounties are suffering from substantial out-migration: Montana, 54 \npercent; South Dakota, 73 percent; and, Nebraska, 66 percent.\n  There is this relentless depopulation of the central part of our \ncountry.\n  Some wring their hands, gnash their teeth, and ask what they can do, \nand say perhaps nothing. I happen to think we can do something.\n  Last March, the Bismarck Tribune ran an Associated Press story \ntalking about the cycle of what is happening in many of these States, \nfrom North Dakota to Texas. Schools are closing. Farmers are giving up. \nYoung people are moving out, leaving behind the elderly in communities \nstruggling to keep their names on the map.\n  The latest census number shows dozens of counties in South Dakota, \nNorth Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, and Illinois have lost people \nin the 1990s. The question is, What, if anything, can we do about that?\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation here in the Congress with my \ncolleague Senator Hagel from Nebraska. Very simply, our legislation is \nsimilar to the Homestead Act of 140 years ago, except we don't have \nland to give away anymore. So we say to people who would move in and \nstay in these local areas that are rural by nature and which have been \nlosing population, here are the reasons for you to stay. There are \nincentives for you to stay.\n  Much of the country aspires to have what they have in many of these \nrural counties and local communities: good places in which to live, \ngreat places to raise a family, good neighborhoods, safe streets, \nstrong schools and other things that people aspire to have. Yet we are \ntrying to recreate that in other areas of the country, even as we are \nlosing it in the heartland.\n  Again, the question is, What can we do about that? Senator Hagel and \nI have introduced a piece of legislation called the New Homestead \nEconomic Opportunity Act.\n  It says to people, if you live and work in these out-migration \ncounties after you graduate from college, we will forgive part of your \ncollege loan.\n  We will provide a tax credit for a home purchased by individuals \nliving in these counties that are suffering from out-migration.\n  We will protect home values by allowing losses in home value to be \ndeducted from your Federal income tax. In many of these small towns, \nwhen you build a home, it is worth less immediately after it is built \nthan the cost of construction.\n  We will establish Individual Homestead Accounts to help build savings \nand increase access to credit if you are living in one of these rural \ncounties.\n  Then there are business incentives as well. Say you create or keep a \nbusiness in one of these rural counties losing population, States can \noffer investment tax credits for newly constructed buildings and \naccelerated depreciation for equipment purchases. There are a whole \nseries of things that represent business incentives, either to stay \nthere and start a business or come there and create a business.\n  The New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act also recognizes in order \nto be successful in starting or keeping business in rural areas, you \nhave to have venture capital. Our legislation would establish a \nnational venture capital fund in order to do that.\n  The National Association of Counties has endorsed the New Homestead \nEconomic Opportunity Act, saying:\n\n       As you are aware, some of America's rural counties are \n     facing critical hurdles . . . many rural counties are \n     experiencing an out-migration of youth to more urbanized \n     areas of the country due to a lack of economic opportunities \n     . . . Your legislation is a good attempt to ameliorate this \n     out-migration from rural America and we fully support your \n     efforts.\n\n  The same is true with many other organizations. I will put up a chart \nshowing just a few of them: The National Telecommunications Cooperative \nAssociation, the North Dakota Association of Builders, the North Dakota \nAssociation of Realtors, bank groups, credit unions, and more.\n  The question for this Congress is, Will we do something about what is \nhappening to rural areas in the heartland of our country?\n  When America's cities were suffering a crisis and inner-city blight, \nAmerica went right to work. It put on its work clothes and said: All \nright, we're going to help America's cities, we're going to do a model \ncities program and an urban renewal program, and we will not allow our \ncities to fail.\n  I supported that. Good for us. The fact is, many of our big cities \nhave turned around completely, and they now have economic life and \nvitality. The question for the Congress and the country is, Will we do \nsomething to restore economic opportunity in the heartland of this \ncountry? I hope we will.\n  So I wanted, on the 140th anniversary today of the original Homestead \nAct, to point out there is a new Homestead Act that has been introduced \nin Congress by Senator Hagel and myself. And we have done that for a \nvery important reason. We hope our colleagues will join us in allowing \nus to move that piece of legislation in this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4550-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4550-S4551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to say a word on another matter, \nif I might, about a speech given by President Bush this morning.\n  President Bush, this morning, gave another speech about Cuba and \nsaid: No, our 40 years of embargo against Cuba really work. We want to \ncontinue this embargo. And we want to get even tougher now.\n\n  The President is going to Florida this evening for a $25,000-per-\nperson fundraiser. I suspect there is a lot of politics and probably \nvery little policy in this speech. But let me say this: I do not think \nit does anything to hurt Fidel Castro to continue an embargo that has \nfailed for 40 years.\n  An embargo that punishes Americans for traveling in Cuba, an embargo \nthat makes it impossible, and now difficult, for our farmers to sell \ninto Cuba, is not an embargo, in my judgment, that represents this \ncountry's best policy interests. It does not make any sense for me to \nembrace policies that don't allow Fidel Castro to ever miss a meal. He \nhas never missed breakfast, lunch, supper, or dinner because of these \nembargoes. It is just poor, sick, and hungry people in Cuba who have \nbeen injured by these policies.\n  This 40-year embargo is at odds with everything else we are doing. We \nsay, let's trade with Communist China. Why? Because China is a \nCommunist country, yes. But trading with them will actually open up \nopportunities and bring democracy to China more quickly. We say, let's \ndo that same thing with Vietnam. Yes, it is a Communist country, but \nengaging with Vietnam will have more impact than not engaging.\n  If that is the case, why is that not the case with Cuba? The answer \nis, of\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\ncourse it is the case. It is just that there is a barrelful of politics \nand a teaspoonful of policy in these pronouncements we have heard this \nmorning.\n  My hope is just as the Senate has expressed itself with 70 percent of \nthe Senate, saying that what we ought to do with Cuba is what we do \nwith China and Vietnam: Open up that market. The quickest way to get \nrid of Fidel Castro, in my judgment, and move to democratic reforms is \nfor Americans to travel in Cuba, for Americans to trade with Cuba, and \nthat replacing the policy of failure for 40 years makes much more sense \nfor this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute \nto my friend and my colleague, Jim Jeffords.\n  Although he made news and history last year--and it will be widely \ndiscussed again this week because, of course, it is the anniversary of \nhis changing political parties--Jim Jeffords really prefers to be \noutside the limelight, though he has been in the limelight this past \nyear. As a result, few people knew much about him before a year ago, \ndespite his many accomplishments in Congress and contributions to our \ncountry during this remarkable career he has had in public service.\n  Jim Jeffords grew up in Vermont where the Jeffords family first \nsettled during the 1700s.\n  After graduating from Yale University, he served in the Navy, on \nactive duty for 4 years, from 1956 to 1959. He later served in the \nNaval Reserve, retiring as a captain in 1990.\n  Senator Jeffords' late father was a distinguished attorney who served \nas chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. No doubt this influenced \nSenator Jeffords' decision to study law.\n  After graduating from Harvard Law School, he returned to Vermont to \npractice. This very quiet, soft-spoken man is a person who has a \ntremendous education: Yale undergraduate degree, Harvard Law School \ndegree.\n  Within a few years after returning to Vermont to practice law, he was \nelected to the Vermont State Senate and then the attorney generalship \nof that State. From 1975 to 1988, he represented the Green Mountain \nState in the House of Representatives. That is where I first met him. I \nhad the opportunity to serve with him in the House of \nRepresentatives. I was impressed then by his knowledge of the issues \nand his dedication to the public well-being.\n\n  He has served in the Senate since 1989 where he has continued to be a \nstrong advocate for dairy farmers and other Vermonters but also someone \nfrom whom people in Nevada have benefited because of his legislative \nrecord. He does not focus only on issues dealing with Vermont, even \nthough these issues come first. He has been a champion of disabled \nAmericans, an outspoken proponent of international environmental \nprotection. He is a person who has dealt heavily in education. While \nserving as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords developed a lot of legislation.\n  One bill I would like to pinpoint is a bill to allow the importation \nof prescription drugs from other countries in an attempt to help make \nmedicine more affordable to Americans. His bill passed overwhelmingly \nin July of 2000 and was ultimately signed into law.\n  He has also proposed a ``DrugGap'' program to help low-income \nMedicare recipients get prescription drug coverage. He has worked to \ndouble funding for the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Senator Jeffords has been a leading supporter of funding for services \nfor the developmentally disabled and assisting disabled workers. He has \nbeen a key cosponsor of hate crimes legislation and antidiscrimination \nlegislation.\n  He is now chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThere his work has been exemplary. He has always been a defender of the \nenvironment. I have been either chairman or ranking member for the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee of Appropriations for a number of years. \nNo matter what we did dealing with renewables, we thought we had done a \nlot; Jim Jeffords wanted more. He always kept us on our toes. We had to \ncome forward with something that would show we were doing more than the \nnormal for renewable energy. He was visionary, as indicated by the \nenergy bill we just passed.\n  He has been a defender of the environment. He has fought against the \nBush administration to roll back protections. Some that come to mind \nare arsenic, allowing toxic levels of arsenic to be in the water, he \nhas fought that. He, of course, has fought, along with Senator Boxer, \nto make sure that children are tested for lead poisoning; that the \nwater is tested that children drink.\n  He has called on President Bush to honor America's commitment to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions to include carbon dioxide in laws \naddressing air quality and aggressively enforce laws against polluters.\n  Clearly, Jim Jeffords has demonstrated to me and, of course, to the \npeople of Nevada that one person can make a difference. If we ever \nthink what can one person do, it is a huge world, a big country, we \ncome from States with thousands and millions of people in them; what \ndifference can one person make. He has certainly shown that one person \ncan make a difference. When he announced almost a year ago, on May 24, \nthat he would no longer be a Republican, he made a difference. For \nmonths after, the impact of Senator Jeffords' switch was defined for \nmany of us by a changed Senate agenda, changed chairmanships, and a \nreturn to divided government, some said.\n  But it wasn't until about 4 months later that we fully appreciated \nthe import of what Senator Jeffords really did. When the attacks of \nSeptember 11 shook our Nation, the service he did for our country \nbecame very clear.\n  Just days after the attacks, Congress, Democrats and Republicans, \ncame together to craft an unprecedented response to the terrorist act \nand threats. Together we approved $40 billion in aid to New York and \nVirginia to recover and to help protect the Nation from future threats. \nRoughly 1 month after that, we enacted sweeping antiterrorism \nlegislation to improve law enforcement to respond to terrorist threats. \nThat was led by Senator Pat Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Both of these measures--these are two of many--were incredibly \nimportant. We passed them swiftly in response to a national emergency. \nBecause of what Senator Jeffords did, these measures were balanced and \nreflected the will of all Americans, not just the will of this \nadministration. There was a check; there was a balance. That is all \nbecause of Jim Jeffords. We afforded the President the power to respond \nto a national crisis, preserved important checks on his authority and \nimportant protections for the civil liberties that make America great.\n  Every Senator has a list of issues they consider important which were \naffected by Jim Jeffords' principled and courageous decision last May. \nFrom protecting national treasures such as the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, ANWR as it is known, to preserving the balance on the Federal \njudiciary, providing a voice for the unemployed, campaign finance \nreform--we could not have done it without him--preserving Social \nSecurity, he has allowed us to have a platform to talk about the fact \nthat we did have a $4.7 trillion surplus 10 years ago. We don't now. We \nare now spending Social Security surpluses. Election reform, Medicare, \neducation, he has allowed us to have a voice on these issues and not \nsimply ram them down the throats of the Senate.\n  For me, his greatest contribution was in preserving the essence of \ndemocracy, debate, consensus, and representation during an \nunprecedented national crisis.\n  Jim Jeffords is my friend. More than my friend, he is someone I will \nalways look to for inspiration, knowing that one person, one of us, and \nanyone\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nwithin the sound of my voice, can make a difference. It was a difficult \ndecision he made. He did it on a matter of principle. People may not \nagree with what he deems as principled, but he did it because it was \nthe right thing to do. That is the story of Jim Jeffords' life, doing \nwhat he thinks is right.\n  This highly educated man is really a common person, a person to whom \nanyone can speak. I am very proud of him and what he did and what he \nhas allowed our country to do.\n  If the Senator from Kansas wishes to speak on our time, he is welcome \nto do that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback pertaining to the submission of S.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a number of problems with the fast-\ntrack legislation. It has only been confirmed as I read the Robert Caro \nbook, ``Master of the Senate,'' which is a biography of Lyndon Johnson. \nThe first 100 pages talk about the role of Senators. One of the very \nstrong points made in the book is that our Founders wanted to make sure \nthere was a check against executive power. This was, of course, the \nreason we have a Constitution and we have a balance of powers. The \ntrade issue, and assuring Congress is part of that process, is \nmentioned over and over again in this biography as one of the issues on \nwhich the Founders focused.\n  The underlying premise of fast track is to write Congress out of the \nequation, to pat us on the head and say: Be good boys and girls; just \ngive the President the right to do whatever he wants, and then you give \nup your right to amend; you can vote up or down. There are some \noccasions where I can see it makes sense if we are talking about a \nspecific treaty and we want to give the President some flexibility, \nthis is really overarching authority to the President.\n  I knew this President when he was the Governor of Texas, supporting a \nminimum wage of $3.35 an hour. I don't want to see that for our people. \nThis is a very serious point.\n  I have also seen this President attack the environment such as I have \nnever seen before. All you have to do is get on the NRDC site, the \nNational Resources Defense Council, and there are 90 times where this \nadministration, under this President, has in the dead of night attacked \nthe environment by weakening clean air, Superfund cleanup, trying to \nstop testing kids for lead poisoning, and on and on and on. Why on \nEarth would we, who care about our own people and their standard of \nliving and our environment and the health and safety of our people, \ngive away the store to this particular administration? I am sorry, I \ndon't get it.\n  I am also very concerned that there will be a cloture vote which \nmeans a lot of the amendments Members are putting forward will not get \na chance for an up-or-down vote. I will talk briefly about two of those \namendments. I will do everything I can to get a vote on these \namendments. If I can't, there will be a lot of noise about it. One has \nto do with truckdrivers, the Boxer-Kerry-Murray amendment which I will \ntalk about first, No. 3421.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3431\n\n  On June 30, trucks that do not meet U.S. safety standards will be \nallowed into the United States to deliver products from foreign \ncountries. That affects your State and it affects my State.\n  The safety issue is a problem in and of itself. We have talked about \nthat quite extensively in our transportation bill. Trucks from Mexico \nsimply do not have the same standards. We are letting those trucks in \nbecause of NAFTA.\n  We also know, in addition to these safety issues and safety problems, \nAmerican truckdrivers will lose their jobs. Why do I say that? Because \nunder the law today, if there are goods being produced in Mexico and \nthey come to the border, the trucks stop there and an American trucking \ncompany, with American drivers, will take the product and deliver it to \nthe rest of the country. There is nothing in this bill as it stands now \nto protect those truckdrivers and any others in future trade \nagreements.\n  Here is the situation. These workers deserve our help. If we are \ntalking about trade adjustment assistance and we have a situation where \nin just a month from now we will have a lot of truckdrivers out of \nwork, it seems cruel that we would not cover that issue in this trade \nadjustment assistance that is part and parcel of this bill.\n\n  Now, originally, as Senator Daschle wrote this trade adjustment \nassistance, we had protections for our truckdrivers. My amendment \nreasserts that language, directing the Department of Labor to establish \na program to provide TAA assistance to truckers who lose their jobs \nbecause we are opening the border to foreign truckers to operate in the \nUnited States of America. This was part of the bill of the Presiding \nOfficer, the original Bingaman TAA bill, as well as the Daschle \nsubstitute amendment. Very sadly, it is no longer included because our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle did not like it. They said: Get \nrid of it or we are not going to go forward with this bill.\n  That is the kind of hard-ball tactics being played on the other side \nof the aisle with the lives of American workers and American \ntruckdrivers. There is no reason on God's green Earth why such workers \nshould not receive trade adjustment assistance. They are losing their \njobs because of past trade agreements and perhaps future trade \nagreements. They should be covered.\n  This is not some theoretical issue; these are real people. I recently \nreceived a letter from Carlos Cervantes, a trucker from California. He \nwrites:\n\n       I am worried if Mexican trucks are allowed to drive through \n     the United States, I will lose my job. Mexican drivers make a \n     lot less money than U.S. drivers do. And if U.S. trucking \n     companies can use those drivers to move their loads then I \n     will be out of work in no time. If that happens, I will have \n     to take two jobs to provide for the income, health, and \n     welfare of my family. It will be extremely helpful if the \n     U.S. truckers were provided some sort of assistance if they \n     lost their jobs.\n\n  That is what our amendment tries to do. It tries to help people such \nas Carlos Cervantes who want to do nothing more than take care of their \nfamilies. Where are our family values? We talk about them every single \nday. We are not doing anything to help truckers in this Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act. That is wrong.\n  Take the case of Guy Adams, a trucker in Kansas. He drives the I-35 \ncorridor which stretches from the United States-Mexican border far into \nthe interior of the United States. He is eligible to retire, but he has \nnot done so because his wife is unable to work because of a heart \ncondition, and the treatment and the prescription drug costs are too \nhigh to handle without the full insurance his job provides.\n  We have the coming together of a lack of a prescription drug benefit, \nforcing a trucker to work past retirement age, and now he may well lose \nhis job because of the competition from Mexican truckdrivers. He will \nnot receive the TAA benefits under this bill. His wife's medical needs \nwill not be met. So, again, this is not theory. This is reality. That \nis why your amendment originally did the right thing. I am heartsick \nthat the folks on the other side said: Do you want to do this bill? \nTake this trade adjustment assistance out for truckers.\n\n  U.S. truckdrivers are some of the hardest working people in the \nworld. They make between $35,000 and $50,000\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\na year--that is their starting salary. Those fortunate enough to be \nrepresented by a union earn the higher end and get good benefits.\n  Compare these figures with the salaries of Mexican drivers, and you \nwill see a major difference. Mexican drivers make about $18,000 a year \nat best. They do not receive any benefits outside of their own Social \nSecurity Program. Here is the really incredible fact: There are no time \nlimits on how long they can drive. The Mexican Government has no hours \nof service regulations, so theoretically a Mexican driver could drive \n20 hours to the border and drive another 10 in the United States.\n  A reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle recently rode with a \nMexican driver on a 1,800-mile run. The 46-year-old driver drove 3 \nstraight 21-hour days, sleeping only 7 hours in all. Another Mexican \ndriver just quoted in the Kansas City Star said:\n\n       U.S. truckers are lazy. In Mexico you can drive 24 hours \n     straight. I do it all the time.\n\n  Mr. President, you know if there are workers who are willing to work \n24 hours straight and work at half the wages that our good people do, \nthey are going to get hired as soon as the June 20 date has passed, and \nwe are going to have our good people out of work. We know it is \ninevitable, and U.S. drivers cannot compete.\n  So Senators Bingaman and Baucus, once again, recognized that when \nthey drafted S. 1209, the original trade adjustment assistance bill \nthat moved out of the Finance Committee. Again, Senator Daschle \nrecognized it when he included this program in a substitute bill. But \nhe was forced to delete it if he wanted to go ahead with this bill.\n  Finally, my amendment will direct the Department of Labor to put in \nplace a system to collect data on adversely affected service workers \nwho work under contract with firms closed or downsized. These workers \ninclude the janitors at a plant that closes, the cafeteria workers \nthere, and those who work at companies, which have contracts with the \nplants, who also lose their jobs. For example, there are plants that \nshut down that, instead of hiring the janitors themselves, contract out \nto another company. So because of that quirk, the service worker loses \na job.\n  We want a study to get to the bottom of this. We want to help these \nworkers. We want to help truckers like Guy and Carlos.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this important assistance was taken out \nof the bill. I am even more disappointed that we may not get a chance \nto vote on this issue if cloture is invoked, and I am going to fight \nagainst invoking cloture on this bill. Why should this not be voted \nupon? Because people are afraid to be seen voting the wrong way, to do \nthe right thing? I do not think that ought to stand. So I am going to \ndo everything I can.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3432\n\n  Mr. President, turning to my other amendment, amendment No. 3432, it \nwould help the U.S. Trade Representative make trade work for women. \nWhat we mean by that is that women's organizations and labor groups \nhave made a convincing case that increased trade and trade rules have \ndifferent implications for women and men, and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative is not taking these effects into account.\n  For example, a little village in Mexico, Felicitas Villalobos, \ncreates intricately woven needle baskets. On the export markets these \nbaskets could fetch from 40 cents to $1.25, but trade rules require \nwomen to produce an official invoice and official identification in \norder to export. Since she lives in a poverty-stricken area of Mexico \nwith little access to government services, she does not have an \nofficial identification and cannot export her goods.\n  This situation is one that an advisory committee on gender and trade \nat the USTR could have foreseen and prevented. They could have produced \nrecommendations to exempt women who are caught in this bind where they \ncannot export their products.\n  In order to help the USTR take the needs of women in account in the \nagreements they negotiate, I am introducing this amendment with \nSenators Mikulski, Durbin, and Harry Reid. Our amendment would create \nan advisory committee on gender and trade at the USTR in order to help \nour negotiators understand and mitigate the negative consequences of \ntrade for women and also help women share in the opportunities that \ntrade creates.\n  Now that I have talked about a woman in Mexico, let me talk about a \nwoman, Joyce Ruthier, who is a garment worker in Maine. She will lose \nher job when the plant closes due to foreign competition, as so many \nothers have over the last decade. She has worked at the plant for 23 \nyears. We know the USTR is not doing a good enough job in looking at \nthe impact of trade on Joyce. It is exceedingly clear that trade \naffects women and men differently, creating opportunities for some and \ncausing others to lose their jobs. The GAO found that, nationally, 66 \npercent of the workers qualifying for NAFTA trade adjustment assistance \nwere women. That kind of job loss concentration has implications for \nhow we design job training and assistance programs and can help us \npredict which communities will suffer job losses as a result of trade.\n  The advisory committee I and my colleagues are proposing would \ninclude representatives from the private sector, nonprofits, academia, \nand the public sector. Their viewpoints, focused on the interests of \nwomen and trade, would add a much needed perspective to trade \nnegotiations.\n  So it is very important that we look at the facts. Of the 134-member \ncountry delegations to the World Trade Organization, only 9 member \ncountries have delegations led by women. Yet women make up 45 percent \nof the world's workforce and make up 70 percent of the world's poor. \nLet's make sure these women have a place at the table on trade.\n  The AFL/CIO, Women's Edge, the Feminist Majority, and other fair \ntrade organizations strongly support this amendment. We want a place at \nthe table for women when it comes to trade.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives we took a look at what was \nhappening with health issues in the Congress. We found that women were \nnot being used in clinical trials. Whenever the NIH or CDC made a \nrecommendation, that was based on studies where only men were included. \nThey pointed out this is so unfair to the women of our country who make \nup a majority of the population. We changed things.\n  On trade, we have a parallel situation. Where the people making \ndecisions are predominantly male, overwhelmingly women in foreign \ncountries and women in this country are disproportionately hurt.\n  My understanding is there is no objection to this amendment on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, but there is objection on the other side. \nI am very distressed, again. We have to admit that in this kind of \ntrade agreement there are winners and losers. One time or another, we \nhave to stand up and say we are going to look at who is losing out and \nwhat we can do to better understand what is happening. Why the other \nside of the aisle cannot accept a simple amendment that sets up a \ncommission to look at this is beyond me. I, frankly, think the result \nof this is going to be a more mean-spirited bill than it has to be.\n  On both of these issues, on both of these amendments, I hope we can \nget some strong support from colleagues. We know truckers are going to \nsuffer. We know women are going to suffer. The least we can do is stand \nup and fight for the people in our country who are going to be \nadversely impacted.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before yielding the floor, will the Senator allow a \nquestion to be asked?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I have been listening to the Senator making her statement. \nOf course, I hope, also, we can figure out a way to get votes on a \nnumber of these amendments.\n  I have been looking for an opportunity to talk to the Senator from \nCalifornia about some of the things she has done. It is not easy to be \nan advocate as the Senator from California has been ever since I have \nknown her. I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate and how \nmuch the people appreciate her advocacy on environmental issues.\n  I know the famous Erin Brockovich was from California. I think the \nSenator from California is the Erin Brockovich of the Senate because \nwith her advocacy we have been able just in\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\nrecent days to put a stop to the prevention of children being tested \nfor lead in their water. The Senator from California was the first to \nhave raised that issue. She is also the one who raised the concern \nabout chromium, and she in fact appeared at an event with Erin \nBrockovich's lawyer, Ed Masry, who allowed her to do what she did. The \nSenator alerted us to that and introduced legislation in that regard \nand, of course, the famous arsenic-in-the-water subject that the Bush \nadministration started. She said they have 90 violations. I have \nnarrowed it down to six or seven about which we haven't talked.\n  But I want the Senator from California to know that being out front \non these issues is sometimes difficult for her because we have a very \npopular President. It is not in vogue to criticize anything he or his \nadministration does. But had it not been for the loud voice of the \nSenator from California, we might not have been able to accomplish the \nthings we did accomplish.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend so much. As my friend knows, the \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, and Senator Reid, the majority whip, \nhave set up the task forces in the Senate to look at different issues. \nWe know that, for example, Senator Lieberman is working on pension \nreform and pension protection. I was given the assignment to look at \nthe environment.\n  I really thank my friend because I think we are finding out that when \nwe shine the light of truth on an issue, the country is better for it. \nSenator Kennedy headed up an education team on a proposal that would \nmake it very difficult for students in this country to pay back their \nloans. This President was about to put that policy in place. Senator \nKennedy roared like a lion on the point. He came here and roared like a \nlion on the point. Guess what. They backed off and the people won.\n  We came down and said, for years we had been testing poor children \nfor lead in their blood. We know that if there is so much lead in their \nblood--as a baby, or as a child--they are going to have mental \ndifficulties. They could even go into a coma and even die; they could \ngo blind; they could have kidney failure. We pointed it out and, by \nGod, a couple of weeks after they backed off.\n  I want to pick up on what my friend said. We are speaking the truth \nas we believe it. That is why we are in the Senate.\n  My friend compliments me. I am so grateful. To me, it is why we are \nhere. It isn't our job to come here and button up our lips and not talk \nbecause we are afraid the administration will attack us.\n  I know my friend is reading a Robert Caro book, ``Master of the \nSenate.'' I mentioned it to the President of the Senate before. The \nfirst 100 pages deal with what Senators do and how we were sent here \nnot just for fun but to make sure there is a check and balance on \nwhatever the executive power is being asserted here. It is not \npolitics. It is our job. It is not partisan. I opposed President \nClinton on a number of issues dealing with what I considered to be \nunfair trade. It is our job.\n\n  So I thank my friend. I hope he takes to the floor time and time \nagain pointing out to the American people what our job is. If we don't \ndo it, if we don't speak the truth as we see it, if we don't challenge \nthe executive, if we believe perhaps they can do more, or if they are \nleading us down the wrong path, then we don't deserve to be here.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. REID. Also, before the Senator leaves the floor, I would like to \nsay that I am a great fan of public radio. I cannot listen to it as \nmuch as I would like. But every morning when I go running, I have my \nlittle radio and I listen to public radio. I don't run as far and as \nfast as I used to. So I probably listen to the radio more. It takes me \nlonger to get from one place to another. But that is one of the good \nthings.\n  This morning, they had a wonderful program about what the Senator \njust talked about. Senate Democrats are making progress. They talked \nabout a poll by a Republican pollster and a Democratic pollster. They \njoined together in this poll. They came up with an interesting fact--\nthat what we are trying with our messages through our task forces and \nother ways to communicate to the American public is really \nreverberating through the American public. By almost 10 percentage \npoints, the American people like what we are doing more than what the \nRepublicans are doing. Tax cuts are not the name of the game. \nPrivatizing Social Security isn't what the American people want. They \nwant to do something about real education. They want to do something \nabout environmental issues. One of the issues is pensions. The \nPresiding Officer is leading that task force. Dealing with medical \ncare, prescription drugs, and making things affordable for people who \ngo to the doctor are what people care about. That is what we have been \ntalking about.\n  We fought those tax cuts. I tell people that if I had to vote again, \nI would vote the same way. I didn't have a single rich person in Nevada \ncome to me and say we should cut their taxes.\n  Today, I had a half-hour interview on public radio, KECP Radio. On \nthat program were some women who are working with the Head Start \nProgram. In Las Vegas, there are fewer than 2,000 children who benefit \nfrom the Head Start Program. That is a school district with 240,000 \nkids. This year, the Head Start Program around the country is being \nstraight-lined with not even inflation. We have to fight to bring the \nHead Start Program up to inflation. Fewer than 2,000 children benefit \nfrom the Head Start Program in this huge metropolitan area of Las \nVegas.\n  My friend, the Senator from California, and I voted against the tax \ncut. It is not easy to vote against tax cuts. But people in the country \nare suffering as a result.\n  The top 1 percent of the income earners in America are doing \nextremely well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is good that my friend raises the point. Tax cuts for \nthe middle class are one thing. Tax cuts for the people who earn a \nmillion dollars a year are another thing. People who are earning $1 \nmillion a year don't want to see this tax. They are going to get back \n$50,000 a year for every year. That is more than twice as much as a \nperson earning minimum wage gets. A person earning $20,000 or $30,000 a \nyear gets back $150 a year.\n  I am all for focusing on the people who need it--people who tell me, \nI am doing fine. I want to make sure there is no crime. I want cops on \nthe street--a program the administration has cut. I want to make sure \nchildren don't get in trouble after school, which my friend knows has \nbeen one of my priorities. The fact is, after the President signed the \neducation bill with great flourish, he has flat-lined afterschool.\n  Mr. REID. If I could interrupt the Senator, I talk to the women about \nafterschool programs. They are desperate for more afterschool programs \nbecause that is when kids get into trouble. We are desperate for \nafterschool programs. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the point. In other words, all of life involves \nshortages.\n  The Presiding Officer has worked for so many years, ever since I have \nbeen here, to help provide for dropout kids. And he has won approval on \nmany amendments.\n  But it does not do any good if this President does not fund those \nprograms. It does not do any good when we pass an authorization for \nafterschool, and the President does not fund those programs. It does \nnot do any good if we have money for rebuilding our schools, and the \nPresident does not fund the programs or fund Head Start or fund special \neducation.\n  The reason he cannot do it is because of the tax cut to the people \nearning over $1 million a year. That is the bottom line. I think if we \ngo to the people earning $1 million a year--and I have a lot of those \npeople in my State, I say to my friend, because we have 35 million \npeople in my State, and we have people who do very well--they will tell \nme to do all I can to redirect their tax cut, that they do not need, to \nthose things that the communities need: prescription drugs for our \nseniors; education for our children; a clean, healthy environment; \nbeautiful parks that are maintained.\n  I say to my friend, the majority whip, who holds such a high position \nhere, I am so proud he is on this floor day after day, bringing us back \nto the reality of why we are here, which is to help the people do the \nbest they can do: live long, healthy, productive lives, being well \neducated, and able to\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nbreathe clean air and drink clean water, and not have kids get in \ntrouble by dropping out of school where then their future is destroyed.\n  So I thank my friend.\n  The more the administration says, shame on you, saying something \nagainst what we believe, the more I have decided that is why I am here, \nand that is why I came here. I promised the people when I walked up \nthose steps and those doors opened up, and I came in this magnificent \nChamber, that I would never forget those who cannot put on the Gucci \nsuits and shoes and beautiful ties and come up here and lobby. I think \nabout them. And the more the administration fights against them, and \nfights for those who have so much more--whether it is Enron executives \nor anyone else; and that is a whole other story we can't get into--the \nmore I will speak up for them. And I know my friend will be there with \nme.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California understands that last year at \nthis time we had a $4.7 trillion surplus projected over the next 10 \nyears. Today, 1 year later, we are spending Social Security money \nsurpluses, Medicare money. The surplus is gone. Sure, 20 to 25 percent \nof that is due to the war. We recognize that. The other 75 percent is \nbecause of economic policies of this administration.\n  Remember, we had surpluses the last 3 years of the Clinton \nadministration. We were spending in the black, not in the red. We were \nmaking money. We were doing fine. We were starting to pay down the $5 \ntrillion debt. It is going to go up now.\n  So the Senator is right. We have to focus on issues that are \nimportant. The people of Nevada are very concerned about prescription \ndrug benefits. The average senior citizen fills 18 prescriptions a \nyear. And with managed care kind of going out of style, these people \nare suffering a lot.\n  So I say to my friend, the Senator from California, thank you very \nmuch for not forgetting why you came here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold suggesting the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I withhold my suggestion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Presiding Officer indicate what the matter before \nthe Senate is now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The matter pending before the Senate is H.R. \n3009.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3456 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Durbin, I send an \namendment to the desk. And I, of course, ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3456 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3433\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, at 11 o'clock, we will \nhave a cloture vote on amendment No. 3433, which has been offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, and my dear colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, with respect to the issue of health benefits for \nretired steelworkers.\n  I rise in strong support of that amendment, but especially to urge my \ncolleagues to vote to put cloture into place so we can move to the \namendment and vote on its merits, on its substance.\n  I know there is some difference of opinion in this Chamber about the \nsubstance of this amendment, and I obviously respect that difference of \nopinion, although I disagree with those who oppose the amendment. But \nat least the body ought to be allowed to move forward and actually vote \non the amendment itself. In order to do that, we have to invoke cloture \nin the morning because, up until now, we have been precluded from \nhaving a vote on this amendment.\n  The amendment itself is straightforward and simple. It would give a \nhealth insurance credit for eligible steel retirees. Actually, it is a \ncredit covering 70 percent of the total cost of health care coverage.\n  The retirees would have to pay 30 percent of the cost of their health \ncare coverage. But this is an effort to get at the problem of what is \ngoing to happen to people who are now retired, who have been getting \ntheir health benefits covered through the company and their companies \nhave now shut down. It covers companies' operations before January 1 of \n2000 that are either now closed or closed before January 1, 2004, and \nare operating under the protection of the bankruptcy code.\n  The setting for this problem is: The steel industry has been severely \nhit by a flood of imports coming into the country, and they are coming \nin on an unfair basis. These imports are being, in effect, subsidized \neither directly or indirectly, and they simply undercut the American \nproducers.\n  The steel industry went through a major restructuring in which they \neliminated a lot of inefficient producers and downsized. Active workers \nwere encouraged to take early retirement in order to slim down the \nworkforce. Having taken retirement and being dependent on the company \nplan for their health benefits, now they find that the company is no \nlonger able to pay the benefits. What is to happen to the retired \nworker? What is to be done for these retired workers and their \ndependents?\n  The International Trade Commission found unanimously there was \nserious injury done to the U.S. steel industry by the unprecedented \nflood of imports coming into the country. In fact, the President has \nundertaken a program of imposing tariffs on steel imports as a \nconsequence. That decision was not simply made out of the thin air. It \nwas a decision based on these findings about the harm being done to the \nsteel industry and based on the fact that we know that this steel has \nbeen coming in at underwritten cost, which makes it impossible for our \nproducers to compete with. So that is the context. In other words, you \nhave individuals and their families in the end who are sort of \nvictimized, and the reason they are victimized is because we have been \ntaken advantage of with respect to the trading relationship and steel \nproducers in other countries.\n  This is a very limited amendment. There are other amendments that \nwere under consideration that were much more far reaching. This is \nreally what they call a bridge amendment. It is to provide 1 year of \nsupport to these retirees in order to give them some breathing space \nwhile they try to straighten out their situation, so they do not simply \nfall off the edge of the cliff with respect to health care coverage for \nthemselves and for their dependents.\n  This goes only to eligible retirees. Most steel contracts require 15 \nyears of service in order for the benefit to vest, so they, in effect, \nwould have been long-term permanent employees. It is for the retirees \nand dependents and spouses who qualify for the retiree health benefit \nbut have lost their coverage because of the closure of their former \nemployer.\n  Unless Members are simply going to walk away from this human problem, \nthey must face up to what is to be done for them. This amendment that \nhas been put forward by my colleagues, Senator Mikulski and Senator \nRockefeller, is an effort to address that in a sensible way. They have \nprovided offsets for the cost of the amendment. It is being offered in \nthe context of what has been done to our steel industry by unfair \ncompetition.\n  It seems to me the least we can do in trying to address this \nsituation is to provide for this 1-year bridge coverage for these \neligible retirees and their families with respect to their health care \ncosts.\n  People may have different ideas about how this ought to be done. \nConceivably, some people may think nothing should be done. I find that \ndifficult to comprehend. From my point of view, it is impossible to \nsupport the idea we should simply do nothing. I think this represents a \nvery sensible effort to try to help people through a very difficult \ntransition period.\n\n  I will close by again observing, the vote we are talking about at 11 \na.m. is not a vote on the substance of the amendment. It is a vote as \nto whether we should end this extended debate that has been going on \nabout this amendment so we can then get to a vote.\n  Obviously, under the rules of the Senate, as long as the extensive \ndebate goes on, we are frustrated from getting to the amendment and \nactually having a vote on it. So I implore my colleagues to let us move \non, let us get beyond this unlimited debate situation so we can then \nget to the amendment in a reasonable period of time and have a vote up \nor down on it in order to try to address the very difficult situation \nin which our steel industry retirees find themselves with respect to \ntheir health care costs.\n  In some ways, it is unfortunate. We have a system in this country in \nwhich the health care costs in certain industries, in fact in many \nindustries--and steel is one example--is borne by the employer and/or \nthe employee dependent. This puts an extra burden on our companies when \nthey compete with foreign companies.\n  In many countries, they do not finance the health care plans in that \nrespect, and they do not have to build it into the cost of the product. \nWe do it the other way, and that is one of the reasons it is very \ndifficult for us in a global economy.\n  In any event, in this instance it is very clear that the companies \nencounter these difficulties because of the unfair competition. Our \nGovernment failed, in effect, to respond to that challenge, although \nPresident Bush has now made a response, and we are left with a \nsituation that we have thousands of retirees who find themselves facing \nimminently, in some instances already, a situation of how are they \ngoing to provide for these health care costs.\n  I think Senators Mikulski and Rockefeller have drafted a carefully \ncrafted amendment. I very much hope we will be able to get to it. I am \nsupportive of the amendment, and I certainly hope my colleagues will \nsupport the cloture motion tomorrow morning in order to bring the \ndebate on the amendment to an end and allow us to move forward and deal \nwith the substance of this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support \nof the trade adjustment assistance legislation. I will keep my comments \nshort and to the point.\n  I want to begin by emphasizing the positive. From what I have heard \non the floor over the last couple of weeks there is a substantial \nmajority of Senators in the Senate that believe a strong and expanded \ntrade adjustment assistance is essential for our country. They \nunderstand it is a fair and appropriate approach for those Americans \nwho lose their jobs as a result of trade. They understand that these \nAmericans are not looking for hand-outs. They are looking for a chance \nto provide for their families and contribute to our country's economic \nwelfare. This program offers them a chance to do just that. I find the \nincreasing consensus on Trade adjustment assistance to be encouraging.\n  But I have also heard some tough criticism of trade adjustment \nassistance lately, and since this is a bill that I introduced, I feel \ncompelled to respond to it.\n  There are two points that have been repeated by opponents of trade \nadjustment assistance. The first is that it should not be tied to fast-\ntrack legislation. I strongly disagree. In fact, I think the two bills \ncomplement each other. Passing fast-track suggests that the U.S. \ngovernment supports a multilateral trading system because it provides \nlong-term advantages for the United States and its people. Passing \ntrade adjustment assistance suggests that the U.S. government \nrecognizes that its trade policies have short-term costs for Americans.\n  Taken together, the bills suggest that we have a real strategy on \ntrade policy, one that shows we are committed to expanding the \ninternational trading system, but equally committed to the American \npeople.\n  I have said this before and I want to say it again because it \nmatters: Contrary to the assertions of some of my colleagues, we cannot \nmeasure the success of our trade policy only by the cost of the \nproducts we buy. We also have to look at whether or not our trade \npolicies make Americans more economically secure. By this I mean \nwhether they have a high-wage job, whether they can buy a home, whether \nthey can afford an education for their children, and whether they have \nretirement security. Without these things, we are poor by any measure.\n  The second criticism is that the trade adjustment assistance program \nis too expansive. I disagree. I believe that the program offers only \nthe basics for people who are trying desperately to make ends meet. \n$1000 or so a month in unemployment insurance is not going to make \nanyone rich. It certainly does not make them complacent, as some of my \ncolleagues have suggested. Giving someone funds so they can get \ntraining, and the support services they need to get training, and the \nhealth care they need to get through hard times, is hardly \nunreasonable. It is common sense, and it's the least we can do for our \nneighbors and friends back home.\n  For some of my colleagues to suggest that workers would want to lose \ntheir job just to take advantage of the trade adjustment assistance \nprogram is troubling. To suggest that individuals actually use the \ntrade adjustment assistance program to ``step backwards'' into other, \nlesser jobs impugns their integrity, honesty, and effort.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep in mind that the people on trade \nadjustment assistance did not ask to be dislocated. U.S. trade policy \ndid that. Contrary to what some of my colleagues have said, the trade \nadjustment assistance bill does not distort the market. It does allow \nus to correct for market failure, and helps Americans hurt by trade to \nget back on their feet again.\n  Some of the comments about trade adjustment assistance imply that the \nlegislation was created without any discussion with experts about what \nthe benefits of specific parts of the program might be. The comments \nare incorrect and misleading. These comments also minimize the \nsuffering of real people in real communities across my state and the \nUnited States.\n  At this stage of the game, it is important for my colleagues to \nremember that the core components of S. 1209--coverage for secondary \nworkers and workers injured by shifts in production, the extension of \nbenefits and allowances, health care and support service coverage, wage \ninsurance, and TAA for communities--were derived from the needs of \npeople I have spoken to who have been hurt by trade. These were people \nacross my state, from Albuquerque, to Questa, to Las Cruces, to \nRoswell, to Silver City. These elements of the bill were reinforced by \nobjective analyses from the Department of Labor, the General Accounting \nOffice, the Trade Deficit Review Commission, and other groups and \norganizations.\n  When I drafted the bill, it was not my intent to push a partisan \nagenda. It was my intent to help the people in my state and across the \ncountry that needed to be helped. This bill does that in a modest way.\n  It is time to move forward and do what has to be done to get trade \nadjustment assistance legislation passed. There is too much at stake \nfor American workers and communities to wait any longer. The program \nexpired last September, and it is time to get trade adjustment \nassistance to those that need it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4561-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of grave \nnational importance, the canned tuna industry in Mindanao. As I was \nlistening to the debate last week, I heard my friend, the gentleman \nfrom Texas, advocating rejection of the Dodd amendment that sought to \napply the same labor and environmental standards used in the Jordan \nFree Trade Agreement to trade agreements negotiated under Trade \nPromotion Authority.\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n  During the debate, the Senator from Texas attempted to distinguish \nbetween the Jordan Free Trade Agreement and future trade agreements by \nsaying ``that free trade agreement was a foreign policy action, not a \ntrade action.'' I would say to you that all trade actions are foreign \npolicy actions.\n  We are currently debating a multifaceted trade package that includes \nexpansion of the Andean Trade Preference Act. The reasons given for \nexpansion of the current ATPA include the need to expand the economies \nof the Andean region to provide alternatives to the illegal drug trade. \nThe United States would like to provide alternatives to drug production \nin order to reduce the drug supply reaching our nation. This is the \nessence of foreign policy conducting relations with other nations in a \nmanner intended to improve our Nation.\n  An element of the expansion under consideration would provide limited \nduty-free access to the U.S. market for canned tuna from the Andean \nregion. This provision, intended to complement our war on drugs, \nconflicts squarely with our Nation's efforts to fight international \nterrorism. This point is eloquently described in an article that \nrecently appeared in the New York Times entitled, ``Drugs, Terror and \nTuna: How Goals Clash.''\n  The article describes the canned tuna industry in the Philippines, \nwhich is entirely based in Mindanao, where the Philippine Government is \nwaging a war against Muslim terrorists and the poverty that breeds \nthem. Damaging the Philippines' export of canned tuna to the United \nStates would seriously harm many workers in Mindanao. Morever, American \ncommitments made by the United States to President Gloria Macapagal-\nArroyo, and the common struggle against worldwide terrorism would be in \njeopardy.\n  At present, at the invitation of the Philippine government, we have \nAmerican troops in Mindanao advising and training Philippine troops. \nMuch of the success of our efforts depends on the outcome of the Andean \nTrade debate. Our trade policy must not undermine our foreign policy \nefforts to fight terrorism worldwide and protect our citizens.\n  I have filed amendments that I will not call up today, but that I \nhave submitted to ensure the continued cooperation of one of our most \nvital partners in the international war against terrorism, the \nPhilippines.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the article and to study this situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2002]\n\n                Drugs, Terror and Tuna: How Goals Clash\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       General Santos City, the Philippines, May 15.--This \n     industrial city on the southern coast of Mindanao Island \n     illustrates how America's various strategic aims in the wars \n     on drugs and terrorism can clash, alienating important allies \n     engaged in battling terrorism.\n       Among leaders of the Philippines' important tuna industry \n     here, resentment is running high over trade legislation now \n     on the Senate floor in Washington. The bill includes a \n     provision to eliminate steep import taxes on canned tuna from \n     Andean nations while keeping taxes in place for other \n     countries like the Philippines.\n       The provision has attracted Congressional support because \n     it is seen as bolstering America's war on drugs. The idea is \n     that the bill will help create well-paid jobs in Ecuador and \n     Colombia as an alternative to the drug trade.\n       But in another war--the one against terrorism--the \n     legislation is causing anger in a country that has become an \n     important part of the administration's plans.\n       It comes at a time when 600 American soldiers are helping \n     the Philippine Army track Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents in the \n     southernmost Philippines, and President Gloria Macapagal \n     Arroyo has staked much political capital on helping the \n     United States fight terrorism.\n       Virtually all of the tuna industry of the Philippines is \n     located here and it employs thousands of migrant workers from \n     small Muslim fishing communities that used to be bastions of \n     various Muslim insurgencies. Local officials warn that the \n     legislation could wipe out the tuna industry.\n       President Arroyo said that passage of the trade provision \n     would deal a severe blow to the economy here while handing a \n     propaganda victory to the Abu Sayyaf movement.\n       The combination would create heavy domestic pressure for \n     the Philippines to retreat from its active support for the \n     American war on terrorism, she warned in a telephone \n     interview tonight.\n       ``I will try very hard not to, but I will be under \n     tremendous pressure,'' she said.\n       In much of the developing world, including Latin America \n     and Africa, trade restrictions or tariffs on products ranging \n     from steel to textiles are causing growing resentment toward \n     the United States. The perception that the Bush \n     administration is a protectionist one is growing.\n       President Arroyo argued that General Santos, the main city \n     on the southern coast of Mindanao and home to most of the \n     Philippines' tuna fishing fleet and canneries, was central \n     both to the economic future of this region and to the fight \n     against terrorism.\n       A powerful pipe bomb packed with nails exploded on a \n     crowded sidewalk outside a supermarket here on April 21, \n     killing 15 people and wounding dozens. A second pipe bomb was \n     safely defused before it exploded at another supermarket the \n     same day, and two shopping complexes have recently burned \n     down here in the middle of the night in separate, unexplained \n     incidents.\n       Police detectives here say that they are still unsure \n     whether the attacks were terrorist incidents, criminal \n     attempts at extortion or some combination of the two. But \n     President Arroyo expresses no such doubts, saying tonight, \n     ``The Abu Sayyaf has been trying to get into General Santos \n     and it has been very difficult for us to justify our support \n     for the United States.''\n       In a city where tunas festoon everything from billboards to \n     restaurant signs, and where even the golf tournament is the \n     Tuna Cup, the fishing industry's influence is impossible to \n     miss.\n       Workers heave baskets of fish onto crude steel carts, which \n     they then pull by hand over a long open-sided shed. Women \n     wash and sort the fish on long tables, the concrete floor \n     beneath them dark and slippery with fish blood. A few larger \n     tuna, some the size of a man, are carried individually to \n     large, white boxes packed with half-melted ice, to be shipped \n     directly to Japan to be turned into sashimi.\n       Renato Alonzo, 47, a fisherman in a ragged T-shirt and \n     flip-flops whose boat had just docked after two weeks at sea, \n     said that he had sold his tiny farm and joined a boat crew 10 \n     years ago after learning he could nearly double his income, \n     to roughly $4,000 a year. Now he can afford to send his two \n     sons, aged 12 and 8, to school.\n       The bustling fishing port here and the nearby row of tuna \n     canneries contrast sharply with most of Mindanao, where \n     peasants still toil on subsistence farms or on large \n     pineapple and coconut plantations. Years of drought, coupled \n     with inadequate irrigation, have crippled agriculture while \n     the global glut of low-priced steel has forced the closing of \n     a big steel mill in northern Mindanao.\n       The tuna industry here barely existed until the late 1980's \n     when the United States led Japan, Italy and other donor \n     nations in an ambitious foreign aid program aimed at \n     rebuilding the Philippines after the fall of Ferdinand \n     Marcos.\n       A full-scale guerrilla war was being waged in Mindanao \n     then, a far broader conflict than the handful of kidnappings \n     and possibly bombings linked to Abu Sayyaf now. General \n     Santos City was nearly surrounded by several very large \n     insurgencies that attracted poor youths from the island's \n     Muslim minority. The city had a small fishing fleet, but it \n     mostly caught fish for local consumption.\n       But the world's richest tuna fishing grounds lay between \n     here and Indonesia, although boats from Thailand mainly \n     fished them then. Foreign donors built the fishing port here \n     as well as a large cargo airport, a container port, extensive \n     roads and a modern phone system, hiring security guards from \n     rebel forces and buying sand, gravel and other construction \n     materials from rebel leaders' businesses.\n       With ready transportation to foreign markets, six big \n     canneries were built, each employing more than 1,000 workers. \n     The only two other tuna canneries in the Philippines are in \n     Zamboanga City in southwestern Mindanao, the staging area for \n     American troops pursuing Abu Sayyaf. Some 30,000 fishermen \n     now supply the canneries.\n       The tuna boom has helped persuade all the rebel movements \n     except the Abu Sayyaf splinter group to lay down their arms \n     under armistices with the government. Many former rebel \n     commanders and foot soldiers have taken jobs at the \n     canneries, which have had no problem with the bombings that \n     have afflicted shopping centers.\n       Abuhasan Jama is a former major in the Moro National \n     Liberation Front who studied guerrilla warfare in Malaysia in \n     1979 and 1980 and then spent 13 years fighting the Philippine \n     government in the jungles of Mindanao.\n       Now he is the security chief at Ocean Canning here, his \n     eldest daughter is in college and he has found jobs at the \n     same cannery for three cousins who are also former \n     guerrillas. ``I like to work,'' said Mr. Jama, 41, recalling \n     that in the jungle ``sometimes you'd just eat leaves, the \n     roots.''\n       Mariano M. Fernandez, the general manager of Ocean Canning, \n     said that he used to carry two Smith & Wesson handguns, one \n     strapped on each hip. ``It was like the Wild West here,'' he \n     said, adding that he carries only a cellphone now.\n       Most of the tuna canned here is sold in the United States \n     under less famous brands like Geisha and Dagim. Bumble Bee \n     and Starkist used to buy large quantities of tuna here but \n     have recently begun relying on Ecuador instead, allowing that \n     country to edge past the\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\n     Philippines last year to become the second-largest foreign \n     supplier of tuna to the United States, after Thailand \n     Starkist in particular is now pushing for the elimination of \n     import tariffs on canned tuna from Ecuador.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4563-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CUBA'S INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I joined President Bush and the \nCuban-American community in Miami to observe the 100th anniversary of \nCuba's independence from Spain. This is a bittersweet celebration \nbecause Cubans today are not free.\n  Centuries ago, when Spaniards first arrived on Cuban shores, they \nmarveled at the breathtaking beauty of the island and recognized the \nimportance of its geographical location. It is no wonder why this \nisland became known as the ``Pearl of the Antilles.''\n  After years of Spanish control, Cuban patriots such as Carlos Manuel \nde Cespedes, Maximo Gomez, Antonio Maceo, and Jose Marti, gave \nunselfishly of themselves to ensure that Cuba would become free and \nindependent. But it was not until May 20, 1902, that Cuba's first \nsovereign government was established and Tomas Estrada Palma became \nCuba's first President.\n  As the years passed, Cuba prospered and was recognized around the \nworld for its many educational, cultural and financial accomplishments. \nRegrettably, many of these advances came to a halt with the arrival of \nFidel Castro's revolution. Sadly, this regime is notorious for its \nrepression and tyranny, and its human rights record has been so \ndeplorable that the United Nations Human Rights Commission continues to \ncondemn the Cuban government year after year.\n  On this day, when all Cubans should be celebrating the many \naccomplishments of the past 100 years, you cannot help but wonder how \nmany more achievements could have been attained in a free, democratic \nand prosperous Cuba.\n  Today, I want to take the opportunity to recognize the many \ncontributions of our Cuban-American friends whose hard work and \nsacrifices have added so much to our nation. At the same time, we \ncannot forget those brave individuals in Cuba who are at risk for \npromoting democracy and human rights in their homeland.\n  Here in America, we look forward to the day when Cubans are able to \nspeak freely without fear of retribution and when democratic reforms \nwill replace the only remaining dictatorship in our hemisphere. Viva \nCuba Libre!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4563-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF THE 7TH ANNUAL ASIAN SPRING FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n7th Annual Asian Spring Festival. This special event was initiated by \nthe Asian American Civic Association in 1996.\n  The Asian Spring Festival is annually held in conjunction with Asian \nPacific American Heritage Month in May. This event provides a unique \nopportunity for members of this diverse community to come together and \ncelebrate the unique aspects of their culture. It is also an \nopportunity to honor outstanding Asian-Americans within their \ncommunities.\n  Throughout its history, our Nation has grown and evolved in a \npositive way as peoples of many backgrounds, beliefs, and ideas have \ncome together to make America the greatest Nation on Earth. With this \nin mind, it is important to honor the special aspects of our society \nthat create this unique whole.\n  I wish the Asian-American community the best on this special \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4563-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL PAPER'S MADISON LUMBER MILL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I pay tribute \nto International Paper's Madison Lumber Mill of Madison, NH, which was \nnamed this year's Manufacturing Business of the Year by the New \nHampshire Chamber of Commerce and Business NH Magazine.\n  As the ranking Republican member of the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I applaud Madison Lumber Mill on its outstanding \nenvironmental efforts. As the neighbor to 1,800 acres of conservation \nland owned by the Nature Conservancy, the mill makes extraordinary \nefforts to create a minimum impact on the environment. Through courtesy \nand a shared commitment to land conservation, the two neighbors have \ndeveloped a solid relationship. Along with a dedication to \nconservation, the mill is constantly looking to reduce any \nenvironmental impact, and their environmental compliance goes above and \nbeyond the requirements of the law. One of the mill's main goals is to \noperate under the principles of the Sustainable Forestry initiative \nprogram, which ensures the perpetual growth and harvesting of trees \nwhile protecting wildlife, plants, soil, air and water quality.\n  I commend the dedication Madison Mill exemplifies within the \ncommunity and surrounding areas. Not only does the mill purchase 90 \npercent of its log supply from predominantly private land owners within \na 60 mile radius of the plant, but they also require their loggers to \ncomplete safety training courses. Continuing a tradition of community \nservice, Madison Mill annually grants $10,000 to local libraries, \nschools and civic organizations. Along with donations, the mill has \ndeveloped a Community Advisory Council partnership to keep the lines of \ncommunication between the mill and local community open. One of the \ncouncil's main goals is to facilitate community economic development \nand awareness. The 13 member council meets quarterly to discuss \nregional issues, raise concerns with the mill and discuss plans for the \nfuture.\n  I applaud Madison Lumber Mill and their dedication to surrounding \ncommunities and the environment. Their environmental efforts and \npositive additions to the community exemplify why Madison Mill was this \nyear's award recipient.

MIDDLETON\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I pay tribute \nto Jack B. Middleton, recently named Business Leader of the Year 2002, \nby the NH Chamber of Commerce and Business NH Magazine. Jack's efforts \nboth in his profession and in his community are unsurpassed, and set an \nimpressive standard for his peers to follow.\n  Jack currently serves as President of the New Hampshire based law \nfirm McLane, Graf, Raulerson & Middleton. Joining the firm in 1956, he \nentered a tradition of community service and dedicated practice. He \nbecame a partner in 1962 and later became President. His countless \naccomplishments both in his professional career and philanthropic \nefforts have led him to a position of mentor, friend and leader.\n  I applaud Jack's continued service to the legal profession and \nwillingness to accept leadership roles in numerous organizations. His \nservice extends to state and regional bar associations, legal \nfoundations, the Interest on Lawyer's Trust Account, IOLTA, program, \nand his own firm. He is the longest serving Chair of the NH Bar \nFoundation and Secretary of the Board of Governors of the American Bar \nAssociation. His position on the American Bar Association is one of \ngreat pride to the New Hampshire legal community, as he is only the \nsecond person from New Hampshire to hold a position at the national \nlevel of the ABA. He is the former President of the New Hampshire Bar \nAssociation, the New England Bar Association, the National Conference \nof Bar Foundations, the National Conference of Bar Presidents and a \nFellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. Along with these \npositions of service, Jack has also received numerous awards such as \nCitizen of the Year 1994 by the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, \nNew Hampshire's Distinguished Citizen of the Year 2000 by the Daniel \nWebster Council and has twice been awarded the President's Award for \nSpecial Service to the Profession by the New Hampshire Bar Association.\n  Jack's community service sets a positive example for all Granite \nStaters and his dedication to improving his community is beyond \ncompare. His role in developing the IOLTA program, which offers legal \nassistance for the needy as well as public education about the law, was \ncritical to helping the people of New Hampshire. This program allows \nlawyers to place money that they are holding for short periods of time \ninto a pooled interest-bearing account. The proceeds of which fund the \nprogram. Since the start of the program in 1982, the account has raised \nmore than $13 million dollars. Jack's efforts to develop this already \nexisting program in New Hampshire as well as his many contributions in \nother fund-raising efforts and community service have led the Bar \nFoundation to name Jack an ``Honorary Fellow.''\n  Jack Middleton is an extraordinary example of someone who serves his \ncommunity as he would serve his career. By continuing the long-standing \ntradition of philanthropy that his firm has set forth, Jack has shown \nonce and again why he is such a deserving candidate of this year's \naward. I congratulate him and wish him continued success in future \nyears. It is an honor to represent Jack Middleton in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4564-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO MANCHESTER NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING SERVICES, INC.\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

One of the largest and most visible projects thus far \nhas been the $11 Million Elm Street Restoration Project, which created \n68 affordable apartments in two of the historic downtown brownstones. \nThis project is one of the largest nonprofit affordable housing \nprojects in New Hampshire's history.\n  I would also like to recognize the Renaissance, a 24 unit family \nrental project and the first Low Income Housing Tax Credit project, \ncreated for first-time home buyers. Among these many accomplishments, \nMNHS has also loaned or granted more than $6.5 million dollars for home \npurchase and rehabilitation. The outstanding performance by this \norganization is not only making positive changes to the community but \nmore importantly to peoples lives. There is nothing more important to \nme than to make sure that people are taken care of.

By taking a fresh approach to the utility industry, \nUnitil has proven that quantity does not necessarily reflect quality. \nUnitil was established after a union between Concord Electric Company \nand Exeter & Hampton Electric Company in 1984. The company now employs \n333 people as well as servicing 110,000 customers.\n  Unitil was among the frontrunners of the industry with the creation \nof their program, USource, which matches buyers on the Internet with \npre-qualified energy suppliers. Unitil's approach to business has \nresulted in the lowest electric rates available in New England as well \nas excellent performance ratings from the majority of their clients.\n  Aside from Unitil's low rates and high quality of service, the real \ntreasure of the company lies within its employees and their dedication \nto community service. By operating with an emphasis on giving and \nvolunteering in their local communities, Unitil has encouraged \nemployees to volunteer their time and make a positive impact. Led by \nexample, Unitil's CEO Bob Schoenberger is President of the Board of the \nUnited Way of the Greater Seacoast. Employees are each granted eight \nhours of paid leave for volunteering. Last year, Unitil's employees \nvolunteered 1,000 hours of community service and raised more than \n$8,000 in a matched contribution program. Unitil also donated $90,000 \nto 200 local non-profit organizations in 2001.\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\n  Unitil serves as a positive example for all Granite Staters, and I \napplaud their dedication to improving their community, both in the \npersonal and the business arena.

Named \nthis year's Education/Non-Profit Business of the Year by the New \nHampshire Chamber of Commerce and Business NH Magazine.\n  The CASA program is crucial to New Hampshire's abused and neglected \nchildren, offering support, guidance, and a sound outlook on the \nchildren for New Hampshire's Family and District Court judges. Started \nin New Hampshire in 1988 by Marcia Sink, CASA has advocated for 3,045 \nyoung victims in 2,276 cases within district and family court during \nthe past 14 years. A national program, CASA trains volunteers to \nadvocate for abused and neglected children in the court system. \nTypically taking just one case at a time, CASA volunteers gain an \nintimate knowledge of the children, family situation and current \narrangements which proves invaluable to judges upon their rulings.\n  Aside from the Business of the year award, CASA has been the \nrecipient of the Citadel Broadcasting Company's 2001 Year of Service \nAward, Brown and Company's Pro Bono Award, the Walter J. Dunley Award \nfor Excellence in Non-Profit Management and WMUR Channel Nine's \nCommunity Champion award. Along with these distinguished awards for \ntheir service and contributions, CASA has made an impact in the lives \nof numerous children which is the greatest award of all. New Hampshire \nthanks you for your continued service to the children of the Granite \nState.\n  I applaud the dedication to New Hampshire's youth that CASA has shown \nover the years. Currently representing more than 75 percent of New \nHampshire's abused and neglected children, these volunteers have spent \ncountless hours defending the best interest of these children. They \noffer a unique and innovative approach to placing children in the best \npossible situation and their efforts are crucial during these trying \ntimes. I commend the CASA program of New Hampshire and wish them \ncontinued success in the coming years. It is an honor to represent you \nin the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4565-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE TOWN OF WILTON, CT, ON ITS BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the Town \nof Wilton, CT, on celebrating its bicentennial anniversary as a \nseparate municipality.\n  Incorporated by the Connecticut General Assembly from the parent Town \nof Norwalk, CT, on Monday, May 20, 1802, Wilton is a vibrant community \nsteeped in both history and culture, and a paradigm of the \nquintessential New England town. Settled as early as 1640, Wilton grew \nfrom 40 recorded families in 1726 to its present population of over \n17,000. While the town has been successful in maintaining a small \ntight-knit community atmosphere, it has greatly benefitted from its \nlocation in Fairfield County and proximity to New York City. Modern \nWilton is blessed with a diverse population, a strong economy, and a \nplethora of different industries.\n  From the day 263 residents volunteered to fight to uphold American \nliberty in the Revolutionary War, the people of Wilton have continually \ndemonstrated admirable patriotism during many different eras. Over the \nyears, the town has also become keenly aware of its own heritage. \nThrough a variety of innovative preservation efforts undertaken by the \nWilton Historical Society, dozens of historical houses and buildings \ndating from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries have been protected for \nthe benefit of future generations. One of these estates happens to be \nthe only National Park in Connecticut, the Weir Farm National Historic \nSite. Home to impressionist painter Julian Alden Weir for over 40 \nyears, the residence is considered a birthplace of the American \nImpressionist movement in the 1890s.\n  To celebrate the town bicentennial, the people of Wilton will be \nholding several different traditional festivities during the month of \nMay. In addition, 20 Wilton residents will be cycling from Washington, \nDC, to Wilton in a special ``BikeCentennial.'' The entourage will \ntravel across Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and part of Connecticut \nbefore arriving at Wilton on July 4.\n  Once again, I would like to commemorate the town of Wilton on its \nbicentennial anniversary. I wish the town and its residents continued \nvibrancy and success for many generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4565-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND DAVID ARIAS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nRev. David Arias, Auxiliary Bishop of Newark and Regional Bishop of \nHudson County on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his \nOrdination.\n  Rev. Arias' background is as wide and as varied as the United States. \nBorn and ordained to the priesthood in Spain, he has worked in Spain, \nMexico City, Texas, Kansas City, California, and now Hudson County, NJ.\n  In 1996, as a member of the Archdiocese of New York, Rev. Arias was \nnamed head of the Spanish Cursillo Movement and later named director of \nHispanic Affairs for the Archdiocese of New York by Cardinal Terrence \nCooke. He was named the Auxiliary Bishop of Newark, NJ in 1983 and has \nserved as Pastor of St. Joseph of the Palisades in West New York, NJ \nsince 1994.\n  The Archdiocese of Newark has been fortunate to have the services. of \nRev. Arias and I wish him the best in his continued ministry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4565-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4565-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4565-6", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 2002 COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY TOWARD \n   SUB-SUBHARAN AFRICA AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND \n                         OPPORTUNITY ACT--PM 87\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 106 of title I of the Trade and Development \nAct of 2000 (Public Law 106-200), I am providing a report prepared by \nmy Administration entitled, the 2002 Comprehensive Report on U.S. Trade \nand Investment Policy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa and Implementation of \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n                                                      George W.

Con. Res. 114\n\n       Whereas the Government of North Korea is one of the most \n     oppressive regimes and was identified by the President of the \n     United States as one of the three countries forming an ``axis \n     of evil'';\n       Whereas the Government of North Korea is controlled by the \n     Korean Workers Party, which does not recognize the right of \n     North Koreans to exercise the freedoms of speech, religion, \n     press, assembly, or association;\n       Whereas the Government of North Korea imposes severe \n     punishments for crimes such as attempted defection, slander \n     of the Korean Workers Party, listening to foreign broadcasts, \n     possessing printed matter that is considered reactionary by \n     the Korean Workers Party, and holding prohibited religious \n     beliefs;\n       Whereas at least 1,000,000 North Koreans are estimated to \n     have died of starvation since 1995 because of the failure of \n     the centralized agricultural system operated by the \n     Government of North Korea and because of severe drought;\n       Whereas the combination of political, social, and religious \n     persecution, economic deprivation, and the risk of starvation \n     in North Korea is causing many North Koreans to flee to \n     China;\n       Whereas between 100,000 and 300,000 North Korean refugees \n     are estimated to be residing in China without the permission \n     of the Government of China;\n       Whereas the Governments of China and North Korea have \n     reportedly begun aggressive campaigns to locate North Koreans \n     who reside without permission in China and to forcibly return \n     them to North Korea;\n       Whereas North Koreans who seek asylum in China and are \n     refused, are returned to North Korea where they have \n     reportedly been imprisoned and tortured, and in many cases \n     killed;\n       Whereas the United Nations Convention Relating to the \n     Status of Refugees of 1951, as modified and incorporated by \n     reference by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     of 1967, defines a refugee as a person who ``owing to well-\n     founded fear of being\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n     persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, \n     membership of a particular social group or political opinion, \n     is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, \n     owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the \n     protection of that country'';\n       Whereas despite China's obligations as a party to the \n     United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     of 1951 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     of 1967, China routinely classifies North Koreans seeking \n     asylum in China as ``economic migrants'' and returns the \n     refugees to North Korea without regard to the serious threat \n     of persecution they will face upon their return;\n       Whereas the Government of China is party to the United \n     Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 \n     and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1967 \n     and must respect the term of these agreements;\n       Whereas in recent weeks, Chinese authorities have increased \n     security around diplomatic properties and reportedly have \n     stepped up detentions of North Koreans hiding in the country, \n     in response to 28 North Koreans seeking asylum who rushed \n     several foreign embassies;\n       Whereas on May 9th, eight North Koreans seeking political \n     asylum rushed the United States and Japanese consulates in \n     the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, including three \n     who scaled a wall and made it into the United States mission; \n     and\n       Whereas Chinese police captured the other five, including a \n     toddler, allegedly by entering the Japanese Consulate \n     compound without permission, and dragging five people out, in \n     clear violation of the provisions of the Vienna Convention on \n     Consular Relations ensuring the inviolability of consular \n     missions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress encourages--\n       (1) the Government of China to honor its obligations under \n     the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of \n     Refugees of 1951, as modified and incorporated by reference \n     by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1967, \n     by--\n       (A) making genuine efforts to identify and protect the \n     refugees among the North Korean migrants encountered by \n     Chinese authorities, including providing the refugees with a \n     reasonable opportunity to petition for asylum;\n       (B) allowing the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees to have access to all North Korean asylum seekers \n     and refugees residing in China;\n       (C) halting the forced repatriations of North Korean \n     refugees seeking asylum in China; and\n       (D) cooperating with the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees in efforts to resettle the North Korean refugees \n     residing in China to other countries;\n       (2) the Government of China to permit access to the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in order to evaluate \n     the asylum claims and to facilitate the resettlement of the \n     North Korean refugees residing in China in other countries; \n     and\n       (3) the United States Government to consider asylum claims \n     and refugee claims of North Koreans arising from a well-\n     founded fear of persecution.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \na few minutes ahead of the Republican time. I want to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to an issue Senator Kennedy and I are working on \ntogether and that is increasing in importance and focus. And that is \nwhat is taking place in North Korea and its border with China.\n  We have in that area approximately 150,000 to 300,000 North Korean \nrefugees who have fled North Korea and the very oppressive regime there \nand are now being hunted down and sent back to North Korea to prison \ncamps, to, in some cases, death and other circumstances that are \nhorrible that may be just short of death in North Korea.\n  I want to outline what is taking place and a couple of action items \nthis body can take up.\n  If a picture is worth 1,000 words, this picture says it all. On May \n9, eight North Koreans were rushed inside the United States and \nJapanese consulates in Shenyang in northeastern China some 125 miles \nfrom the North Korean border. Five of those sought refuge in the \nJapanese consulate, including this 2-year-old girl who has the \nbeautiful pigtails and in any other sitting you might think is cute--\nshe is cute in this one as well--sought refuge in the Japanese \nconsulate. They were forcibly removed from inside the consulate \ncompound by the Chinese paramilitary security forces--two of whom you \nsee arresting this girl's mother and why she is crying--and placed in \nChinese police detention.\n  This morning's news came out that a Korean-American pastor had been \ndetained by Chinese authorities for protecting 14 North Korean orphans \nin this same area.\n  Pastor Joseph Choi, 47, an American citizen, was detained in Yanbian, \nnortheastern China, on May 9 along with 14 North Korean children. He \nwas protecting these 14 orphans and providing them food and shelter. He \nwas arrested, and that news came out this morning.\n  As you may know, the facts regarding this particular child and her \nfamily are at dispute, although the videotape of the incident, which I \nhave reviewed, leaves no doubt that the Chinese authorities trespassed \non the Japanese consulate compound. Chinese authorities allege that \nthese five persons in Shenyang never made it inside the Japanese \nconsulate compound. Once inside that compound, this is Japanese \nsovereign territory. They said the consulate had requested that the \nChinese security forces remove the asylum seekers. Japanese consulate \nofficials deny these allegations. A videotape filmed by a Japanese \njournalist documents their entry into the Japanese consulate compound \nand the forcible removal that took place.\n  Tokyo has demanded that Beijing apologize, release the detainees, and \nassure safe passage for these asylum-seekers and a promise that such \nintrusions won't happen again. As of this morning, China continues to \ndetain the five individuals including the 2-year-old child, including \nthe pastor and 14 other orphans.\n  A large-scale problem exists of North Koreans fleeing political and \nreligious oppression and starvation and seeking refuge in northeastern \nChina. There are an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 North Korean refugees \nliving illegally in China. China has a treaty with North Korea under \nwhich China agrees to view these individuals as illegal immigrants or \n``economic migrants'' and to send them back, without consideration of \nthe persecution they may face upon their return. The Chinese Government \nrefuses to permit the UNHCR to screen fleeing North Koreans to \ndetermine whether they deserve political asylum. Furthermore, under \nChinese law, anyone aiding a fleeing North Korean is subject to a fine, \nand bounties are paid to Chinese citizens who turn in North Koreans to \nthe Chinese authorities--bounty hunting.\n  Since the end of April, Chinese authorities have increased the use of \nthe People's Armed Police, a paramilitary security force guarding \nforeign diplomatic properties, in order to thwart further asylum \nattempts. An estimated 312 North Koreans have defected to South Korea \nto date.\n  The United States is the leading donor of food to North Korea, which \ncannot feed its 22 million people. American negotiators should insist \non assurances that this aid is reaching those most in need.\n  Since 1995, the United States has provided more than $500 million in \nfood and other commodities to North Korea--up to 350,000 metric tons of \nfood each year. This year this aid is down to 155,000 metric tons \nbecause of demands for aid in Afghanistan; other countries are also \nsending less to North Korea. But American deliveries of food and fuel \nremain critical to Pyongyang.\n  More than 2 million North Koreans are reported to have died from \nstarvation and related diseases between 1994 and 1998, and large \npockets of hunger and starvation remain. At least 40 percent of \nchildren under 5 are malnourished, according to the World Food Program, \na United Nations agency.\n  No one really knows, however, how much donated food is diverted to \nthe North Korean military, police, Communist Party officials, essential \nworkers, and those loyal to the regime. The World Food Program argues \nthat food aid is not going to the military because the military has the \nfirst cut from national harvests. But the agency has no evidence \nbecause there is no independent monitoring of donated food.\n  In the coming negotiations, the United States should insist upon \nunrestricted access to all areas of the country where food is \ndelivered. It should require lists of the actual institutions to which \nfood and medicines are going and uncontrolled access for the World Food \nProgram. It should press the North Korean Government to allow \ninternational aid groups to set up feeding stations of their own that \nare accessible to all hungry North Koreans.\n  More importantly, the precarious situation of the North Koreans who \nhave crossed into China should also be on\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nthe table. These desperate people foraging for food are treated as \nillegal immigrants and hunted down. When forcibly returned to North \nKorea, they may face imprisonment or worse. And we should demand of the \nChinese government to let these people go--let them go to a third \ncountry.\n  The Government of Korea is one of the most repressive regimes in the \nworld and was identified by the President as one of three countries \nforming an ``axis of evil.'' It is also an economic disaster in which a \ncentralized agricultural system has led to millions starving to death. \nYet it is flanked on all sides by some of the most successful economies \nin the world.\n  This picture and the video tape that has been played continuously in \nJapan, Korea, and around the world has shocked the conscience of people \neverywhere. Yet, we should be reminded it was not so long ago that the \nworld at times ignored similar pictures and stories--during World War \nII, Cambodia, and Kosovo, to mention just a few. In North Korea today, \nwe are facing a similar evil.\n  I am reminded of a story during World War II about a church along a \nrailroad track that routinely carried people in trains on their way to \nthe Nazi concentration camps. When members of the congregation could no \nlonger ignore the cries for help from those trains, some insisted that \nthey sing louder. I hope we will listen, learn and act. What we should \nbe afraid of is not the deeds of ``evil'' but the conscience of the \nworld. This child is watching us, judging us. I hope China does the \nright thing.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to submit a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, along with Senator Kennedy, my colleague and chairman of \nthe Immigration Subcommittee, where I serve as the ranking member. The \npurpose of this resolution is simple and direct: under both \ninternational laws and on humanitarian grounds, China should release \nthis girl and her family as well as the Korean American pastor and 14 \norphans immediately and provide them safe passage to a third country. I \nencourage my colleagues in joining Senator Kennedy and myself in \nsupporting this resolution and getting quick passage so that we can \nsend a strong message to China to let these people go.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The resolution will be received and appropriately referred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/20/senate-section/article/S4571-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3456.
