Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss once again \nthe amendment that will be voted on after the party caucuses at 2:45. \nThe amendment I am offering is to wall off and protect the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds from being raided, from being used \nfor other purposes.\n  I think every Member of this body remembers very well the time in \nwhich, for years, Social Security trust funds were regularly raided for \nother purposes. We only stopped that practice 3 or 4 years ago, and I \nthink all of us do not want to go back to those days.\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n  The best way to assure that we do not go back to those days is to \nagree to the amendment I have offered today, the amendment that is \nvirtually identical to the amendment I offered last year that got 60 \nvotes in the Senate.\n  We call it the Social Security and Medicare lockbox amendment because \nit protects both the Social Security surplus and the Medicare surplus.\n  In fact, if we go to the detail of what we are discussing, this \namendment protects the Social Security surpluses in each and every \nyear, takes the Medicare Part A trust fund off budget in the same way \nwe have taken the Social Security trust fund off budget, and gives \nMedicare the same protections as Social Security.\n  This legislation contains strong enforcement language--budget points \nof order--to assure these funds are not used for some other purpose.\n  One of the things that leaves out, for anyone studying the \nPresident's budget proposal, is unless he uses Medicare trust fund \nmoney in 2005, he runs an $11 billion deficit in that year.\n  That is part of the problem with this budget. It threatens to put us \nback into deficits because the tax cut is so large. Some of us believe \nit is critically important that we protect both the Social Security \ntrust fund and the Medicare trust fund so they are not used for other \nspending in the Federal budget.\n  Some have argued, well, there really is no surplus in Medicare; that \nthere are two trust funds, and there is a surplus in one--that is, Part \nA of Medicare, the hospital coverage part of Medicare, and Part B that \ncovers largely doctors' services, which is in deficit.\n  I have heard this argument made over and over, but it is just wrong. \nIt is not what the law says. It is not what the actuaries say. It is \nnot what the detailed financial reports that have been made to the \nSenate say.\n  This is the page right out of the budget book from the Congressional \nBudget Office. It says on the table on page 19 ``trust fund \nsurpluses.'' The first one is Social Security. It shows year by year \nthe surpluses we will have in Social Security. Then it talks about \nMedicare. The first trust fund it discusses is Part A. You can see year \nby year the surpluses that are projected for Medicare Part A.\n  Under the Congressional Budget Office scoring, this adds up to over \n$400 billion. In the President's analysis, it is over $500 billion of \nsurplus in Part A.\n  Then it goes to Part B. While some have argued that Part B is somehow \nin deficit and therefore there are no surpluses in Medicare, that isn't \nwhat the report shows. The report shows that over the 10-year period \nthere is a rough balance in Part B--not a deficit. It is not any big \nsurplus.\n  Those who have argued that there is no Medicare surplus--I don't know \nwhat it is based on. But it is not based on the facts, and it is not \nbased on the law. Some have tried to argue, well, because Part B is \nfunded 25 percent by premiums and 75 percent by general fund revenue, \ntherefore Part B is in deficit. Again, that isn't what the law says. \nThat isn't what the actuaries say. That isn't what Congress has said. \nCongress made the determination that Part B would be funded 25 percent \nby premiums, and 75 percent by general fund revenue. We made that \ndetermination. It is not in deficit.\n  If one follows the logic, and one says, well, if Part A is in \nsurplus, Part B is in balance, therefore it just doesn't matter somehow \nbecause they are claiming Part B is in deficit because 75 percent of \nits funding is from the general fund, we can just forget about the Part \nA surplus, and we can move it, as the President does to this so-called \n``contingency fund,'' what does that do? That moves up the date of \ninsolvency of Medicare by 15 or 16 years. And Medicare will go broke in \nthe year 2009 and 2010 instead of the year 2025.\n\n  What kind of a policy is that? What earthly sense does it make to \nraid the Medicare trust fund and use it for other purposes?\n  I suggest to my colleagues that it makes no sense. It is precisely \nwhat we should not do.\n  In answer to my amendment, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are offering an amendment. This amendment claims to be a lockbox, \nbut the door is wide open. This is what I call the ``leaky lockbox'' \nbecause there is no lock. There is no box. And it is wide open to abuse \nand to raid.\n  There is not a penny that is reserved for Medicare under the \nPresident's budget. That happens to be the reality. He takes the whole \n$500 billion under his calculation of what is in the surplus and moves \nit to the so-called ``contingency fund'' and goes around the country on \nAir Force One, as he did in my State, and tells people who are \nconcerned about his cutting the agriculture budget to not worry about \nthat; the money is in the contingency fund.\n  Go to the contingency fund. Boy, are people going to be surprised \nwhen they go to the contingency fund and they find that there is \nnothing there because it is virtually all Medicare trust fund money. \nThere is supposed to be some money there. I don't know what the source \nof it is other than maybe he is going to raid the Social Security trust \nfund, too, because there is no money there.\n  Add up the President's budget. I will do it in a minute. There is no \nmoney there. We will get a chart that shows those numbers.\n  Let's look at what the Republican amendment says. I must credit and \ngive compliment to those who crafted the language on the other side. It \nis very attractive language.\n  Here is what it says. They say they have a lockbox for Medicare. But \nthen they have this clause which they call ``exception''.\n  ``Subparagraph A''--that is the language that gives protection--\n``shall not apply to Social Security reform legislation or Medicare \nreform legislation.''\n  Who can be against reform? I am certainly not. I have been an \nadvocate and have voted for reform--even sometimes unpopular \nlegislative proposals--because of the clear and compelling need for \nreform.\n  But when you write language such as this, it is a giant trapdoor \nbecause there is no definition of what constitutes ``reform.'' You can \ndo anything and call it reform and use the money. That is what is wrong \nwith the amendment on the other side. You could, under the cloak of \nreform, cut taxes. Under the cloak of reform, you could say with \nMedicare that we are going to take that money and pay for prescription \ndrug benefits. Some might call that reform. The problem with that is \nthat it is classic double counting. That is exactly how we will get in \ntrouble around here--if we first say money is attributed to the \nMedicare trust fund for the purposes of keeping the promises already \nmade, and then we take a part of it and use it for new promises.\n  That is a mistake. That will do nothing but create financial trouble \nfor this country. The trouble it will create is if money is diverted \nfrom the Social Security trust fund or the Medicare trust fund--that \nmoney which is currently reserved for paying down the publicly held \ndebt because it is not needed until a later point in time--it reduces \nthe amount of money available to pay down the publicly held debt. That \nmeans you pay down less debt. That means you have more of a hole to dig \nout of when the baby boomers start to retire.\n  I know the occupant of the chair disagrees with this analysis. He and \nI had a long conversation on the bus the other day.\n  I think it is undeniable that if you take money that is in the trust \nfunds of Medicare and Social Security and divert that money for any \nother purpose, you are reducing what is used to pay down publicly held \ndebt. I think it is undeniable. That has real economic consequences.\n  I want to go to the question of the President's budget because we \nhave heard over and over that there is this contingency fund. I am \nunable to locate the contingency fund as I add up the President's \nnumbers.\n\n  First of all, we have the $5.6 trillion projected surplus. Everybody \nagrees that is the projection. I think the first thing we should \nremember is that it is a forecast, and it may or may not come true. In \nfact, the forecasting agency itself has told us there is a 10-percent \nchance that number comes true; there is a 45-percent chance it is \nbigger; there is a 45-percent chance it is smaller.\n  There is also agreement on what follows. The Social Security trust \nfund is $2.6 trillion, according to the President's Office of \nManagement and Budget. The Medicare trust fund is $500 billion. If we \nset them aside, that leaves\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n$2.5 trillion. That is not what the President's budget does because it \nonly uses $2 trillion of the Social Security trust fund--he only \nreserves $2 trillion. The other $600 billion is left for, perhaps, \nprivatization. I have been told by people close to the administration \nthat is their intention.\n  As to the Medicare trust fund, they do not reserve it at all. But if \nwe were to reserve it, as most of us believe is important, it leaves us \nwith an available surplus of $2.5 trillion.\n  Then we look at the Bush tax cut, advertised at $1.6 trillion. Part \nof it has now been reestimated by the Joint Tax Committee for action in \nthe House, and those two parts that they reestimated increased by $126 \nbillion. So unless the President changes his proposal, the cost of his \ntax cut is now $1.7 trillion.\n  In addition to that, the President's proposal will have a dramatic \neffect on the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax \ntoday affects about 2 million taxpayers. The Joint Tax Committee has \nnow told us that if the Bush plan passes, it will affect, at the end of \nthe 10-year period, over 30 million taxpayers in the United States. \nOver 30 million taxpayers will be affected by the alternative minimum \ntax under the Bush proposal. And to fix it will cost $300 billion. This \nis not part of the President's plan, but it is made more necessary by \nthe President's plan. He provides no resources--none, zero--to deal \nwith it.\n  I do not believe, for one moment, that this Congress is going to \nallow over 30 million people to be caught up in the alternative minimum \ntax. But if we do not provide the resources to fix it, it will happen.\n  The third is the interest cost associated with the first two. That is \nanother $500 billion.\n  Then we have the Bush spending proposals, those proposals that are \nabove the so-called baseline of $200 billion. That adds up to $2.7 \ntrillion. And that is before any defense initiative the President might \napply or send as a suggestion.\n  The result is, we have a package here that simply does not add up. So \nI hope, I say to my colleagues, that before the end of the day we adopt \nthis amendment to protect both the Social Security trust fund and the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the education \nopportunity tax credit on behalf of myself as well as Senators Warner, \nCraig, and Allard. This is a measure that was introduced last Thursday, \nMarch 8.\n  What the education opportunity tax credit would do is increase the \namount and the quality of available academic services and technology-\nrelated resources for parents and for students.\n  This measure does several very good things. No. 1, it increases \neducation spending with greater parental involvement. No. 2, it is a \ntax cut for families. And, No. 3, it brings forth more funds available \nfor technology and specialized tutoring-type teaching.\n  I know the Presiding Officer and other Members of the Senate \nrecognize how important education is for our children and for the \nfuture of our Nation. It is essential for our children's futures \nbecause the best jobs will go to those who are the best prepared. The \neducation opportunity tax credit helps in that regard.\n  In education, good quality classrooms and good teachers, able to \nimpart knowledge to our children, are important. Academic standards and \naccountability and the measurement of those high academic standards in \nthe basics of English, math, science, social studies, and economics are \nall important, but also as important as teachers and administrators in \nthe education of our children are the parents; and parents need to be \nempowered. Their involvement is key for the academic success of their \nchildren.\n  Indeed, parents know their children's names. They know the specific \nneeds of their children much more than any bureaucracy in Washington, \nDC.\n  Finally, children need to have computer skills to be able to compete \nand succeed in the future. Computers and wiring in schools and access \nto the Internet in schools and in libraries is a good idea and is very \nimportant. Community centers are important.\n  Last week, the Republican Senate High-Tech Task Force visited an \nIntel clubhouse. It is working in conjunction with the Boys and Girls \nClub here in Washington, DC. There are many good ideas in these \ncommunity centers, but we need to make sure there are computers and \nsoftware programs and educational programs at home because homework is \ndone at home and on weekends.\n  This is what the education opportunity tax credit does. It provides \nfamilies with a $1,000-per-child education opportunity tax credit. It \nis capped at $1,000 per year per child, and capped at $2,000 per year \nper family if they have more than one child. It defrays the cost of \neducation-related expenses for computers and computer-related \naccessories and technology. Educational software, Internet access, and \ntutoring services could be expenditures that would thereby get the tax \ncredit. It does not apply to private school tuition. And as introduced, \nit is refundable.\n  This is a family-oriented education tax incentive that will have a \nvery real impact on the ability of parents to better afford education-\nrelated services and technology resources.\n  This is the financial situation of a family with an income of \n$38,900. That is the median family income in the United States.\n  After a family pays all the money in taxes to the Federal Government, \nthe State Government, the local government, and after they pay for \ntheir housing, their clothing, their food, their medical care, and \ntheir transportation--these are all absolutely essential for the \nsurvival of a family--the real disposable income gets down to about \n$2,100.\n  Now, educational expenses normally are going to be school supplies \nand a variety of other items that are important. But you realize, with \nthat amount of money, if you bought a computer, purchased a used \nprinter, software, and Internet access, that totals over $2,400. So the \namount that would be added to credit card debt would be $241 a year.\n  The reality is, once you pay your taxes to all levels of government, \nonce you pay for food and clothing and housing and putting gas in the \ncar, and a car payment, and all the rest, the average family has about \n$180 left a month for everything else. And the average cost of a \ncomputer is going to be about 70 percent of that.\n  You can have the statistics, but real people in the real world, folks \nsuch as Jim and June Meadows, support this proposal because it would \nhelp them afford specialized software for their daughter Morgan, who \nhas dyslexia, without sacrificing the education needs of their other \ndaughter, Meghan, who is age 10.\n  You do not have to go outside the beltway to find these working \nfolks. In fact, right here in the Capitol you will find people who are \nworking who recognize the value of this. In fact, Milton Salvadore, who \nI ran into in the Senate restaurant a few weeks ago, is such a working \nfamily man--he works, his wife works, and they have young children--I \nasked him: Do you all have a computer for your young school-aged \nchildren?\n  He said: No. No.\n  I said: Why not?\n  He said: Look, we have all these bills, and so forth. My wife and I \nare working hard, but we do not have enough money for that. We do not \nwant to go into debt to go get a computer and Internet access for our \nchildren. He said it would help him and his hard-working wife afford a \ncomputer for his family, if this education opportunity tax credit were \nin effect.\n\n  The tax impact on the average family of three with an adjusted gross \nincome of approximately $39,000 a year, if they took the full $1,000 \ntax credit for their children's education expenses, that would save \nnearly 34 percent on their yearly Federal tax bill. A family of four \nwith an income of $39,000 taking the full $2,000-per-family tax credit \nwould realize a savings of 95 percent on their taxes owed for the year.\n  If we are going to seriously address the digital divide--and the \ndigital divide is a divide in opportunities--we must act to provide \nfamilies and children with the financial means to take\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nadvantage of education opportunities. Closing the digital divide is \nimportant. The education opportunity tax credit provides the financial \nresources to achieve this goal by making the tax credit fully \nrefundable so that lower income families who owe the Government less \nmoney than the maximum available tax credit--say they owe $700--or if \nthey have no tax liability at all, would get the full credit. Everyone \nwould be able to take full advantage of this opportunity.\n  The digital divide is a function of many factors, including geography \nand educational levels of parents. Hence, the most salient and \ndeterminative factor is family income. According to numbers released in \nOctober of 2000 by the U.S. Department of Commerce--these figures are \nborne out by studies by Virginia Commonwealth University--we find that \nof the 92 percent of people who are computer owners, 29 percent have \nInternet access. So these figures do match in that regard with \nVirginia. If we look at households with less than $15,000 in annual \nincome, 12.7 percent of them have Internet access, which is pretty much \nequal to computer ownership. Families falling within the $15,000 to \n$24,000 per year range have a 21-percent rate of Internet access. \nFamilies with incomes of $75,000 per year or more have about a 77-\npercent Internet access rate.\n  These numbers show how this bill will help all people, but that the \nmain value will be to those of middle income and lower middle income \nwho will be able to purchase computers, Internet access, and \neducational computer software for their children. This is more than \njust a purely personalized education tax and parental involvement \ntechnology issue. This is about--the digital divide and making sure \npeople are getting a good education and access to technology so they \nare literate and capable. It is vital to the future of the United \nStates in a global economy. It is important for our domestic economy, \nand it is obviously important for individual families.\n  In maintaining our economic growth, the Department of Commerce \nestimates that information technology industries accounted for 30 \npercent of the country's total real economic growth between 1995 and \n1999. Between just 1997 and 1999, there were over 1.2 million new jobs. \nThe average wage of technology jobs in the Nation was $58,000 compared \nto $32,000 in the overall economy.\n  What we need to understand is, without a continued influx of \nqualified, competent workers, the growth in the technology industries \nwill stall and Americans, if not properly educated, will not be able to \nseize the opportunities. Whether it is in the Silicon Valley of \nCalifornia, the silicon Dominion of Virginia, or whether it is in \nIdaho, Pennsylvania, Florida, Iowa, or anywhere else, it is important \nthat our youngsters are getting a solid education.\n\n  The number of U.S. college graduates with high-tech degrees in the \ncountry is declining. Since 1990, the number of high-tech degrees has \ndropped by 2 percent. Undergraduate degrees in math have declined by 21 \npercent, computer science degrees have declined by 37 percent, and \nelectrical engineering degrees by 45 percent. Although, this wasn't the \ntrend we saw in Virginia in the 1990s. Actually, there was a big \nincrease of jobs and degrees--Virginia having the third fastest growth \nin technology jobs--however there was the same income differential \nbetween technology-related jobs and other forms of employment. The \nstudies from Virginia showed that the average technology job paid \n$66,000 a year versus $31,000 in the overall economy.\n  As a country, unless we better prepare all students, they will not be \nable to meet the high-tech job demand; the number of innovations and \nnew technology developments will decline, and businesses and jobs will \nmove offshore.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, it is time for us to act to \nmake sure we keep these well-paying jobs, these high-tech jobs, in \nAmerica for Americans.\n  There is broad-based support by Virginia voters for the education \nopportunity tax credit. This is not a conservative versus liberal, or \nDemocrat versus Republican, or men versus women type issue; it is a \ncommonsense, good for families, education spending and tax cut issue.\n  What we found in Virginia with this idea--and it did get pretty well \ndebated in the recent campaign--is that--and this was from polling--61 \npercent of liberals liked the idea; 69 percent of conservatives liked \nit, and moderates actually liked it the best, 71 percent. Men liked it \nat over 70 percent. It was supported by nearly 70 percent of women. It \ndidn't matter someone's race, where they lived, ideology or political \npersuasion, or if they were not involved in any organized political \nparty. It was very strongly supported by everyone in Virginia.\n  The people of Virginia recognize that it helps them with their own \nchildren. In fact, at the Flying J truckstop in Caroline County, I was \ngoing in to pay my bill, and the woman who was there taking my credit \ncard said: I like your education tax credit.\n  I said: That's great, ma'am. I am glad you know what is going on with \nthis measure. Do you like it?\n  She said: I am a tutor in Caroline County schools in mathematics.\n  It is a county with many people who cannot afford a tutor, and she \nsaw that those students who needed help in math and their families \ncould better afford her or other tutoring services so they could get up \nto speed in mathematics with the support of this tax credit. This is an \nidea that is appreciated by people in Virginia. As we work to make sure \nour fellow Senators know about this idea, they will realize it is \nsomething on which we will need to have to take action very soon, to \nmake sure our students have the highest quality and most appropriate \neducation possible.\n  We need to trust parents to be involved in their schools. They know \ntheir children's needs. They know their specific areas that will be of \ninterest and what will best benefit them. Through this substantial tax \nbenefit, all families will have access to a full spectrum of available \neducation opportunities and related technologies.\n  I hope my colleagues will look into this matter. The Education \nOpportunity Tax Credit Act will provide families with choice and \nopportunity. I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senator \nWarner of Virginia, Senator Craig of Idaho, and Senator Allard of \nColorado, as well as other Members, in making sure that we ensure the \npassage of the education opportunity tax credit to empower parents, to \nincrease education spending, and also to reduce taxes while providing \nmore technology capabilities to the children of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2172-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig).

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Hollings, is recognized for not to exceed 20 \nminutes to speak on the lockbox issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had a lockbox amendment at the desk, \nbut I am not calling it up at this time. In the limited time granted \nme, I want to support the Conrad amendment, which will be introduced \nlater, having to do with procedure. I didn't want to bring about any \nconfusion because I think the Conrad amendment is a sound one. I know \nthat the particular amendment I have at the desk was designed by the \nAdministrator of Social Security. It is a true lockbox.\n  But we have a more serious problem here. There isn't any question \nthat with the Concord Coalition coming out yesterday afternoon with a \njoint statement by Warren Rudman, Sam Nunn, Peter Peterson, Robert \nRubin, and Paul Volcker, we are just about ready to break the \ndiscipline with respect to paying down the debt. They strongly point \nout the reasons we should continue the discipline.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their particular summary be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Concord Coalition, Mar. 12, 2001]\n\n  Joint Statement by Warren Rudman, Sam Nunn, Peter Peterson, Robert \n                         Rubin and Paul Volcker\n\n       Washington.--Congress and the Bush administration face the \n     critical challenge this year of adopting a framework for \n     using near-term budget surpluses to help fill the huge long-\n     term gaps in federal entitlement programs and household \n     savings, and to best further our continued economic well \n     being. This is certainly a more welcome challenge than \n     eliminating budget deficits, but it is every bit as vital.\n       What are we concerned about?\n       We are concerned that the mere prospect of very large, but \n     highly uncertain, budget surpluses is being used as an excuse \n     to abandon fiscal discipline, creating the threat of renewed \n     non-Social Security deficits and failing to realize the full \n     opportunity of paying down the publicly held debt.\n       Then there is the fundamental long-term challenge, which \n     The Concord Coalition has always stressed, of setting aside \n     sufficient resources to meet the huge retirement and health \n     care costs associated with the coming ``senior boom.'' The \n     surpluses provide an opportunity to help meet this \n     challenge--but only if we are careful to preserve them.\n       The obvious question: How much should we be willing to \n     gamble on 10-year projections that the Congressional Budget \n     Office itself say could be off by trillions of dollars?\n       Answer: The Concord Coalition believes that it is unwise to \n     rely on these projections to commit ourselves to a series of \n     large escalating tax reductions over a 10-year period, \n     particularly in advance of addressing the huge and daunting \n     future deficits of Social Security and Medicare. Doing so \n     would be to rely on the unreliable while we ignore the \n     inevitable.\n       We believe that fiscal discipline is the key to providing \n     for the unmet needs of the future.\n       Savings from deficit reduction, and now surpluses, have \n     helped provide the capital to increase the productivity of \n     American workers--a major factor in the record growth of the \n     last 10 years. Further gains in productivity will become \n     especially urgent when the retirement of the huge baby boom \n     generation virtually halts the growth in the size of the U.S. \n     work force.\n       Continued debt reduction is the government's most direct \n     contribution to net national savings. Increasing national and \n     personal savings is the single most effective policy the \n     government can pursue to promote long-term economic growth \n     and retirement security. Budget proposals should be assessed \n     in that context.\n       As public debt is reduced to the low levels possible, other \n     policies such as retirement savings accounts also play an \n     important role. Household savings are nowhere near adequate \n     to prepare for ever-lengthening retirements.\n       We recommend that as Congress and the Bush administration \n     decide how best to deploy budget surpluses, they be guided by \n     the following framework:\n       Ensure the continued economic benefits of a stable fiscal \n     policy by maintaining discipline and avoiding both a spending \n     spree and large escalating tax cuts.\n       It is exceedingly unwise to lock in a large 10-year tax cut \n     based on unreliable long-term budget projections.\n       An immediate moderate tax cut is justified and reasonable \n     as a surplus dividend, given last year's surplus and in light \n     of near-term economic and budgetary prospects.\n       However, a back loaded 10-year tax cut is not the right \n     tool to provide short-term economic stimulus--particularly at \n     the expense of the urgent long-term need to fund our senior \n     entitlements and retirement savings needs.\n       Realize the full opportunity for paying down the public \n     debt to the low levels possible.\n       Establish a new set of firm, but realistic discretionary \n     spending caps.\n       Consider establishing a system of mandatory, individually \n     owned retirement accounts to help families build a more ample \n     nest egg while alleviating concerns that future budget \n     surpluses will result in either higher spending or in a large \n     build up of government-owned private sector financial assets.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The only objection I have to it--and I commend them for \ntheir leadership--is they say an immediate moderate tax cut is \njustified. You see, therein is the difference with this particular \nSenator and the ``wag.'' Surpluses, surpluses, surpluses--everywhere \nmen cry surpluses. But there is no surplus. Mind you me, I have been \nelected seven times to the Senate, and to paraphrase our wonderful \nleader, President Richard Nixon, I am not a nut. I believe in tax cuts, \ntoo--if you have some taxes to cut. So let's see where the taxes are to \ncut. They say the so-called surpluses belong to the people, but I find \nnothing but indebtedness belonging to the people.\n  For example, we have gone, in the past 20 years, from a creditor \nnation to the largest debtor nation in history--some $2 trillion. We \nactually have a current account deficit of $439 billion, or more, and \ngoing up. There is a deficit in the balance of trade up, up, and away, \nwhere we used to have a plus balance of trade. With respect to \nsurpluses, actually, we owe Social Security some $1.164 trillion \nMedicare accounts are $238 billion in the red. Military retirement is \n$156 billion in the red. Civilian retirement is $544 billion in the \nred. Unemployment compensation is $92 billion in the red.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this table of \nCongressional Budget Office figures be printed in the Record at this \nparticular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                      [By fiscal year, in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   2000    2001    2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security.................................   1,007   1,164   1,336\nMedicare\n  HI............................................     169     198     234\n  SMI...........................................      45      40      39\nMilitary Retirement.............................     149     156     164\nCivilian Retirement.............................     512     544     575\nUnemployment....................................      86      92      98\nHighway.........................................      31      31      30\nAirport.........................................      13      15      17\nRailroad Retirement.............................      25      26      27\nOther...........................................      72      74      77\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total.....................................   2,109   2,340   2,597\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This shows the total sum of all trust funds--not just \nSocial Security, but all the trust funds--including black lung, nuclear \nand otherwise. So the total amount that we now owe in Government \naccounts--since they want to split it--is $2.3 trillion.\n  Let me go right to that particular point: $2.3 trillion, as compared \nto the $3.4 trillion they call public debt. You see, that is where Mr. \nGreenspan and others start the monkey business of dividing the debt \nthat belongs to us all. We are the Government, and the public debt and \nthe Government debt, or the intergovernmental accounts, are all our \nindebtedness. It is $5.7 trillion. Now that Government debt has not \ngone down. We ended the last fiscal year $23 billion in debt. The \nnational debt went up some $23 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record page 20 of the \nTreasurer's report showing the difference in how it increased.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\n\n\n  TABLE 6.--MEANS OF FINANCING THE DEFICIT OR DISPOSTION OF SURPLUS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

Mr. President, we not only ended the fiscal year with a \n$23 billion deficit, but look at the debt to the penny, which I printed \njust a half hour ago from the U.S. Treasury Web site, and you will see \nthat we continue to run deficits. U.S. Treasury Secretary O'Neill, when \nI had him at the hearing, said, ``That is your paper, Senator.'' I \nsaid, ``No, this is your paper, Secretary O'Neill.'' The public debt \nnumbers found on-line show that the debt has increased from $5.674 \ntrillion at the end of September last year--at the beginning of this \nfiscal year, 2001--to $5.747 trillion. So the debt has gone up $73 \nbillion.\n  Let me emphasize the split in the debt. The Treasury Secretary says \nwho owes the public debt. He has the public debt held by the public, \nand he has another listing of intergovernmental holdings. In January, \nfor the years preceding--Mr. President, that used to be Government \ndebt. Now they are trying to change the phraseology so you are misled--\nintergovernmental holdings. That is an indebtedness. The public debt \nhas gone up $21 billion. Did you hear that? Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, is running around saying, ``My problem is we are \ngoing to pay down too much debt,'' when it has gone up in the beginning \nof the fiscal year some $21 billion. It is $3.4 trillion, going down \n$21 billion. Go down $100 billion, go down $200 billion, go down $300 \nbillion, $400 billion, and you still\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nhave $3 trillion to pay off. Don't worry about paying down too much \ndebt.\n  It was an absolute charade to see the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \ncome to the Congress with that nonsense about ``we have too much debt \nto pay down.'' I mean, we are paying down too much debt and we are \ngoing to have to pay a penalty on our fiscal holdings.\n  With respect to the intergovernmental holdings, or public debt, it is \n$52 billion. So as of this morning, a half hour ago, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury reports that the debt has gone up $73 billion. It is not \ngoing down. That is the problem with the Concord Coalition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these documents be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          THE DEBT TO THE PENNY\n                        [Updated March 12,

5,413,146,011,397.34\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what is happening? Well, we got on \ncourse. Reaganomics II. We know what Reaganomics I did. I notice my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, \ncalled it in the interviews over the weekend Kemp-Roth. He didn't want \nto hurt President Reagan's feelings. I don't either, but President \nReagan adopted this idea of ``starve the beast.'' All we have to do is \ncut the revenues. The money belongs to the people, and the people know \nhow best to spend their money, and we will have prosperity galore.\n  What happened? Well, President Lyndon Johnson last balanced the \nbudget. During 200 years of history, in the course of all the wars, we \nhad accumulated less than a trillion dollars in debt.\n  But when President Reagan came in with Reaganomics, that less than a \ntrillion dollars in debt went up to $4 trillion and is now up to $5.7 \ntrillion. What happens? I speak now to my colleagues because this is \nthe greatest waste. I served on the Grace Commission to abolish waste, \nfraud, and abuse. The greatest waste ever proposed or propounded in the \nhistory of Government is the interest costs, the carrying charges on \nthe national debt.\n  When President Johnson balanced the budget and for the 200 years of \nhistory, the interest cost on the debt was only $16 billion. Now it has \ngone up to $365 billion and is projected by CBO to go to $371 billion. \nThe first thing the Government did this morning at 8 o'clock was go \ndown to the bank, borrow $1 billion and add it to the debt. Tomorrow we \nare going to do the same thing. On Saturday do you think the banks are \nclosed? No. We are going to borrow another $1 billion on Saturday, and \non Sunday and on Christmas Day. Each and every day, we are going to \nborrow $1 billion for nothing--$365 billion.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer could buy all sorts of things \nwith this money. We could get an energy policy, a forestry policy, a \nresearch policy. We could pay for education. We could almost double \neverything that anybody wanted. This $365 billion amount is bigger than \nthe national defense. National defense is supposed to go from $305 \nbillion to $310 billion. We are paying out more just in carrying \ncharges, waste, and nobody seems to care.\n  The point is, when you are in a deficit and debt position, you cannot \ncut taxes without increasing taxes. That is exactly where we are. The \nso-called tax cut that President Bush is insisting upon is a tax cut \nthat wore no clothes.\n  He is running all around the country. Talk of a tax cut started back \nin September and October, when he was ascending in the polls. Then the \nmarket started to decline. In November, the distinguished Mr. Cheney \nsaid it looked like a recession. They insisted on the tax cut in \nDecember, January, and February. Can you imagine the President having \nto go out and sell a tax cut?\n  People ought to sober up on that particular point. Do you have to \nsell a tax cut? What is the market saying? The market is saying: Look, \nwith all this indebtedness, awash in debt, a devalued dollar, they are \nnot going to, by gosh, buy our instruments, our bonds, they are not \ngoing to continue to finance our debt, and they are going to have to \nraise the interest rates. That is exactly what happened in Reaganomics \nI, and we have Reaganomics II on course. There is no education in the \nsecond kick of a mule. We should all like the Concord Coalition: Pay \ndown the debt; enforce the discipline; quit running around bribing, if \nyou please, the people with their own money.\n  It is a sordid trick. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. \nResponsible Congressmen and Senators ought to tell the truth. We have \ngone bilingual when it comes to the budget. The second language is \ntruth. We are running around here saying surplus, surplus, surplus \neverywhere, and there is no surplus. Even the President says there is \nno surplus.\n  I hold in my hand President Bush's document that he just submitted. \nOn page 201, you can see the debt this year: $5.637 trillion. He \nprojects that the national debt will go to $7.159 trillion--not a \nsurplus. This is President Bush.

Mr. President, there it is. We have been engaged in the \nmost sordid activity one can possibly imagine with these 10-year \nbudgets. I remember when I was chairman of the Budget Committee in 1979 \nand 1980, we had a 1-year budget. The country sustained, survived, \nsucceeded 200 years of history on 1-year budgets. If you were a \nGovernor of a State and you submitted a 10-year budget, Moody's and \nStandard & Poor's would immediately lift your credit rating. But wait a \nminute, the best campaign finance trick is to use the Government's \nbudget to get ourselves reelected, running around and promising visions \nof sugarplums dancing in their heads: Give the money back; the people \nknow how to spend their money.\n  Of course, every morning we are borrowing $1 billion, and they say \ngive it back to the people, but we are increasing the debt and \nincreasing the waste. We run amok with these 10-year budgets, and we \nought to go back to 1-year budgets. Let's take the budget we passed in \nDecember, a few months ago, and debate all the cuts and vote on them.\n  With respect to the increase, we should have the pay-go rule. You \nhave to have an offset and withhold, not abolish. If President Bush and \nthis Government has a surplus by the end of this fiscal year, I will \nvote for President George W. Bush's tax cut. I will vote for it--I have \nto say that publicly--if we have a surplus. But as long as we continue \nto increase the debt, let's hold up and find out.\n  As much as I hate to, I think we might have to go with a capital \ngains tax cut, instead of an across-the-board tax cut, to really get \nthe market going. An across-the-board cut is not going to infuse \nconsumer confidence.\n  If the President came back here today--that is our problem. These \nPresidents continue to run for office, they continue to work at keeping \nthe job rather than doing the job. If he would only come back and tend \nto the real problems of the country and quit running all over the place \ntrying to sell a tax cut, I think the market would start back up. It is \nnot lack of consumer confidence in the economy, it is citizens' lack of \nconfidence in their Government. When they see us play this sordid game \nof 10-year budgets, calling deficits and debt surpluses and sending the \nmoney back with a childish cause that people are going out and spending \ntheir money best and that kind of nonsense, that is what is happening \nto the stock market. They can see we are going to an inflated economy, \nthe results we had from Reaganomics I. We are going to have Reaganomics \nII, and we are going to really be in economic trouble.\n  The ox is in the ditch. We have everyone running around talking about \nsurpluses and 10-year budgets where everybody is right and everybody is \nwrong. If we can just hold the line and get back to that 8-year record \nof paying down the debt and fiscal discipline, then the people will \nbegin to appreciate this Congress at the market level.\n  Right now, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves with this sordid game \nof again and again calling deficits and debt surpluses in order to buy \nthe people's vote. That is all we are doing. We will, with April 15, \nhave a large influx of revenues, and some debt will be paid down, but \nthey will never get to paying down $3.4 trillion in the Presiding \nOfficer's time and in my time.\n  Do not worry about paying down the public debt. Let us worry about \nthe increase of the overall national debt and go back to the Concord \nCoalition's recommendation of fiscal discipline.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are now proceeding on our debate and \ndiscussion on the bankruptcy bill that is pending. I do hope those who \nhave amendments and want to make statements on them will come down and \ntake advantage of this time. It is an opportunity to discuss the \nimportant questions that are before us.\n  As I have noted before, bankruptcy reform is, in fact, a second look \nat the 1978 bankruptcy law. That law reformed the way bankruptcy courts \ndeal with debt in America. We have had experience now for over 20 years \nwith\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nthat reform. We have seen how the law has been manipulated and abused, \nand it is perfectly appropriate for us to try to create a system that \nis honest and fair, eliminates abuses, and helps us make sure that what \nhappens in bankruptcy court is rational and defensible and furthers \ngood public policy.\n  That is what we are about. It is not legislation to fix all problems \ndealing with credit in America. It is what happens when a person files \nin bankruptcy. As the Members of this body know, we have in this \nlegislation a provision that says if you make above median income in \nAmerica, and a judge finds you are capable of paying back as much as 25 \npercent of your debts, and he calculates the current income and what \nyour debts are, if he determines that is possible, instead of wiping \nout all your debt, you may be moved from chapter 7--in which debt is \nwiped out in bankruptcy--to chapter 13, in which you would pay back, \nover a number of years, 25 percent of the debts you owe.\n  It is my view, and I think the view of a majority of Americans, that \nbankruptcy is a good thing. But if you can pay back your debts, you \nought to pay them; that we ought not say a person with a $100,000 \nincome, perfectly capable of paying back a substantial portion of his \ndebts, can just not pay them. In fact, some of these people, over a \nperiod of 3 to 5 years, can pay back all of their debts, we have \nlearned.\n  That is the change. I think well over half of the people who file \nbankruptcy, maybe three-fourths, maybe even more, will be below median \nincome, so they will not be affected by this means testing of \nbankruptcy. It is just those above median income based on family size \nand other criteria.\n  I believe we are doing the right thing. I believe it is the right \napproach, it is fair and just, and we ought to move in that direction.\n  We have also improved the system by eliminating quite a number of \nabuses by good lawyers. Some people put them down, but I cannot blame a \nlawyer for advising his client there is an opportunity to not pay \nsomething if they do not have to under the current bankruptcy law. They \nhave learned how to advise clients to take advantage of the current \nlaw. It is up to us now to fix that.\n  One of the aspects in the bill that I think is of great value is an \namendment I offered to encourage credit counseling. A lot of people do \nnot understand credit counseling. I, frankly, did not fully understand \nit until I spent virtually a day with a good credit counseling agency \nin Mobile, AL. They are off the main thoroughfare. They had a nice \narea. People came there to deal with their debts.\n  What they do is negotiate with the creditors of the people who come \nin to see them for counseling, and they will get them to reduce their \ninterest rates, get them to stretch out their payments, and they will \nhelp that family develop a budget by which they can pay off their \nexisting debts.\n\n  Not only do they get them on a budget, but they save marriages. That \nis because one of the highest causes of marital breakup is financial \ndiscord. They sit the whole family down--children, wife, husband--and \ngo over their income. They go over their expenditures, what they can \nreduce in their budget expenditures: Do they really need this cell \nphone? Do they really need the higher level cable TV? They knock it \ndown.\n  Then they get the creditors to see this family is in trouble. If you \nreduce your interest rate so that payment to the credit card company is \nreduced, the payment to the furniture store is reduced, the payment to \nthe brother-in-law is reduced, maybe the deficiency on rent is \nreduced--they work out a budget so the family can work themselves out \nof this.\n  The beauty of this is that for the first time, many of these families \nlearn how to manage money. Too often they have not been taught that in \nAmerica today. I think it is a very good thing. I believe that is \nhealthy. Some have complained that our amendment says before you go to \nbankruptcy, you should go to a credit counseling agency and at least \ndiscuss with them the possibility that you could work out a debt \nrepayment plan and come out better doing it that way rather than going \nstraight into bankruptcy without that option.\n  What is happening is there are lawyer mills in the country. You turn \non your television; you look at your little flier at the corner market \nthat shows what you buy and sell, automobiles, furniture and things, \nand you see advertisements by these lawyers about how to wipe out your \ndebts and avoid paying what you owe.\n  People respond. When they go down to the lawyer's office, essentially \nthe lawyer tells them--there is no mystery about this; I don't think I \nam misstating it--I believe you are entitled to bankruptcy. I believe \nyou can wipe out these debts. It is now January 1, so you will need to \npay me $1,000. What I want you to do is live off your credit card and \nall, but do not pay any of your other debts. Save up until you get the \n$1,000 and pay me, and I will file the bankruptcy. Then you can wipe \nout all your debts.\n  That is what they do, and they make money off that. I know an \ninstance where one of these lawyers does at least 1,000 of those cases \na year. That is $1 million in income in chapter 7, chapter 13, routine \nfilings. He doesn't even meet his clients. Basically his paralegals do \nthat and pretty much that is what goes on in America.\n  For people who need that, that is fine. For people who are not able, \nhopelessly in debt for various reasons, that is fine. But if they can \npay their way out of it, I think somebody ought to be concerned about \nhelping them figure a way to do so. They will feel better about paying \ntheir debt.\n  We don't need a legal system in America that suggests paying your \ndebt isn't important. What does that do for us on a moral basis--that \nwe have a legal bankruptcy system that suggests you have no \nresponsibility to pay your debt if you can pay those debts? I don't \nthink that is good public policy.\n  I suggest at least there be an opportunity for every bankrupt to \nconsider credit counseling. They are in virtually every community in \nAmerica. If they are not there, the bankruptcy judge can certify that \nand the person doesn't have to go to credit counseling. But if there is \na credit counselling agency, this bill would say to a bankrupt who is \nthinking about bankruptcy to go to them and talk to them. It is \nfundamentally an interview. They do not have to fill out forms or do \nanything at the credit counseling agency. They just have to certify \nthat they have been there and they have considered that option because \nit is not being provided to them in the lawyer's office. Trust me. I \nbelieve for a certain number they are going to conclude that credit \ncounseling--a matter they have never considered before--is better for \nthem than going into bankruptcy. And the family will be better for it, \nand the legal system will be better for it.\n  That is what we are about today. Many people are in debt for many \ndifferent reasons. Some say: Well, it is credit card debt.\n  Some college students are filing, but their numbers are not \nexceedingly high. The reason college students primarily are filing \nbankruptcy and the reason many of them are deeply in debt is paying for \ntheir tuition and fees--not on their credit card. It is their loan \npayment which has put them in debt very deeply. And at some point they \nend up running up credit card bills too, perhaps. But the biggest \namount of debt for college students is a student loan and the money on \nwhich they have to borrow to live. Whatever the reason, we are not \ncertain.\n  We know hospital bills are a big factor in tipping people into \nbankruptcy. That is a legitimate reason. We know many people are in \nbankruptcy because they have a compulsion to spend; one or more family \nmembers just cannot discipline themselves. I do not know if it is an \nillness or what it is, but they cannot discipline themselves and are \nunable to work their way out of adverse financial circumstances as \nother family members are able to do. Other family members every day in \nAmerica are sitting down and deciding when they can buy a new suit of \nclothes, or whether or not they can take a vacation this year, or \nwhether or not they can go on a school trip, or buy a new car. What are \nthey asking themselves? How can we pay the money we owe and buy \nsomething new? Maybe we can't afford to do both this year. Maybe we \nneed to pay down our debt.\n  We don't want to create a system that makes the honest, disciplined, \nfrugal family look like a chump or look\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\nlike they are silly by working hard to pay off unexpected debt and \nrewarding those who do not make the effort.\n  This is a fundamental question to me. This bill provides all the \nprotections for median income and below that are in the previous \nlegislation, and it provides other benefits also. It places women and \nchildren at the highest possible level of protection. They get the \nfirst money out of a bankruptcy estate today under the new legislation \ninstead of being seventh or eighth under the current bill in who gets \npaid from what is left in the bankruptcy.\n\n  It provides priority to pay alimony and child support in a way that \nwe have never done before. It provides many other good provisions that \nhelp our country socially and economically do the right thing.\n  We are excited about that possibility. Just because you move from \nchapter 7 to chapter 13, if you are above median income--in fact, it \nisn't all bad that you have been damaged dramatically.\n  I saw an article recently where someone was talking to a bankruptcy \nlawyer. He said one person he was talking to had a $70,000-a-year \nincome and wanted to rush out and file his bankruptcy bill under \ncurrent law because under the new law he might have to go into chapter \n13 and pay back some of his debts.\n  I ask you why a person who makes $70,000 a year shouldn't pay back \nsome of his debt. They say: Well, it is medical bills. Maybe it is an \nunexpected medical bill. If he is making $70,000, why didn't he have \ninsurance? If he is making below median income, or a low income, maybe \nI could be sympathetic because they didn't take out insurance. But if \nhe is making $70,000, he ought to be able to provide some medical \ninsurance. Maybe he shouldn't have such medical debts, No. 1. But, No. \n2, why should we take the view that if you are able to pay back to your \nhospital some of the costs of the service that hospital provided you, \nwhy shouldn't you pay them?\n  I visited 20 hospitals in Alabama this year. I have talked to \nadministrators, nurses, and doctors. They are in trouble. It is \ndifficult for hospitals to make a living. They have a factor of \nuncollected debt. They do not abuse people. But they are not being paid \na lot.\n  If a person cannot pay the hospital, and they are making below median \nincome in America, I don't want them to have to worry about it. Wipe \nout the debt and go forward under this bill. But if they are making \nabove median income and they owe the hospital $10,000 and over 5 years \nthey can pay them $2,500, why shouldn't they? They got a benefit from \nthe hospital. Somebody else is going to pay for it, if they don't. Who \nelse is going to pay it? People are going to be paying for it through \ntheir taxes and other payments, and they will be making below median \nincome. Why should a person who is honest and frugal making below \nmedian income pay for the hospital bill for somebody making $70,000 who \ncan pay a portion of his hospital bill? Answer that. That is not \njustice.\n  We have a bill that takes a step toward achieving justice. They say: \nWell, you are just out defending big corporations, banks, and these \ncollection agencies, and you are oppressing the poor. There is no \nchange for the poor. There is no change in this bill for the 75 or 80 \npercent of the people who file bankruptcy who already make below median \nincome. There is no change in that. It is only if you make above median \nincome that a judge can order you to pay some of your debt.\n  I think that is right. I don't apologize for that. I do not believe \nin this class warfare argument we are hearing time and time again that \nit is oppression of the poor. Those are the same arguments we have \nheard today. It seems that the hospital providing good care to an \nindividual and does not get paid for it is oppressing the person who is \nmaking above median income by asking them to pay for it; if a credit \ncard company has loaned money, or a bank has loaned money to somebody \nto go out and buy a house, buy a car, buy things a family needs, they \nare oppressing them by giving them the money and asking them to pay it \nback when the time comes to pay your debts back. Most Americans pay \ntheir debts. I think credit cards are great.\n\n  We have had serious complaints in this body--and rightly so--that \nbanks and credit companies are not fairly making credit available to \npoor people.\n  We have a bill called redlining that prohibits banks from opposing \nand refusing to allow people with marginal incomes to borrow money \nbecause they might think it is risky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Under the \nprevious order, 5 minutes was reserved for Senator Feinstein to begin \nat 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see Senator Feinstein is here. I will be glad to \nconclude.\n  Fundamentally, this bill is not unfair. I would be willing to look at \nany particular part of it. It has been pounded on for 4 years now. \nEvery jot and tittle of it has been looked at. We have tried to make \nsure it is fair in every way. But we do say you ought to seek credit \ncounseling. Maybe there is an alternative to bankruptcy.\n\n  We say, if you make above the median income, you can pay back some of \nyour debts. But if your debts are so big, even if you make above median \nincome, you do not have to pay them; you can wipe them out, and that is \nOK. And remember the great protection of bankruptcy for people in debt \nis they cannot be subject to harassing phone calls and letters, demands \nfor payment and lawsuits.\n  When you file bankruptcy, all lawsuits and demands for payment have \nto stop, whether you are in chapter 7 or chapter 13. A family can put \ntheir lives in order under the bankruptcy laws now and in this new bill \nin the same way that will allow them to have some stability in their \nlives, to bring a conclusion to their credit difficulties, to not be \nfighting lawsuits and credit demands that disrupt their lives.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 27, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment on the bankruptcy bill \nthat I have proposed is a very straightforward amendment. It simply \nsays credit card companies that issue credit cards to minors must limit \nthat debt to $2,500 a credit card, unless the minor demonstrates the \nmeans to pay back the debt, or a parent cosigns for the debt.\n  In addition, the amendment would entitle parents who cosign on their \nchild's credit card the opportunity to be consulted before the debt \nlimit on the card is increased.\n  The amendment is basically a compromise. I amended the amendment to \nplace a cap of $2,500 a card rather than $2,500 on all cards a minor \nmight have.\n  The reason for the amendment is a simple one. Student credit card \ndebt has increased 46 percent over the last 2 years alone. Bankruptcy \nfilings among youth have increased sevenfold since 1996. The problem \nis, there is no limit on the credit card debt a youngster can \naccumulate. This amendment would end that problem, give parents the \nresponsibility of choosing to cosign for their youngster if they want \nmore than a $2,500 cap, unless the youngster could demonstrate that \nthey had the source of income to support the debt.\n  So essentially what this amendment does is provide a credit card \nlimit of debt of $2,500 a card for a youngster who is under the age of \n21.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to each side.\n  Approximately 2 minutes remain in opposition to the Feinstein \namendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will confine my remarks to the other amendment we \nwill be voting on, unless someone else wants to respond to the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  At 11 o'clock, we will also be voting on the Kennedy amendment that \nattempts to remove the cap of $1 million on how much a bankrupt can \nprotect in their IRA account.\n  I know Senator Kennedy steadfastly opposed the homestead law under \nthe current bill and I agreed. We made substantial progress in \ncontaining the abuse of homestead that is unlimited in a few States. \nRight now, if you pour millions of dollars into a home, you can protect \nthat home, you can file bankruptcy, and not pay your debtors, and keep \nthe $2 million home. To me,\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nthat is not right, so I have supported that change. And we could not \nget as far as we wanted because a number of States have provisions in \ntheir constitutions that protect homesteads. We made a number of steps \nto curtail that abuse--real steps--but we did not go as far as I wished \nwe could have gone.\n  This is a very similar situation. Why should you not pay individual \ndebtors--why should you not pay your hospital debt and other debts and \nbe able to file bankruptcy and have $2 million in your IRA account? \nCan't a person live on $1 million at a 6-percent return a year? That is \n$60,000 a year the rest of your life without touching the principal.\n  So I think this is an abuse by rich people, really, to protect over \n$1 million in savings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Does the Senator wish to continue under the 2\\1/2\\ minutes in \nopposition to the----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think Senator Kennedy is here. He would wish to speak \non his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the first time in the history of \nbankruptcy, we will put at risk the retirement savings of workers. In \nthis instance, we do not have a limitation in terms of the retirement \nsavings under the 401(k) programs. There are virtually no limitations. \nBut there are limitations in terms of the IRAs.\n  The IRAs are the programs that are most used by working families. \nThey can only contribute $2,000 a year to an IRA. There was no history \nand no comments in the long testimony we took before the Judiciary \nCommittee that this was being abused, that people were putting money \ninto their IRAs in order to be able to circumvent bankruptcy. They \ncannot do it in the first place because they can only contribute $2,000 \na year. But there are many hundreds of thousands of workers in this \ncountry who are putting aside the $2,000 a year and hope to build up a \nsufficient nest egg that will augment their Social Security so they \nwill be able to live with some dignity. Now we are putting that money \nat risk.\n  In many instances, the people who are going into bankruptcy are going \ninto bankruptcy because their health insurance has failed or they do \nnot have health insurance. They go to the hospital for 4 days and they \nrun up these enormous bills.\n  What the current proposal before the Senate is saying is, OK, that is \ngoing to be too bad. We are going to suck up the 25 years of payments \ninto retirement programs for working families.\n  We say, we do not do it for the 401(k) programs, which are the \nretirement programs for the more wealthy and affluent. We should not do \nit for the IRAs. Starting now, at $1 million, it will just continue to \ncome down. And we are putting these savings at risk. It does not belong \nin this bill. I hope my amendment will eliminate it. I think it is the \nproper way to proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Kennedy. I know we worked hard on this \nbill to gain his support. Basically, the language that is in the bill \nnow has been modified to deal with a number of the concerns he raised.\n  The Department of Justice, under the Clinton administration, said:\n\n       A debtor should not be able to shield abundant resources \n     from creditors, including Federal, State, and local \n     governments, in the form of retirement savings.\n\n  What is ``abundant resources''? We say, over $1 million. I do not \nthink that is too much to allow somebody to keep when they are not \npaying their debts.\n  From the Securities and Exchange Commission:\n\n       We have seen insider traders, who do their trading through \n     IRAs, and fraud participants stash their profits in IRAs. The \n     State law exemptions have not defeated our Federal statutory \n     claims to date, but a new Federal exemption--\n\n  Which we could be doing here--\n\n     could do so. I am concerned about the grave potential for \n     abuse that the exemption for all retirement assets from \n     bankruptcy estate poses.\n\n  We have asked--and the Senator from Massachusetts and others voted \nfor an amendment I sponsored--to limit homesteads to $100,000 as the \namount you could put in your homestead and not pay your debtors. Yet \nthere is an objection for some reason to saying you can't maintain more \nthan $1 million in your IRA and not pay your debts.\n  This is a reasonable cap. It will not hurt people. It will allow them \nto have an income of $60,000 or more per year to live on without even \ntouching their principal under this IRA plan. It will, as the \nSecurities Commission says, avoid the dangers of fraud and just the \nunfairness of not paying your local businesses, not paying your local \nhospital, not paying your local neighbors what you owe and living high \non the hog with multimillions of dollars, perhaps, stuffed in an IRA \nplan.\n  That is why we are in disagreement on this bill.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 27, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I move to table both the Kennedy and \nFeinstein amendments. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). It is not in order to move to \ntable both amendments at this time. The Senator may move to table the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I move to table the Feinstein amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I seek recognition as in morning business \nto address the Senate in reference to the state of the economy. I think \nmost of us have read the press reports about what happened to the stock \nmarket yesterday. We certainly hope that was an anomaly and that it \nwill not continue and that our economy rebounds quickly from what \napparently has gone beyond a soft landing and is now headed toward what \nappears to be a harder landing.\n  The news out of my home State of Illinois is not encouraging. This \nmorning, Motorola announced it is cutting 7,000 more jobs in its \ncellular phone division, increasing to 12,000 the number it will have \neliminated in operations since December. These reductions to its global \nworkforce of more than 130,000 will take place over the next two \nquarters.\n  We have seen this phenomenon not just at Motorola but at other \nindustries across America. It raises a very important question about \nour responsibility in Washington to respond to what is clearly an \neconomic challenge, if not more.\n  I hope we in the Senate, as well as the House, working with the \nPresident, can take the current debate over a tax cut and make it part \nof a much larger question about economic growth in America. What is our \nplan? What are we, as a nation, prepared to do to turn around this \neconomy and to start it moving forward again?\n  We have just come off an extraordinary period of time when the \neconomy of the United States reached record-breaking prosperity \nnumbers, where we had some 22 million jobs created over the last 10 \nyears. Some 2 million more businesses were created over the last 10 \nyears, with more home ownership than any time in our history, with \ninflation under control, the welfare rolls coming down, and the number \nof violent crimes committed across America decreasing. All of the \npositive things we want to see in America occurred during the last 8 or \n10 years.\n  But we seem to have taken a turn in the road. I am sorry to report \nthat these numbers coming out of Motorola, and employers across \nAmerica, as well as the Dow Jones index, and other stock indices, \nsuggest to us we need to step back for a second and ask, What is right \nfor this country?\n  The economic prosperity we knew for so long has now been challenged. \nThe feeling of optimism in America, which really had us in its thrall \nfor such a long period of time, is now changing dramatically. We have \nseen $5 trillion of economic value that has been wiped out in the last \nfew months because of this economic downturn. When I say $5 trillion \nwiped out, what am I talking about? I am talking about the pension \nplans, the 401(k)s, the IRAs, the savings, the mutual funds of families \nacross America have all taken a plunge. My family has experienced this \njust as every other family.\n  We know our value, our net worth in terms of what we have saved and \nwhat we hope to have for our future, has been diminished. The question, \nobviously, before us is, What are we going to do in response.\n  I think the President has focused almost exclusively on one idea, and \nthat idea is a tax cut. The general idea of a tax cut is popular. It is \nhard to think of two words that a politician can utter that would be \nmore popular. But, clearly, the President is having a tough time \nclosing the deal. To think that a President has to go out on a \nnationwide rally, crusade, campaign, to convince the American people of \na tax cut suggests that it may not be as easy as it appears to him.\n\n  People across America are skeptical of a tax cut that is based on \nprojections of surpluses that may not occur for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 \nyears. They understand this idea of a tax cut was actually part of the \nPresident's campaign platform 2 years ago when America was in \nprosperity. This tax cut was not designed by President Bush as an \neconomic stimulus then. Our economy had plenty of stimulation. It was \ndoing well. But now the President has said: What I really meant to say \nis that the tax cut will breathe life back into the economy.\n  Hold the phone here. Take a look at the tax cut President Bush is \nproposing. Even if he has his way and gets everything he wants, the tax \ncut will not kick in to our economy in full force for 5 years. I can \ntell you that the employees at Motorola can't wait 5 years. The people \nacross America who have seen their savings dwindle can't wait 5 years. \nSo the medicine which President Bush is prescribing does not fit the \nillness that currently affects America.\n  Frankly, what we need at this point is a tax cut that is reasonable, \nthat will create some stimulus, but is not too large as to really be \nirresponsible. The President has said $1.6 trillion over 10 years is \nnot that much in a $5.6 trillion surplus. We know frankly, his number \nis much larger when you add in all the hidden costs. He wants to spend \nsome $2.6 trillion on his tax cut.\n  It is unfortunate but true that 43 percent of President Bush's tax \ncut goes to people making over $300,000 a year. Forty-three percent of \nthe benefits go to people making over $300,000 a year.\n  I believe everyone in America should have a tax cut, but for \ngoodness' sake, do not shortchange families in middle-income categories \nand working families to give a bigger tax cut to the wealthiest among \nus. We have to look at this tax cut in terms of fairness and the fact \nthat it could be an economic stimulus.\n  On the Democratic side, we believe we should have an honest tax cut \nthat we can afford. We should not overextend ourselves in anticipation \nof surpluses that may not arrive. How can we have day after day of bad \nnews about the state of the economy, and the economists in this town \nnot take that into consideration? If we are having more people laid \noff, that means fewer people paying their taxes into the Treasury \ncreating surpluses.\n  So this anticipation by the President of a great surplus, \nunfortunately, may not occur, as many economists have predicted.\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n  President Bush, as Governor of Texas, faced this situation once \nbefore. When he became Governor of Texas, he had a surplus in his \nTreasury. He declared a tax cut that, unfortunately, was too large and \nnow the State of Texas is back in the deficit ditch, with other States \nseeing the same thing happening.\n  Why can't we learn from this experience on a national level and not \noverextend this surplus, not overextend this tax cut, to find ourselves \nreturning to the days of deficits? I think that is the challenge for \nthis Congress.\n  Equally important, we have to take the tax cut as part of a larger \ndiscussion. What is it that we can do responsibly now to create \neconomic growth again in America? To ignore what is happening with the \nlayoffs and the situation in the stock market and the loss of savings \nby American families is to ignore reality.\n  To take the President's tax cut that will not kick in for 5 years, \nthat is no stimulus to the current economy.\n  It is time we looked at things that can make a difference.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. One of the problems I have had during the past 6 months or \nso is that we have heard from the man running for President, and now \nPresident, always bad news about the economy, always something negative \nabout the economy. There are some economists and others who say that \none of the reasons keeping the stock market high is optimism. As we \nknow, the prior administration was very optimistic about the economy. \nDoes the Senator think that the negative talk about the economy for \nsuch a long period of time has finally gotten the wish granted?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I heard the observation of the Senator from Nevada \nyesterday along these same lines. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. \nFor the leader of our country to repeatedly say that our economy is in \ntrouble is to, frankly, have a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this \nsituation I am afraid people lose confidence if the leader of our \ncountry doesn't have confidence. Some of the campaign rhetoric should \nhave been abandoned as soon as the President took office. The spirit of \noptimism and growth, a positive feeling about the future is important \nfor American families to feel they can do the right thing by perhaps \nbuying a new home or putting an addition on their home, perhaps buying \na car, whatever it might be that makes a difference in terms of \neconomic growth. The Senator from Nevada is right.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask one more question, I spoke to the American \nLegion today. Prior to my going to the rostrum to speak, their national \nsecurity director gave a long speech about the need for increased \nspending on the military and national missile defense. When I spoke \nabout a number of issues, I said: All of you out there have to \nunderstand that we should have a tax cut, but it should be a modest tax \ncut. I have heard the Senator from Illinois say that. I think we all \nagree with that. We also have to pay down the debt. If we are going to \nhave additional spending for the military and we want a prescription \ndrug benefit for seniors, if we want to increase spending for \neducation, does the Senator agree we are going to have to save some of \nthat surplus for some of these things that our country badly needs?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. What the President \nhas said to America is--he arrived initially to find a good, strong \neconomy and a big buffet of opportunities--let's eat our dessert first. \nYou don't have to eat your vegetables; eat your dessert first. Let's \nhave a tax cut and a big one.\n  A lot of us are saying: Isn't it better for America to have a \nsensibly sized tax cut that helps working families and middle-income \nfamilies and not just the wealthy and one that also pays off our \nnational debt and leaves money aside for important investments in our \nfuture? If we are going to have a plan for economic growth in America, \nthe Senator from Nevada will agree with me that education ought to be \nthe first item on the agenda.\n  The American people, interestingly enough, when you ask them what we \nshould do with the surplus, do not say: Give me a tax cut. Their first \nresponse is: Do something to help our schools and our teachers.\n  When you look at these priorities and investments that can mean \neconomic growth for a long period of time, we ought to start with \neducation. As the Senator from Nevada says, if the President has his \nway, if the tax cut is too large, if it goes to the wealthiest people \namong us and doesn't help working families, we will squander the \nopportunity to invest in education, to invest in a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare, to invest in Social Security and Medicare for \nthe future. The American people understand that. If it sounds too good \nto be true, as the old saying goes, it probably is.\n\n  For the President to suggest we can have it all, we can give this tax \ncut of $2.6 trillion and take care of all of our other problems, really \nstrains the credibility of his position.\n  Mr. REID. One last question: In the western part of the United \nStates--and it is coming back here--there is the high cost of \npurchasing electricity in the home. I have received a number of very \nsad letters--for lack of a better description--from people who are \nsenior citizens saying: I have to have electricity in my home. I am now \nhaving to make the choice not only whether I am going to have food or a \nprescription drug but electricity.\n  With the one-third that we are suggesting should be saved for taking \ncare of some important programs in this country, would the Senator \nagree that one of the most important priorities, second only to \neducation, would be a prescription drug benefit for the senior citizens \nof this country who certainly deserve a change in the Medicare program?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. The President's \nsuggestion when it comes to prescription drugs is entirely inadequate. \nOnce you have funded his tax cut, you don't have the resources \navailable to create a universally affordable voluntary prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare, a position which the Senator from Nevada \nand I share. In fact, let me read from an article in the New Yorker \nwhich appeared March 12, 2001, by Henrik Hertzberg in which he \ndescribes President Bush's prescription drug plan as follows: When the \nPresident said that no senior in America should have to choose between \nbuying food and buying prescriptions, he received quite a bit of \napplause at his State of the Union Address. But he omitted the details. \nFor example, under President Bush's prescription drug plan, a widow \nliving on as little as $15,000 a year would receive no help in paying \nfor drugs until she has already spent $6,000 of her own money. That is, \nshe would have to have already left more than a third of her income at \nthe pharmacy to qualify for President Bush's prescription drug plan.\n  To put it another way: Her deductible for the President's \nprescription drug plan, this lady living on a fixed income, would be \n$115 per week, not per year.\n  That is what happens when you take a $2 trillion tax cut and ignore \neducation, ignore prescription drugs. You can have something that is \ncalled a prescription drug benefit, but when you look at the details, \nis it reasonable that someone who is making $15,000 a year--imagine \nscraping by on that amount--who is a fixed-income senior, has to spend \ndown $6,000 each year on their own pharmacy costs before the benefit \nhelps them?\n  I can tell the Senator from Nevada, who has spoken to a lot of \nseniors in his part of the world, that sort of approach is no benefit, \nand it isn't to most of the people to whom I have spoken in the State \nof Illinois.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the national debt. The national debt \nis an important issue for us not to ignore. The President says out of \nthe $5.6 trillion surplus, we can only spend down or pay down $2 \ntrillion of the national debt. I disagree. Much more can be spent down \nand should be. We collect $1 billion in taxes every single day in \nAmerica; $1 billion from families, businesses, and individuals to pay \ninterest on the old debt. We have a national mortgage of $5.7 trillion. \nMost of it did not occur until after 1980, when President Reagan and \nthe former President Bush came to office.\n  Under President Clinton, we started paying down this debt, but it is \nstill a $5.7 trillion national mortgage. If we\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\ndon't take this seriously, we are going to find ourselves in a \npredicament where that is a mortgage we are going to leave our kids. I \ntake no comfort in promising a tax cut to myself or anyone else and \nthen leaving my son, my daughters, or my grandson a national mortgage \nof $5.7 trillion.\n  The President likes to say if we have a surplus in Washington, it \nbelongs to the people. Well, I ask the President: To whom does the \nnational debt belong? That belongs to our Nation as well. Do we not \nhave a responsibility in good times of surplus to pay off the mortgage \nbefore we tell everybody go ahead and eat your dessert, go ahead and \ndeclare a dividend?\n  What the Democratic side is suggesting, as the Senator from Nevada \nhas said, is take a third of any real surplus, not any guess, and give \nit to people in the form of a tax cut that helps everybody across the \nboard, not just the wealthy; take a third of it and pay down the \nnational debt so this mortgage is reduced for our kids. And then take a \nthird and invest in things that will get this country moving again: \neducation, worker training, investments in technology. These are things \nwhich are good in the long term for America.\n  Sadly, this President is stuck on a one-note song: Tax cut, tax cut, \ntax cut.\n  The tax cut is not a plan for economic growth. It is not a plan for \neconomic prosperity. The President proposed this tax cut in the \ncampaign after he was challenged by Steve Forbes to come up with a \nmassive tax cut. Well, he came up with one. He is still sticking with \nthat song 2 years later.\n  America has changed. Our needs have changed. The President's response \nis still the same. If he has his wish and this tax cut goes through, we \nwill find ourselves realizing its benefits 5 years from now, not when \nwe need it. And we will find ourselves short on funds to invest in \nthings important for America, and we won't put the money necessary into \npaying down our national debt.\n\n  This is not a popular thing I am preaching here. The most popular \nthing is to tell people we can give the biggest tax cut in the world \nand we are all for it. I guess you can get reelected on that platform. \nBut part of our responsibility on Capitol Hill is to speak honestly to \nthe people about the real problems facing our Nation.\n  The real problems suggest that the President's tax cut goes too far. \nIt is ironic to me that this President is traveling around the country, \ngoing to South Dakota and North Dakota, trying to sell this concept and \nhaving a tough go of it, because although Americans like tax cuts, they \nare genuinely skeptical when the President tells us we can have \neverything.\n  The fact is that we need to use the same fiscal responsibility, we \nneed to use the same fiscal conservatism that finally turned the corner \na few years ago and got us out of the deficit world and into the \nsurplus world. When you look at the state of our current economy, we \nneed it now more than ever.\n  I hope we can find a bipartisan agreement for a tax cut that is \nsensible. I look at families across Illinois, and I don't believe that \ntwo people, husband and wife, who are public school teachers in the \ncity of Chicago, making about $100,000 a year, are wealthy people at \nall. I think they are struggling to pay their mortgage, to put kids \nthrough school, to make sure they put savings aside for the future. \nThese people need to benefit from the tax cut as much as, if not more \nthan, people making over $300,000 a year.\n  I believe if you have an income of $25,000 a month, the idea of a \nPresident Bush tax cut that gives you $46,000 a year in tax cuts is \nsomething these people will hardly even notice, if they are making \n$300,000 a year. But I can tell you that several thousand dollars to a \nfamily making $100,000, or $75,000, or $50,000 a year can make a real \ndifference.\n  The President's tax cut, incidentally, leaves 30 million Americans \nbehind--30 million Americans who pay no income tax. The President says, \nwhy should they get a tax cut? These 30 million Americans are paying \npayroll taxes, my friends. I don't think the President would like to \nlook them in the eye and say they are not paying taxes. They are paying \na lot of taxes. It is coming out of their paychecks.\n  The President's tax cut provides no income tax benefit or other tax \ncredit to help those wage earners. So let's come up with a balanced and \nfair tax cut, in a way to get the economy moving again. Let's not get \nstuck on the old rhetoric of the political campaign of 2 years ago. \nLet's have a vision that speaks honestly to the people and puts \ntogether investments and things that make a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how ironic it is that we hear about the \nnegativism of the President toward the economy. And then, in turn, we \nhear all of this negative comment about the new President. It just \ndoesn't quite add up.\n  I can stand here and talk about the Clinton recession we might be in \nbecause the manufacturing index turned down in September and has been \nturning down since. I could talk about the Clinton recession from the \nstandpoint of the confidence index, which started turning down in \nAugust. But I don't think blaming gets much accomplished.\n  I think we have to look to the future, and the future is that we can \npay down the national debt. We have a tax surplus. We can give tax \nrelief to every taxpayer--the working men and women who have made a big \ndifference, the entrepreneurs who have made a big difference over the \nlast 10 years to help us pay down the national debt. We can fund our \npriorities.\n  When we use the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan economist, \nto judge what the future is--and it is a difficult thing to do, but it \nis no more difficult than the young workers who are trying to look \nahead to see what their income is going to be and convince the banker \nthat they ought to get a 30-year mortgage. They put a lot of trust in \nthe future in order to pay off that mortgage. We put a lot of trust in \nthe future, too, to make a determination of how much income we are \ngoing to have coming in over the next 10 years. We determined that that \nis about $28 billion, $29 billion. Out of that, we will have a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus. Out of that $5.6 trillion surplus, we are going to \ntake $3.1 trillion off because of trust funds--Social Security: Save \nSocial Security income just for Social Security, Medicare money just \nfor Medicare. And then we have money for a $1.6 trillion tax cut. Every \nAmerican who pays income tax will get a tax cut. Every American who is \nat a $35,000 income--a family of four--will have a 100-percent tax \nreduction. A family of four at $50,000 will have a 50-percent tax \nreduction. Six million people who are now paying taxes won't pay any \ntaxes after this program is passed.\n\n  When we are all done passing this legislation, the wealthy, the \nhigher income people of America, will actually be paying a higher share \nof the total income tax money coming into the Federal Treasury than \nbefore under present law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator made a point that I think has to be \nemphasized because you hear a lot of comments that this is a ``tax \nbreak for the rich'' or this is ``benefiting the wealthy.'' But the \nSenator said something that is probably the most important point of \nthis entire debate about fairness. That is, if you look at all the \ntaxes being paid and who pays them before the tax cut, and look at all \nthe taxes being paid and who pays them after the tax cut, what he said \nis vitally important for people to understand. Would the Senator repeat \nwhat happens to the tax burden?\n  This tax burden was set back in 1993 when we in the Senate raised the \ntop tax bracket and President Clinton signed the bill that shifted the \ntax burden to higher income individuals, creating another rate at the \ntop and, at the same time, increasing the top income tax credit which \ngoes to people who don't pay income tax. So we raised taxes on people \nin higher income brackets and took that money and gave it to people who \ndon't pay income taxes. At that point, Democrats said the distribution \nof taxes between the wealthy and lower income was now fair. What the \nSenator is saying is we are going to now take this fair distribution \nand change it. How are we going to change it?\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. When we are all done passing the proposal the President \nhas put before Congress, we will actually have the high-income people \nof America paying a higher percentage of the income tax coming into the \nFederal Treasury than right now.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So when the Democrats, in 1993, said, ``We have now \nfixed the Tax Code; we have now changed it so higher income individuals \nare going to pay more of their fair share''--I think that was the \nterm--and that ``we have a fair Tax Code''--I heard that over and over \nagain--what the Senator is suggesting is that we are going to make it \neven fairer by shifting the burden even more, and the argument on the \nother side is that isn't fair enough. Their argument is that we need to \nincrease taxes even more on higher income individuals.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. Let me tell you why we don't hear that from the \nother side. They talk about tax cuts, but they don't have a passion for \ntax cuts. They talk about reducing the national debt, but they don't \nhave a passion for reducing the national debt. What they have a passion \nfor is muddying the waters, maintaining the status quo, keeping the \nhigh level of taxation we have today, so that when we have 20.6 percent \nof the gross national product coming into the Federal Treasury in taxes \ntoday, at the highest level in the history of the country--if we \nmaintain the status quo, in 10 years it will be at 22.7 percent. They \nare going to be able to spend that. They have a passion for spending. \nThat is why they do not like this program that gives every working man \nand woman in America, every taxpayer in America who pays income taxes, \na tax cut, and it has a larger share of tax cuts for lower and middle-\nincome people than for higher income people.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator for his clarification.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we will have $28 trillion coming into \nthe Federal Treasury over the next 10 years. We are taking $3.1 \ntrillion of that off the table for Social Security. Social Security \nmoney will only be spent on Social Security, and Medicare money will \nonly be spent on Medicare.\n\n  We have the $1.6 trillion tax cut because Americans are overtaxed. We \nare going to give tax relief to every taxpayer.\n  We have $900 billion left over. That is a rainy day fund. When they \nraise questions, as they have just now, on the other side of the \naisle--Will we be able to afford it? Will we have the money for \nprescription drugs for seniors in America?--we will have a plan that \nwill give universal coverage to seniors in America. It will be \naffordable, and we will improve Medicare so that Medicare fits the \npractice of medicine today. When it was passed in 1965, the practice of \nmedicine was to put everybody in the hospital. Today, the practice of \nmedicine is to keep people out of the hospital.\n  Obviously, prescription drugs are a big part of why not so many \npeople are going the expensive route of hospitalization.\n  I hope it is clear that this is well thought out, and we will be able \nto do the things we have said we would do. If we do nothing and that \nmoney is in the pockets of Congressmen and Senators in Washington, it \nis surely burning a hole, and if it is burning a hole, it has to be \nspent.\n  If we keep up the level of spending that recent remarks indicate we \nought to, at 6 percent growth each of the last 3 years, and continue \nthat for 10 years instead of a $1.6 trillion tax relief, we will not \nonly eat up the $1.6 trillion, we will eat up a half trillion dollars \nmore. Then we get that level of expenditure up to where we are now at \n20.6 percent of gross national product, and we see a downturn in the \neconomy about which these nervous nellies are concerned.\n  The income is going to go down but the expenditures never go down. We \ndo not operate as a business in the sense of when there is a change of \nincome, we change our spending behavior.\n  That is what needs to be considered by everybody. By having a surplus \nof only 5.6 percent of the $28 trillion coming in over the next 10 \nyears, a little bit less than one-third is going to go to the \ntaxpayers, some of it is for a rainy day, and the rest of it is to keep \nour commitment to Social Security and Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statements \nthat have been made by my friend from Iowa, as well as the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I think the Senator from Iowa realizes the honest \nmeasurement of the size of the Federal Government is the proportion of \nthe gross domestic product--the total value of goods and services in \nAmerica--against the amount we spend in the Federal Government.\n  When President Bush's father left office, we were spending 22 percent \nof our gross domestic product on the Federal Government. During the \nClinton years, that was reduced to 18 percent. We have seen a steady \ndecline in the size of Government against the size of America's \neconomy.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Is this a trend which we should criticize? \nI think not. It is a good trend. We have shown we can be more \nefficient, but when the Senator from Iowa stands before us and supports \nplans, as I do, for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, that \nwill be more Federal spending. He and I will support that. We believe \nthe seniors and disabled across America are entitled to it.\n  We have to make sure we reserve enough money, in terms of what our \nplans are for tax cuts and deficits and debt reduction, so we can still \nmake investments to make sure there is a prescription drug benefit \nunder Medicare.\n  Let me add another point. The Senator from Iowa understands as well \nas anyone that we are going to face a balloon payment in Social \nSecurity and Medicare when the baby boomers all show up. If we do not \nmake plans right now to protect Medicare and Social Security, we will \nfind ourselves without the resources to take care of these people. We \nmade a promise that throughout their working lives, if they paid into \nSocial Security and Medicare, it would be there when they needed it. We \nare not providing for that with President Bush's tax cut. In fact, in \norder to fund his tax cut, he has to reach into the Medicare trust fund \nand take out money. If you take the money out of this trust fund, it \nwill not be there when the baby boomers show up. The balloon payment \nwill be there.\n  We will have to pay it to keep our contract with the American people, \nand the President's tax cut and his strategy will have eaten up the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  Senator Conrad of North Dakota is going to offer an amendment to \nprotect the Medicare trust fund, and Members on both sides of the aisle \nwill have a chance to stand up and say: We are not going to raid the \nMedicare trust fund to pay for President Bush's tax cut. I am anxious \nto see how that vote comes out.\n  If Members of Congress believe as strongly as I do about protecting \nMedicare and Social Security, then they should vote in favor of Senator \nConrad's amendment, which will be offered this afternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. One of the points the Senator from Illinois made during his \ninitial statement was that he believes it is time we had a bipartisan \nagreement on the budget and on taxes generally.\n  I heard the Senator say--and I am commenting on the comment my friend \nfrom Iowa, the chairman of the very important Finance Committee, made--\nwe are talking negatively. I say to my friend from Iowa, the Senator \nfrom Nevada and the Senator from Illinois are talking about the \neconomy. We are talking about the need to do something about it.\n\n  If we, with a 50-50 Senate, butt heads here, we are going to get \nnothing done.\n  Will the Senator elaborate a little bit on one of his initial \nstatements that we need to work on a bipartisan agreement to come up \nwith something that is good for the American people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator understands President Bush was elected \npromising he was going to change the tone in Washington--more civil and \nmore bipartisan. I actually thought he got off to a good start. He \ninvited Democratic Congressmen and Senators to the White House. They \nhad a good time. They watched movies, he gave them all nicknames, and \nit looked as if it was going to be a great change in atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n  In the last week or two, things have not improved. They have gone the \nother way: The decision in the House of Representatives by the \nRepublican leadership on the tax cut vote they would not even allow \namendments from Democrats or Republicans on the floor. They allowed one \nsubstitute vote. Their hearings in the Ways and Means Committee did not \nallow any bipartisan exchange.\n  Frankly, I do not think that is in keeping with the President's \npromise of more bipartisanship. It is going to occur over here. There \nwill be a real debate on taxes in the Senate. Senator Grassley, as \nchairman of the Finance Committee, is going to provide an opportunity \nfor amendments and discussion in his committee. We will have a chance \nto offer amendments on the floor, and a 50-50 Senate finally will \ndebate this bill.\n  The last week has not been promising. The decision of the President \nto go to the home State of the minority leader, Tom Daschle, was an \ninteresting choice. I do not think it was the best political decision \nfor a President preaching bipartisanship, but it was his decision. I \nhope we can return to his promise of bipartisanship.\n  I guess the Senator from Nevada heard the comment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania a few minutes ago about the decision in 1993 by the \nClinton administration to put together a package to do something about \nour deficits. That package, which passed in the House and the Senate, \ndid not have a single Republican in support of it. Many of the \nRepublicans who are saying President Bush's tax cut is the best \nmedicine for America also voted against President Clinton's plan in \n1993.\n  That plan turned it around. We got out of the deficit mentality and \ndeficit experience and started creating surpluses.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania talked earlier about the unfair tax \nburden. I will read from the same New Yorker article I quoted earlier \nabout that tax plan in 1993:\n\n       From 1992, the year before a supposedly onerous new \n     marginal tax rate kicked in, through 1998, the most recent \n     figure for which the IRS has information available, the \n     average after-tax income of the richest 1 percent in America \n     rose from $400,000 to just under $600,000--\n\n  That is in a 6-year period of time.\n\n     and from 12.2 percent of the national net income to 15.7 \n     percent.\n\n  Our friends on the Republican side do not want to acknowledge that we \nnot only put a plan in place that ended the deficits in this country \nbut also created income, wealth, and prosperity, the likes of which we \nhave not seen in modern history. Now comes President Bush saying I want \nto return to the concept that I tried in Texas, where I started with a \nsurplus, put in a tax cut, and ended up with a deficit.\n\n  Excuse me if many Members of the Senate are skeptical of that \napproach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2184-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes for closing remarks on amendment No. 29, as modified, and \namendment No. 32 to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 29, as modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my amendment is designed to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund. It has been \ncalled the Medicare-Social Security lockbox. That is a good \ndescription. It is designed to try to prevent these trust funds from \nbeing used for other purposes, from being used as we saw in the past \nfor spending on other programs.\n  A quick description of what my amendment provides is the following:\n  First, it protects Social Security surpluses in each and every year;\n  Second, it takes the Medicare Part A trust fund off budget just as we \nhave taken the Social Security trust fund off budget, again to try to \nprotect it from being raided and used for other purposes;\n  Third, it gives Medicare the same protections as Social Security;\n  Fourth, it provides strong enforcement legislation and strong \nenforcement provisions to make certain that protections hold.\n  The alternative--the legislation that will be offered by my \ncolleague, the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee--does not take Medicare off budget. It contains huge \ntrapdoors for anything labeled ``Social Security and Medicare reform.''\n  In other words, they have a lockbox that leaks. They have a lockbox \nwhere the door is wide open. The money can be used for other purposes \nas long as they call it Social Security or Medicare reform. There is \nabsolutely no definition of what constitutes Social Security or \nMedicare reform.\n  The proposal of my colleague does not add any new protections for \nSocial Security and does not protect Medicare from sequester. This \nconstitutes what I call the broken safe. The door is wide open to what \nmy colleague from New Mexico is presenting.\n  Under the President's budget, not a penny is reserved for Medicare. \nIn fact, the President takes the Medicare trust fund and puts it into a \nso-called contingency fund available for other purposes. In fact, as we \nhave already heard, he went to my State and told folks there that if \nthey need money for agriculture, go to the contingency fund. If people \nneed money for defense, they are being told to go to the contingency \nfund. If they need more money for education, go to the contingency \nfund. If they need money for a prescription drug benefit that really \ndelivers something, go to the contingency fund. That money is going to \nbe spent four or five times over.\n  Some on the other side say: Look, there is no trust fund surplus in \nMedicare.\n  That is not what the Congressional Budget Office says. On page 9 of \nthe ``Budget Outlook,'' under the table ``Trust Fund Surpluses,'' they \nstart with Social Security. Then they go to Medicare. And they point \nout that Part A of Medicare has over a $400 billion surplus. They point \nto Medicare Part B. And that is in rough balance over the 10 years of \nthis forecast period.\n  Some on the other side say: Oh, there is a huge deficit in Medicare \nPart B; therefore, we should not worry about the surplus in Medicare \nPart A. I just say to them, the law does not say that. The actuaries do \nnot say that. Medicare Part A is in surplus. Medicare Part B is in \nrough balance. There is no justification for taking the Medicare trust \nfund that is in surplus and moving that money into this so-called \ncontingency fund that is available for other spending. That is \nprecisely what will get us into financial trouble in the future.\n  I hope my colleagues will support having a protection mechanism for \nboth the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund. It \nmakes sense for the country, it makes sense for taxpayers, and it makes \nsense for beneficiaries. Most of all, it makes fiscal sense. And that \nis what my amendment is all about: to wall off the Social Security \ntrust fund and the Medicare trust fund so they cannot be raided for \nother purposes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me say I am very pleased this afternoon to \nbe on the floor with Senator Conrad. I think those who watch the Senate \nas it conducts business are probably, in the next 3 weeks, going to see \na lot of us because we will have the whole budget up here for at least \na week. Senator Conrad manages it for the other side of the aisle, and \nI manage it on this side.\n  I am very hopeful that, while this is a very interesting and somewhat \ndifficult issue today, we will handle it in a very civil manner between \nthe two of us as to what we ought to do.\n  First of all, everybody should know that when we offered a lockbox on \nSocial Security on this side--it is the only one you could really call \na lockbox--the other side of the aisle opposed it because it was too \nrigid. And\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\nthey found out from the Secretary of the Treasury it may have been even \ntoo difficult for the U.S. Government to manage in terms of managing \nits debts.\n  So we have come from that point to what we generally call a lockbox \nhere, to make any expenditures from that fund that are not authorized \nin that law itself subject to a 60-vote point of order. That generally \nis called a lockbox because it will call it to the attention of those \naffected, and it will require a supermajority to vote for it. That is \nwhat our amendment does for both Social Security and Medicare. But what \nit does in both programs is exactly what the House did. It passed by \nover 400 votes. Essentially, it says only for Social Security and/or \nSocial Security reforms. And on Medicare it says Medicare Part A and/or \nreforms.\n  My distinguished friend on the other side of the aisle would say we \ntake Medicare off budget. We no longer get to count it as an asset of \nthe budget. And in addition, it cannot be used for the reforms that are \ngoing to be necessary when we improve that program and add to it \nprescription drugs.\n\n  So the difference is big. As a matter of fact, it is as if my friend \non the other side of the aisle had concocted an approach so we cannot \nget a tax cut because, for some reason, the $1.6 trillion tax cut just \nis not within the grasp of those on the other side. They do not want to \ngive that back to the American people. In a moment, or in closing \narguments, I will share with you the fact that it is a very responsible \ntax cut. It is very small in proportion to the total tax take of the \nUnited States of America.\n  But for now let me just, again, discuss these two issues.\n  First, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Kent Conrad, my opponent here \nwould take Medicare off budget and not permit it to be used for reform \nand say to us, use it to pay down the debt. I want to just take a \nminute to talk about the debt because everybody ought to understand.\n  The President of the United States has asked us to reduce the debt of \nthe United States from $3.2 trillion to $1.2 trillion--a $2 trillion \nreduction. The President says--as did President Clinton before him who \nalso said, through his experts--that is all we can pay down without \npaying a big penalty and costing the American taxpayers money.\n  This little chart I have here shows what is going to happen to the \nownership of American debt as we buy down the debt and attempt to \nminimize it. You can see, the red is all foreign investment and \nforeigners. That grows because they do not want to sell the American \nbonds. They hold on to them. I understand that if we said, you are \ngoing to pay those people anyway, even though they do not want to \nsell--they are under an arrangement they like in terms of the terms of \nthe bonds--then what we would have to do is we would have to pay a \npremium that would cost the American people a 21-percent premium on the \nmoney we pay to them to buy down the bonds. We will pay a 21-percent \npremium.\n  Isn't it amazing that we are being asked to vote for an amendment \nthat, on the one hand, is calculated to prevent us from getting a tax \nreduction for the American people, and, on the other hand, \nunintentionally, I assume, we are going to have to pay that money at a \n21-percent premium to foreign countries and foreigners from whom we are \ngoing to buy these bonds because we are going to say to them: If you \ndon't want to sell them, we want you to sell them anyway. It is similar \nto a marketplace gun you put there and say: Sell them to us. And, of \ncourse, we will throw away money in the process.\n  The amendment that will be voted on second is their lockbox and its \noperation. It is a lockbox for which everybody in this Senate has \nvoted. It requires a 60-vote majority to use any of the Social Security \ntrust fund for anything but Social Security or Social Security reform. \nIt is the same lockbox on Medicare that we voted for heretofore on a \nnumber of occasions that says, Medicare cannot be used--I say to the \nFinance Committee chairman, who is bound by all these rules--for \nanything other than Medicare and/or Medicare reform.\n  I note the presence of the chairman of the Finance Committee. I note \nmy friend, who is on the other side of the aisle on this issue, is a \nmember of the Finance Committee. They have a very important job. They \nare going to have to decide whether they want to reform Medicare.\n  As a matter of fact, it is most interesting, for those who are \ninterested in this debate, we had not had a formal Medicare reform put \nforth by the former President for 8 years. We have not had one put \nforth by the other side of the aisle, except in the Breaux-Frist \namendment or bill which came out of a commission. We still do not have \none from the other side of the aisle. I do not know why.\n\n  I am very hopeful the Finance Committee will, indeed, produce a \nbipartisan Medicare reform proposal--under the Domenici amendment, \nwhich is the second amendment, that can be done--because without \nreforms, the Medicare trust fund is doomed. There will not be enough \nmoney for the senior citizens.\n  As the chart demonstrates, by 2010, the spending exceeds the income; \nby 2018, the spending exceeds the income plus interest; and by 2026, \nthe trust fund is depleted.\n  We already have heard testimony from experts that our tax reduction \nof $1.6 trillion does not have anything to do with that. What has to do \nwith that is that you must reform the Medicare system in order to get \nyour job done.\n  I close by saying, I think the Medicare trust fund should be used for \nMedicare reform. I do not think it should be used to pay huge premiums \nto foreign countries and foreigners by trying to coerce them to buy the \ndebt.\n  My last observation is, Medicare is a very mixed program. Part of it \nis paid out of the trust fund until there is no money. Then what will \nwe do? And part of it, a big part of it, including doctors, home health \ncare, and a long list of items, is paid for under Part B, which is the \ngeneral taxpayer.\n  How would you split them apart and take one and put it off budget, to \nbe used for debt service, and the whole other one just left there to be \npaid by the taxpayer?\n  I believe reform should include a process that would envision both of \nthose problem areas and reform them, to the future benefit of our \nsenior citizens.\n  I have great admiration for my friend on the other side, but I do \nthink on this one, it is subject to a point of order and we ought to \nlet it die. We ought to vote on the second one and approve it because \nthe House did it, and it could become law because it would be the same \nas theirs. It is a very good way to attempt to save Medicare for \nnothing other than Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me respond briefly and then we will \nhave a chance to hear from the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Senator Domenici said Democrats voted against a lockbox last year. \nThat is only part of the story. Democrats voted for the lockbox that \npassed on a bipartisan basis. We voted against one version of the \nlockbox that threatened, according to the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe ability of Congress to pay the national debt. Yes, we voted against \nthe lockbox provision that threatened the good credit of the United \nStates, but we supported the lockbox that protected Social Security and \nMedicare that passed on a bipartisan basis.\n  Second, the Senator says the House passed, by a huge margin, the \nlockbox he is offering. The House was not permitted to consider an \nalternative. This alternative, the one I am offering that passed the \nSenate last year, is far stronger.\n  Third, the Senator says we would take the Medicare Part A trust fund \noff budget. That is exactly right. We would treat it the same way we \ntreat the Social Security trust fund to give it the full protection it \ndeserves.\n  Finally, the Senator says we threaten Medicare reform and the ability \nto write a prescription drug benefit. That is not the case. My \namendment creates a point of order against legislation that makes the \ntrust fund less solvent, not more solvent. Medicare reform is intended \nto make Medicare more solvent, not less solvent. In addition, new \nspending for a drug benefit would not reduce the Part A surplus and, \ntherefore, would not be subject to any point of order under my \namendment.\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n  This measure is not meant to defeat a tax cut or any other measure. \nIt is designed to protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \nThis is what we voted for on a bipartisan basis last year. I hope we \nwill do the same this year and say, whatever else we do, we are not \ngoing to raid the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes of the time \nremaining.\n  Senator Conrad's amendment is very bad medicine for our seniors, in \nterms of this fuzzying up the issue. If we allow this to happen, we are \ngoing to perpetuate the hoax that Medicare is running a surplus so that \nwe can postpone urgently needed improvements in Medicare.\n  The Senator's amendment also leads Americans into believing we can't \nprovide tax relief for hard-working families and at the same time \nprotect Medicare and Social Security. The Senator is just plain wrong \nbecause over the next 10 years we will be spending $3.8 trillion just \non Medicare. That is more than two times the size of any proposed tax \ncut. To say that we on this side of the aisle are shortchanging seniors \nis ludicrous. In fact, the Senator's amendment would shortchange \nMedicare patients by splitting Medicare in half and leaving Part B of \nthe program, including prescription drugs, unprotected.\n  In 1993, Congress voted to tax up to 85 percent of Social Security \nbenefits and transfer those taxes into the Part A trust fund. In 1997, \nCongress voted to transfer the cost of home health out of Part A trust \nfund into Part B. Had these two actions not occurred, there would be no \nsurplus in Part A. Medicare Part B will run a deficit of more than $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years, completely offsetting the $400 billion \nsurplus in Part A. Splitting Medicare in half would only further these \naccounting gimmicks and mislead seniors into believing Medicare is \nsecure. Of course, we know that is not the case.\n  We think it is time to be very open with our seniors about Medicare's \nfinancial condition. We have the opportunity this year to modernize \nMedicare, provide prescription drug coverage, and put the program on a \nsound footing for our seniors, particularly for baby boomers. We want \nto protect the Medicare surplus so it can be used for this purpose, and \nthis purpose only.\n  Senator Conrad's amendment will deprive seniors of what they need \nmost, a stronger, updated Medicare program, by locking away the \nMedicare dollars and making them unavailable for much-needed \nimprovements. Is this what our seniors want? I don't think so. They \nwant something for future generations.\n  This lockbox approach has one additional problem: When you add it to \nthe additional one-third of the on-budget surplus the amendment would \nthen reserve for debt reduction, it would equal $3.8 trillion. That \nexceeds the total amount of publicly held debt by $700 billion, and it \nexceeds the amount of debt available to be repaid by $1.5 trillion. As \na result, the Government will be forced to invest the excess surplus in \nthe private sector.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has warned that such investments \ncould disrupt financial markets and reduce the efficiency of our \neconomy. My colleague from New Mexico has said that very well and \ndemonstrated it with the chart.\n  Moreover, it is important to remember that the Senate has already \nvoted 99-0 in the year 1999 against allowing the Government to invest \nthe Social Security surplus in the private sector.\n  I oppose the amendment by the Senator from North Dakota and support \nSenator Domenici's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield time to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the points made by \nour good friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nas well as by Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  However, the long and short of it is, the amendment offered by \nSenator Conrad is very simple. It is probably the only responsible \nthing to do. Essentially it says Social Security trust fund money is to \nbe kept for Social Security. We are going to keep it in the trust fund \nso the trust fund continues to build. It also says that the Medicare \nPart A trust fund money is to be kept in that trust fund to be used as \nit is supposed to be used.\n  To be honest, we hear lots of arguments on the other side, but, \nfrankly, they sound like Senators doing the administration's bidding by \ntrying to desperately grab shoestring kinds of arguments to try to \ncounter this amendment. If we look at all the arguments, they are \ntransparently false.\n  No. 1, we are playing footloose with senior citizens because it would \nmake it sound as if the Medicare Part A trust fund is in good shape. \nThe fallacy of that is, if we rob Peter to pay Paul, if we rob Part A \nto pay for Part B, it is going to make the Medicare problem more \nurgent. I don't think any senior wants that.\n  Second, we hear: Those Democrats don't want to reduce taxes. That is \na patently false argument. We are just saying protect Social Security, \nprotect Medicare, because that is what our seniors expect, and that is \nwhat the baby boomers certainly expect when they retire on down the \nroad.\n  Third, we hear the argument, gee, if this amendment passes, you are \ngoing to have to pay a 21-percent premium on foreign debt. That is \ntotally false. Nobody knows where those figures come from, except I \nhear them from my good friend from New Mexico.\n  It is true that if this amendment were to be enacted, as it very much \nshould, then earlier, rather than later, we could be facing the \nquestion of debt retirement and what debt would be involved and what \nnot. But there are other options. We can use the money for other forms \nof savings--that is savings provisions outside Social Security or \nMedicare. Or if we come to the premium question on redeeming debt, we \nwill cross that bridge when we get there. Nobody knows what the premium \nis. There is a debt rescheduling going on currently. We are buying back \ndebt, and it is working.\n\n  My main point is that this is a very simple amendment. It is the most \nresponsible thing to do because it starts to protect Social Security \nand Medicare for senior citizens and for the future.\n  I might add, Mr. President, the alternative amendment we are going to \nbe asked to vote on has, as I think the Senator from North Dakota \ncharacterized it, a trapdoor. It is a ``nothing'' amendment. It doesn't \ndo what it purports to do. If you want honesty in budgeting and in \namendments, honesty in what provisions actually say, I ask you to look \nat the language of the amendment offered by the Senator from North \nDakota and look at the language of the alternative. You will very \nclearly see, if you read the language, one does protect Social Security \nand Medicare, the other does not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to my colleague \nfrom Iowa who said a series of things that are just not so. He said \nthis amendment is bad medicine for seniors. Come on. This amendment \nprotects the Social Security trust fund, and it protects the Medicare \ntrust fund. It prevents them from being looted and raided for other \npurposes. That helps seniors.\n  He says it suggests there is a trust fund surplus in Medicare. It \ndoesn't just suggest it; there is one. This is from the Congressional \nBudget Office. It says very clearly there is $400 billion in surpluses. \nThe President's budget says $500 billion in the Medicare trust fund.\n  The Senator from Iowa says you can't have a tax cut with this \namendment. Nonsense. You can have a tax cut with this amendment. This \nonly says don't raid Social Security, don't raid Medicare. The only way \nit endangers a tax cut is if their intention is to raid Social Security \nand Medicare to pay for one.\n  Now, finally, Senator Grassley has the plan I have talked about being \nall mixed up. He has taken the $2.9 trillion dedicated for reduction of \nthe publicly held debt and he added that to the $900 billion that is \nreserved for strengthening Social Security for the long term and says \nall of that money is designed\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nto deal with short-term debt. Wrong. That is just wrong. The $2.9 \ntrillion is to eliminate our short-term debt. The $900 billion is to \ndeal with long-term debt. Unfortunately, they have not set aside any \nmoney to deal with long-term debt.\n  This amendment is simple. It is designed to protect the trust funds \nof Social Security and Medicare against raids for other purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Medicare trust fund should \nbe used for Medicare and Medicare reform. I don't think we should use \nit to fund, in any way, a requirement that we pay huge premiums--some \nestimate as high as 21 percent--to attract foreign investors to retire \nour debt.\n  I yield whatever time I have to Senator Frist.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to sustain the point of order \nagainst the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota for three \nreasons. No. 1, our trust funds need to be strengthened by combining \nthe hospital trust fund with the physician trust funds. That is \nMedicare. You need physicians and hospitals. The real question is, What \ndo we do with the surplus on the hospital side? Medicare has a deficit. \nI think we should not tell taxpayers we are going to take that money \nand use it to pay down the debt. We ought to reassure them that we can \ntake that money forward and use it to modernize Medicare, strengthen \nit, eliminate the redtape, and install tools in our Medicare system \nthat explain and get rid of the fact that an aspirin may cost $2. That \nmakes our seniors mad.\n  Third, and last, every nickel that the taxpayer pays today will go \nfor Medicare, will be used for Medicare. The President has said it. The \nunderlying amendment by the Senator from New Mexico also will guarantee \nthat every nickel paid in will be used for Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 minute 41 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the argument of my colleague from New \nMexico that somehow we are going to be paying big premiums to foreign \ndebtholders has nothing to do with my provision here. My provision \nprotects the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare against raids \nfor other purposes. If you save the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds in that way, there is no cash buildup problem until the year \n2010--2010.\n  If the issues the Senator from New Mexico addresses become a problem, \nwe have a lot of time to deal with it. You can save every penny of \nthese trust funds and not have any of the problems he talked about, at \nleast until the year 2010. Many of us believe we will never have them.\n  Mr. President, what is this amendment about? It is very simple: It \nsays we are going to provide the same protection to the Medicare trust \nfund that we provide the Social Security trust fund. It says we are \ngoing to provide additional protection to the Social Security trust \nfund so that this Congress can't go back to the bad old days of raiding \nevery trust fund in sight to pay for other purposes. That is what we \nused to do. We have stopped that practice. Let's make certain it \ndoesn't start again. Let's protect the trust funds of Social Security \nand Medicare. It is the fiscally responsible thing to do.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to \nwaive the applicable sections of the act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also raise a point of order that the \npending Sessions amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That point of order will be recognized when \nthat amendment comes up. First, the Senate will vote on the motion to \nwaive.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 22 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). On this vote, the yeas are 53, the \nnays are 47. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 32\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make a point of order on the Conrad amendment.\n  On the next amendment, does the Senator from North Dakota want to \nraise a point of order?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \nSessions amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the senator from New Mexico raise a point \nof order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the point of order been ruled on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has not been ruled on. The \nSenator from New Mexico has raised a point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes; he has. The point of order is that the Conrad \namendment violates the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota, the Senator from New Mexico has raised a point of order that it \nviolates the Congressional Budget Act. Since this is a matter of \njurisdiction of the Senate Budget Committee, the point of order raised \nby the Senator from New Mexico is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber? We \ncan't hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: Didn't the Senator from New Mexico \nhave to have raised a point of order against my amendment before the \namendment was voted on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment was not voted on. The Senate \nvoted on a motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is it in order at this point for me to \nraise a point of order against the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order is now timely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I raise a point of order that the pending Sessions \namendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to waive that pursuant to the appropriate \nprovisions of the law and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Sessions amendment No. 32. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 23 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are \n48.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The Chair will now rule on \nthe point of order.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is correct in moving to \nreconsider.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will now rule on the point of order. \nThe amendment of the Senator from Alabama would add a new point of \norder to the Budget Act. Since this is a matter within the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Budget Committee, the point of order is sustained and the \namendment falls.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just so we understand the order of things \nhere, as I understand it, my friend from Utah has a brief statement he \nwants to make, and then my colleague and friend from New York has a \nrequest to make, and then I would ask unanimous consent, at the \nconclusion of both of these, the statement and request, that the \nSenator from Connecticut be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to put my name in the queue after the Senator from Connecticut has \noffered an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah raise an objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do raise objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation and suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah raise an objection \nto the original request which would have the Senator from Connecticut \nfollowing the two statements?\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Chair tell me the original request?\n  Reserving the right to object, what is the original request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The original request was that the Senator from \nConnecticut be recognized to offer an amendment following a statement \nby the Senator from Utah and a request by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. HATCH. Repeat the request one more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has requested \nthat following the statement of the Senator from Utah and a request by \nthe Senator from New York, he be recognized to offer an amendment. Is \nthere objection to the request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the offer of the Senator from New York an offer to make \na statement only, or does the Senator want to call up an amendment?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What I would like to do is get a time. I was assured, \nwhen I brought this amendment up last time, that we would get a vote on \nit. The regular order is still our amendment. We departed from it to do \nmany other things. I want to get that assurance before the cloture vote \ntomorrow, that I get a set time when we can do that, which Senator \nGrassley assured me of, as I can read here in the Record.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me object for now until Mr. Gramm, the \nSenator from Texas, arrives on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would say to the Senator, I have no problem waiting \nuntil we touch base with Senator Gramm. I want to make as part of this \norder that I would then be allowed to take the floor and renew my \nrequest.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why don't we ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nmake a statement as if in morning business and then the distinguished \nSenator may make his statement until the distinguished Senator from \nTexas gets here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is he on his way?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand, he will be here in 5 minutes or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I am not going to object to \nmy friend from Utah making a statement under normal comity in this \nbody. If I could have the attention of the Senator from Utah for a \nmoment, I am obviously not going to object to his making a statement, \nnor would he object to my doing the same. I keep reading statements \nfrom some of the leadership that we should hurry up this bill so that \nwe would be allowed to vote. The Senator from New York had his \namendment here on Thursday of last week and hasn't been able to get a \nvote. We began the bankruptcy bill and it was pulled down at the \nrequest of the Republican leadership to bring up ergonomics. I hope \nthat the Republican leadership will allow us to start having some votes \non some of these amendments and not just wait until such time as we \nhave a cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, does the Senator want me to yield for a \nquestion? I just want to make a statement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. So long as I don't lose my right to the floor after he \nfinishes his 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend, the distinguished Chair. I am mostly \ninterested in getting in the queue to offer an amendment with Senator \nSmith. I would like to yield to Senator Boxer for a moment because I \nknow her time is short. She has consulted with us on this amendment. I \nwould like to yield to her for a quick moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I just ask what the order is. Is there an amendment \npending? Is Senator Wyden's amendment pending?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is asking me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises that a series of amendments \nhave been offered. All have been set aside. There are 24 seconds \nremaining on the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to be in the queue here on an \namendment on which I have worked with Senator Smith, and Senator Boxer \nwould like to make a quick comment. I will yield back. I thank the \nSenator from Utah for his courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oregon has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand we are going to go to Senator \nSchumer, and after the distinguished Senator from New York, the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was going to offer an amendment. I \ngraciously yielded to a couple of things happening here. I am happy to \nyield to people to make statements unrelated to the bill, but I want to \nbe protected. I would like to ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of these remarks, I be allowed to offer an amendment.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I don't have a problem \nwith that, except that I want to make sure that before we get to that, \nI get to make my request.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a brief statement on \nthe subject matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, \nalong with Senator Leahy, there is no question that there are \namendments that should be voted upon. However, the distinguished \nSenator from New York is in a little different category because when he \nallowed his amendment to be taken down, the manager of the bill at the \ntime, the chairman of the Finance Committee, someone who has worked on \nthis bill for so long, this bankruptcy bill, Senator Grassley of Iowa, \nsaid he would allow a vote on Senator Schumer's amendment. He said he \ndidn't know when it would be, but there would be a guaranteed vote on \nthat.\n  So I want to make sure the Senator from New York--everybody realizes \nhe is in a little different category than everyone else, even though \nthere are many other votes that should take place. There is no question \nbut that the Senator from New York has been guaranteed and assured \nthere would be a vote on his amendment. That is why he agreed last week \nto take it down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me just \nsay this. Let me make this statement: As I understand it, we are \nwaiting for the distinguished Senator from Texas to get here because he \nhas an amendment, I believe, to the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from New York. And then I will put in a quorum call and we will \nget this resolved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New York be permitted to call up his amendment, that there is \nexpected to be an amendment to his amendment by Senator Gramm, and I \nask unanimous consent Senator Gramm be permitted to do that, and that \nwe then go to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I am not here to try to \nhold up the business. I want to make sure that since my amendment--I \ndon't think we have to move to it because of the pending business. I \nwant to make sure we get a time agreement as to when we are going to \nvote on my amendment.\n  That is all I want. But I will not relinquish the floor or allow any \namendment to be offered until we get a time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah allow me to make a brief \nstatement?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. REID. I do not want him to lose the floor. I say to my friend \nfrom Utah, my friend from Vermont, and my friend from New York, I do \nnot know where we got into the idea that we are going to have an \namendment offered to Senator Schumer's amendment. I have the \nCongressional Record of March 8, 2001. Senator Grassley said:\n\n       The point is we can assure the Senator from New York the \n     yeas and nays on his amendment, not someone else's amendment. \n     We can't assure the Senator from New York when we are going \n     to vote on this amendment, but there is going to be a vote on \n     the amendment.\n\n  My only point is, how can we now change this to say we are going to \nbe voting on a Gramm amendment? The Senator from New York was assured a \nvote on his amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reclaiming the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor. The \npending matter is the unanimous consent request of the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What I want to do--I see the Senator from Texas has come \nto the floor--is ask a question. Does the Senator from Texas have a \nsecond-degree amendment to my amendment which is the pending amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut be permitted to proceed with his \namendment with a half hour time limit equally divided, and that \nimmediately after the vote on his amendment, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York be given the floor on his amendment.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Just to clarify how the amendment will be handled, will the \nSenator from Utah make it 45 minutes equally divided with no second \ndegrees? Will the Senator add that element to it?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Utah has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object. That is it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so everybody understands where we are, the \nSenator from New York brought up an amendment on Thursday. He was \npromised on the Record by the manager of the bill that he would get a \nvote. The Senator from New York is within his rights to ask for that \nvote.\n  It seems to me to be a concern that everybody is holding things up so \nwe cannot have votes. Is there any reason why we cannot set up a \nsituation here--and both my friend from Connecticut and my friend from \nNew York are on the floor--that we could have some kind of agreement \nthat says, within the next 45 to 50 minutes, we could have at least two \nstacked votes, that of the Senator from New York and that of the \nSenator from Connecticut, with the understanding we can have one or two \nothers after that; otherwise, we can spend as much time making \nunanimous consent requests to vote.\n  Why would that not be sensible? It is not just enough to say the \nSenator from Connecticut will bring up his, and after his vote on it we \nwill have somebody else, if the vote turns out to be tomorrow afternoon \nat 5. I want to get a few votes today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have not been involved in this discussion out here \nexcept to understand that today, yesterday, and Friday there was a \ngreat deal of complaining about this bill moving too slowly, it is not \nmoving along, people are concerned and frustrated about it.\n  My understanding is that the Senator from New York offered his \namendment, was committed to having a record vote on his amendment, and \nnow we see delay, delay, delay on getting him a record vote on his \namendment.\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, is it his understanding the Senator \nfrom New York has a commitment that he will get a vote on his \namendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tell my friend from North Dakota it is in the \nCongressional Record that the majority side gave a commitment to the \nSenator from New York to have a vote. I would like to know when that \nvote will occur. I am a man of great and deep abiding faith, and I even \nbelieve in miracles, but I would feel a little more comfortable if, \ninstead of dealing with a miracle, we had a precise time.\n\n  I suggest we have a vote at 4:45, 5, 5:15 or something like that on \nthe amendment of the Senator from New York, and following that, a vote \non the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, followed by votes on \nother amendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it the case if the Senator from New York does not get \na vote and there is a cloture vote that prevails, the Senator from New \nYork will not ever get a vote on his amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is a possibility that the Chair may rule it is not \ngermane and he would not get a vote, contrary to the commitment given \nby the Senate majority.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am baffled why it has been so difficult to set up a \nqueue. I have an amendment with Senator Smith. I worked very closely \nwith Senator Boxer to make some perfections on which she insisted. We \nare here to go with the queue so Senator Dodd's and Senator Schumer's \ninterests are protected as well as others.\n  Perhaps we could be enlightened what it will take to get a queue so a \nbipartisan amendment such as ours can go forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't know. We have several pending amendments that \ncould all be voted on. I have one or two. We have the yeas and nays \nordered, and I am willing to have a 2- or 3-minute time agreement.\n  I suggest to those who keep complaining about why this is taking so \nlong, the amendments we know are going to require rollcall votes, we \ncould dispose of more than half of them by 7 o'clock this evening.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield without losing the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we work in this body by unanimous consent, \nby agreement. The senior Senator from New York, in good faith, allowed \nthe Senate to proceed on Thursday with the express agreement he would \nhave a vote on his amendment. I know the good faith of the Senator from \nTexas. He believes, at least it is my understanding, that some of the \nsubject matter in this amendment that the Senator from New York has \nbrought is under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. That may be \ntrue. But the fact is, there was a gentleman's agreement in this Senate \nthat Senator Schumer would have a vote on his amendment.\n  I think it would set a bad tone in this bipartisan Senate if someone \ngoes back on their word. When a manager of a bill is operating in the \nSenate, he is operating for the caucus that he represents--in this \ninstance, Senator Grassley, one of the most senior Members, chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. No one has been more heavily involved, with the \npossible exceptions of Senators Leahy and Hatch.\n\n  I think we should get a time set to vote on the Schumer amendment. If \nmy friend from Texas has an amendment, he should propose it.\n  I think it will create a very difficult situation if someone such as \nSenator Schumer is told by a manager of the bill he will have a vote \nand suddenly that agreement is voided. That is, in effect, what is \nhappening. It would set an extremely bad tone.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will get recognized on my own.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand the difficulty we are in. I understand the \ndifficulties of the Senators from Connecticut and Oregon. However, as \nwas stated, I was promised a vote, unequivocally. I could have insisted \non the vote then and there. The Senator from Texas wouldn't even have \nbeen on the floor to object. I didn't.\n  I will repeat the words, because this has been going on long enough. \nI--Mr. Schumer--said, from the March 8 Record:\n\n       If the Senator from Iowa will yield, as long as we get the \n     yeas and nays on this amendment in due course.\n\n  Previous to that, the Senator from Iowa had requested that I \ntemporarily lay aside the amendment.\n  And Mr. Grassley said:\n\n       The point is, we can assure the Senator from New York the \n     yeas and nays on his amendment.\n\n  That is as good an assurance as one can get on this floor. I feel \nconstrained to object to anything moving forward until we get an \nagreement as to when we will vote on my amendment. I offer this to \nthink about. I know the Senator from Texas wants to study it. We could, \nfor instance, debate the amendment of the Senator from Texas for 45 \nminutes, debate my amendment for 45 minutes, and move to vote on both \nthe amendment of the Senator from Connecticut and my amendment. Or we \ncould use some other process.\n  Until I am given an assurance that we will have a vote on this floor \non this amendment, until I am given a time--I have been given an \nassurance; I should not have to be given a second--until I am given a \ntime as to when we will vote on my amendment, I am constrained to \nobject to every amendment, even those from friends, even those with \nwhom I might agree.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in a moment. I know \nthe Senator from Texas wishes to speak, and I don't want to deny him \nthat privilege.\n  The Senator from New York was given a commitment by the Republican \nleadership to have a vote. Frankly, at the rate we are going, I don't \nsee that commitment being fulfilled. I have been here 26 years and I \nhave never seen an instance where the majority--and I have been here \nthree times the majority and three times the minority--I have never \nseen an instance where the majority has given such a commitment that \nhasn't been carried out.\n  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to make sure this will not \nbe the first time in 26 years such a commitment was not carried out. \nThis is a very serious matter.\n  There are only 100 Members who represent a nation of over a quarter \nof a billion people; 100 Members have a special responsibility because \nwe are a small number. One is a responsibility to always carry forth \nour commitment. The Senator from New York has a commitment. It should \nbe carried out. Frankly, we are only 3 months into this Congress. On a \nbill as serious as this, we should not have to be debating keeping a \ncommitment that is laid out in the Congressional Record but, rather, \ntry to find how to get the votes and vote amendments up or down.\n  I have amendments. I am prepared to go to vote with a 2- or 3-minute \ntime agreement. Let's not delay on the Senate floor and then hold press \nconferences by the Ohio clock saying: We can't understand why this bill \nis taking so long; I guess we have to file cloture.\n  The fact is, the bill could have been finished last week if people \nhad let the votes occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I just came into this discussion. \nI've had a lot of people speaking on my behalf, and I greatly \nappreciate it, but I am even more appreciative of the right to speak \nfor myself. I never made any agreement with regard to this amendment.\n  One of my predecessors, Lyndon Johnson, used to say, ``I resent a \ndeal I am not a party to.''\n  Having said that, when I read Senator Grassley's comments in full, I \ndo not see the deal that our dear colleague from New York sees. Senator \nGrassley says on March 8, on page S. 2032, ``The point is we can assure \nthe Senator from New York the yeas and nays on his amendment. We can't \nassure the Senator from New York when we are going to vote on the \namendment.''\n  Reasonable men looking at the same facts are prone to disagree, as \nThomas\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nJefferson said. But it looks to me as if this is a commitment to have \nthe yeas and nays on having a rollcall vote. I don't see any commitment \nabout ending debate on the amendment in advance.\n  Having said that, let me say what I want to say.\n  No. 1, I will object to a time limit on any amendment within the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee from this point forward. We have \nall had a good time. We have debated a lot of amendments, many of which \nwere of dubious merit and no relevance whatsoever to the underlying \nbill. But we have reached the point now where you are either for the \nbankruptcy bill or you are against it. I am for it. And I think we need \nto get on with our job. Cloture has been filed. We are going to vote on \nthat tomorrow.\n  What I am willing to do is sit down with the Senator from New York \nand his staff, if we can do that, and try to figure out exactly what it \nis he is trying to do, get an opportunity to raise concerns I have, and \nthen basically make a decision as to whether we can move forward with \nan amendment or substitute. But in terms of reaching a resolution, the \nbest use of our time would be to sit down for a few minutes with our \nstaff and see if we can potentially work something out. I would like to \npropose that to my colleague from New York.\n  Let me also make clear, it would make me happy to have no more \namendments. I don't understand why we are continuing to have all these \nvotes. If the Senator wants to hold the Senate up and not allow votes, \nthat doesn't break my heart. But that is up to the Senator from New \nYork. What I would like to do is see if something can be worked out and \nfor the two of us and our staff to sit down and see if something can be \nworked out.\n  Since there is confusion about what Senator Grassley meant, I don't \nhave any doubt that the Senator from New York reads it the way he is \nsaying it is written. I read it the other way. The point is, perhaps \nsomething can be worked out. However he wants to proceed, I think our \ntime would be well spent to take about 10 minutes and sit down and talk \nto the amendment.\n  With that, let me suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of the Schumer amendment, No. 25, that the \namendment be modified, and following a statement by Senators Gramm and \nSchumer--with Senator Gramm going first--for up to 5 minutes each, the \namendment be temporarily laid aside in order for Senator Dodd to offer \nan amendment, No. 75.\n  I further ask consent that there be 40 minutes equally divided for \ndebate in relation to the Dodd amendment and, following that time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Schumer amendment, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote in relation to the Dodd amendment, and \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask consent that following those votes, the Senate proceed \nto consideration of the Wyden amendment, No. 78.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I, first of all, express my \nappreciation to the chairman of the Banking Committee for allowing us \nto go forward. I understand, as I indicated earlier in the day, the \nsincerity of his concern about this. I am happy to have him claiming \njurisdiction. As I indicated to him, I have the same problem in my \ncommittee--Environment and Public Works--always trying to catch up to \nwhat the Energy Committee has done to us. So I express my appreciation \nof the entire Senate for the Senator's cooperation and also the \npatience of Senator Dodd and the general work of everyone. I think this \nis a good agreement and we can get rid of this bill in a timely \nfashion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before you rule on my unanimous consent \nrequest, I would like to express my appreciation to both the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas and the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, and also the distinguished Senator from Oregon, as well as the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, for working out these various \nmatters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 25, As Modified\n\n  The amendment (No. 25), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. 204. PRESERVATION OF CLAIMS AND DEFENSES UPON SALE OF \n                   PREDATORY LOANS.\n\n       Section 363 of title 11, U.S. Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(p) Notwithstanding subsection (f), if a person purchases \n     any interest in a consumer credit transaction that is subject \n     to the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S. Code 1601 et. seq.), or \n     any interest in a consumer credit contract as defined by the \n     Federal Trade Commission Preservation of Claims Trade \n     Regulation, and that interest is purchased through a sale \n     under this section, then that person shall remain subject to \n     all claims and defenses that are related to the consumer \n     credit transaction or contract, to the same extent as that \n     person would be subject to such claims and defenses of the \n     consumer had the sale taken place other than under title \n     11.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a very complicated issue. I am \nopposed to the amendment. There was a dispute about whether an \nagreement had been reached. I think you can read the language and argue \nit one way or the other, but the Senator from New York thought he had \nan agreement. And if he thought he had an agreement, I am willing to \ndefer to it.\n  Here is the whole argument in a nutshell. The amendment would affect \ninsurance companies, mortgage companies, securities companies. It is a \nchange in current law. Here is the whole issue.\n  Currently, if I have a mortgage, or if I am a customer of a company, \nand the company holds an asset as a result of my doing business with \nthem, when bankruptcy occurs and that company goes out of business--\ndeclares bankruptcy--my ability to file a claim against those assets is \nsevered. Why is that the case? It is severed because at that point the \npeople who are creditors of the company that has gone bankrupt have \nfirst claim against its assets.\n  If the amendment of Senator Schumer is adopted, well-intended as it \nis--and I am sure we will have dire examples of why it would be a good \nthing in some very limited cases--what it will really mean is that if I \nhave a mortgage with a company that goes bankrupt, under current law \nthe creditors of that company can sell that mortgage to try to pay off \ntheir debt. Under the Schumer amendment, at that point, never having \nraised any complaint whatsoever, I would have the right to come in and \nsay: I believe there was something wrong. I never raised the point \nbefore, but now that the company has gone bankrupt, I want to claim \nthat there is a problem with that loan and whoever bought the loan \nshould carry the problem with them.\n  Here is the problem in a nutshell: This will destroy the secondary \nmarket for the assets of bankrupt companies. Now, who will suffer? \nSenator Schumer is going to say, maybe these people are crooks. But \nthey are not going to suffer. They went bankrupt. The people who are \ngoing to suffer are the creditors who won't be able to sell the assets \nof the company because there will be a potential cloud against those \nassets.\n  This is a perfect case in point where, to correct a little wrong, you \ncreate a great big wrong that hurts ten thousand times as many people. \nThe reason we have bankruptcy laws is that the first claim against \nassets goes to creditors, not people who may have real or imagined or \nmade-up grievances against the company.\n  Surely in the midst of bankruptcy law in a country where we have a \nsanctity of contracts and where creditors have first claim, we are not \ngoing to create a situation where we taint the assets of a bankrupt \ncompany so that\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nthe people to whom the company owes money will end up not being able to \nget their money. That is the problem in a nutshell.\n\n  I am not saying there may not be unscrupulous lenders. The point is, \nif you listen to Senator Schumer, he is, essentially, penalizing not on \nthe unscrupulous party, but the people who are owed money. What we \nwould do if this amendment passed is we would literally cloud the title \nand the marketability of every financial asset of every financial \ncompany in America.\n  I hope this amendment will not be adopted. If it is adopted, I am \ndetermined that it not become law. I urge my colleagues to look at this \namendment and keep in mind that bankruptcy law is primarily aimed at \nprotecting creditors. Destroying the marketability of financial assets \nby creating the potential to raise new claims after the bankruptcy is \nsomething that cannot be in the public interest. It does nothing to \nhurt the bankrupt company.\n  If we want to strengthen laws to put people in jail longer for bad \nlending practices, that is one thing. To punish creditors who have had \nnothing to do with this issue is fundamentally wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Nevada and \nUtah for helping, as well as Senators from Connecticut and Oregon.\n  I say to my good friend, the Senator from Texas, his statements about \nthe proposal are about as accurate as the statements about my title. I \nwas elected to the Senate 2 years ago. He was calling me ``Congressman \nSchumer.'' He was about as accurate in my appellation as he is in his \ndescription of the amendment.\n  First, this amendment is a simple amendment. When someone is terribly \nvictimized because of a predatory lender, this amendment prevents that \npredatory lender from declaring bankruptcy, selling its loans into the \nsecondary market, and then vamoosing, leaving the poor homeowner with \nnothing. This has happened time and time again. Predatory lenders have \nfiled Chapter 11.\n  United Companies, First Alliance, Conti Mortgage, all listed hundreds \nof individual suits, class actions, and State government enforcement \nactions pending when they filed. Worse yet, when they sold their loan \nportfolios, the purchasers of these loans were fully aware of the \npredatory claims pending and serious questions about whether all the \nmortgages were valid or enforceable.\n  This is not some innocent creditor. Any creditor who buys loans in \nbankruptcy knows the score. And even when they do, under present law \nthey can say to the poor homeowner who has basically been financially \nraped: Sorry, you have no claim against us. Go sue the bankrupt \npredatory lender.\n  What this does in effect is allow new predatory lenders to exist \nbecause they know even if someone goes after them, having made all \ntheir money beforehand and paid it out in salaries and everything else, \nthey can then sell the loans into the secondary market and start up the \nbusiness in a new name. If the secondary lender knew they might be \nsusceptible to the claims of the homeowner who was seduced, they \nwouldn't be so fast to buy the loan from the predatory lender.\n\n  This is an amendment that is narrow. I supported the amendment by my \ncolleague from Illinois, but that was much broader, dealing with all \npredatory lending. Not this. This only deals with those predatory \nlenders who declare bankruptcy as a means of escaping claims of people \nwho have struggled, who have saved their $25 and $50 and $100 every \nweek or month, so that they buy their home, and when they buy that \nhome, they find that the home is in disrepair, that the mortgage is not \nwhat they were told, and their American dream is smashed.\n  If this amendment is so detrimental to honest secondary mortgage \nbuyers, then why do Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac support this amendment? \nThey are the largest secondary market makers in the country when it \ncomes to mortgages, far and away, and they are supportive. I am sure \nthey are not doing something to damage themselves.\n  This is not an overreaching amendment. It is a modest amendment. It \nis the most modest amendment that has been offered on predatory lending \non this bill. It does not involve the Banking Committee, no more so \nthan any of the other amendments that deal with money and banks and \ncredit cards because we solely amend the bankruptcy code, not RESPA or \nTILA or any of the other laws in the Banking Committee's jurisdiction.\n  What it does is very simple: It deals with the kinds of situations \nthat my good colleague, Senator Sarbanes, mentioned when he rose in \nsupport of the amendment: That the predatory lender sells knowingly to \nthe secondary mortgagor and that mortgagor then says: There is nothing \nI can do. Even though I knew these were horrible loans that violated \nthe law, I am immune from any claim.\n  It is a simple amendment. It is a fair amendment. It is a humane \namendment. I expect that this kind of amendment on its own should pass \nclose to unanimously in this body. I don't know if it will. Based on \nthe merits, it could hardly be fairer or any less controversial.\n  I remind my colleagues that everyone who cares about this issue is \nwatching this vote. It is a simple and fair one and seeks only to \nprotect innocent consumers, American families, by whom we have each \nbeen elected.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 75\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send my amendment, No. 75, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 75.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Truth in Lending Act with respect to extensions \n              of credit to consumers under the age of 21)\n\n       At the end of Title XIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1311. EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO UNDERAGE CONSUMERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 127(c) of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1637(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(8) Applications from underage consumers.--\n       ``(A) Prohibition on issuance.--No credit card may be \n     issued to, or open end credit plan established on behalf of, \n     a consumer who has not attained the age of 21, unless the \n     consumer has submitted a written application to the card \n     issuer that meets the requirements of subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Application requirements.--An application to open a \n     credit card account by an individual who has not attained the \n     age of 21 as of the date of submission of the application \n     shall require--\n       ``(i) the signature of the parent, legal guardian, or \n     spouse of the consumer, or any other individual having a \n     means to repay debts incurred by the consumer in connection \n     with the account, indicating joint liability for debts \n     incurred by the consumer in connection with the account \n     before the consumer has attained the age of 21;\n       ``(ii) submission by the consumer of financial information \n     indicating an independent means of repaying any obligation \n     arising from the proposed extension of credit in connection \n     with the account; or\n       ``(iii) proof by the consumer that the consumer has \n     completed a credit counseling course of instruction by an \n     approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency that \n     meets the requirements of section 111 of title 11, United \n     States Code.''.\n       (b) Regulatory Authority.--The Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System may issue such rules or publish such \n     model forms as it considers necessary to carry out section \n     127(c)(8) of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by this \n     section.\n\n       Amend the table of contents accordingly.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe that most people, including most \nof my colleagues, will understand the purpose and intent behind this \namendment. It attempts to inject a sense of responsibility not only \namong those who have received credit, which this legislation purports \nto accomplish, but it also asks those who are extending credit to \nassume some responsibility as well. That is truly what the underlying \nlegislation fails to accomplish. In my view, the underlying legislation \nfails to recognize that while creditors will gain much from this \nlegislation, while young people in our country, those under the age of \n21, remain unprotected\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nfrom the barrage of unsolicited credit card applications.\n  I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the mere signature of a \nstudent and the presentation of an identification card, indicating they \nare a student at that institution, is all they need to sign up for \n$3,000, $5,000, $20,000 worth of credit.\n  This amendment merely attempts to inject some responsibility into a \nprocess that is out of control in this country. I will show you in a \nmoment the statistics which bear this claim out. This is not a small \nproblem. It is a growing problem. We must demand that the credit card \nindustry bear some responsibility before they go on college campuses \nand accept applications from these young people, enticing them with the \noffer of a free baseball cap, or a free T-shirt without anything more \nthan a signature and an ID. This is the growing problem across our \nnation that this amendment attempts to address.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the purported goal of the \nunderlying bill: to curb bankruptcy abuses. My fear is in our zeal to \nprevent abuses, we have cast the net too broadly, and snared some very \nhonest and hard-working parents and young people.\n  Of equal concern is that this legislation does little to focus on an \nissue of fundamental importance, and that is trying to help consumers \navoid declaring bankruptcy in the first place. That ought to be our \nfirst line of defense: to minimize or offer a means by which people \nwould not have to seek bankruptcy protection. There is precious little \nin this legislation, which is heavily slanted toward creditors, to \nprovide consumers with the tools they need to understand the causes and \neffects of filing for bankruptcy protection.\n  If those who incur debt must meet their responsibilities, so, too, \nmust creditors who extend credit with no reasonable expectation that \nthose debts will be repaid. My amendment simply requires that any \ncredit card issuer, prior to granting credit to persons under the age \nof 21, obtain one of three things: That they have a co-signature by a \nparent, guardian, or other responsible party; or the applicant \ndemonstrates an independent means of financial support for paying off \nthe amount of credit that is offered; or the completion of a certified \ncredit counseling course, which is currently outlined in the underlying \nlegislation.\n  This is not an onerous obligation. Federal laws in this country \nalready put limitations on what people under the age of 21 can do. You \ncan't drink alcohol anywhere in America if you are under age 21. The \nTax Code makes the presumption that if someone is a full-time student \nunder the age of 23, they are financially dependent on parents or \nguardians.\n  I ask a simple rhetorical question, if you will: Is it so much to ask \nthat credit card issuers find out if someone under the age of 21 is \nfinancially capable of paying back the debt? Or that their parents or \nguardians are willing to assume financial responsibility? Or if they \ndon't want to meet either of those two conditions, that they understand \nthe nature and conditions of the debt they are incurring?\n\n  It is my understanding that there are responsible credit card issuers \nalready requiring this information in one form or another. Is it too \nmuch to ask that the entire credit card industry strive to meet their \nown best practices when it comes to the most vulnerable in our society?\n\n  Providing fair access to credit is something I have fought for \nthroughout my entire tenure in the Senate. Credit cards can play a very \nvaluable role in assisting millions of people to pursue the American \ndream. They have been a wonderful asset for millions of people.\n  This amendment would not result in the denial of credit to worthy \nyoung people. However, it would help to protect financially \nunsophisticated young consumers from falling into a financial trap even \nbefore beginning their adult lives.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe this amendment is unduly burdensome on \nthe credit card industry, nor is it unfair to people under the age of \n21. It is the responsible thing to do. The fact is, these abusive \ncreditors assume that if the young adult is unable to pay, they will be \nbailed out by their parents. Many times this means parents must \nsacrifice other things in order to make sure their child does not start \nout their adult life in a financial hole, with an ugly black mark on \ntheir credit history.\n  By adopting this straightforward amendment, the Senate would send a \nvery clear message to those aggressive credit card companies that we \nwill no longer countenance their abusive behavior. This amendment \ncorrects that behavior by making those overly aggressive credit card \ncompanies exercise their best judgment when it comes to the people who \nare obtaining their own credit cards for the very first time.\n  Additionally, the legislation before us offers no protection for the \nmost vulnerable in our society, who ironically are the primary targets \nof many credit card issuers--college students. This amendment, which I \nam offering with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, is very \nsimple. It makes a modest attempt to help educate young people, as well \nas help credit card issuers help themselves by making sure that those \npersons applying for credit cards have the reasonable ability to repay \nthose debts, or that someone will cosign with them, or that they will \ntake at least a course on understanding what their credit \nresponsibilities would be.\n  In the context of the bankruptcy debate, I think it is important to \nunderstand that an estimated 150,000 young Americans declared \nbankruptcy in the year 2000. I will repeat that. 150,000 young \nAmericans, last year alone, filed for bankruptcy protection. That is a \nstaggering number. According to Houston University professor, Robert \nManning, the fastest growing group of bankruptcy filers are those \npeople who are 25 years of age or younger.\n  In fact, the number of bankruptcies among those under the age of 25 \nis more than 6 times that of what it was 5 years ago. One of the most \ntroubling developments in the hotly contested battle between the credit \ncard issuers to sign up new customers has been the aggressive way in \nwhich they have targeted people under age 21, particularly on college \ncampuses across America.\n  Solicitations of this group have become more intense for a variety of \nreasons. First, it is one of the few market segments in which there are \nalways new customers to go after. Every year, 25 to 30 percent of \nundergraduates are fresh faces entering their first year of college. It \nis also an age group in which brand loyalty can be established. In the \nwords of one major credit card issuer, ``We are in the relationship \nbusiness, and we want to build relationships early on.''\n  Recent press stories have reported that people hold on to their first \ncredit card for up to 15 years, but in my view, some credit card \nissuers have gone just too far. They irresponsibly, target the most \nvulnerable in society and extend large amounts of credit with \nabsolutely no regard to whether or not there is a reasonable \nexpectation of repayment.\n  Although college students are one of the primary targets for credit \ncard marketeers, they are not alone. One does not have to be in college \nto receive a credit card. In fact, one does not have to be old enough \nto read to qualify for one.\n  I am sure there are people who may be listening to this debate who \ncan offer their own anecdotes.\n  I bring the attention of my colleagues a heartwarming story that was \nreported in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. The article relates \nthe story of a 3-year-old child who received a platinum credit card \nwith a credit limit of $5,000. Her mother filled in the application. I \nquote what she said:\n\n       I would like a credit card to buy some toys, but I'm only 3 \n     and my mommy says no.\n\n  This child's credit line is greater than the number of days she has \nbeen alive. The pitfalls of giving 3-year-olds platinum credit cards is \nself-evident, and this is happening with increasing frequency.\n  Let me take a moment to refocusing on the efforts of credit card \ncompanies on young people in our academic institutions. Credit card \nissuers are deeply involved in the business of enlisting colleges and \nuniversities to help promote their products. I find this shameful, and \nI hope they are listening: It is shameful what you are doing to these \nyoung people on your campuses.\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n  According to Professor Robert Manning, banks pay the largest 250 \nuniversities nearly $1 billion annually for exclusive marketing rights \nto sell their credit cards on college campuses.\n  Other colleges receive as much as 1 percent of all student charges \nfrom the credit card issuers in return for marketing or affinity \nagreements. Even those colleges that do not enter into such agreements \nare making money. Robert Bugai, the president of College Marketing \nIntelligence, told the American Banker that colleges charge up to $400 \nper day for each credit card company that sets up a table on their \ncampuses. That can run into tens of thousands of dollars by the end of \njust one semester.\n  A recent ``60 Minutes II'' piece that ran a few weeks ago vividly \nillustrated the impact that credit card debt can have on college \nstudents. A crew from the show ``60 Minutes II'' went to a major public \nuniversity campus in this country and, with the use of hidden cameras, \nfilmed vendors pushing free T-shirts, hats, and other enticements with \ncredit card applications: Just sign on the dotted line, show me your \nID, and you get $5,000 to $10,000 worth of credit. That is all you \nneed. A signature, an ID, you get a hat, a T-shirt, and you incur \n$5,000 worth of debt.\n  ``60 Minutes II'' revealed that the university, a well-known \nuniversity in this country, was being paid $13 million over 10 years by \na credit card company for the right to have a presence on their campus \nand to use the university logo on its credit cards. This public \nuniversity is actually making money off its students who use these \ncards. As part of the agreement, the university receives four-tenths of \na percent of each purchase made with the cards. Unbelievable. This \nuniversity has a vested interest in getting their students in as much \ndebt as possible.\n\n  We have a chance to do something about that. Look, if you are going \nto sign up a student under 21, and they do not have the independent \nmeans to repay, then a parent, guardian or other responsible party \nshould co-sign or at least mandate that the student will take a course \nto understand what credit obligations are.\n  If you are in the military, you have a paycheck. This amendment has \nno effect on persons who have a source of income. I am not referring to \nthose people. I am talking about kids who have no independent means of \nfinancial support, who are being given these cards without any \nconsideration for what it is going to do to them or their families.\n  The ``60 minutes II'' piece also told the story of one student's \ncircumstances, Sean Moyer. He made desperate attempts to handle the \nmassive credit card debt he incurred. Sean Moyer's life began to spin \nout of control as a result of the huge debts racked up in 3 years in \ncollege. He could not get loans to go to law school like he dreamed. \nHis parents could not afford to pay his way. So in 1998, Sean Moyer \ntook his own life.\n  ``It is obscene that the universities are making money off the \nsuffering of their students,'' said Sean Moyer's mother. Sean Moyer had \n12 credit cards and more than $10,000 in debts when he committed \nsuicide nearly 3 years ago. He had two jobs, one at the library and \nanother as a security guard at a Holiday Inn, but he still could not \npay his collectors.\n  Three years after his son's death, his mother still gets pre-approved \ncredit card offers in Sean's name from some of the same companies to \nwhom he owed thousands of dollars. One company pre-approved Sean for a \n$100,000 credit line, according to his mother.\n  Do not misunderstand me. People have to take responsibility for their \nactions. If you are going to apply for a credit card, you have to \nunderstand your responsibilities. All that I ask is that there be a \ncommensurate responsibility on those soliciting these individuals. That \nis all I am asking for: some sense of balance in this bill.\n  In the last Congress, I went to the main campus of the University of \nConnecticut in my home State to meet with student leaders about this \nissue. I was surprised at the amount of solicitations occurring at the \nstudent union at the University of Connecticut. I was surprised at the \ndegree to which the students themselves were concerned about the \nconstant barrage of offers they were receiving.\n  The offers seemed very attractive. One student intern in my office \nreceived four solicitations in 2 weeks: One promised ``eight cheap \nflights while you still have 18 weeks of vacation.'' Another promised a \nplatinum card with what appeared to be a low interest rate until you \nread the fine print that it applied only to balance transfers, not to \nthe account overall.\n  Only one of four, the Discover card, offered a brochure about credit \nterms, but in doing so also offered a spring break sweepstakes. In \nfact, last year the Chicago Tribune reported that the average college \nfreshman will receive 50 solicitations during their first few months at \ncollege--50 solicitations from credit card companies. All you have to \ndo is sign up and show your ID. You get five grand of credit. Is it too \nmuch to ask that the student show they can repay these debts? Or have \nan independent source of income? Or, in the absence of that, mom and \ndad or guardian are going will cosign the application? Or the student \nwill complete a credit education course to understand what credit \nobligations are? It can be any one of these three options. That is all \nthis amendment does.\n  College students can get green-lighted for a line of credit that can \nreach more than $10,000 on a signature and an ID, according to the \nChicago Tribune.\n  There is a serious public policy question about whether people in \nthis age bracket can be presumed to be able to make the sensible \nfinancial choices that are being forced on them from this barrage of \nmarketing. It is very difficult to get reliable information from the \ncredit card issuers about their marketing practices to people under the \nage of 21.\n  However, the statistics that are available are deeply troubling. I \nrefer to chart #2, titled ``Undergraduates pile on credit cards and \ndebt.'' Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in New England, \nconducted a recent survey of students who applied for student loans. It \ntermed the results ``alarming''.\n  The study found the following: 78 percent of all undergraduate \nstudents have at least one credit card. That is up in 2 years from 67 \npercent to 78 percent. Of those students, the average credit card \nbalance is $2,748. That is up from $1,879, 2 years ago.\n\n  In 1998, 67 percent of these students with credit cards, and in 2 \nyears it jumped 11 percent. In the same 2-year period, the obligations \nhave gone up nearly $1,000, with every indication that student credit \ncard debt is on the rise. We can do something now or wait until the \nproblem is more severe. Ten percent of the college students have over \n$7,000 in credit card debt; 32 percent of the undergraduates had four \nor more credit cards in the survey.\n  Some college administrators are bucking the trend of using credit \ncard issuers as a source of income. Some have become so concerned they \nhave banned credit card companies from their campuses. I applaud them. \nSome have even gone so far as to ban credit card advertisements in the \ncampus bookstores.\n  Roger Witherspoon, the vice president of student development at John \nJay College of Criminal Justice in New York, banned credit card \nsolicitors, saying indebtedness was causing students to drop out. \nMiddle-class parents can bail out their kids when this happens, but \nlower income parents can't.\n  I don't completely agree with Mr. Witherspoon on that statement. I \ndon't think middle-class parents can afford it, either. Middle-class \nparents trying to make ends meet can hardly assume this kind of burden. \nOnly the most affluent of people can assume these obligations.\n  Mr. Witherspoon also said, ``kids only find out later how much it \nmesses up their lives.''\n  An important component of this amendment is requiring credit \ncounseling.\n  Let me explain how this works. Much like we encourage our children \nwho reach driving age to take driver's education courses to prevent \nautomobile accidents, I think we should teach young people, young \nconsumers, the basics of credit to avoid financial wrecks. Educating \nour Nation's youth about responsibilities of financial management is \ncritical. Currently, we hardly do a very good job.\n  There is overwhelming evidence student debt is skyrocketing. Most \nsurveys also show the same group of consumers is woefully uninformed \nabout\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nbasic credit card terms and issues. According to the Jump Start \nCoalition for Personal Financial Literacy, a nonprofit group which \nconducts its annual national survey of high school seniors' knowledge \nof personal finance, financial skills are poorer today than 3 years \nago.\n  I will not go into all of the data they provided, but a startling \nnumber, well over a majority of students, have little or no \nunderstanding how credit works.\n  Without any question in my mind, some credit counseling requirement \nis needed before you can sign on for the kind of debt being offered by \nthe credit card issuers. The amendment I offer does not take any \ndraconian action against the credit card industry.\n  I agree with those who argue there are many millions of people under \nthe age of 21 who hold full-time jobs, are deserving of credit. I also \nagree students should continue to have access to credit, that we should \nnot try to prohibit the market from making credit available to them. \nAgain, this amendment does nothing to affect these persons. However, \nyou ought to be required to have more than just a student ID to qualify \nfor credit. That is all that is currently required. I don't think \nasking for a co-signature, or proof that you have a job id too onerous. \nBarring the absence of those two qualifications, you need only take a \ncourse in credit responsibility.\n\n  I think parents across the country would applaud the passage of this \namendment. How many parents with kids who are currently in college are \nincurring more debt than they can afford. Are they perhaps affecting \nthe ability of another sibling to go to school because of the debt they \nhave accumulated? I think every mother and father in America would \napplaud a Senate that said: When you tighten the bankruptcy laws for \ndebtors, make the credit card companies more responsible, too.\n  This is a modest amendment. Can't we adopt this amendment, include \nthis sort of simple proposal, to add some basic sense of responsibility \nfor creditors? This bill should help families, not hurt them. If I have \nto choose between the credit card companies versus the parents, I \nbelieve that we should side with the parents. On this issue, parents \nshould get our vote.\n  I hope my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, whatever else their \nviews may be on this bill, will decide tonight, as parents and children \ngather around the dinner table, we will vote for this amendment, and \ncast a ballot tonight on behalf of families.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 20 minutes under his \ncontrol; no time remains for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the feelings of my colleague \nfrom Connecticut. He is a good man.\n  I think this is a discriminatory amendment which would unduly \nrestrict access to credit cards for adults between the ages of 18 and \n21. It is a paternalistic amendment and some believe it is paternalism \nat its worst. It puts a complete prohibition on the issuance of a \ncredit card to those adults unless, one, their parent, guardian, \nspouse, or someone else with means agrees in writing to joint liability \nfor the debt; or, two, if a person submits proof of independent means \nof repayment; or, three, the consumer proves he has completed a credit \ncounseling program.\n  These hurdles, targeted at adults between the ages of 18 and 21, in \nour opinion, are not warranted. In short, adults between the ages of 18 \nand 21 can vote, serve in the military, obtain a driver's license, and \nunder longstanding law enter into legally binding contracts. \nDiscriminating against them when it comes to obtaining credit cannot be \njustified.\n  The unnecessary and burdensome requirements of making various \npaperwork submissions under this amendment will make the cost of credit \nmore expensive for everybody and the process inefficient.\n  Of course, this amendment strikes me also as ironic. Those who oppose \nparental consent for abortion for those under the age of 18 want \nparental consent for individuals over 18 to get credit cards. Something \nis wrong with that picture. That, it seems to me, is ironic.\n  Finally, we have already had a 55-42 vote to table an amendment that \nattempted to restrict access to credit to adults between the ages of 18 \nand 21. This amendment by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is \neven more restrictive and unfair than that amendment.\n  One last comment I have is this amendment is based on the myth \nyounger borrowers are less responsible than older borrowers. The truth \nis that they are more responsible.\n\n  As of 1999, 59 percent of all college students in America paid their \nbalance in full at the end of each month compared to only 40 percent of \nthe general population, And 86 percent of students pay their credit \ncards with their own money, not with their parents' money.\n  Frankly, there is little or no reason to have this amendment. I know \nit is well intentioned, but just the costs alone would be passed on to \nevery person in the country. Frankly, I think this amendment \ndiscriminates against young people between 18 and 21, the age of \naccountability in the eyes of most States, where they can legally enter \ninto contracts. What are we going to do next, take away their rights to \nenter into contracts because we don't trust them or we don't think they \nare adult enough to be able to handle these matters?\n  Again, I think this amendment is well intentioned, but these young \npeople have all these obligations in life that they have to live up to, \nand they are living up to them. Yes, there are horror stories such as \nthose the Senator has indicated, but I can give you horror stories \namong adults, too, 40, 50, 60 years of age who just didn't live up to \nthe obligations to pay their debts.\n  I think bankruptcy is a sorry thing for everybody. I wish nobody had \nto go into bankruptcy. But I will tell you one thing: To pass on \nadditional costs and additional burdens to everybody else because there \nare some people who are irresponsible is not the right thing to do.\n  Last but not least, under this bill, if they are under the average \nmedian income in their particular area, they will not have the \nobligation of going into the other chapter and having to try to pay \nback some part of these debts. I think society understands that.\n  What we are trying to do is get people to be more responsible in this \narea. I think this bill will go a long way towards doing that. I \nappreciate my colleague, but I have to move to table this amendment. I \nam prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Does the Senator need any more time? I am prepared to yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield 5 minutes of his time for one \nMember who would like to be heard on the amendment? I have no time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork from my time, and then if I could have 1 minute after that.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join in support of this amendment \nbecause we know, from a lot of the work that has been done over the \nlast several years, many students are being deliberately solicited, \neven targeted, for credit cards before they are financially \nindependent, responsible, or knowledgeable about what it is they are \nsigning up for. Story after story has demonstrated clearly that this \nparticular amendment by my good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, \ntargets a real problem.\n  I think all of us are committed to ensuring that people who are \nirresponsible with their financial affairs are held accountable. But I \nthink we should look at our young people in a different category. It \nused to be no one could be held financially responsible when they were \nunder 21. Then the age was dropped for many purposes to 18. But despite \nhow quickly it seems our children grow up these days, there are many \nyoung people in college or out working who are not yet 21 who do not \nreally have the experience to deal with the solicitations that come \nflooding through the mail and over the telephone that we know are \ntargeting them with these credit card applications.\n  This morning, I was talking with another colleague of ours who told \nme he was babysitting for his very young grandchildren. He put them to \nbed, the phone rang, and the person on the other end asked for one of \nhis granddaughters. Our colleague said: What is\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nthis about? He was told, much to his amazement, that his 5\\1/2\\-year-\nold granddaughter had been approved for a new credit card. He said he \nwas shocked this kind of activity was going on and did not really \nbelieve it until it happened in his own family.\n  I urge our colleagues, regardless of the position we take on the \nunderlying legislation, we should stand behind the basic principle that \nour young people should not be solicited, they should be given some \nbetter credit training as this amendment proposes, and there should be \nsome sense of responsibility on the part of creditors before they reach \nout to entice our young people into these credit cards before they even \nknow what it is they are signing up for. It looks all so easy, and they \nend up in trouble, with debts they cannot pay.\n  Let's try to avoid that. That does not mean they cannot ever become \ncustomers, but let's make it a little more reasonable in the steps that \nhave to be taken in order for them to qualify.\n  I certainly urge passage of this amendment. I thank my good friend, \nthe Senator from Utah, for yielding time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will just take a minute.\n  I understand this amendment is well intentioned. Think about it. We \nare talking about taking away the rights of people who have to go to \nwork, people who have a driver's license, people who can enter into \nlegal contracts. That is paternalism at its worst.\n  According to a national survey by the Educational Resources \nInstitute, a majority of students use credit cards responsibly and do \nnot accumulate large amounts of credit card debt. The majority of \nstudents, 59 percent, typically pay off their monthly balances right \naway. Of the 41 percent who carry over their balances each month, 81 \npercent pay more than the minimum amount due. In addition, the \noverwhelming majority of students pay their own credit card bills. The \n14 percent of students who do not pay their own bills receive \nassistance mostly from parents or spouses.\n  The average monthly balances reported by students also appear to be \nmanageable. Eighty-two percent of students with credit cards who know \ntheir balance report average balances of $1,000 or less, and 9 percent \nhave average balances between $1,001 and $2,000. In addition, slightly \nmore than half of student credit card users report combined limits of \n$3,000 or less. All of these factors indicate the majority of students \nuse credit cards responsibly.\n  A significant portion of students with credit cards use them to pay \nfor education-related expenses.\n  This amendment is much more restrictive than the prior amendment by \nthe distinguished Senator from California, which was voted down.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time, having said \nthat.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 25, as modified\n\n  On the Schumer amendment, I move to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the nondischargeability of debts arising from \n                    the exchange of electric energy)\n\n       After section 419, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 420. NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS ARISING FROM THE \n                   EXCHANGE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1141(d) of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by this Act, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\n       ``(6) The confirmation of a plan does not discharge a \n     debtor--\n       ``(A) in the case of a debtor that is a corporation, from \n     any debt for wholesale electric power received that is \n     incurred by that debtor under an order issued by the \n     Secretary of Energy (or any amendment of or attachment to \n     that order) under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 824a(c)) and requested by the California Independent \n     System Operator; or\n       ``(B) in the case of debt owed to a Federal, State, or \n     local government agency named in an order referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) for wholesale electric power received by the \n     debtor except to the extent the rate charged for power traded \n     by the California Power Exchange delivered to the California \n     Independent System Operator is determined by the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission to be unjust and immeasurable, \n     in which case this subpargraph should only apply to debt for \n     the actual cost of production and distribution of energy.''.\n       (b) Automatic Stay.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United \n     States Code, as amended by this Act, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (28), as added by section 907(d) of this \n     Act, by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (29), as added by section 1106 of this \n     Act, by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after that paragraph (29) the following:\n       ``(30) under subsection (a), of the commencement or \n     continuation, and conclusion to the entry of final judgment \n     or order, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or \n     proceeding for debts that are nondischargeable under section \n     1141(d)(6).''.\n       (c) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--Section 1141(a) \n     of title 11, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     ``subsections (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section'' and \n     inserting ``paragraphs (2), (3), and (6) of subsection (d)''.\n       (d) Applicability.--This section and the amendments made by \n     this section shall apply with respect to any petition for \n     bankruptcy filed under title 11, United States Code, on or \n     after March 1, 2001.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I offer this bipartisan amendment tonight on behalf of my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, from the Pacific Northwest. It \nwas perfected in close consultation with Senator Boxer because of the \nimportance of this matter to Senator Boxer's California constituents.\n  As all of our colleagues know, during the California energy crisis a \nnumber of regions of this country have tried to assist. In the Pacific \nNorthwest we believe we have been more than a good neighbor. Bonneville \nPower and other governmental agencies up and down the west coast have \nrepeatedly shifted power to California to help out at critical times.\n  Various California public officials have thanked profusely the \nBonneville Power Administration and others for helping California avoid \nblackouts, help that was a real hardship for many in the Pacific \nNorthwest because we have had a tough year, a low-water year. A variety \nof concerns were very much on the mind of those whom Senator Smith and \nI represent.\n  To give an idea of how appreciative California public officials have \nbeen, I will read a letter Senator Feinstein wrote to Bonneville Power \nAdministration recently.\n  It reads:\n\n       Dear Mr. Wright: I am writing to express my gratitude to \n     Bonneville Power Administration for selling power to \n     California yesterday.\n       Yesterday my State nearly had an energy catastrophe. In a \n     meeting at my office yesterday to discuss California's energy \n     situation with Governor Davis, Secretary Richardson from the \n     Department of Energy, and Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission Chairman Hoecker, calls came into my office that \n     within the hour, a rolling blackout could hit California and \n     that the California Independent System Operator (ISO) would \n     not be able to purchase the power necessary to ``keep the \n     lights on.''\n       Twelve energy generators, marketers and utilities, mostly \n     located outside of California, contacted the California ISO \n     yesterday and indicated their reluctance to sell electricity \n     into California without letters of credit from California's \n     investor owned utilities, who they feared would not be able \n     to pay for this power because of their economic \n     circumstances.\n       I am very grateful for BPA's cooperation! THANK YOU!\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank-you letters are certainly \nappreciated, but Bonneville Power still is in a position where they \nneed to be repaid. As of now, Bonneville Power is owed more than $120 \nmillion by California, and various other public entities such as the \nWestern Area Power Administration and various municipal utilities up \nand down the west coast are also owed funds. The fact is that they do \nnot have shareholders as do the big, private California utilities. The \npeople we are speaking for in this amendment do not have any \nstockholders to absorb the costs if they are not paid what they are \nowed. The public entities that would get a fair shake under this \namendment would have to pass the costs on directly to the consumers if \nthey were not in fact repaid.\n  Our amendment makes nondischargeable in bankruptcy any debts under \nthe Department of Energy emergency orders or otherwise owed for \nelectric power sent by Federal, State, or local governmental agencies. \nThis means these debts would have to be paid in full unless there was a \ndetermination by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the \nrates charged in California for electric power were unjust and \nunreasonable.\n  I want to make it very clear, because we have seen a lot of letters \npassed around, exactly what Senator Smith and I are saying in this \nbipartisan amendment. All we are saying in this amendment is that if \nyou are in a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, you have to have a plan \nto pay the public back when the public has assisted you in these \nemergency situations.\n  Let me repeat that. There is no preference given to anybody--nobody--\nin this amendment. But it does say that instead of stiffing the people \nof the Pacific Northwest and some other public entities such as in the \nWestern Power Administration that serves Montana and other areas, you \nhave to have a plan in order to pay those folks back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield to my friend from California.\n  I want to make clear to her we very much appreciate her being \ninvolved because this is so important to her constituents. We tried to \nperfect it so as to address her legitimate concerns.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I may interrupt, I hope Senators who \nhave amendments they want to bring down, and I hope they will because I \nthink many of us would like to get some amendments that would be in a \nposition to be voted on perhaps early tomorrow morning so we can start \nfairly quickly.\n  As I said, we would have finished this bill last week had we not had \nergonomics and other things interfering.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I express again my appreciation to the Senator from \nCalifornia because we want to come up with something that will work for \nthe whole west coast and not pit people against each other. I am happy \nto yield to the Senator at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, what I would like to do is state \nmy understanding of the amendment by the two Senators from Oregon, and \nthen ask my friend to comment if I am correct in my assumptions about \nthis amendment.\n  First, I appreciate the Senator's openness, working with me. The fact \nis I agree with my colleague; we on the west coast are going to have to \nwork together. We need each other because there are some times when \nthey will need power and we will have excess power. That may happen at \nsome point. It has happened in the past. Certainly in this recent \nexample we desperately need the power, and even though they had a hard \ntime doing it, they came through for us. That is why we have thanked \nthem. I say again a very big thank you on behalf of my constituency.\n  As we all know, power is not a luxury item; you need it to live. If \nyou are elderly and it is cold, you need it to stay warm. You need the \nlights. Certainly our jobs depend on electricity. So I do think the \nspirit with which my friends offer this amendment is not a spirit of \nanger but I think it is a spirit of fairness.\n  I want to point out to my friend my understanding, and I hope when he \ncomments on my remarks he will tell me if I am right, that there are \n12, as we have read it, public power entities in California which will \nbenefit from his amendment. In other words, it is not only Bonneville \nbut, in essence, what I understand the Senator is saying is if public \nutilities stepped in and helped us during this period, the \nutilities should pay their bills. I think it is fair. I don't think we \ncan say thank you very much and then let them be there hanging, without \ngetting paid.\n\n  I think it also says if the private sector was forced to sell power \nin addition to the public sector during that crisis\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nperiod, in fact they will get paid, except they will not get paid back \nthat portion that the FERC says was unfair and unreasonable.\n  I really appreciate my friend including that language in his \namendment because while I want to pay people a fair price, I do not \nthink we should have to pay it if it is gouging. My friend was very \nquick to say he would, in fact, add that language.\n  So my understanding is the purpose of this is to protect, in general, \npublic utilities that are selling to California, to make sure they get \npaid; second, during that period of crisis, that any generator that was \nforced to sell, gets paid--except they do not get the part that may \nhave been considered unjust and unreasonable charges.\n  As I understand it, the public power entities that will benefit from \nthis are: California Department of Water Resources, City of Anaheim, \nCity of Azusa, City of Banning, City of Burbank, City of Glendale, City \nof Pasadena, City of Riverside, City of Vernon, Sacramento Municipal \nUtilities District, Silicon Valley Power, and Western Area Power \nAdministration in Folsom.\n  I have heard from these public utilities. They have told me, I say to \nmy friend from Oregon, they are very frightened about not getting paid. \nWhile the big generators may be able to wait, these smaller public \nutilities really need this amendment so if the worst happens--and we \ncertainly hope the worst will not happen--and there is a bankruptcy \nfiling, these debts cannot be discharged.\n  Let me just wrap it up in this fashion. I know there are \ndisagreements. The Governor does not agree with my position on it, \nSenator Feinstein does not, others do. The fact of the matter is, I do \nnot want to be known as a deadbeat State. California is too great to \nget that kind of reputation. I think what you are doing in this \namendment is just assuring people that will not happen. I think it is \nimportant. It is the responsible way to proceed.\n\n  Frankly, as I look at reports that show our private utilities--and \nthis is a fact--taking some of the windfall that they got at the \nbeginning of deregulation and giving it to parent companies and, \ntherefore, shielding it, this is not a good thing. This isn't a fair \nthing.\n  Why should a public utility that came to our rescue get punished \nbecause our private utilities took funds and essentially gave them over \nto a parent company? And now we cannot get at those funds.\n  So on behalf of these public power entities in California that will \nbenefit from this--and, frankly, in the name of fairness--I think the \nWyden-Smith amendment is a fair amendment. I hope that it shows my \nfriends that I do think we are in this together, that the west coast \nhas to stick together.\n  If this amendment is adopted--and I hope it is adopted--it is a \nsignal that we are not saying, by virtue of this bill, that people can \ndeclare bankruptcy, utilities can declare bankruptcy, and run away from \nthese bills they owe public utility companies and also some of the \nprivate generators during that period of the threatened brownouts.\n  So I ask my colleague if he agrees with my interpretation of his \namendment and for any other comments he might have.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator has stated it extremely well and put a \nvery complicated, by anybody's calculation, and arcane subject into \nsomething resembling English. I really appreciate the Senator's \nexplanation. I think the position the Senator has taken not only is \ncorrect, but it is very gutsy.\n  We all know this is a divisive issue in many quarters. I want the \npublic to know the reason we have nailed down the protection for those \nvarious public entities, such as those California municipalities, is \nbecause Senator Boxer stood up for them. I want it understood that \nthose FERC provisions, again, in the name of fairness, came about \nbecause the Senator helped us put that language together. I think when \none looks consistently at who is out on the floor of the Senate \nstanding up for the consumer, the Senator has shown that again and \nagain. I think the spirit the Senator has shown in working with us on \nthis issue is exactly what it is going to take to bring folks together \nin the Senate and on the west coast to really address this issue in a \ncomprehensive way for the long term.\n  I thank the Senator and would be happy to yield to her for any other \ncomments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator again. This is a long, drawn-out \nfight. I hope we can work together in the future.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Oregon yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. This is a very difficult issue. A lot of people want to \nspeak on it. I see a number of them on the floor this evening.\n  Senator Carnahan, the junior Senator from Missouri, has been here, in \nand out, all day long. She has an amendment to offer. She has asked to \nspeak on the amendment for 5 minutes. Then we would return the floor to \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n\n  I would ask those on the floor who are so concerned about this \namendment offered by the Senator from Oregon to allow Senator Carnahan \nto proceed. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Clearly, I think west coast Senators may not agree on \neverything debated tonight, but I think all of us can agree it is very \nappropriate that Senator Carnahan get 5 minutes at this point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, that the Senator from Missouri be allowed to \noffer an amendment, and to speak on it for up to 5 minutes, and then \nthe floor would be returned to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just ask consent to speak for a moment \nbefore we go to the Senator from Missouri without it detracting from \nher time.\n  I am also delighted to see the Senator from Missouri here to offer \nand speak on her amendment. I want to add to what the Senator from \nNevada said. He did his usual courtesy in providing for all Members on \nour side. The Senator from Missouri has been on the floor waiting to \nspeak more today than has the Senator from Vermont as one of the \nmanagers. So it is only appropriate she proceed now. I commend the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for up to 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mrs. Carnahan], for herself and \n     Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 40.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure additional expenses associated with home energy \n          costs are included in the debtor's monthly expenses)\n\n       On page 10, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       ``(V) In addition, if it is demonstrated that it is \n     reasonable and necessary, the debtor's monthly expenses may \n     also include an additional allowance for housing and \n     utilities, in excess of the allowance specified by the Local \n     Standards for housing and utilities issued by the \n     International Revenue Service, based on the actual expenses \n     for home energy costs, if the debtor provides documentation \n     of such expenses.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. The purpose of the amendment that Senator Collins and \nI are offering is to make sure that extraordinary and unexpected \nexpenses related to home energy costs are taken into consideration in \nthe means test.\n  Under the bill, monthly utility expenses are calculated based on the \nInternal Revenue Service standards. But these standards are only \nupdated once a year from data based on the previous 12 months.\n  These standards do not take into account the potential for dramatic \nincreases in home energy costs. The\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nsharp rise in home energy costs this winter has put a tremendous strain \non low- and middle-income Americans. People across Missouri and, \nindeed, across the country have experienced dramatic increases in their \nhome energy costs. Therefore, I believe the potential for significant \nincreases in home energy costs must be considered in the means test.\n  Our amendment ensures that a debtor can include an additional \nallowance in his or her monthly expenses if the debtor can document a \nsharp rise in home energy costs. The bill already allows a debtor to \ninclude an additional allowance for food and clothing in excess of the \nIRS standard.\n  The logic of this amendment is similar. It would allow bankruptcy \njudges to consider whether an additional allowance related to home \nenergy costs is appropriate. But the amendment requires that an \nadditional allowance is only permitted when it is reasonable and \nnecessary, and when the debtor can provide documentation of the \nadditional expenses.\n  The added discretion provided by the amendment will enable bankruptcy \njudges to consider that families may be paying double or triple the \nprice for heating their homes as they did when the IRS last calculated \nlocal energy costs.\n  Our amendment will ensure that full bankruptcy relief is not denied \nto individuals and families because they have been saddled with \nextraordinary utility costs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Missouri for the \namendment she has offered. As does the Senator from Missouri, I come \nfrom a State that has some very cold winters and a lot of snow. I know \nhow important this issue is.\n  Any of us who live, basically, in the frost belt know how an \nunusually severe winter, sometimes even an enormously severe winter, \ncan push somebody over the brink into bankruptcy.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Missouri--I assume we will \nvote on her amendment tomorrow--has raised an extremely good point. I \nhope all Senators, whether they come from the northern-tier States or \nfrom more temperate States, will look at her amendment and support it. \nI applaud her for proposing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will now resume consideration of the \namendment I have offered with Senator Smith. I, too, want to praise \nSenator Carnahan for an excellent amendment. I am happy she spoke on it \nat this time.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 78\n\n  Mr. President, just a couple of additional points. Again, I want to \nmake it clear that nobody is going ahead of the line under this \namendment that we have developed in close consultation with Senator \nSmith. I want to make it clear that all that happens is in chapter 11 \nyou have to have a plan to repay the public.\n  In providing for this review by the FERC, we are not in any way \nsubjecting the Bonneville Power Administration and public entities to \nrate review by FERC. Rather, it would have rates for power traded or \ndelivered in California subject to FERC review, to examine if they are \nunjust and unreasonable.\n  It was a very tough proposition for folks in the Pacific Northwest \nand elsewhere to send our power to California.\n  It has been a tough year. At the bipartisan town meetings Senator \nSmith and I held earlier this year, again and again we heard from our \nconstituents who were very irate--and understandably so--about being \nforced to send power to California. It doesn't seem to be fair--it is \njust not right--to say that all of those working families in the \nPacific Northwest are going to be stiffed, that after thank-you letters \nhave arrived, now somehow there could be a bankruptcy proceeding and \nthe folks we represent just have to face the music and the extra cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to prevent this unfair result by supporting the \nbipartisan amendment Senator Smith and I developed with Senator Boxer \nfrom California.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon at this time.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 95 to Amendment No. 78\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I send a \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 95 to amendment No. 78.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the nondischargeability of debts arising from \n                    the exchange of electric energy)\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     420. NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS ARISING FROM THE EXCHANGE \n                   OF ELECTRIC ENERGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1141(d) of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by this Act, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(6) The confirmation of a plan does not discharge a \n     debtor--\n       ``(A) in the case of a debtor that is a corporation, from \n     any debt for wholesale electric power received that is \n     incurred by that debtor under an order issued by the \n     Secretary of Energy (or any amendment of or attachment to \n     that order) under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 824a(c)) and requested by the California Independent \n     System Operator; or\n       ``(B) in the case of debt owed to a Federal, State, or \n     local government agency named in an order referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) for wholesale electric power received by the \n     debtor except to the extent the rate charged for power traded \n     by the California Power Exchange delivered to the California \n     Independent System Operator is determined by the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) to be unjust and \n     unreasonable in which case this subparagraph shall only apply \n     to the debt determined by the Commission to be just and \n     reasonable.''.\n       (b) Automatic Stay.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United \n     States Code, as amended by this Act, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (28), as added by section 907(d) of this \n     Act, by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (29), as added by section 1106 of this \n     Act, by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after that paragraph (29) the following:\n       ``(30) under subsection (a), of the commencement or \n     continuation, and conclusion to the entry of final judgment \n     or order, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or \n     proceeding for debts that are nondischargeable under section \n     1141(d)(6).''.\n       (c) Applicability.--This section and the amendments made by \n     this section shall apply with respect to any petition for \n     bankruptcy filed under title 11 as amended by this bill, \n     United States Code, on or after March 7, 2001.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, my second-degree amendment is \nvery similar to that of my colleague, Senator Wyden's. I have changed \nonly the date of the applicability for bankruptcy filings to those that \noccur on or after March 7, 2001, and I have further clarified that just \nand reasonable debt owed will be paid to government agencies. I did \nthis because it is important to recognize the efforts made by the State \nof California during the first week of March to begin to restore \nstability to the west coast energy market.\n  On March 5, the Governor of California announced that the State \ndepartment of water resources had signed 40 long-term contracts for \nelectricity. Prior to this, the State had required the investor-owned \nutilities to purchase all their power on the spot market, making these \nutilities very vulnerable to short-term price spikes.\n  While California is making some headway on restoring the \ncreditworthiness of its utilities, it is imperative that the utilities \nin California not be able to export their bills to Oregonians and other \nWestern States by seeking bankruptcy protection and avoiding repaying \nother power providers in the western United States for power that has \nliterally kept the lights on in California in recent months.\n  My constituents and energy-sensitive businesses in Oregon are already \nfeeling the effects of the price volatility in the west. Utilities in \nthe northwest are facing current rate increases of 11 to 50 percent.\n  The customers of the Bonneville Power Administration are facing the \nprospect of 95 percent rate increases\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nbeginning in October, when current contracts expire.\n  Much of the media attention in recent months has focused on the cost \nand availability of electricity in California.\n  But the West Coast energy market extends to eleven other western \nStates, including Oregon, that are all interconnected by the high-\nvoltage transmission system.\n  That's why avoiding bankruptcy for California's utilities is \nimportant for Oregon and other western states. From the middle of \nDecember until early February, western utilities were forced to sell \ntheir surplus power into California, with no guarantee of being paid.\n  If the California utilities subsequently seek bankruptcy protection, \nit will be Oregonians who are stuck with the bill for California's \nfailed restructuring effort.\n  In fact, certain Oregon utilities are already receiving bills from \nCalifornia's power exchange for funds owed to the exchange by \nCalifornia utilities.\n  Other utilities are being paid 60 cents on the dollar for sales they \nmade as far back as last November.\n  In addition, the Bonneville Power Administration is owed over $100 \nmillion for power sales it made into California as long ago as November \n2000.\n  I know that certain state officials have refused to consider raising \nretail rates in California, claiming the State has the highest rates in \nthe Nation.\n  However, let me point out just a few facts about California's energy \nuse from publications by the U.S. Energy Information Administration:\n  California ranks 50th in the Nation in the amount of electricity the \nstate can generate on a per capita basis. In fact, total generation has \ndecreased nearly 10 percent in the last 10 years, while total \nconsumption has increased over 10 percent.\n  In 1999, the average residential bill in California was actually \n$2.70 less than the average Oregonian's bill.\n  In 1999, Californians actually paid 17 percent below the national \naverage for their monthly electricity bills.\n  Further, California consumers paid 32 percent less than consumers in \nFlorida, $58.30 versus $86.34.\n  To put a human face on what is happening in my State, let me tell you \nabout a letter I recently received from a small school district in my \nState.\n  Basically, they are pleading for the energy crisis to be fixed \nbecause, as a small school district, they are having to take resources \naway from students to pay energy bills. Their local utility has just \nadded a 20 percent surcharge to the cost of electricity.\n  The district also heats a number of its school buildings with natural \ngas. In November 1999, the bill was $4,383.59. By November 2000, the \nbill to heat the same buildings was $11,942.\n  Another small school district in my State is concerned that its power \nbills may go up by $100,000. For them, that means laying off two \nteachers.\n  Oregonians area already paying for California's failed experiment in \nelectricity restructuring. It is exacerbated by one of the worst \ndrought years on record in the Northwest.\n  Our rates are going up, but we should not have to pay twice for \nCalifornia's mistakes by being stuck with the unpaid bills for being a \ngood neighbor and helping California keep the lights on in recent \nmonths.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to the Wyden amendment.\n  I offer just a few concluding remarks. What Senator Wyden and I are \ntrying to say to our friends and neighbors in California is that \nOregonians are already paying once in the form of higher energy prices \nbecause of the situation created by California's law. If there is a \nbankruptcy, they will pay a second time because the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, in order to make its treasury payments, will be forced \nto add $100 million or more to the rates charged to Oregon, \nnorthwestern customers. This is not right.\n  We are simply saying, as kindly as we can, let's pay our bills. Let's \nbe fair as neighbors.\n  On a personal level, I can only understand how officials of the State \ngovernment of California must look with horror upon the rate cap that \nis there that is not allowing price signals for conservation and \nproduction to be sent. In very real and human terms, this law has \ncreated something of a Frankenstein that is roaming the lands of the \nWestern States and it is wreaking havoc upon jobs, communities, \nschools, and discretionary income. It isn't right. It isn't fair.\n  I say to my friend from California: A regulated power market can \nwork; a deregulated power market can work. One that is partially \nregulated and partly deregulated cannot work, as we are seeing to the \nlament of many people right now.\n  Our hope, Senator Wyden's hope and mine, and others, is that we can \nsimply say, as good neighbors, please fix this law. At the end of the \nday, if the ratepayers don't pay in California, the California \ntaxpayers will pay because they are selling billions of dollars of \nbonds right now sucking up State surpluses that should be going to \nschools, should be going to streets, should be going to serve all kinds \nof human needs but instead are going to pay inflated power rates.\n  At the end of the day, it is their issue, but it affects all of us. \nWe want simply to say, with this amendment, please fix the law. Please \npay this bill because we are in it together. We know that. We care \nabout California being prosperous. Ultimately, the citizens of \nCalifornia will pay. They will pay as ratepayers or they will pay as \ntaxpayers. It is, frankly, their choice. We don't want to be hung \nfurther with this obligation. We want to pay our bills.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will make a couple of additional \narguments on my time. I know colleagues want to speak, and I certainly \nwant to give them the opportunity.\n  Today as we listen to this discussion, perhaps the central argument \nthat has been advanced by some, that the amendment Senator Smith and I \noffer is unwise, is the argument that somehow what we are going to do \nis force California utilities into bankruptcy. I will take just a \nminute to say why I don't think that is the case and, in fact, why I \nthink our legislation is an incentive to bring about the kinds of \nnegotiations that everybody on the west coast would like to see.\n  As our colleagues know, there is an effort underway in California to \nlook at a comprehensive solution which presumably would involve \nrepaying in full everyone who is owed money for sending power to \nCalifornia. That is about $12 billion in total. This amendment involves \na few hundred million dollars owed under the emergency order plus debt \nowed to government agencies. The total, of course, is only a fraction \nof what is owed by California.\n  The question that is central is, How is it possible that California \ncan go out and work on a deal to pay $12 billion in full but ensuring \nrepayment of several hundred million dollars, as Senator Smith and I \nare calling for, is going to force California utilities into \nbankruptcy?\n  I want to come back to this one last point before yielding, regarding \nthe effort that Senator Smith and I are pursuing. As I touched on \nearlier, this comprehensive approach to repaying those who are owed \nmoney under discussion in California involves about $12 billion in \ntotal. It just seemed to me to not be credible to say that California \ncan work out a deal to pay $12 billion in full, but somehow ensuring \nrepayment of several hundred million dollars is going to force the \nCalifornia utilities into bankruptcy.\n  My view is that other creditors truly believe they are going to be \nfully repaid under this $12 billion comprehensive solution. They would \nnot risk forcing California utilities into bankruptcy. Other creditors \nwill only be concerned about our amendment if, in fact, they don't \nthink there is enough money to pay everybody back.\n  The amendment requires that Bonneville Power and other governmental \nagencies be repaid so that ratepayers and taxpayers don't end up \nholding the bag if these for-profit California utilities go into \nbankruptcy to avoid their debts. It does not--I repeat this--put these \ngovernment agencies at the head of the line. It only keeps their \ncurrent place in line to ensure that they would be repaid at some \npoint.\n  All of us in this discussion are hopeful that there is not going to \nbe a bankruptcy proceeding. I am prepared to work as one Senator--and I \nknow Senator Smith is as well--with our California colleagues to put in \nplace a comprehensive agreement so that this amendment does not come \ninto play.\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\n  I see my colleague from the State of California on the floor. I want \nto repeat that again. I am prepared to work with her, as I sought to do \nfor several weeks now, to make sure that California can have every \nopportunity to put in place a comprehensive agreement so that this \nparticular amendment never comes into play. But if that doesn't happen, \nand if there is a bankruptcy filing, and there isn't enough money to \npay back everybody, then it seems to me that the people's power--the \npower that belongs to these public entities deserves an opportunity to \nget a fair shake in a chapter 11 proceeding so that our constituents \nare not shellacked as part of an effort to be good neighbors.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I ask unanimous consent, it is \nobvious this has become a very partisan bill. We have people on both \nsides of the aisle on both sides of this issue. I guess we are making \nprogress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered for the remainder of \nthe evening with respect to amendments to be offered from the list \nsubmitted last Thursday by the leadership be postponed on a case-by-\ncase basis until 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes prior to each \nvote for explanation, that the votes be in stacked sequence with the \nfirst vote limited to 15 minutes and all remaining votes in the \nsequence limited to 10 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that, following those stacked votes, \nthe Senate proceed to additional amendments and that the cloture vote \nbe postponed to occur at 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Further, that just prior \nto the vote on cloture, Senator Wellstone be recognized to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  This has been discussed with the Democratic leader and cleared on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, just to ask the leader a \nquestion: Is it the leader's desire that this amendment be voted on \ntonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. This amendment would be voted on, if a vote is required, at \n10:30 tomorrow morning in the stacked sequence.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know there is a good deal of discussion that needs to go \nforward. I hope Senators on the floor will continue on this amendment \nand other amendments. Then, if votes are ordered, we would stack them.\n  I believe there would be probably three amendments that would be \noffered tonight, and therefore we would have probably a minimum of \nthree stacked votes tomorrow at 10:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, there will be no further votes this evening. I \nthank my colleagues for their cooperation. I look forward to listening \nto the debate on this particular issue. It is very interesting. I will \nlisten and decide how to vote as the night progresses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for some parliamentary \nbusiness for a second without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding.\n  This is a very interesting issue. A lot of people want to talk on it. \nwe have a number of people who are going to be required to offer \namendments sometime tonight. We want to have some idea. There are at \nleast two Senators waiting to offer amendments.\n  If I could ask my friend from Alaska, does he have a general idea how \nlong he wishes to speak this evening?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska will probably speak not more \nthan 10 minutes. I am just going to comment on the amendment and the \nsecond degree offered by my two colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. How long does the Senator from Oregon wish to speak this \nevening?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think we will have some back and forth. But certainly \nthe major points I have been interested in making have been made. I am \nhappy to be sure that we are fair to all of our colleagues and that we \nmove expeditiously.\n  Mr. REID. I am not trying to cut back anybody's time. Does the \nSenator from California have an idea as to how much time she may take \nthis evening?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the question. I believe very strongly \nabout this amendment, and I believe it is going to have untoward \nconsequences and act directly contrary to what the Senator from Oregon \nbelieves. I cannot give a precise time. I have been here all day. I \nhave done nothing else. I would like to have a chance to make the \narguments against the amendment following the comments of the chairman \nof the Energy Committee.\n\n  Mr. REID. Just for the sake of Senators waiting around, does the \nSenator believe it will take an hour, hour and a half, 2 minutes, 3 \nminutes?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Probably not more than an hour.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, let me share with you my \nown observation, with respect to the amendment and the underlying \namendment by the two Senators from Oregon, that it is understandable \ntheir wanting to protect their public power entity, and to ensure that \nit receives just payment for power provided, to which they are \nentitled. What concerns the Senator from Alaska, as chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, are the questions of whether \nthis establishes a precedent, whether this addresses the issue the \nSenator from Oregon has assured us would not be a factor, and whether \nthis might force the two utilities in question into bankruptcy, with \nthe resulting chaos that is pretty hard to predict.\n  What effect would it have on the California teachers' retirement fund \nwhich is invested in these utilities in the State of California? What \neffect might it have on the State employees' retirement? We don't know \nthe answers to these questions. But there is a reasonable suggestion by \nknowledgeable people that this amendment may force a chapter 7 \nbankruptcy by these utilities. We all know what a chapter 7 is. It \nrequires the utility to liquidate its assets and then the creditors \nstand wherever they stand.\n  Now to determine the intent of the amendment by the Senator from \nOregon it is necessary to consider what the amendment says--it says the \nconfirmation of a plan does not discharge a debtor. That means a \nbankruptcy judge cannot settle for 80 cents on the dollar, or even 50 \ncents on the dollar. It implies that, indeed, full payment must be \nmade. That is what it says.\n  Now the question of the exceptions that go into section A of the \namendment, and this covers the case of a debtor--that is, a \ncorporation--from any debt for wholesale electric power received that \nis incurred by the debtor under an order issued by the Secretary of \nEnergy. Recall that there was an order issued by President Clinton, and \nan order issued later by President George W. Bush, that required power-\ngenerating companies to sell into the California system; and the \nassumption has been, well, since the Government ordered it, and if the \nutilities can't pay then there is a case against the Government.\n  But it is rather curious, in examining that question, that was not a \nformal acceptance by the utilities. It was an understanding that they \nsell. So the question, legitimately, that counsel may ask is: Does this \nensure that those power companies that sold into Pacific Gas and \nElectric and Southern California Edison have a case against the \nGovernment if indeed there is not some form of guarantee in that regard \nfor repayment?\n  The answer seems to be nobody knows yet whether those companies that \ngenerate power and sold to Pacific Gas and Electric can get paid from \nthe Government on the basis of that order because of a lack of \nformality. That is something that is going to employ a lot of lawyers \nfor a long period of time if it comes to that.\n\n  Then it says in section (B) of the amendment: In the case of a debt \nowed to the Federal, State, or local government agency named in an \norder referred to in subparagraph (A).\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\n  Except for certain exceptions, it includes that the discharge that is \ninitiated in the first portion is confirmed; that a plan--that would be \na plan submitted by a bankruptcy judge. The bankruptcy judge cannot \ndischarge the debt.\n  Let us be realistic. That just sets a criteria to ensure that \nBonneville is repaid. California got Bonneville's power. Bonneville is \nentitled to repayment. What concerns me is what we are doing here and \nnot knowing the implications of what we are doing.\n  Let us look at the history of why the California investor-owned \nutilities are on the brink of bankruptcy. We found the State of \nCalifornia designed a deregulation competition program that was flawed \nfrom the start. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, but California ordered its \nutilities to sell the bulk of their generation, the nonnuclear and \nnonhydro generation assets. California also ordered its utilities to \npurchase power only from the spot market, preventing them from entering \ninto contracts to protect consumers from wholesale price spikes.\n  That was fine as long as there was a big spot market and there was a \nlot of competition, and the utilities could get very favorable rates, \nbut that changed.\n  Then California did something else. They also decided to prevent the \npassthrough of wholesale rates into retail rates, despite the fact that \nthis is contrary to Federal law.\n  I remind you California has received the power. Now they have to pay \nfor it. The point was made, whether it be the California taxpayer or \nthe California ratepayer, and they are the same, that somebody has to \npay for this.\n  My colleagues should understand that the California program applies \nonly to investor-owned utilities. Rather curious, because we have both \nmunicipally-owned and investor-owned utilities in the same competitive \nmarket. The result is potentially economic disaster for California's \ninvestor-owned utilities.\n  California's investor-owned utilities were required to purchase all \nof their on the spot market at high prices, and sell low on the State \nprice-controlled retail market. You do not have to take Economics 101 \nto know if you buy high and sell low where you end up. You end up where \nthey are: straight in bankruptcy. That is the reality of this \nsituation.\n  Who is responsible? What is the solution? First, California has to \nact responsibly in that manner.\n  On the supply side, California must get over its aversion to new \npowerplants and transmission lines because the problem in California is \nhaving the supply necessary to meet demand. The supply is not there; \nyet the demand is there and it is increasing.\n  On the demand side, California simply has to recognize the realities \nand get over its unwillingness to pass through the wholesale costs. If \nthe wholesale costs were passed through, we would not be having this \ndebate. The utilities would not be on the brink of bankruptcy and \nBonneville would have gotten paid.\n  Blaming others, driving utilities to the brink of bankruptcy, having \nthe State buy power, taking over transmission lines, seizing utility \nassets is not going to solve California's problem. It only prolongs the \nagony and makes a lot of lawyers rich.\n  This reminds me of a recent survey which found that--this is \nevidently accurate--that two out of three people in California would \nrather have the lights go out than pay an increase in their rates. That \nis their choice, I guess, and if they continue to oppose powerplants \nand transmission lines some of them might get their wish.\n  There is no question that California faces a serious problem. We are \nsympathetic. We want to help them. We have to help them. But we have to \nfind a meaningful solution. A Band-Aid approach that creates perhaps \neven more serious problems is what concerns me about this amendment.\n  It is not that the power suppliers the Senators from Oregon are \nconcerned about are not entitled to payment. They are entitled to \npayment. They ought to be fighting for payment. Sometimes we throw the \nbaby out with the bathwater, and I am not sure we know what we are \ndoing here. This might force those utilities into bankruptcy, into \nchapter 7 where they simply take their assets and sell them off and you \nare a creditor like anybody else. I do not think that is what we want \nto happen, we want everybody to get paid.\n  I am also concerned about the bond holders, the teachers' retirement \nfunds that have been invested in Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern \nCalifornia Edison. Do we have a responsibility to protect them? I do \nnot suppose we have a direct responsibility, but we have an implied \nresponsibility. Those people invested in those utilities for retirement \nin good faith, and we have a responsibility to know what we are doing.\n  If this thing goes into bankruptcy, I just wonder if we have achieved \nthe objective by protecting solely the merits of the PMA, in this case \nBonneville.\n  I can understand Bonneville wanting some assurance that they are \ngoing to get paid, but I am not so sure if they the utilities go into \nchapter 7 that they are going to be any better off than any other \ncreditor. I wonder if that will not create a worse situation for the \nutilities, the customers in California, the Federal PMAs, and the \nentire west coast and Pacific Northwest.\n  That is my concern, but I do respect and recognize the efforts of \nSenator Wyden and Senator Gordon Smith to try to address protections \nfor their constituents. They are doing what they have every right to \ndo.\n  The fact is that California got their power and cannot seem to come \nup with a structure to pay for it. Make no mistake about it, this \nparticular amendment does give preference under any interpretation to \nBonneville, and it may set off other creditors. For example, and I ask \nmy good friends from Oregon, what about the natural gas suppliers that \nhave not been paid? The amendment does not address their particular \nsituation, but it is similar to Bonneville. They have not gotten paid \nfor their power.\n  What about other electricity that came from out of state? What does \nthat do to those folks? Are they going to come in with an amendment \nlater and say that we took care of Bonneville to ensure Bonneville \nreceived 100-percent payment, so why shouldn't the natural gas \ntransmission companies that also have not been paid be taken care of? \nThat is a concern.\n  I wish we could find another solution. Maybe the Senator from \nCalifornia can enlighten us a little bit about a legitimate way to \nprovide the Senators from Oregon the assurance that their utilities are \ngoing to get paid somehow, as well as the other creditors.\n  The worst possible thing would be to force into bankruptcy the \nutilities and have the State of California take over. I do not think \nGovernment does a very good job of running businesses, whether it is \nthe utility business or any other business.\n  I stand here as chairman concerned about the implications of this \nproposal; that it sets a precedent for other creditors who are going to \nwant protection and an unknown. I wish we had spokespersons here from \nPG and Southern California Edison to tell us what the results of this \nare going to be, not only on the citizens of California, but the \nability of Bonneville to get paid so they can receive consideration for \nwhat they have provided, and that is consideration in the sense of \npower.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield without losing my right to the floor, and I am \nhappy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I respond briefly to the point the Senator is making. It \nseems to me the Senator makes an interesting point and certainly raises \nsome interesting legal questions.\n  The scenario just described is what Senator Smith and I seek to \nprevent by keeping our amendment narrow, to involve government \nentities. In other words, if you were to broaden the scope of the \namendment to all kinds of other parties, it seems to me the case would \nbe more credible that perhaps you could have a scenario where you were \ndriven into bankruptcy. That is why we kept it narrow. We believed \nkeeping it narrow gave people an incentive to negotiate and increase \nthe prospect that we wouldn't have this calamitous situation that the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee is so correct to say would be \nbad for all.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Perhaps we could have some enlightenment. I hope my \ngood friend from California can give an indication of what the two \nutilities at\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nissue think of this. The State of California and the ratepayers and/or \nconsumers are prepared to meet this just obligation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent amendment No. 93, \nthat is at the desk and has been filed by Senator Durbin, and amendment \nNo. 94, filed by Senator Breaux, be called up and put in the ordinary \ncourse of amendments that are already pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to check with our \nleadership at this time. It is not my intention to object, but I would \nlike to have a few moments to consider the request.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to my friend from Alaska, if there is a \nproblem with it, let's go ahead and get it done. If there is a problem, \nI will be happy to join with him to go ahead and rescind the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am very--I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and \nChairman of the Committee for his comments. He asked, what do the two \nutilities at issue think of this? I will respond and I will give the \ncomment of Robert Glynn--the Chairman, President, and CEO of Pacific \nGas and Electric. This is his company's position:\n\n       PG is at a critical point in sensitive negotiations to \n     resolve an energy crisis that is affecting the Western United \n     States. Our creditors have been willing to forbear in the \n     interest of achieving a comprehensive solution that is fair \n     to all parties. This amendment would change the relationship \n     among creditors and could destabilize the fragile cooperation \n     that currently exists. It would be a terrible irony if \n     actions of the United States Government were responsible for \n     tipping this situation over the edge.\n\n  That is the response of one of the major investor-owned utilities in \nthe State of California.\n  I have input from the other, Southern California Edison, and I will \nread from a letter by John Bryson, CEO of Southern California Edison:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Wyden amendment undermines the solution \n     being crafted within the State. The Wyden amendment would \n     require that, in the event of bankruptcy, the power \n     generators who have made significant profits from this crisis \n     receive full payment before small businesses, banks and bond \n     holders. This is not fair to the other creditors.\n       Furthermore, this amendment could trigger the bankruptcies \n     that everyone is trying to avoid. Other creditors will not \n     stand by and just watch as the amendment takes away their \n     rights.\n\n  This is the reason I so strongly oppose this amendment. I don't \nbelieve the Senators who support this Wyden amendment have an \nunderstanding of what might happen. There is $13 billion of debt out \nthere. It involves banks all over the United States. It involves high-\ntech companies, it involves cities, it involves generators, it involves \nnatural gas companies, it involves a wide range of debtors and \ncreditors.\n  Right now, the State of California has made considerable progress \ntoward resolving this crisis. More than anything, the State needs some \ntime to conclude those negotiations. If the State is able to conclude \nnegotiations, this means that the debt could be paid to the utilities, \nand would help exactly the creditors that Senators Wyden and Smith want \nto help.\n  At this point, the State doesn't need the Federal Government to step \nin and destroy the progress they have made. I have checked with \nbankruptcy attorneys, and I believe I am right. This amendment is \nunprecedented. Never before without a hearing has the Senate of the \nUnited States decided the pecking order of creditors and debtors for a \npotential bankruptcy of this size. This amendment rewrites the \nbankruptcy rules in favor of one set of creditors. It creates an \nenormous incentive, as the Chairman has just said, for other creditors \nto now push the utilities into bankruptcy before this amendment would \nbe signed into law. It is like a run on the bank. So without a hearing, \nthis amendment seeks to determine winners and losers.\n  There is not a single debtor or creditor that I know that supports \nthis amendment. Virtually all of them have opposed to this amendment. \nEven some of the people helped by the amendment are opposed. That \nincludes the California Municipal Utilities Association, the City of \nLos Angeles, Duke, Enron, Calpine, and Williams who all oppose this \namendment.\n  Let me quote from some of the letters I have received. I begin with \nthe Governor of the State of California.\n       A critical component of the plan to resolve California's \n     energy challenge is the return of our utilities to financial \n     solvency. Our efforts have taken the form of painstaking \n     negotiations between the State and the utilities to stabilize \n     their financial condition. Any attempt to create a special \n     class of debtor under Federal bankruptcy laws, may have \n     serious repercussions to our efforts. Therefore, I am writing \n     to express my strong opposition to Senator Ron Wyden's \n     amendment to S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001. Any \n     actions on the part of the United States Senate might very \n     well undermine all the progress we have made to this point in \n     our negotiations with the utilities. This is a very delicate \n     process and we urge the Senate to allow all parties in \n     California to continue their work together to solve this \n     crisis.\n\n  Now from the Electric Power Supply Association, which is the electric \ngenerating companies together:\n\n       This amendment seeks to give certain entities a favorable \n     status in the event that California utilities fall into \n     bankruptcy. Many companies have provided power to \n     California's consumers and EPSA, the Electrical Power Supply \n     Association, believes emphatically that all these entities \n     deserve to be fully and fairly compensated. However, it is \n     inappropriate for the Senate to try and create winners and \n     losers in this desperate situation. Rather than orderly \n     resolution, this legislation could lead to a premature \n     declaration of bankruptcy and the inevitable liquidation of \n     the California electric utilities assets in a legal free-for-\n     all. We urge you to oppose the Wyden amendment.\n\n  Let me read from a letter submitted by a big electric generator, \nWilliams--a generator that has profited mightily from this situation:\n\n       Williams is strongly opposed to any such proposal. In our \n     judgment, intervention by the Congress in the California \n     market in a way that picks winners and losers among similarly \n     situated parties will only precipitate a deepening of the \n     crisis. It will cripple ongoing efforts within the State to \n     resolve the crisis and trigger an outpouring of litigation \n     and legal maneuvering that would prolong the crisis, not \n     resolve it. Restoring financial solvency to the local \n     utilities is a critical element of any long-term solution to \n     the electricity problem in California. If those utilities are \n     forced into bankruptcy, the immediate result would be to \n     plunge everyone involved in the crisis into protracted, \n     uncertain, court proceedings. In our judgment, this proposed \n     legislation will only serve to precipitate that bankruptcy. I \n     fear the mere possibility that such an amendment might become \n     law will leave those involved little choice but to trigger \n     bankruptcy proceedings in order to protect their own \n     interests.\n\n  Let me give you another generator's view, Calpine:\n\n       Under Senator Wyden's amendment, many out-of-state power \n     producers, both public and private entities, would be made \n     whole under any eventual utility bankruptcy, while QF's, \n     forced to sell by virtue of contracts rather than a federal \n     emergency order, would likely be left with little or no \n     recourse. Some of the cleanest, most environmentally \n     desirable sources of energy would be severely disadvantaged \n     by this action.\n       While on fairness grounds alone, we believe the Wyden \n     amendment should be defeated, perhaps more importantly, we \n     think the amendment would only worsen the California energy \n     crisis. Creditors have shown remarkable patience to date, \n     giving California state officials an opportunity to seek a \n     solution that avoids utility bankruptcy. This amendment, \n     however, could trigger an immediate bankruptcy filing in \n     order for the filing to precede enactment of the legislation.\n\n  So you see, just by passing this, what we do is, to all the community \nout there that is owed money, we trigger their urge to move the \ncompanies into bankruptcy. That would be a huge mistake.\n  This letter is signed by the vice president of the company.\n  Mr. President, I would like to read from a statement by the Edison \nElectric Institute which, as I understand it, represents most electric \nutilities with the exception of Pacific Gas and Electric:\n\n       I am writing to express our concerns regarding a proposed \n     amendment to S. 420, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001'', \n     that may be offered by Senator Wyden for himself and Senators \n     Baucus and Murray. While there appear to have been several \n     iterations of that amendment, the thrust appears to favor \n     public power electricity suppliers in a utility bankruptcy \n     proceeding by providing that debts to them for electricity \n     are not dischargeable. The amendment also applies to debts \n     for wholesale electric power received pursuant to the \n     emergency order issued by\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\n     the Secretary of Energy under section 202(c) of the Federal \n     Power Act. This amendment raises large public policy concerns \n     by affecting all utilities as well as those involved in \n     bankruptcy proceedings.\n       First, it primarily advantages government-owned utilities \n     who already are uniquely able to sell power at rates which \n     are not subject to regulation by FERC. It makes no sense to \n     give a bankruptcy preference to the only generators whose \n     rates are unregu-\n     lated. . . .\n       This amendment would undermine efforts underway to address \n     the current electricity situation in California. All parties, \n     including the Governor, the utilities and creditors, are \n     trying to work out an agreement. Passage (as well as concern \n     about the possible passage) of this amendment could disrupt \n     these efforts and lead to immediate initiation of bankruptcy \n     proceedings.\n  Mr. President, this is not me saying this. These are the major \ncreditors and debtors in this situation, all of whom are saying that \nonce you give preference to one, the others will trigger bankruptcy to \nprotect their rights. And, in protecting their rights, it will push \nthese utilities into bankruptcy because that is the only way they can \ndo it.\n  If you push these utilities into bankruptcy, I believe it is likely \nthey will go into chapter 7--not 11 or 13, but 7, and, therefore, they \nwill go out of business altogether. So it is a very dangerous thing to \ndo.\n  The surprising thing is we have this amendment on the floor, in view \nof the fact that virtually all of the major creditors and debtors \noppose it because they know exactly what is going to happen.\n  We also have unions. I would like to have printed in the Record the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' letter. They represent \nover 800,000 electrical workers, who also believe the effect this would \nhave would be to trigger a bankruptcy.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters in their entirety be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          Calpine,\n\n\n                              1200 18th Street, NW, Suite 850,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to urge your \n     opposition to an amendment that will be offered by Senator \n     Wyden to the bankruptcy legislation currently being \n     considered by the full Senate. It is my understanding that \n     Senator Wyden intends to offer an amendment that would ensure \n     that public power producers and others who sold power to \n     California under the Federal emergency order are made whole \n     in any bankruptcy proceeding, thus allowing these select \n     creditors to be treated preferentially.\n       As you may know, most of Calpine's power plants in \n     California are ``qualifying facilities,'' commonly referred \n     to as QFs. QFs are cogeneration and renewable energy \n     facilities, all located in the state of California, which \n     provide power to the California utilities under contracts. \n     Despite the contractual obligations of the utilities, the QFs \n     have not been paid for several months and today over $1 \n     billion is owed collectively to these in-state companies.\n       Under Senator Wyden's amendment, many out-of-state power \n     producers, both public and private entities, would be made \n     whole under any eventual utility bankruptcy, while QFs, \n     forced to sell by virtue of contracts rather than a Federal \n     emergency order, would likely be left with little or no \n     recourse. Some of the cleanest, most environmentally \n     desirable sources of energy would be severely disadvantaged \n     by this action.\n       While on fairness grounds alone, we believe the Wyden \n     amendment should be defeated, perhaps more importantly, we \n     think the amendment would only worsen the California energy \n     crisis. Creditors have shown remarkable patience to date, \n     giving California state officials an opportunity to seek a \n     solution that avoids utility bankruptcy. This amendment, \n     however, could trigger an immediate bankruptcy filing in \n     order for the filing to precede enactment of the legislation.\n       I urge you to do everything possible to help your \n     colleagues understand the very negative consequences of this \n     amendment for clean, renewable sources of energy. Thank you \n     for your assistance and please let me know if I can provide \n     you with any additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jeanne Connelly,\n     Vice President--Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Edison Electric Institute,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to express our \n     concerns regarding a proposed amendment to S. 420, the \n     ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001'', that may be offered by \n     Senator Wyden for himself and Senators Baucus and Murray. \n     While there appear to have been several iterations of that \n     amendment, the thrust appears to favor public power \n     electricity suppliers in a utility bankruptcy proceeding by \n     providing that debts to them for electricity are not \n     dischargeable. The amendment also applies to debts for \n     wholesale electric power received pursuant to the emergency \n     order issued by the Secretary of Energy under section 202(c) \n     of the Federal Power Act. This amendment raises large public \n     policy concerns by affecting all utilities as well as those \n     involved in bankruptcy proceedings.\n       First, it primarily advantages government-owned utilities \n     who already are uniquely able to sell power at rates which \n     are not subject to regulation by FERC. It makes no sense to \n     give a bankruptcy preference to the only generators whose \n     rates are unregulated.\n       Second, the amendment appears to have little benefit for \n     generators which are not publicly-owned, even though their \n     rates are fully subject to FERC regulation. Many of these \n     suppliers sold into the California market voluntarily without \n     being compelled to by the DOE order and most of their sales \n     took place both before and after the DOE order was in effect. \n     Thus, most of their sales would not be covered.\n       Third, the amendment would have long term impacts \n     increasing all utilities' cost of capital by downgrading the \n     protections afforded to lending institutions and investors. \n     Such institutions lent money to California utilities to allow \n     them to continue to provide service to consumers in \n     California despite the retail rate freeze. Legislating \n     reductions in a lender's and an investor's bankruptcy \n     protections may lead investors to increase the cost of \n     capital to all utilities to compensate for the added risk. \n     This would result in higher costs to all consumers. Since \n     significant amounts of new capital are needed to fund \n     necessary expansions of generation and transmission \n     facilities, this would have a negative impact on the entire \n     economy.\n       Fourth, this amendment would undermine efforts underway to \n     address the current electricity situation in California. All \n     parties, including the Governor, the utilities and creditors, \n     are trying to work out an agreement. Passage (as well as \n     concern about the possible passage) of this amendment could \n     disrupt these efforts and lead to immediate initiation of \n     bankruptcy proceedings.\n       Finally, this amendment would do nothing to solve the \n     underlying problem that retail rates in California are frozen \n     at a level far below the cost of wholesale power purchases. \n     It does nothing to provide for new supplies of electricity, \n     does nothing to clarify existing provisions of the bankruptcy \n     code which may limit the authority of a bankruptcy judge to \n     increase rates and in effect merely ``reshuffles the deck \n     chairs'' in the California electricity crisis.\n       We urge you to vote against the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas R. Kuhn.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Williams Companies,\n\n\n                                          One Williams Center,\n\n                                  Tulsa, Oklahoma, March 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand that Sen. Wyden may \n     offer an amendment to the bankruptcy legislation before the \n     Senate that would adversely affect the California electricity \n     situation. I understand this amendment would give \n     preferential standing in any bankruptcy proceeding to private \n     or public providers of electricity who were required to sell \n     power pursuant to the Department of Energy orders. That is an \n     illogical outcome when private providers within the state may \n     have provided electricity outside of the DOE order and other \n     creditors may be equally deserving of payment.\n       Williams is strongly opposed to any such proposal. In our \n     judgement, intervention by Congress in the California market \n     in a way that picks winners and losers among similarly \n     situated parties will only precipitate a deepening of the \n     crisis. It will cripple ongoing efforts within the State to \n     resolve the crisis, and trigger an outpouring of litigation \n     and legal maneuvering that would prolong the crisis, not \n     resolve it.\n       Williams is a national energy company who has been an \n     active participant in the California market. Williams \n     dispatches as much as 4,000 megawatts of power in the Los \n     Angeles region, although the amount available on any given \n     day may be less, depending on a variety of factors. This \n     represents about 40 percent of the independent generating \n     capacity in the Los Angeles area and about 9 percent of the \n     available in-state generation that is available to the \n     independent system operator.\n       Restoring financial solvency to the local utilities is a \n     critical element of any long-term solution to the electricity \n     problem in California. If those utilities are forced into \n     bankruptcy the immediate result would be to plunge everyone \n     involved in the crisis into protracted, uncertain court \n     proceedings. In our judgement, this proposed legislation will \n     only serve to precipitate that bankruptcy. I fear the more \n     possibility that such an amendment might become law will \n     leave those involved little choice but to trigger bankruptcy \n     proceedings in order to protect their own interests.\n       In our view, a far more constructive course is for those \n     involved to work in good faith to find a comprehensive \n     solution to the problem. Congressional encouragement of that\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\n     approach would be welcome, but partial solutions, especially \n     those that would increase the probability of litigation, \n     should be rejected.\n       At the end of the day, if recovery efforts do fail and \n     there is the unfortunate outcome of a bankruptcy of one or \n     more of the California utilities, then leaving the existing \n     provisions of law in place will produce the fairest outcome. \n     Adoption of this amendment would create subsets of rights \n     among similarly situated parties with unpredictable and quite \n     possibly inequitable results.\n           Sincerely,\n     Keith E. Bailey.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                             TURN,\n\n\n                                   The Utility Reform Network,\n\n                                San Francisco, CA, March 12, 2001.\n     Re: Wyden-Baucus Amendments to S. 240--TURN Opposition\n     Senator Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter is written to express \n     TURN's opposition to the Wyden-Baucus Amendment to S. 420. \n     The amendment would give preferential treatment to wholesale \n     power generators, who sold electricity into California's \n     severely dysfunctional market. By making debt incurred by \n     utilities for wholesale purchase of electricity non-\n     dischargeable in the event of utility bankruptcy, the \n     legislation would unfairly favor generators at the expense of \n     ratepayers. During the worst part of the energy crisis, \n     wholesale generators, both public and private, realized \n     windfall profits in California. There is no justification to \n     protect 100 percent of these profits at the expense of \n     ratepayers and other creditors. Even power that was \n     dispatched subject to a federal order was sold at prices way \n     in excess of the just and reasonable rates that are required \n     by federal law. Why should Federal legislators protect \n     windfall profits at the expense of other creditors who were \n     loaning money to the utilities to purchase power during the \n     same emergency?\n       We are afraid that this kind of legislation will harmfully \n     impact whatever negotiations are happening at the state level \n     to strike a balance that would cause all players to make some \n     sort of sacrifice so that we can all move forward. Let the \n     bankruptcy laws remain status quo ante in order to allow the \n     settlement of all claims going forward. The Senate should not \n     modify laws that were in place during this period in order to \n     choose winners or losers in California's energy debacle. \n     Either there will be a settlement at the state level or the \n     utilities will be forced to bankruptcy. If bankruptcy is the \n     eventual solution, let the federal bankruptcy judge, applying \n     the laws that were in place during the crisis, resolve the \n     equities. Senate intervention at this point influences the \n     negotiating dynamics unfairly. Such intervention could \n     actually hasten bankruptcy if other creditors perceive an \n     advantage to forcing early involuntary bankruptcy. This could \n     happen if bankers or commercial paper holders believe they \n     have more opportunity to recover their losses by filing \n     before the effective date of any legislation that could \n     compromise their claims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Nettie Hoge,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Edison International,\n\n                                                   March 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you to express \n     Edison International's opposition to an amendment from Oregon \n     Senator Ron Wyden to the Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 420.\n       As you know, California and the western states have been \n     hard hit by an electricity shortage and dramatic price spikes \n     for the last eight months. Edison has incurred an \n     undercollection of nearly $5.5 billion procuring wholesale \n     power at prices that greatly exceed retail rates in \n     California. In mid-January, after we ran out of credit and \n     stopped payment on most of our outstanding debt, the state \n     stepped in to pick up the funding shortfall for daily power \n     purchases. The state has spent an additional $3 billion in \n     electricity purchases so far.\n       At this moment, California Governor Gray Davis is trying to \n     craft a solution that will get the system working again. \n     Those who hold utility debt, including banks, pension funds, \n     municipalities, retirees and other bondholders, small \n     businesses and electricity generators, have been patient, \n     working with us to avert utility bankruptcy while the state \n     works to resolve these very difficult issues.\n       Unfortunately, the Wyden amendment undermines the solution \n     being crafted within the state. The Wyden amendment would \n     require that, in the event of bankruptcy, the power \n     generators who have made significant profits from this crisis \n     receive full payment before small businesses, banks and \n     bondholders. This is not fair to the other creditors.\n       Furthermore, this amendment could trigger the bankruptcies \n     that everyone is trying to avoid. Other creditors will not \n     stand by and just watch as the amendment takes away their \n     rights.\n       It is Edison's sincerest hope that a comprehensive solution \n     will be crafted that will allow us to make our creditors \n     whole. The state is currently in the midst of delicate \n     negotiations with generators and utilities. The Wyden \n     amendment should not be allowed to disrupt this process, and \n     we thank you for your efforts to oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John E. Bryson,\n     Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             PG Corporation,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, March 8, 2001.\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter addresses the proposed \n     Wyden amendment which would modify the relationship among \n     creditors in some bankruptcies. We are in opposition to this \n     amendment.\n       PG is at a critical point in sensitive negotiations to \n     resolve an energy crisis that is affecting the Western United \n     States. Our creditors have been willing to forbear in the \n     interest of achieving a comprehensive solution that is fair \n     to all parties. This amendment would change the relationship \n     among creditors and could destabilize the fragile cooperation \n     that currently exists.\n       It would be a terrible irony if actions of the United \n     States Government were responsible for tipping this situation \n     over the edge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senate \n         Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Electric Power Supply \n     Association (EPSA) is the national trade group representing \n     competitive power suppliers, both developers of power \n     projects and marketers of electric energy. Our members are \n     active nationally and include many of the companies that \n     produce and market power for the California wholesale market. \n     Few have a greater stake in the orderly and effective \n     resolution of California's electricity crisis than these \n     companies.\n       We are writing to express our deep concern and opposition \n     to an amendment that may be offered by Senator Ron Wyden to \n     the bankruptcy legislation now before the Senate. Our fear is \n     that this amendment could precipitate a financial crisis and \n     exacerbate the already precarious situation in the West.\n       This amendment seeks to give certain entities a favorable \n     status in the event that California utilities fall into \n     bankruptcy. Many companies have provided power to \n     California's consumers and EPSA believes emphatically that \n     all these entities deserve to be fully and fairly \n     compensated. However, it is inappropriate for the Senate to \n     try and create winners and losers in this desperate \n     situation. Rather than orderly resolution, this legislation \n     could lead to a premature declaration of bankruptcy and the \n     inevitable liquidation of the California electric utilities' \n     assets in a legal free-for-all.\n       We urge you to oppose the Wyden amendment. EPSA is prepared \n     to assist you in structuring a more effective remedy to the \n     energy and financial crisis in western wholesale electric \n     power markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lynne H.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Diane: I want to express my sincere appreciation for \n     your efforts on behalf of California as we work to solve the \n     electricity challenge we inherited.\n       We have taken immediate steps to build new power plants. \n     Not one major power plant was built during the 12 years \n     before I was elected. Starting in April, 1999, we have \n     approved 9 plants, with 6 plants under construction, and with \n     3 plants on-line by this summer. Moreover, under my emergency \n     authority, I acted to accelerate and incentive the \n     development of new generation, including distributed \n     generation and peaking facilities, with an aggressive but \n     attainable goal of putting 5000 MW of new power on-line this \n     summer, and another 5000 MW by the summer of 2002.\n       Today, I announced a major energy conservation initiative, \n     the 20/20 Rebate Program, which will reward consumers with a \n     20 percent reduction in their summer 2001 electricity bill if \n     they reduce their use by 20 percent or greater. This program \n     will be the centerpiece of $800 million in energy \n     conservation programs including a $30 million public \n     education program which features conservation messages in 12 \n     media markets throughout California. The state, itself, has \n     initiated electricity conservation programs which have \n     produced an average savings of 8 percent, increasing to over \n     20 percent of its use during stage 2 and 3 alerts.\n       A critical component of the plan to resolve California's \n     energy challenge is the return of our utilities to financial \n     solvency. Our efforts have taken the form of painstaking \n     negotiations between the state and the utilities to stabilize \n     their financial condition. Any attempt to create a special \n     class of debtor under federal bankruptcy laws may have \n     serious repercussions to our efforts.\n       Therefore, I am writing to express my strong opposition to \n     Senator Ron Wyden's amendment to S. 420, the Bankruptcy \n     Reform Act of 2001. Any actions on the part of the United \n     States Senate might very well\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n     undermine all the progress we have made to this point in our \n     negotiations with the utilities. This is a very delicate \n     process and we urge the Senate to allow all parties in \n     California to continue their work together to solve this \n     crisis.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gray Davis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n              International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, SH-720 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We understand the Senate will be voting \n     on an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act (S. 240) today, \n     submitted by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. The International \n     Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) has a number of \n     concerns with this amendment and urges your opposition.\n       The Wyden Amendment would make any debts incurred under a \n     federal order imposed during the power crisis in California \n     non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding. Inevitably, \n     power suppliers would be given preference above other \n     creditors, pushing workers' interests further down the \n     ladder. This looming threat also adds pressure to bargaining \n     efforts during contract negotiations, putting our members at \n     higher financial risk.\n       It is understandable that public agencies who supplied \n     power during the crisis want guarantees for their ratepayers, \n     and should, at just and reasonable rates that cover the cost \n     of producing the power. However, privately owned suppliers \n     took part in predatory behavior during the spot market price \n     spikes, selling electricity at 1,000-3,000 percent profit \n     margins. Should these suppliers who inflated their power \n     prices be the priority in a bankruptcy proceeding? Should \n     small bondholders, workers, pension trust funds and other \n     creditors be left to pick up the crumbs?\n       Governor Gray Davis is working tirelessly to resolve the \n     electricity deregulation disaster in California. We are \n     hoping the state's solution will avert utility bankruptcy and \n     protect workers who could lose their jobs if these delicate \n     negotiations are not successful. We believe the Wyden \n     Amendment could disrupt this fragile process.\n       On behalf of over 800,000 IBEW members and their working \n     families, we urge you to ``OPPOSE'' The Wyden Amendment to S. \n     420.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edwin D. Hill,\n       International President.\n     Jerry J. O'Connor,\n       International Secretary-Treasurer.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there is also a consumer organization, \none that I am familiar with because while I was Mayor of San Francisco \nI had occasion to work with them. This group is The Utility Reform \nNetwork. In their letter they state:\n\n       We are afraid this kind of legislation will harmfully \n     impact whatever negotiations are happening at the State level \n     to strike a balance that would cause all players to make some \n     sort of sacrifice so we can all move forward.\n\n  I have offered the testimony of the Governor of the State of \nCalifornia, who states that, yes, Senator Wyden's amendment would \ninterfere with the negotiations that are going on today. The letter \ngoes on to say:\n\n       Let the bankruptcy laws remain status quo ante, in order to \n     allow the settlement of all claims going forward. The Senate \n     should not modify laws that were in place during this period, \n     in order to choose winners or losers in California's energy \n     debacle. Either there will be a settlement at the State level \n     or the utilities will be forced to bankruptcy.\n\n  That is certainly correct.\n\n       If bankruptcy is the eventual solution, let the Federal \n     bankruptcy judge, applying the laws that were in place during \n     the crisis, resolve the equities.\n\n  I could not agree more, Mr. President.\n  I mentioned that right now the State of California is working \ndiligently to ensure the utilities can make their payments. The State \nis negotiating to purchase the transmission assets of both of the \ninvestor-owned utilities in the State. This will provide an infusion of \nrevenue into the ailing utilities that will enable them to begin to \nrepay their creditors. If this amendment should trigger a run on the \nbank and generators or banks or other creditors find the only way they \ncan protect their rights is to force a bankruptcy, the State of \nCalifornia will not be able to complete its plan to buy these \ntransmission assets and have the utilities pay their debts.\n  I am very hopeful this situation will be resolved in short order. The \nState has already come to preliminary agreements, and these agreements \nwill likely be finalized within the next few months. California's \ncreditors are also hopeful that this process will improve the chances \nthat they will ultimately be repaid for all the debt they have \nincurred.\n\n  I believe the public entities will be repaid. However, let me just \nsay that some in the Northwest have charged that Bonneville Power \nAdministration (BPA) has been forced to drain Federal reservoirs to \nsupply power to California. I want to correct the record because those \ncharges are mistaken.\n  In December 2000, when the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, \nissued the emergency order to Western utilities to sell power to \nCalifornia, BPA helped, but it helped in a way that also benefits the \nNorthwest. It was an energy capacity exchange. In other words, they \nhelped California meet their peak loads. And California, by that \nagreement, sent twice the energy back, using their excess capacity at \nnight. So that helped BPA keep more water in the reservoirs when BPA \nhas stated they really needed it.\n  I am not critical of Senators Wyden and Smith for trying to protect \ntheir State. But what I am saying is, I have read almost a dozen \nletters from debtors and creditors intimately involved in the \nnegotiations, all of whom oppose this. They do so because they believe \nit may well trigger a bankruptcy.\n  I have read from the utilities involved--Southern California Edison, \nPacific Gas and Electric--who also say, wouldn't it be ironic if the \nFederal Government were inadvertently to trigger a bankruptcy?\n  I say to you that to move an amendment such as this at the time of \ncritical negotiations is a huge mistake. I, for one, do not want to be \nresponsible should it truly trigger both of these large investor-owned \nutilities to go into bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to respond just for a few minutes to \nmy colleague from California. I think she knows I admire her \nenormously. I think the Record will show the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and I agree on a vast majority of the issues that come \nbefore the Senate.\n  What is troubling about the argument that is advanced before the \nSenate tonight is that after State officials in California botched the \njob of deregulation--by the way, this was not Senator Feinstein; \nSenator Feinstein did not do that, but State officials in California \nbotched the job--now the message is, the public entities and those \nresponsible to taxpayers are just supposed to trust folks in California \nto hope everything is going to work out. Given the hardship we are \nfacing in the Pacific Northwest, that is just a little much to swallow; \nit is hard for this Senator to swallow, despite the fact that I have \ngreat respect for my colleague from California.\n  I think tonight we have seen--certainly over the course of the last \nhour--that there is a sharp difference of opinion between California's \ntwo Senators on this matter. Senator Boxer worked with us in close \nconsultation. She is in support of this amendment. She believes it is \ngoing to help bring folks together in the West for a comprehensive \nsolution.\n  I think what she is saying is she does not want her State to be a \nscofflaw. She does not want her State to, in effect, be a deadbeat in \nthe course of this whole discussion as the State of California asks the \ndistinguished new Senator from Virginia to be part of an effort--and \nmyself and others--to come up with a comprehensive solution to this \nquestion.\n  The distinguished Senator from California started her presentation by \nreading from some letters from private utilities in California and, in \nparticular, focused on the fact that Southern California Edison is in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The fact is, the Washington Post noted this recently. Southern \nCalifornia Edison actually passed along nearly $5 billion in net income \nto its parent, Edison International, which used the money to pay \ndividends to its shareholders and to repurchase its own stock.\n  So what you have is a private company, Edison International, that my \ncolleague cites tonight as the reason the Senator from Virginia and \nother colleagues should vote against the bipartisan Smith-Wyden \namendment because we are individuals who ought to be concerned about \nSouthern California Edison first.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n  I want Southern California Edison to get a fair shake. That is why we \nmade very clear in our amendment that no one would get a preference if, \nin fact, you had the worst case scenario of an actual bankruptcy \nunfolding in the State of California. I just do not want Southern \nCalifornia Edison and a handful of these private interests to get a \nfree ride. I do not know how it passes the smell test. I think this is \nwhy Senator Boxer agrees with us on this matter.\n  How we can say to the people of the Pacific Northwest, who, in \neffect, got these glowing thank-you letters from Senator Feinstein, \nthat somehow they are not going to be repaid, even though it involves \nonly a few hundred million dollars, may not be a big deal to \nCalifornia, but it is a huge deal to the ratepayers in our area. We are \nconcerned. We always have to make debt repayment to the Federal \nGovernment. These sums make a real difference.\n  So I am very hopeful, as our colleagues overnight reflect on the \ndebate that is being held on the floor of the Senate, that they will \nstand with Senator Smith, Senator Boxer, and myself rather than with \nSouthern California Edison, which has been busy sending billions of \ndollars overseas, when all the rest of us on the west coast have been \ntrying to figure out how to get through a very difficult situation.\n  Mention was made of the fact that this amendment requires out-of-\nState generators to be paid in full before other creditors are paid. \nOur amendment does no such thing. It does no such thing. It only deals \nwith a fraction of the debt that is owed by California utilities. It \nonly requires the debt be repaid at the end of a bankruptcy proceeding \nwhen a plan of reorganization is put in place. If the worst case \nscenario takes place, which we believe our legislation helps to avert, \nthen we will have a measure of fairness in the consideration of how to \nhandle that situation.\n  Senator Feinstein also quoted from out-of-State generators. These are \nthe companies that the Governor of California has called profiteers. \nThose are not my words; those are the words of the Governor of \nCalifornia.\n  So I am sure my colleagues, by this point, are awfully confused about \nthe back and forth. But I do think Senator Feinstein has framed the \ndebate well. On one side are the interests of those directly \nresponsible to taxpayers, those who have no shareholders, nobody who \ncan absorb the cost, nobody who can be involved in some kind of \nsleight-of-hand arrangement where you can send billions of dollars \noverseas.\n  The people who are supporting Senator Boxer, Senator Smith, and \nmyself, and others, do not have those kinds of shareholders involved in \nthose multibillion-dollar deals that were reported in the Washington \nPost.\n  They are standing up for taxpayers. They are the ones who would be \nhelped by this bipartisan amendment. It is very clear, on the basis of \nthe letters that have been read in opposition, that on the other side \nare the interests of these private utilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article outlining \nSouthern California Edison's program to send $5 billion overseas be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\nCalifornia's Utility Sent Parent Firm $4.8 Billion--Audit Results Anger \n                            Consumer Groups\n\n                  (By William Booth and Rene Sanchez)\n\n       Los Angeles, Jan. 30--The first of several audits to be \n     released by the state regulators said that one of \n     California's two nearly bankrupt utilities, Southern \n     California Edison, legally passed along nearly $5 billion in \n     net income to its parent, Edison International, which used \n     the money to pay dividends to its shareholders and to \n     repurchase its own stock.\n       The audit, released Monday night by the California Public \n     Utilities Commission, also showed that Southern California \n     Edison is now broke and so strapped for cash it cannot keep \n     buying electricity at rates higher than it can pass along to \n     consumers.\n       the $4.8 billion was, in part, proceeds from the sale of \n     the Southern California Edison's power plants, which the \n     utility was required to sell under California's 1996 \n     deregulation plan. Deregulation here sought to break up the \n     utility monopolies and open the state up to free-market \n     forces.\n       Consumer advocates--and some elected officials--reacted \n     angrily to the audit, accusing the utilities of pleading \n     poverty and begging for financial assistance from the state \n     to avoid bankruptcy.\n       ``Basically, they took the money and ran,'' John Burton, a \n     Democratic leader of the state Senate from San Francisco, \n     told reporters. ``Had they not done that they would not be in \n     the financial problem they are in. If ratepayers bail them \n     out, ratepayers should get something in return, like power \n     lines or something.''\n       But officials with the utilities said their critics are \n     playing politics and misinterpreting their books. Tom \n     Higgins, senior vice president at Edison International, said: \n     ``There's been no profit, no windfall. This is the recovery \n     of capital investment.''\n       The past profits and current solvency of the state's two \n     struggling utilities are central to California's energy \n     crisis. Most experts agree that the state is suffering from \n     soaring prices and its 15th day of emergency energy rationing \n     because of a failed and dysfunctional deregulatory plan, \n     which allowed wholesale energy prices to soar while capping \n     the rates utility companies could charge consumers. In the \n     past six months, the utilities have gone bust, while \n     wholesale power producers have reaped huge profits.\n       California is fast running out of time to solve its \n     immediate energy crisis. The state already has used up the \n     first $400 million in emergency appropriations for \n     electricity purchases. The Legislature is considering bills \n     to make the state a major buyer of power--and to pass along \n     possible steep increases in costs to consumers. Gov. Gray \n     Davis (D) worked through the weekend trying to hammer out a \n     longer-range plan, but so far the Legislature has passed only \n     emergency measures and decrees--and no long-term solutions.\n       Higgins, the Edison International executive, said Southern \n     California Edison was required to sell off its plants after \n     deregulation in 1996, and that it did so--mostly to out-of-\n     state companies that are now the wholesale suppliers of \n     California's electricity. The utility sold off its gas and \n     coal-fired plants, but retained its nuclear and hydroelectric \n     facilities.\n       The money they got from plant sales, Higgins said, went to \n     pay off the banks that loaned them the cash to build the \n     generating stations and to repay investors and shareholders \n     who also put money into plant construction. The transfer of \n     money occurred from 1996 through last November.\n       ``It's like you have a house and mortgage and you sell the \n     house and you recover your initial investment and then pay \n     off the mortgage,'' Higgins said.\n       Another audit of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the other \n     struggling utility, will be released within days. That \n     results are expected to be similar.\n       ``The only reason this would be controversial is that the \n     consumer groups are trying to rewrite history,'' said John \n     Nelson, a spokesman for PG\n       Nelson said his utility did the same thing as Southern \n     California Edison--it sold plants, paid off loans and sent \n     the rest to its holding company, PG Corp. He would not \n     disclose exactly how much was transferred, but said it is \n     safe to assume a figure of several billion dollars.\n       Consumer advocates around California, however, said it did \n     not matter that the utilities were returning investments to \n     their shareholders, a practice that no one has asserted is \n     financially improper or illegal. Today, they began lobbying \n     state lawmakers to scrap an emerging legislative plan that \n     would cover much of the utilities' purported debts with \n     billions of dollars in publicly financed bonds.\n       ``This confirms what we've been saying all along,'' said \n     Matt Freedman, a director of the Utility Reform Network. \n     ``Edison is not being straight with the public or the \n     Legislature about the extent of its debt.''\n       Freedman also said that the audit shows that in recent \n     months Edison has been selling some of its own generating \n     power back to itself at high prices on the open market, then \n     claiming both profit and debt.\n       ``It's like a laundering scheme,'' he said.\n       Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network said \n     the audit could significantly influence the fastmoving \n     legislative debate on the state's energy crisis. He said that \n     while it was not illegal for the utilities to transfer money \n     to their parent companies, ``the question is, `Was it \n     prudent?' ''\n       But Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert \n     Hertzberg (D), said there are no substantive new revelations \n     in the Edison audit and that the Legislature is proceeding \n     with a plan outlined last Friday that would cover much of the \n     utilities' debts in exchange for the state receiving warrants \n     to buy stock in the companies.\n       ``I don't know that it changes the landscape at all,'' \n     Hefner said, referring to the audits. ``All along we've been \n     saying we're not going to do this and get nothing back. We're \n     driving as hard a bargain as we can.''\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. On the other side of our amendment are exactly those kinds \nof interests, those kinds of powerful private interests. Various \nletters have been read into the Record tonight. Yes, those who oppose \nus are utilities that transferred billions of dollars to the \nshareholders and parent companies and, frankly, don't seem to think \nthat there is anything wrong with doing that while stiffing Bonneville \nPower, the western power administration,\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nitty-bitty municipal utilities, and others.\n  The reason we have been able to put this bipartisan amendment \ntogether is that we have fashioned a narrow approach to ensure that \nthese public entities get a fair shake. We have fashioned an approach \nthat is not going to put in peril a comprehensive effort in the State \nof California to deal with this power situation. In fact, we believe \nthat it will create incentives to actually bring parties together and \nto avert the kind of doomsday scenario that all of us in the Senate \nwant to prevent.\n  The lines are drawn very well. On one side you have Senator Smith and \nSenator Boxer and myself, and on the other side you have Southern \nCalifornia Edison and those representing a handful of multibillion-\ndollar private interests that were intimately involved in creating this \nproblem in the first place.\n  I don't think the Senate ought to be asked, in effect by those who \nbotched the job at the State level several years ago, to just trust \nthem. We ought to take a practical step such as this that is going to \nbring the parties together.\n  Senator Feinstein said: Well, this is without precedent. The fact is, \nthe botched job that California did on energy deregulation is what is \nwithout precedent. If we are going to talk about setting precedents \nthis evening, what we ought to talk about is the fact that in the State \nof Virginia they didn't go about the task of deregulating energy this \nway. Certainly, we didn't do it that way in my State. We believe in \nmarkets. We don't believe in saying, well, you can do one thing for \nwholesale and another thing for retail, but if everything doesn't work \nout, come to the Senate and if somebody tries to make sure you get a \nfair shake when you are sending power under Federal order, we will \nfight it.\n  We don't say things such as that. We say you have to be fair to all \nparties. That is why I am particularly pleased to have the support of \nSenator Smith and Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes occur \nwith respect to the Carnahan amendment No. 40 and the Smith of Oregon \namendment No. 95, and the Wyden amendment No. 78, as amended, if \namended, and the Wellstone amendment No. 36, as modified, at no later \nthan 10:40 a.m. and that at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Senator Wellstone \nbe recognized for up to 10 minutes to be followed by the stacked votes \nas provided in the earlier agreement.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman, prior to the \nvote on the Wyden amendment, be recognized himself for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object for the purpose of asking my \ncolleague a question, I want to make sure I understand my colleague. \nThe first vote on the amendment involving this matter with Pacific \nNorthwest and California would be on the Smith of Oregon perfecting \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend, it was just brought to my \nattention that there could be some parliamentary move, for example, to \ntable the Smith amendment and that, of course, would not be in keeping \nwith what the Senator just said. The intent is to have a vote on or in \nrelation to the Smith amendment first. That would be the regular order.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I did not understand the comments of my distinguished \ncolleague.\n  Mr. REID. In relation to the question asked by the Senator from \nOregon, the Smith amendment is the first amendment that will be called \nup. Someone could move to table that amendment. I am sure the Senator \nunderstood that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I understand that.\n  Mr. REID. We will vote on or in relation to the Smith amendment \nfirst.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, we have an objection to \npart of this on our side, that the Wellstone amendment not be taken up \nbecause we don't have the modification yet.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, the modification has been \nprepared. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \noccur with respect to the Carnahan amendment, No. 40, and the Smith of \nOregon amendment, No. 95, and the Wyden amendment, No. 78, as amended, \nat approximately 10:45 a.m. on Wednesday, and that following the votes, \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Wellstone amendment, No. 36.\n  I further ask consent that at 10:30 a.m. Senator Bingaman be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes for debate and Senator Hagel be \nrecognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  I further ask consent that no second-degree amendments be in order to \nany of the above-listed amendments, where applicable, and there be up \nto 5 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, this has been \na long, arduous task. I appreciate the Senator from Oregon being so \npatient throughout the day. But there are two Senators who came here, \nSenators Durbin and Breaux, who have filed amendments in a timely \nfashion. There are 10 other amendments at the desk. Before I agree to \nthis, I want these amendments just to be called up. It doesn't give \nthem a right to vote or anything, except it is in the stack of these \namendments.\n  These two gentlemen were here tonight and waited. I told them I would \noffer the amendments for them. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to call those two amendments up, No. 93 and No. 94.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request proposed by \nthe Senator from Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Amendments Nos. 93 and 94\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments. The \nlegislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 93.\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Breaux, for \n     himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Johnson, Ms. \n     Landrieu, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska, proposes an amendment numbered 94.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n  (The text of amendment No. 93 is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                            amendment no. 94\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for the reissuance of a rule relating to \n                              ergonomics)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A RULE RELATING TO ERGONOMICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Academy of Sciences issued a report \n     entitled ``Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace--Low \n     Back and Upper Extremities'' on January 18, 2001. The report \n     was issued after the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration promulgated a final rule relating to \n     ergonomics (published at 65 Fed. Reg. 68261 (2000)).\n       (2) According to the National Academy of Sciences, \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the low back and upper \n     extremities are an important and costly national health \n     problem. An estimated 1,000,000 workers each year lose time \n     from work as a result of work-related musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       (3) Conservative estimates of the economic burden imposed \n     by work-related musculoskeletal disorders, as measured by \n     compensation costs, lost wages, and lost productivity, are \n     between $45,000,000,000 and $54,000,000,000 annually.\n       (4) Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act \n     of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to ``assure so far as \n     possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and \n     healthful working conditions,'' and charged the Secretary of \n     Labor with implementing the Act to accomplish this purpose.\n       (5) Promulgation of a standard on workplace ergonomics is \n     needed to address a serious workplace safety and health \n     problem and to protect working men and women from work-\n     related musculoskeletal disorders. Any workplace ergonomics \n     standard should take into account the cost and feasibility of \n     compliance with such requirements and the sound science of \n     the National Academy of Sciences report.\n       (b) Authority To Issue Rule.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\n     Secretary of Labor shall, in accordance with section 6 of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), \n     issue a final rule relating to ergonomics. The standard under \n     the final rule shall take effect not later than 90 days after \n     the date on which the rule is promulgated. The standard \n     shall--\n       (A) address work-related musculoskeletal disorders and \n     workplace ergonomic hazards;\n       (B) not apply to non-work-related musculoskeletal disorders \n     that occur outside the workplace or non-work-related \n     musculoskeletal disorders that are aggravated by work; and\n       (C) set forth in clear terms--\n       (i) the circumstances under which an employer is required \n     to take action to address ergonomic hazards;\n       (ii) the measures required of an employer under the \n     standard; and\n       (iii) the compliance obligations of an employer under the \n     standard.\n       (2) Authorization.--Paragraph (1) shall be considered a \n     specific authorization by Congress in accordance with section \n     801(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to the \n     issuance of a new ergonomic rule.\n       (3) Prohibition.--In issuing a new rule under this \n     subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall ensure that nothing \n     in the rule expands the application of State workers' \n     compensation laws.\n       (4) Standard setting authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to restrict or alter the authority of the \n     Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to adopt health or safety \n     standards (as defined in section 3(8) (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) of \n     such Act) for other hazards pursuant to section 6 (29 U.S.C. \n     655) of such Act.\n       (5) Information and training materials.--The Secretary of \n     Labor shall, prior to the date on which the new rule under \n     this subsection becomes effective, develop information and \n     training materials, and implement an outreach program and \n     other initiatives, to provide compliance assistance to \n     employers and employees concerning the new rule and the \n     requirements under the rule.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 36, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority has received the modified \nWellstone amendment. I ask that his amendment be modified at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 36), as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To disallow certain claims and prohibit coercive debt \n                         collection practices)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. DISALLOWANCE OF CERTAIN CLAIMS.\n\n       In General.--Section 502(b) of title 11, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end of the following:\n       ``(10) such claim arises from a transaction--\n       ``(A) that is--\n       ``(i) a consumer credit transaction;\n       ``(ii) a transaction, for a fee--\n\n       ``(I) in which the deposit of a personal check is deferred; \n     or\n       ``(II) that consists of a credit and a right to a future \n     debit to a personal deposit account; or\n\n       ``(iii) a transaction secured by a motor vehicle or the \n     title to a motor vehicle; and\n       ``(B) in which the annual percentage rate (as determined in \n     accordance with section 107 of the Truth in Lending Act) \n     exceeds 100 percent.''.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 78\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time briefly to make a few \nadditional points on the matter of the California utilities and the \nPacific Northwest getting repaid for the funds it sent California \nduring their period of critical blackouts and other problems this \nwinter.\n  I agree completely with those Senators who have spoken tonight, that \nit is in everyone's interest to come up with an approach that avoids \nbankruptcy. I think that is an area of widespread agreement. Senator \nSmith and I repeatedly have said to Senator Feinstein and others who \nhave had reservations about our approach that we would be open to a \nwide variety of avenues in order to make sure our constituents get a \nfair shake and are repaid.\n  For example, I would be happy this evening, or at another appropriate \ntime before the vote, to accept a perfecting amendment that would give \nCalifornia a reasonable period of time to perfect this comprehensive \napproach that they are pursuing in order to make sure everyone is paid \noff. I think that is very reasonable, and I want to make it clear that \nSenator Smith and I have talked about that in discussions with various \nutilities, and a couple that oppose it. We made it clear we are open to \ngiving California a reasonable period of time to put their agreement \ntogether.\n  But, in effect, what these California utilities have said is that it \nis basically our way or the highway. That just doesn't pass the smell \ntest in the Pacific Northwest and with these public entities that are \nhaving so much difficulty paying their bills. I wish just a few of \nthose thank-you letters we got from California public officials had \nbeen accompanied by checks because the fact is that all over the State \nwe are getting and have gotten these letters from California public \nofficials thanking us, and now tonight we are hearing that we will be \nrepaid for our good deeds by being told that we can't even get a fair \nshake in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  So this is unprecedented, Mr. President. There is no question about \nthat. I am happy to yield to my colleague in a second because she has \nsaid, correctly so, that this is an unprecedented situation. But what I \nbelieve is unprecedented is that after State officials have botched the \njob, they would have the hutzpah to say to my constituents, just trust \nus; we hope everything works out.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may say to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, the point I don't understand is why you feel you won't be paid, \nwhy you feel you have to move ahead with this when everyone involved \nbelieves that moving ahead with it precipitates them to take action to \nforce a bankruptcy, and if a bankruptcy is forced, it is chapter 7, \nwhere the company is dissolved and no one gets paid. That is my problem \nwith this. This is why I believe it is so counterproductive.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I say to my colleague that we are being asked to trust the \npeople who essentially botched the job. And I look at Southern \nCalifornia Edison--my distinguished colleague read something from the \nSouthern California Edison, and I opened my Washington Post recently \nand learned that the Southern California Edison sent $5 billion \noverseas.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from California. I don't think \nshe would have put together what California did in the first place. \nWhere we disagree is that I cannot come to the floor of the Senate \ntonight and say that because I am fond of my colleague from California, \nCalifornia can, in effect, declare bankruptcy and not pay its bills. \nThe Senator's colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said--I think \nvery eloquently--she thought it was just plain fair. That is the way I \nsee it.\n  I think you are going to have important legislation come before the \ncommittee involving rate caps and other approaches. I am going to be \nworking closely with you on those kinds of issues, and Senator Smith is \nas well. But if we now get stiffed, and if we are now told we can't \neven stand in line in a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding under a plan, \nI don't think that passes the basic test of fairness.\n  That is why we are here tonight. The Senator has framed the issue on \nher side--Southern California Edison and several of those significant \nprivate parties who were intimately involved in botching this job. On \nour side: Senator Boxer, Senator Smith, and a variety of public \nentities who believe that, coming out of the chapter 11 bankruptcy \nproceeding, you ought to have something--something--that says you are \ngoing to get repaid.\n  I ask my colleague again tonight, if she were to offer a perfecting \namendment to the one we discussed tonight saying we will give you a \nreasonable period of time to work out your plan, that is yet another \nolive branch which we have been trying to extend over the last couple \nof weeks that might allow the Senate to go forward and approve a \nmeasure of protection for my constituents while at the same time \nshowing that I and other Westerners are going to bend over backwards to \ngive you all a chance to put together your comprehensive approach.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I respond?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that. I appreciate the Senator from \nOregon saying he may postpone his amendment to give the State of \nCalifornia a chance to go forward with its comprehensive remedies. We \ndo have to wait and see.\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I may reclaim my time, what I am saying is we will add \nlanguage to the amendment that says the State of California would get a \nreasonable period of time to work out this comprehensive approach you \nhave pushed for before any of this kicked in, before anything kicked in \nthat would say the people of the Northwest at some point would get \nrepaid.\n  Senator Smith and I will go yet another mile to accommodate the \nconstituents of the Senator from California and say let's pick a \nreasonable period of time. You all work to put together your agreement. \nWe will work cooperatively with you, and if you accept that change, we \ncan let the Senate go home before breakfast time tomorrow morning and \nlet it get about its business.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may respond to the offer of the Senator from \nOregon, I will be happy to take a look at it. The problem I have with \nit is that it does not stop what I am concerned about, which is a run \non the bank; that as soon as creditors find there is an amendment in \nthe bankruptcy legislation which gives a preference to a certain class \nof creditors, they then have to exercise their right and ultimately the \nutility companies will be driven to bankruptcy.\n  I did not enter this letter into the Record. The American Gas \nAssociation just put it the way it is. I do not know whether the time \nsolution proposed by the Senator from Oregon solves this, but ``By \ncreating a preferred class of creditors,'' which your amendment does, \n``in effect the nonpreferred creditors would initiate involuntary \nbankruptcy proceedings against the utility. As the preferred \ncreditors''--those are your entities--``would in actuality control the \nbankruptcy proceedings through their status, in effect chapter 11 \nreorganization would not be an option. Liquidation of assets through \nchapter 7 would result.''\n  That is what I am trying to avoid. No matter what you do, you create \nthis situation of preferred versus nonpreferred so the nonpreferred \nexert their rights now and throw the situation into bankruptcy.\n  This is not me saying it, this is the president and CEO of the \nAmerican Gas Association saying that is what would happen.\n  I do not know whether a time delay solves that basic problem.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If my colleague will let me reclaim my time, again, there \nis absolutely nothing in the four corners of this amendment that would \ngive a preference to Bonneville Power and the other public entities \ninvolved. The fact is Bonneville and the other public entities would \nnot get priority over claims of secured creditors, for example, because \nmy colleague has been speaking about creditors and the utilities \ntonight, and Bonneville gets no preference.\n  All we are saying is that coming out of bankruptcy, there has to be a \nplan to pay back government agencies. It does not say there has to be a \nplan to give the people of the Pacific Northwest first crack. It does \nnot say there has to be a plan making Bonneville, again, a preferred \ncreditor. It just says there must be a piece of paper that makes sure \nthe people to whom you sent that thank-you letter, that really gracious \nthank-you letter where you thanked them in all capital letters--you \nsaid, ``Thank you, Pacific Northwest''--all we are saying is that at \nsome point those people you said thank you to should have something \nthat would indicate they are not going to get stiffed but will \neventually get paid back.\n  I hope overnight our staffs can work together on this point. You are \nright; we do have a philosophical difference, and it was expressed by \nSenator Boxer. Senator Boxer said she did not want the people of her \nState, good and caring people--my colleague knows I went to Stanford, \nso I know something about her State--she did not want the people of her \nState to be essentially scofflaws and not pay their bills.\n  If I may engage my colleague briefly, I want to make clear that \novernight we are anxious to work with you on, for example, the idea of \ngiving you a reasonable period of time before this legislation would \nkick in, and perhaps my colleague has other ideas because over the last \ncouple of weeks we have made it clear that we want to work with her on \nthis.\n  Senator Boxer made the point, and correctly so, that on the west \ncoast ours is a power system that is interconnected. It is a grid that \nserves the people of the West. There is a tangible reason for us to \nwork together.\n  It does not create much confidence, nor build a lot of credibility, \nfor us to come to the floor of the Senate and say: Southern California \nEdison, which sent $5 billion overseas is against what Senator Smith, \nSenator Boxer, and I want to do, and the people of the Pacific \nNorthwest ought to trust them and others who botched the job in the \nfirst place to let it all work out.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If you put a time date in this, why wouldn't that \nencourage certain creditors to beat that date and push into bankruptcy \nahead of that deadline? This is what every bankruptcy attorney with \nwhom I have talked--and I have it right here:\n\n       The inclusion of an effective date may not reduce the \n     likelihood that non-covered creditors would rush the \n     bankruptcy process, but rather could heighten and accelerate \n     that risk because the affected parties will perceive a need \n     to beat the legislative clock while simultaneously trying to \n     amend the legislation.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. If my colleague will allow me to reclaim my time to \nrespond, that is not my first choice. My first choice was what we did \nwith Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer worked very closely with us to narrow \nthis amendment. In order to make sure we had the best possible response \nwith respect to this threat that there could be a great run on the \nbanks and the institutions of California, we narrowed this so it \ninvolves a few hundred million dollars out of $12 billion. In fact, \nthere is a little irony here. The sum of money we are talking about all \ntold is less than the Senator's staff initially indicated they could go \nalong with, but I gather Southern California Edison and some of these \nother folks do not happen to agree.\n\n  Our first choice is to have a very narrow amendment to make sure the \npeople whom California public officials have been thanking get a fair \nshake. It is only because we are anxious to explore other options with \nyou that we thought giving you a reasonable period of time might be \nhelpful.\n  We are prepared to take the consequences of an up-or-down vote on the \nSmith amendment. The choices are clear: Southern California Edison is \nnot with the Smith-Boxer-Wyden amendment. We have established that. It \nhas been read in letters tonight.\n  Those who are with us are these small public entities--the Western \nPower Authority, Bonneville Power, small municipal utilities in \nCalifornia. They are with us. It sets a very bad precedent to say those \norganizations that are responsible to taxpayers can be stiffed through \nthe bankruptcy process.\n  I admire greatly my colleague from California who is here in this \ndiscussion tonight. I make it clear we are prepared to stay until all \nhours of the night toiling on this matter because one issue we both \nagree on is this is of enormous interest to our constituents--those you \nrepresent in California, those I represent in the Pacific Northwest. We \nhave our door open to work with the Senator on other approaches.\n  If that doesn't work, the choice is clear for colleagues tomorrow \nmorning at 10:30. Senator Smith, Senator Boxer, and I have an approach \nthat is narrow and we think will promote negotiations to avoid a \nbankruptcy proceeding. On the other side is Southern California Edison \nand a crowd shipping billions of dollars overseas when they ought to do \ntheir homework to correct a botched job in energy deregulation on the \nwest coast in California.\n  If my colleague from California wants to go back and forth some more \ntonight, we can do that. I have, with Senator Boxer and Senator Smith, \nmade the principal points on our side, and unless my colleague from \nCalifornia wants to engage in further discussion, we can yield back, \nbut I can't yield my time until we have had a chance to respond to any \narguments the Senator has.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will set the record straight. This \nis not just Southern California Edison or PG There is virtually no \ncreditor or\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\ndebtor that is in support of the Wyden amendment. Not even the \nBonneville Power Administration has written a letter in support of this \namendment. There is a reason why they are not in support of this \namendment. Once you create a preferred class of creditors, you prompt \nthe breaking of the dam and other creditors will force an involuntary \nbankruptcy.\n  If that happens, it is the wrong chapter. It is chapter 7. It is \ndisillusion. It means the utilities get out of the business of \ndistributing power.\n  This is why this amendment is so dangerous. If the Senator can show \nme some of these authorities that think this kind of change of \nbankruptcy law in the middle of what is an extraordinarily precarious \nsituation is a good thing, I may relent.\n  I have introduced about a dozen letters, not just from Southern \nCalifornia Edison but from creditors, big and small. One of the rumors \non the street is that many of the renewable power generators--the wind \nand solar generating firms for example--are most concerned and would \ntherefore press bankruptcy should this amendment pass.\n  To get involved in the State's healing process is extraordinarily \ndangerous. That is my argument. I am not sure simply extending the time \nobviates the argument I am making. I have virtually every one of these \nletters that say in so many words, don't force them to exercise their \nrights to push these companies into bankruptcy. That is what this \namendment does.\n  I find it very hard when my distinguished colleague says it is just \none utility advocating against his amendment. It is not. It is the big \ngenerators, the small generators, it is virtually everybody involved in \nthis situation who says, let us try to work it out with the State. Let \nthe State buy these transmission lines. That will inject billions to \npay creditors.\n  If you vitiate or abrogate it by creating a preferred class of \ncreditor, you will encourage other creditors to push for bankruptcy. \nThere are literary hundreds of creditors, huge banks, small banks.\n  I understand the Senator is trying to do something for his State. I \nunderstand that. It is incomprehensible to me to think the Bonneville \nPower Administration isn't going to get paid back. I believe they will. \nI believe if you amend bankruptcy law to provide for it, you simply \ncause a reaction from the other creditors that I think can be \ndevastating.\n\n  That is the sum and substance of my argument. I have tried to \nindicate that with a large number of letters. I regret if anyone thinks \nthis is just one utility advocating against this amendment. It is not. \nIt is virtually the entire creditor community.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again to set the record straight, when my \ncolleague came to the floor tonight, the first thing she said was, what \ndo the two private utilities affected by this think?\n  That is clearly what this debate is all about in terms of those who \nare opposed. Yes, Southern California Edison and PG are opposed. The \ncrowd who botched the job of energy deregulation, the State of \nCalifornia, is prepared to oppose something such as this. My colleague \nfrom California said this is a dangerous amendment. What is really \ndangerous is what California has already done to the American people \nbecause the fact is, what California has already done to the American \npeople is put in a set of energy decisions that have great implications \nfor the whole country, not just those in the West.\n  The President of the Senate is from Nevada; I am from Oregon. It will \nhave ripples all the way through our country. That is what California \nhas already done.\n  The crowd that has botched this and engaged in this conduct, by my \ncalculation, is pretty close to political malpractice if you look at \nhow they went about deregulating energy, deregulating only one part in \none way, leaving another part alone. Now they come to the floor of the \nSenate and they say, trust us even though they have already been \ndickering about it for months and months; we are going to be able to \nput together a $12 billion comprehensive settlement. But you in the \nPacific Northwest and the public entities that Senator Boxer talked \nabout, despite the fact that these organizations involve just a few \nhundred million dollars as part of a $12 billion plan, trust us because \neverything will work out in the end.\n  That is a bit too much to swallow. Tomorrow when we vote --and we are \nopen to working with our colleague from California this evening--I hope \nthe Senate will stand with Senator Smith, Senator Boxer, and myself. We \nare of the view that our amendment is about simple, basic fairness. \nNobody is given a preference in bankruptcy under this legislation. In \nfact, no one in the course of this debate that has gone on now for \nseveral hours has once pointed to any language in the amendment that \nprovides a preference to Bonneville or anyone else.\n  I wrap up by way of saying I will assume my colleague from California \nmisspoke. The Bonneville Power Administration is for this. We have been \nworking with them constantly. The Northwest Power Planning Council is \nfor this. Bonneville Power, for example, is faced with a situation \nwhere they will have to make debt repayment before long.\n  They badly need this money. So this is about the small public \nentities in California that Senator Boxer spoke about. It is about the \nmunicipal energy entities all up and down the west coast. You bet \nsouthern California is against us on this. I hope my colleagues will \nstand with Senator Boxer and Senator Smith and I at 10:30.\n  I will again invite my colleague to discuss this further. I will \nrespond to any other arguments. Whenever she finishes, perhaps I can \nmake my closing arguments and we can wrap this up.\n  Would my colleague like me to yield to her?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to respond.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would you like me to yield or do you wish your own time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't believe there is a time agreement. If the \nSenator has concluded his remarks, I would like an opportunity to \nconclude mine.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, a lot has been said tonight. Let me \nexpress what did happen.\n  In 1996, the State of California passed a deregulation law. \nRepublicans and Democrats voted for that law. A Republican Governor \nsigned the law. The law was badly flawed. It essentially deregulated \nthe wholesale end of power and kept regulated the retail end. That was \na mistake.\n  Additionally, it provided that 95 percent of the power of California \nwould have to be bought on the spot or day-ahead market. It prevented \nthe bilateral, long-term contracts which are a key part of the solution \nfor California. And the flawed deregulation plan said that California \nhad to buy power through something called a power exchange, which \nactually guaranteed a higher price for power. And the plan said that \nthe utilities which had generation facilities would have to divest \nthemselves of those generation facilities.\n  The law was a gamble. It gambled that spot power would be cheaper to \nbuy than the price of bilateral contracts. In fact, that was not the \ncase. There was not enough power supply to meet the demand, so the spot \npower prices rose dramatically.\n  I am one who strongly believes that you have to fix the marketplace; \nthat you cannot deregulate on the wholesale end and not also deregulate \non the retail end. Possible solutions include establishing a baseline \nrate, or realtime pricing, or tiered pricing, or something else. These \npossibilities would create an incentive for conservation and, in the \nlong term, corrects the flawed power market.\n  The remedies before the State are slightly different than the way I \nwould have gone. It does not mean it is better or worse, but it is a \ndifferent way. Up to this point, the State has spent $3.9 billion in \nbuying power. The State of California is willing to authorize funds to \nbuy the transmission lines to enable the utilities to then secure their \ndebt.\n  It is very easy to point fingers. It is very easy to castigate. It is \nvery easy to call the State a lot of names. Nonetheless, I think the \nState should have the opportunity to work this situation out.\n  There is the rub. This amendment does not basically allow that \nbecause either advertently or inadvertently, it\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\ncreates a situation to which others will respond by driving the utility \ncompanies to bankruptcy.\n  Let there be no doubt--in my mind there is no doubt--that others will \nrespond to this situation by pushing these companies into bankruptcy. \nIf they have to go into bankruptcy, they are not going to go into 11 or \n13 to repay the debt. They are going to go into 7 to dissolve the debt \nand simply get out of the business of power distribution. So I am \nafraid that Senator Wyden, Senator Smith, and even my colleague from \nthe State of California, Senator Boxer--I am afraid this is going to be \ncounterproductive and it is going to produce something which can be \ndevastating to everyone.\n\n  If it were just me alone who said that, I would be too timid to stand \nup here and say that. I am joined by virtually all of the debtor and \ncreditor community in saying it. I am even joined by some of the public \nutilities that Senator Wyden seeks to protect. The largest city in the \nState, Los Angeles, which produces its own power, does not support this \nbecause the city is worried about the same thing I am worried about.\n  I say give the State the time. Senator Wyden and I do appreciate \nthis--says, all right, we will work with you to create a time. I would \nlike an opportunity to see if that is possible without launching the \nassault on bankruptcy that I am afraid will come out of the passage of \nthe Wyden-Smith amendment.\n  I represent the sixth largest economic power on Earth. If these \nutilities go into bankruptcy, as Senator Murkowski pointed out, it \nimpacts hundreds of thousands of investors who have invested in the \nutilities, public retirement funds, other companies as well. It creates \na situation which I think will have a major negative economic impact \nthroughout the rest of the United States.\n  If the State were not assiduously trying to work out this problem, I \nwouldn't feel so strongly. If there was nothing being done to solve the \nproblem, I wouldn't feel so strongly. But two utilities have agreed \nwith the State on terms to purchase the transmission lines. Therefore, \nwhen the remainder of that purchase is completed, there will be the \nmoney available to pay Bonneville, to pay the Western Power \nAssociation, to pay the cogenerators, to pay other generators, to pay \nthe natural gas suppliers. And I hope in the securitization of the back \ndebt, the banks, the large New York banks will also feel that the \narrangements are in place to see that they will get paid back. \nBankruptcy, I do not believe, will solve this problem.\n  The degree to which this amendment would push these companies into \nbankruptcy, I think, is a gamble that is very unwise to take at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief, but I want to just respond \nto several of the arguments made by my distinguished colleague. My \ncolleague said, for example, that this is going to have real \nramifications for the economic well-being of her State. The fact is, \nwhat the State of California has already done has already had a major \neconomic impact on my State and on the people of the Pacific Northwest. \nUnder very difficult circumstances we sent additional power to \nCalifornia which generated these glowing thank-you notes from my \ncolleagues and various California public officials.\n  So my colleague from California envisages some economic trouble in \nher State. We are already seeing it and it is compounded by the fact \nthat we have been more than a good neighbor. What it is all about on \nthe west coast, as my colleague from Nevada knows, is we have an \ninterconnected power system. We have been more than a good neighbor, \nand we are suffering economic hardship as a result.\n  My colleague also said that California is owed the opportunity. Those \nwere her words: The State of California is owed the opportunity to work \nout this matter.\n  There is no question in my mind that they should have the opportunity \nto work it out. But they should not get a free ride. They should have \nto be part of an effort, as Senator Boxer said this evening, to bring \nthe parties together as we have sought to do with our very narrow \namendment we offered this evening.\n  Finally, my colleague says that somehow the amendment put together by \nSenator Smith and Senator Boxer and I, in her words, has launched an \nassault on the State of California.\n  That is pretty incendiary oratory, in terms of this whole debate. \nBut, again, I submit if there has been an assault that has been \nlaunched, it was what was done in the State of California. It was not \nsomething that came about because the Senators from Oregon, working \nwith the Senator from California, tried to figure out a way to make \nsure there was a modest measure of protection for our constituents. It \nis not a proposal that moved Bonneville Power to the head of the line, \nnot a proposal that gives our constituents a free ride, the way \nSouthern California Edison seems to want, but something that ensures \nthat we do get a fair shake.\n\n  I am very hopeful my colleagues will see that there has been an \neffort on the part of the sponsors of this particular amendment. The \nfirst vote will be on the Smith amendment tomorrow morning at 10:30 or \nthereabouts. It is an amendment that was perfected by Senator Boxer so \nas to ensure that this would not create a greater opportunity for \nbankruptcy to take place.\n  It was designed to make sure that the parties had a reason to \nnegotiate. I fear that if this particular proposal goes down, this \ngives a green light to the private interests that are opposing this \ntonight, to know they basically got the votes on the floor of the \nSenate to work their will on any of these major issues.\n  This is going to be a big vote, it seems to me. It is important for \nus in the Pacific Northwest. But for anybody who reads the Washington \nPost--and I put the article in the Record--the people who are opposing \nthis amendment are folks who are sending billions of dollars overseas \nrather than trying to take care of business here at home.\n  The lines are drawn with respect to who is with us and who is not. \nThose who are responsible to taxpayers and have to make Treasury \npayments in small California municipal utilities are with us. This is \nabout one proposition, and one proposition only, and that is basic \nfairness for all concerned in dealing with a difficult issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Smith amendment that \nwill come up in the morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 27, as modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to table an \namendment that had been offered by Senator Feinstein regarding credit \ncards for young adults. This amendment would have required a $2,500 cap \non credit card limits to anyone under the age of 21 unless they have a \nsignature from their parent or can provide financial documents that \nestablish their independent means of repaying their bills. I opposed \nthis amendment because I am concerned that the age limit is arbitrary \nand could be unfair to many hard working Americans.\n  I understand the concern that has been raised by many regarding \ncredit card companies that blanket college campuses with brochures and \nsolicitations. I agree that credit card companies have some \nresponsibility in limiting credit to those who have no income. But I \nbelieve that the amendment that was offered today was not a good way to \nsolve that problem.\n  There are many people who are still in school at age 21. But there \nare many more who are holding down full time jobs, working to start a \nfamily, and deserve to have financial tools available to them, \nincluding credit cards without artificial credit limits. A 19-year-old \nNorth Dakotan can vote, serve in the military, and is considered an \nadult under state and federal laws. This amendment would create new \nhoops for that young person to access a credit card with a limit over \n$2,500. This is not a fair approach and is not an appropriate solution \nto the problem that the amendment's supporters are trying to solve.\n  Credit card companies have a role to play as we reform bankruptcy \nlaws. They should be held accountable for offering credit responsibly. \nBut this amendment missed its mark. A person under the age of 21 should \nbe able to have and use credit cards if they are working and have an \nincome. For this reason, I opposed the amendment and supported the \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted in favor of Mrs. Feinstein's\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\namendment to the bankruptcy reform bill that would limit the amount of \ncredit that credit card companies can extend to underage consumers. For \nthe benefit of my West Virginia constituents, I offer a brief \nexplanation of my vote.\n  I supported the Feinstein amendment because I agree with the general \nphilosophy behind it. Credit card companies are far too willing to \noffer credit cards to young, financially-inexperienced consumers. Many \nof these young consumers are college students without any income or \ncredit history. Too often these young consumers get in over their head \nwhen credit card companies offer unlimited credit to buy whatever they \nwant, whenever they want. The Feinstein amendment is a commonsense \napproach that would restrict the amount of credit that could be offered \nto these young consumers, unless they gain parental approval or are \nable to demonstrate their financial independence.\n  However, I disagree that $2,500 is an adequate credit limit for \nprotecting underage consumers. My own view is that this amount is too \nhigh. I would prefer to see a $500 credit limit. Even with a credit \nlimit of $2,500, young consumers are at risk of accumulating massive \ncredit card debt without the ability to repay it. A smaller credit card \nlimit is more likely to reduce this risk.\n  My hope is that, even though the Senate rejected this amendment, \ncredit card companies will take it upon themselves to more carefully \nscrutinize to whom they are extending credit, and reign in their credit \noffers when necessary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this morning the Senate briefly debated \nand tabled the Feinstein amendment No. 27 to S. 420, the bankruptcy \nreform bill. I was unable to make that vote this morning, but I did \nwant to make a brief statement for the record to register my opposition \nto the amendment. Under the Feinstein amendment, credit card companies \nwould be forced to limit the debt a minor can carry on a credit card to \n$2,500, unless the minor demonstrates a means to pay back the debt or a \nparent cosigns for the debt. I oppose this amendment as unnecessary \ngovernment intervention in the marketplace. Washington has no place in \nlimiting or determining the financial needs of students and their \nability to repay loans. The government has an abysmal track record when \nit meddles in the marketplace, and I strongly believe that these \ndecisions should be made by individuals and families, not by the \nfederal government.\n\n\n                           Financial Privacy\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I planned to offer an amendment to this \nbankruptcy bill to protect financial privacy and prevent identity theft \nin electronic bankruptcy court records. I thank Senators Sarbanes, \nHarkin, Schumer, and Rockefeller for agreeing to cosponsor this \namendment.\n  This amendment addressed just a single area where the Federal \nGovernment, here, the Bankruptcy Courts, holds significant amounts of \nhighly personal information, which is freely available for any person \nfor any reason to access and use. The manner in which all three \nbranches of the Federal Government, the Federal agencies, the Congress \nand the Judiciary, protect the privacy of personal information that \nAmericans are required to divulge to the government, is an important \narea that needs our attention. I thank the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for agreeing to work with me on addressing the problem in a \nmore comprehensive manner.\n  Mr. HATCH. My distinguished colleague makes a good point, and one \nwhere we both agree on, and frankly, it is something on which there is \nbipartisan interest. The issue of privacy, both online and offline, is \nsomething that we have discussed together and both agree that the \nCommittee should examine, and will be examining, the current legal \nframework for privacy protection and determine where improvements can \nand should be made. This is an important matter on which we have agreed \nto hold hearings and move forward with legislative proposals, where \nappropriate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While much attention has been focused on online privacy \nand the use of personally identifiable information by commercial web \nsites, the Federal Government is a huge repository of personal \ninformation in both paper and electronic form. Balancing the important \ninterests of public access to government records with privacy \nprotection for personal information is not always easy to do.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree, this is a difficult subject, but one we must \ntackle and I believe as policy-makers, Congress has an important role \nto play in making sure this balance is done properly. It is becoming \nincreasingly more important as we see government using technology to \nbecome more efficient, more user friendly, and we need to be sure that \nthe new ease of use of government resources do not compromise the \ncitizenry's privacy expectations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The federal judiciary is grappling with the issue of how \nto put additional court filings online while providing appropriate \nlevels of privacy protection and security for the information in those \nrecords. Bankruptcy records, for example, contain all kinds of highly \nsensitive personal and financial information, including social \nsecurity, bank and credit card account numbers; medical history; and \nchild support and alimony information. This information may pertain to \nthe debtor but also to many other people who are creditors or simply \nassociated or employed by the debtor. These records have traditionally \nbeen available to the public for perusal by individuals who went to the \ncourt house, requested the records, and physically reviewed the hard \ncopies. This was an open process, but it was cumbersome. The \ninefficiency of obtaining data provided its own protective shield. For \nthe most part, only those with a legitimate interest in bankruptcy \ncourt data took the trouble to collect it.\n  As courts increasingly go online, however, personal information such \nas that contained in court filings may be posted on the Internet \navailable for some legitimate uses but also vulnerable to misuse or \nobjectionable re-use. In some cases, personal information of parties \nwith only limited interest in a bankruptcy case can be widely \ndistributed and posted online. Last August, for example, employees of \nan Internet retailer were shocked to learn that their salaries, \nbonuses, stock-option information, and home addresses were posted on \nthe Web. Their employer, Living.com, had filed for bankruptcy and \nsubmitted all corporate financial data to the courts. Then, at the \nrequest of the company's creditors, the trustee in the case posted this \nhighly personal data, information about employees, not about debtors, \non the Web. In an unusual twist, the home addresses of 1,000 of \nLiving.com's creditors were also posted on the Internet. The Living.com \ncase demonstrates the risks of automatic electronic disclosure of data, \nthreats that can befall not just debtors, but employees and even \ncreditors.\n  Federal agencies could also do a better job of protecting the privacy \nof those who do business with or seek help or information from the \ngovernment. A recent GAO study reports that while most major federal \nagency sites post privacy notices, many do not do so on pages that \ncollect personal information and few satisfy the principles of notice, \nchoice, security and access that the Federal Trade Commission believe \nshould be met by commercial sites. Moreover, the Privacy Act has not \nbeen seriously examined or updated for over twenty years. It is not \ndoing the job it was originally intended to do of protecting the \nprivacy of personal information provided to and held by the government. \nI look forward to working with the Chairman on addressing these and \nother important privacy issues in this Congress.\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly share your concerns regarding the privacy \nimplications of government actions. I should note that I understand the \nJudicial Conference is also looking at this issue, but it is clearly \none that we must oversee as it raises important policy issues, as well \nas important First Amendment and Fourth Amendment concerns. In the \nbankruptcy context, I should state that I believe it is critical that a \ndelicate balance be established between the privacy interest of the \ndebtor who seeks to take the privilege afforded under our bankruptcy \nlaws, and the need in the case of bankruptcies for creditors whose \ndebts are being extinguished, as well as those who enforce against \nfraud in our bankruptcy system, to obtain information about the debtor \nand the bankruptcy case. A fair\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nbalancing of these competing concerns is critical, and one that the \nCongress, and particularly the Judiciary Committee, must take an active \nrole.\n  I think that there is no question that making sure the privacy \npolicies and practices of the Federal Government is important.

Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues a \nletter that Representatives Gephardt, Lantos, Skelton, Senators Biden \nand Levin, and I recently sent to President Bush. The letter outlines \nour support for efforts to work with our South Korean friends to \naddress the threats to our security emanating from North Korea.\n  Like President Bush, we harbor no illusions about the challenges \nposed by the North Korean government. To say North Korea's actions the \npast several decades have greatly troubled the United States and the \nworld is an understatement. However, we also recognize that we cannot \nsimply ignore the challenges the current regime poses for the \ninternational community; the stakes, which include the proliferation of \nmissile technology, are simply too high.\n  Last week Secretary Powell publicly recognized that the Clinton \nAdministration made progress in addressing the threats posed by North \nKorea. We agree with that assessment. We believe the record shows that \nthe Clinton Administration fell just short of reaching a comprehensive \nagreement with the North Koreans that would have dramatically reduced \ntensions between the two Koreas and between North Korea and the rest of \nthe world.\n  Given the urgency of these threats and the fact that a breakthrough \nappeared imminent just months ago, it is in the U.S. national interest \nto pursue additional discussions with the North Koreans. Only by \nallowing our negotiators to sit down with their North Korean \ncounterparts will we be able to determine whether that recent progress \ncontains the seeds of a comprehensive and verifiable agreement with \nNorth Korea.\n  Let us be clear. The burden here is on the North Koreans to prove \nthat they will join the international community. We may find that a \ndeal is not possible. But to walk away from that effort now, without \nknowing whether a deal is possible, is to pass up an opportunity to \naddress a principal threat to the United States and to our friends in \nthe region, South Korea chief among them.\n  We urge the President to work with President Kim and our South Korean \nfriends--with our strong support--to test North Korea's commitment to \npeace through a comprehensive and verifiable agreement on its nuclear \nand missile activity. The stakes are too high and the issues too urgent \nto do otherwise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nMarch 6, 2001.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2001.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing in regard to your \n     upcoming meeting with Republic of Korea President Kim Dae \n     Jung. Korea is a steadfast ally in a strategic part of the \n     world, and we are pleased you will meet with President Kim \n     early in your administration.\n       We understand that President Kim's efforts toward \n     rapproachement with North Korea will be a subject of your \n     meeting. In the context of those efforts, late last year \n     North Korea suggested it may be ready to permanently address \n     U.S. and allied concerns regarding its nuclear and missile \n     capability--a major destabilizing force in East Asia and a \n     principal threat to the security of the U.S. and its allies \n     in the region.\n       Your meeting with President Kim offers an opportunity to \n     stand with our South Korean friends to test whether North \n     Korea is indeed committed to peace. Given North Korea's often \n     far-reaching demands and record of disregarding international \n     norms, we are under no illusions about the difficulty of \n     getting comprehensive and verifiable agreements with North \n     Korea that address our concerns about its current and future \n     nuclear and ballistic missile activities. We believe, \n     however, the stakes are high and the issues involved demand \n     urgent attention, and it is evident to us that the continued \n     engagement of the U.S. Government on this matter could serve \n     to reduce a serious potential threat to our national \n     security.\n       We therefore hope you thoroughly explore the possibility of \n     reaching agreements that are in our national interest, and \n     ask that you clearly demonstrate to President Kim our \n     government's ongoing commitment to working constructively \n     with the Republic of Korea to confront this major strategic \n     challenge.\n       Should you choose this path to work with the Republic of \n     Korea to address these critical concerns, we stand ready to \n     support you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sen.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my deepest \nsympathy to the Indian people for the recent loss of life and property \ndue to the recent earthquake in their country. On January 26, the \npeople of Gujarat in western India were hit with an earthquake the size \nand devastation of that which hit San Francisco in 1906. The earthquake \nin Gujarat killed more than 30,000, injured more than 100,000, and \ndisplaced more than a half million men, women, and children. My \nthoughts and prayers, and those of many Americans, are with them at \nthis difficult time.\n  The people of India have been valuable friends to America, and a \nnumber of Indians call this country their home. Unfortunately, tragic \nevents like these show how quickly loved ones and friends can be take \nfrom us. However, it is also through despair and tears that people \noften find humanity and caring.\n  The damage to the region is expected to exceed $5.5 billion. In the \nface of such a catastrophe, it is imperative that the global community \nactively respond. I am heartened to see the outpouring of assistance \nthat nations around the globe, and countless non-governmental \norganizations, have offered to India. Our own government will continue \nto offer our support to the victims of this earthquake, and I encourage \nPresident Bush to offer any needed additional assistance as they begin \nthe process of rebuilding shattered homes and lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2214-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2214-S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE DEPARTURE OF A DEAR FRIEND, KRISTINE ``IVO'' IVERSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of my very dear staffers is about to \nleave the Senate, a wonderful woman who has given a great deal of her \ntime and love--indeed, a great deal of her life--to me, my office, the \ncitizens of Utah, the county, and indeed, to this grand and honored \ninstitution, the Senate of the United States.\n  It is almost impossible for me to believe, but, after nearly a \nquarter of a\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\ncentury, Kristine Iverson's last working day in my office has now come \nupon us.\n  I can still remember that day in 1976, when a young Illinois native--\njust two years out of DePauw University--when that young lady came to \nmy office, resume in hand, seeking a position as a legislative \ncorrespondent. Kris got that job, and it was one of the best moves I \nmade.\n  Kris joined my staff in 1977 as a legislative correspondent. But her \nintelligence, dedication, warm heart and incredible ability to grasp \nall the intricacies of the legislative process quickly propelled her to \na series of top positions in my office and on the Labor Committee.\n  And for the past 24 years, day in and day out, we have always been \nable to count on Kris Iverson. Night after night, year after year, she \nwas the first one in and the last one to leave.\n  In short, we have grown gray together.\n  Over the years, Kris has worn many hats: Legislative Assistant, Labor \nCommittee Policy Director, Labor Committee Minority Staff Director, and \nnow Legislative Director.\n  In every position she served admirably and won the utmost respect \nfrom her colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Most recently, Kris has served without peer in one of the most \ndifficult and challenging positions in the office of any Senator--\nlegislative director. In that position, she has served with an \nunmatchable commitment to the Senate and indeed the very Congress of \nthe United States.\n  We all know how important it is to have a Legislative Director who we \ncan trust to take our legislative priorities and help us direct them \nthrough the Byzantine maze of the legislative process.\n  Kris has been responsible for shepherding every piece of legislation \nthat I sponsored. Beyond that, she was also responsible for helping to \ndirect the legislative activities of both my personal staff and the \nJudiciary Committee staff.\n  Not only has Kris--or ``Ivo'' as we endearingly refer to her--earned \nmy undying respect and admiration, but she is also highly admired by \nmany in this body for her honesty, her work-ethic and her analytical \nskills.\n  When I think of many of the great laws in this nation the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant Act of 1990, the Women in Science Act, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, the Job Training Partnership Act or \nJTPA, the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP all of these \ngreat laws reflect Kris Iverson's substantial mark.\n  Kris was there--in fact, Ivo was the lead staffer--on my first law, \nthe National Ski Patrol Federal Charter, signed by Carter in 1980.\n  We often joke that she has files older than many of our staffers, and \nI'm sorry to say, it's true!\n  Unfortunately for us, her reputation has carried all the way to the \nWhite House where President George W. Bush has announced his intent to \nnominate her to one of the highest positions in the Department of \nLabor.\n  If all goes as planned--and I know it will--very shortly Kris will \nbecome the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Congressional and \nIntergovernmental Affairs.\n  Her only obstacle is confirmation by this august body . . . and I am \ncounting on my colleagues to give her their support. Unanimous support!\n  I know that in that very important office, she will serve Secretary \nChao with the same dedication and spirit. Clearly, being appointed by \nthe President of our great nation to such a position is a tremendous \nhonor and a tribute to her.\n  A great writer once said:\n\n       Give us an individual of integrity, on whom we know we can \n     thoroughly depend; who will stand firm when others fail; the \n     friend, faithful and true; the advisor, honest and fearless; \n     the adversary, just and chivalrous: such an one is the \n     fragment of the Rock of Ages.--J.P. Stanley\n\n  Ivo has been such a faithful and true ``rock'' of our office. I \ncannot put into words how much she will be missed, not only by my staff \nbut also by the Senate as a whole.\n  And of course, she will be greatly missed by me.\n  I have considered her my right-hand counselor and advisor. I have \nrelied on her on a daily, if not hourly basis.\n  We have come to count on Kris to do it all. From proper placement of \ncommas . . . to strategy on the most important legislative initiatives \n. . . Kris does it, and does it well.\n  Dozens, if not hundreds, of people throughout Washington and the \nnation were mentored by Kris Iverson, and under her gentle tutelage \nhave gone on to lead successful careers.\n  When the times were hard or the seas were rough, Kris was there with \na steady and unbending hand to guide us on the proper course. She was \nour captain, our Mother Superior, our eye in the storm, our calm center \nin a sea of chaos.\n  I must say that I am very saddened by her departure. But I am very, \nvery happy and proud of her accomplishments and most importantly, of \nthis tremendous appointment to a place where I know that she will \ncontinue to honor and serve her country with dignity and respect.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing Kris well, in \nexpressing our love and gratitude for her service to us.\n  There is no doubt in our minds that she will move on to even greater \nheights as she continues to serve our government and our President.\n  Mr. President, I have had a lot of people serve with me throughout \nthe years, a lot of really good people I love, adore, appreciate, and \nhonor. I have had no one serve with me who did a better job or gave \nmore to this institution and to our country than Kris Iverson. I felt \nvery much like I had to make this statement at this time before Kris \nleaves. She is sitting right beside me, and I am very, very proud of \nher.\n  I yield to my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to my colleague for the \npurpose of making this statement, although I had no idea what the \nsubject matter was going to be. I feel fortunate to have been on the \nfloor when I discovered it was going to be about Kris Iverson, with \nwhom I have worked now for some 15 or 16 years, going back to the mid-\n1980s when Senator Hatch and I authored the child care development \nblock grant.\n  Kris Iverson did the initial work for Senator Hatch on that \nlegislation, working with a fellow from my office who has been at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services over the last number of years. \nI thank Kris.\n  Coming from the other side of the aisle here, I didn't have the \nprivilege of working with her every day, but on the days that I did, I \ncame to know her as a highly competent, serious individual of deep \nconvictions, who understands issues very, very well, appreciates the \nrole of government, and that bright and talented people can make a \ncontribution.\n  We are going to miss you, I say to Kris Iverson, here in the Senate, \nalthough we are not going to lose you entirely from public service. So \non behalf of those of us on this side of the aisle--we don't want to \nruin your reputation in Republican circles--but we thank you as well \nfor a job very well done on behalf of all Americans. We are lucky to \nhave had you serve the Senate and certainly the interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks \nbecause he knows how hard we worked together on the child care \ndevelopment block grant, and a whole raft of other issues. Kris has \ndone such a great job, and I am honored to have her sit beside me for \nthe last time in the Senate. We are very proud of her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2215-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2215-S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING JIM O'ROURKE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nConnecticut State Representative Jim O'Rourke on being named the \nIrishman of the Year by the Portland-Middletown Ancient Order of \nHibernians, an Irish-American organization with a tradition of service \nto the community.\n  Jim O'Rourke, born in Boston, MA, has served the people of \nConnecticut for most of his adult life. He is a graduate of Manchester \nHigh School and earned a Bachelors Degree in Political Science at the \nUniversity of Connecticut. While at the University of\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nConnecticut, Jim developed a deep passion for issues affecting the \nenvironment, consumer protection, and education, serving as Chairman of \nthe statewide Connecticut Public Interest Research Group and later as \nChairman of the Connecticut Environmental Caucus.\n  For the past 11 years, as a member of the Connecticut State House of \nRepresentatives, Representative O'Rourke has been a champion of \ninitiatives aimed at providing cleaner air and water for the people of \nCromwell, Portland, and Middletown. Last month, he hosted the \nConnecticut Coalition for Clean Air, CCCA, a partnership of private, \nState, and local government officials committed to educating the public \nwhile providing solutions to pollution concerns throughout the State. \nJim believes that pollution of our air and waterways is more than just \nan environmental problem, it is a public health concern. Representative \nO'Rourke's leadership on these vital issues has earned him wide respect \namong his colleagues. In fact, one indication of the high regard Jim's \ncolleagues have for him is that he was chosen to serve as Assistant \nMajority Leader of the Connecticut House of Representatives earlier \nthis year.\n  Jim O'Rourke has made numerous contributions to his community. His \ntireless work on behalf of children and families there and throughout \nConnecticut is never-ending. He works as Assistant Development Director \nof The Connection, a non-profit service and community development \norganization which provides counsel to low and moderate-income families \nseeking to purchase their first home. It also provides important \ntreatment services for underprivileged families and persons in need of \ncounseling.\n  Mr. O'Rourke is an active member of the Portland-Middletown division \nof the Connecticut Ancient Order of Hibernians, having been granted the \nthird degree prior to his latest achievement. The Order has been an \nintegral part of Irish-American life since its North American branch \nwas founded in 1836 in New York City, it is now the largest of all \nIrish Social Societies in the United States. Jim O'Rourke is also a \nmember of the Cromwell Kiwanis Club and the DeSoto Council Cromwell \nKnights of Columbus. He serves as president of the statewide People's \nAction for Clean Energy, an organization committed to energy \nconservation and a clean and healthy environment.\n  As a result of his endeavors, Jim has been the recipient of numerous \nawards, including being recently named the Legislator of the Year by \nthe Connecticut Council of Small Towns and Champion of Youth by the \nConnecticut Coalition of Youth Advocates.\n  As you are aware, this week is a special one for all Irish-Americans, \nfor Saturday we celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. Let us take this \nopportunity not only to recognize the rich legacy of the Irish in \nAmerica, but also to honor a man who has worked so hard within his \ncommunity to preserve this heritage, and to promote the well being of \nall citizens, as well. I can think of no finer illustration of the \ncontributions that Americans of Irish descent continue to make to our \nNation than the good deeds that Jim O'Rourke performs each and every \nday as an outstanding public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BLACK MOUNTAIN SKI AREA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Black Mountain Ski Area in Jackson, NH, upon the \ncelebration of their 65th year of business.\n  A pioneer in the ski industry, Black Mountain Ski Area installed the \nfirst overhead cable lift in the United States in 1935. Designed and \ninstalled by Bartlett, NH, inventor George Morton, the lift consisted \nof an overhead cable with strands of rope hanging down for skiers to \nhold onto as they ventured up the mountain.\n  In 1936, Bill and Betty Whitney purchased the Moody Farm and Ski Area \nat Black Mountain from Ed and Ada Moody, renaming the business as \nWhitney's. The Whitney family retrofitted the overhead cable lift in \n1937, replacing the strands of rope that hung from the cable with \nseventy-two shovel handles purchased from Sears Roebuck and Company.\n  Black Mountain utilized the first snow making system in New Hampshire \nin December, 1957. A Skyworker Snowmaking System was installed by the \nWilliam A. Walsh Company of Manchester, NH.\n  Black Mountain Ski Area has been in continuous operation as a ski \nfacility since 1935, making it one of the oldest ski areas in New \nHampshire. The Black Mountain Ski Area is a true friend to the people \nof New Hampshire and to the tourists who travel to our great state to \nutilize the facility. Their efforts to serve the needs of the ski \nindustry in New Hampshire are truly commendable.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe training of health professions students with respect to the \nidentification and referral of victims of domestic violence; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, domestic violence is a national crisis \nthat shatters the lives of millions of women across this country and \ntears at the fabric of this society. Despite increased efforts prompted \nby legislation such as the Violence Against Women Act, domestic \nviolence continues to be the leading cause of injury to women across \nthe country between the ages of 15 to 44. Furthermore, many of our \nhealth professionals today--those who are often the first in a position \nto recognize domestic violence, still do not have the proper training \nto assist these very vulnerable victims.\n  Wonderful partnerships currently exist between many hospitals and \ngraduate medical institutions and these partnerships should be \nencouraged in order to more effectively serve victims of domestic \nviolence and prevent future violent attacks.\n  For these reasons, I am reintroducing my bill, the Domestic Violence \nIdentification and Referral Act, which would help ensure that medical \nprofessionals have the training they need to recognize and treat \ndomestic violence, including spouse abuse, child abuse, and elder \nabuse. The bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to require \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to give preference in \nawarding grants to institutions that train health professionals in \nidentifying, treating, and referring patients who are victims of \ndomestic violence to appropriate services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this worthwhile legislation that \nwould help in our continued fight to prevent domestic violence across \nthis nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 519. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat trusts established for the benefit of individuals with \ndisabilities shall be taxed at the same rate as individual taxpayers, \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to address a tax \ninequity that has existed for some time and was made worse by the large \ntax increases of 1993. The ``Tax Fairness for Support of the \nPermanently Disabled Act'' would change the tax rates for the taxable \nincome of a trust fund established solely for the benefit of a person \nwho is permanently and totally disabled. Instead of being taxed at the \nhighest tax rate 39.6 percent for amounts over $7500, the income of \nthis fund would be taxed at the tax rates that would normally apply to \nregular income of the same amount. In essence, trust fund income would \nbe treated as personal income for a permanently disabled person.\n  Mr. Nicholas Verbin of Nashville, TN personally called my office \nabout this problem he had encountered. The problem was that he had \nestablished an irrevocable trust for his son Nicky, who is completely \ndisabled, unable to work, and totally dependent on his dad to provide \nfor him. Mr. Verbin has spent his whole life building up this trust \nfund so that his son can live off this lifetime of hard work after Mr. \nVerbin is gone. Mr. Verbin does not want his son to have to go on \nwelfare or become a ward of the state. Instead, he has\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nbuilt up this fund so that his son can be self-sufficient after he \ndies. Apparently, the federal government would rather have Nicky on its \nwelfare roles than have him take care of himself.\n  Instead of taxing the interest that Nicky's trust accumulates every \nyear as simple income, which it is since Nicky has no other form of \nincome, the IRS taxes the interest at the highest rate allowable, 39.6 \npercent. Instead of helping this sum grow into a sort of pension fund \nfor Nicky, the IRS has milked it for all its worth. If Nicky's trust \nearns more than $7500 in interest in a year, the federal government \ntakes $2,125 plus 39.5 percent of the amount above $7500. Meanwhile, \neven Bill Gates does not pay 39.6 percent on the first $275,000 of his \nincome. We are taxing disabled children at a rate that we don't even \ntax multimillionaires!\n  I believe that we should not punish Mr. Verbin for his foresight, nor \nshould we punish Nicky for his disability. While a case could be made \nthat Congress should eliminate the tax on this type of trust \naltogether, I have simply proposed that the interest income be treated \nlike normal income for those disabled boys and girls, men and women who \ncannot work for themselves and depend on this interest as their only \nsource of income.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clayton Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, along \nwith my friend and colleagues Mr. Kohl, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Reid of \nNevada, called the ``High-Density Airport Competition Act of 2001.'' We \nare introducing this legislation in an effort to increase and maintain \ncompetition in the domestic aviation industry. If the traveling public \nis to have access to affordable, quality air service, real competition \nis essential.\n  The need for this legislation stems from our belief that the recent \nsurge in proposed mergers among our nation's major airlines is a threat \nto competition. Let me explain. Less than a year ago, United Airlines \nand US Airways announced their plans to merge, creating an airline that \nwould be nearly 50 percent larger than its next closest competitor and \na network significantly more extensive than other carriers. Most \nindustry observers believed at that time that if the United/US Airways \nmerger were allowed to go forward, those airlines would gain a dominant \nposition at several key airports throughout the country, including \nairports such as New York LaGuardia and Reagan National airport here in \nWashington.\n  At the time the merger was announced, I expressed my concern that \nthis merger would provoke further airline consolidation and potentially \ncould leave the country with as few as three large domestic carriers. I \ncontinue to be concerned about additional mergers, and for good reason.\n  In early January of this year, American Airlines announced that it \nwas joining in the United/US Airways deal by acquiring certain assets \nfrom US Airways and also by entering into agreements with United, \nincluding an agreement to jointly operate the lucrative Washington/New \nYork/Boston shuttle. So, if the deal is successful, instead of having \none dominant carrier, our country would face the prospect of having two \nairlines that are significantly larger than their competitors.\n  Quite frankly, American Airlines saw the writing on the wall. Its \nleaders understood how difficult it would be to compete effectively in \nan industry where one airline was so much larger and so dominant in \ncertain key business markets. As a result, American decided that, in \norder to survive, it had to join the deal and grow much bigger, as \nwell.\n  If these deals are allowed to go forward, I am certain we will see \neven more consolidations. As policy-makers, we are faced with a \ndaunting question: Will the airline industry remain sufficiently \ncompetitive in the wake of the proposed United and American deals? We \nhave concluded that unless action is taken, competition very likely \nwill be harmed.\n  But we cannot just sit idly by and let competition in this critical \nindustry waste away. It is vital that other airlines have the \nopportunity to compete, and a big part of that is having access to \nairports that are essential in a network business, such as the aviation \nindustry. Two of these key airports, Reagan National and LaGuardia, are \nsubject to government slot controls, which limit the number of take-off \nand landing slots during a day. If the United and American deals are \npermitted, those two airlines will control roughly 65 percent of the \nslots at Reagan National and New York LaGuardia. These are key \nresources that other airlines need reasonable access to if competition \nis to be maintained.\n  Simply put, competition is not served if we allow two airlines to \ndominate these airports. More important, consumer interests are not \nserved if any airline is permitted to gain such a position through \nmergers. That's why my colleagues and I are introducing the ``High-\nDensity Airport Competition Act.'' This bill represents one way to \nmaintain a competitive environment in the airline industry.\n  Specifically, our bill would limit the percentage of slots that large \nnational carriers can control at Reagan National and New York LaGuardia \nairports. The legislation would ensure that no single airline gains an \nanticompetitive advantage at these slot controlled airports. It would \ndo so by prohibiting any large airline from controlling more than 20 \npercent of the slots over any 2-hour period. If such an airline did \nhave more than 20 percent of the slots, that airline would be required \nwithin 60 days to either return the slots to the Department of \nTransportation or sell the slots in a blind auction. This procedure \nwould preserve competition by giving all airlines equal opportunity to \nbid for the slots and gain access to these airports.\n  Again, our overriding concern is the welfare of the traveling public. \nWe have seen, first-hand, the frustration of many travelers about \nservice, delays, and high air fares. The answer to those and other \nchallenges is not more consolidation. The answer is effective \ncompetition. We are concerned the airline industry is moving in the \nwrong direction, toward a consolidated industry, away from a truly \ncompetitive, consumer-friendly environment. That's not good for the \nindustry. And, that's certainly not good for consumers. That is why I \nhope my colleagues will join us in support of our legislation. We need \nto move back to real competition in our domestic aviation industry, an \nindustry that we all recognize plays a vital role in our Nation and our \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues Senators \nDeWine, Grassley, and Reid, to introduce the ``High Density Airport \nCompetition Act of 2001.'' This legislation is a small but important \nstep to promote airline competition during this time of massive \nconsolidation in the airline industry. This legislation will prevent \nany large national carrier from gaining a dominant share of takeoff and \nlanding slots at either Washington Reagan National or New York \nLaGuardia airports.\n  During the last year, we have all witnessed a tremendous \nconsolidation in the airline industry. First, last May, United \nannounced its planned deal to acquire US Airways. More recently, in \nJanuary, airline consolidation took another great leap forward as \nAmerican announced its plan to acquire TWA, and also its deal with \nUnited to acquire 20 percent of the US Airways assets. If all of these \ncombinations and acquisitions are approved, the result will be that \nAmerican and United will become the nation's dominant airlines, \ncontrolling about half of the national market. And many believe we are \nnot done yet, with press reports that Delta is soon expected to \nannounce an acquisition of its own. That would mean three large \nnational airlines would dominate 75 percent of the market.\n  The problem of airline consolidation is especially acute at the two \nof the nation's four slot-controlled airports, Washington Reagan \nNational and New York LaGuardia. At these two vital airports, if all \nthese mergers go through as planned, American, United and their \naffiliated and partner carriers will together control nearly two-thirds \nof the slots, leaving little room for competitors.\n  Gaining access to slots at these airports is essential for smaller \nand start-up airlines if they are to compete with the giant mega-\ncarriers, especially after these mergers are completed. Without slots, \nairlines cannot take off or land at these two airports. And access to \nthese key airports in New York and Washington, D.C. is essential for \nsmaller airlines to build national networks to compete with the large \ncarriers. Without that access for smaller airlines, large airlines will \ndominate the nation, grow larger and larger, and bar effective and \nrobust competition. To show the importance of just one of these \nairports to the nation's entire air transportation system, the FAA \nrecently reported that more than one quarter of the nation's entire \ncongestion related flight delays resulted from delays at LaGuardia \nairport alone.\n  Our legislation is a simple and effective measure to prevent large \nairlines from gaining a stranglehold on the slots at these two \nairports. It provides that, for any airline with at least a 15 percent \nshare of the national market, that airline, and its affiliates, cannot \ncontrol more than 20 percent of the slots at either Washington Reagan \nNational or New York LaGuardia in any two hour period. If an airline \nexceeds these limits, it must take one of two steps, either return the \nexcess slots to the FAA or sell them in a blind auction to its \ncompetitors. This blind auction provision will prevent airlines from \ndisposing of their excess slots by engaging in ``sweetheart'' deals.\n  Our legislation does not reach the other two-slot controlled \nairports, Chicago O'Hare or New York JFK. Slot controls are scheduled \nto be lifted at Chicago O'Hare in June of next year, and are in place \nat New York JFK only from 3 to 8 p.m.\n  In sum, our legislation is a carefully crafted and narrowly tailored \nprovision which will break the dominance that the large national \ncarriers will have at two vital slot-controlled airports, particularly \nif the currently pending mergers are completed as planned. It will \nenable smaller and new carriers to have a fair shot at gaining access \nto these airports, and thus help bring real competition both to \nconsumers who travel to and from New York and Washington and to the \nnation's skies as a whole. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 521. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for expenses incurred in teleworking; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat would help people who ``telework'' or work from home, to receive a \ntax credit. Teleworkers are people who work a few days a week on-line \nfrom home by using computers and other information technology tools. \nNearly 20 million Americans telework today, and according to experts, \n40 percent of the nation's jobs are compatible with telework. At one \nnational telecommunications company, nearly 25 percent of its workforce \nworks from home at least one day a week. The company found positive \nresults in the way of fewer days of sick leave, better retention, and \nhigher productivity.\n  I am introducing the Telework Tax Incentive Act, along with \nRepresentative Frank Wolf in the House of Representatives, to provide a \n$500 tax credit for telework. The legislation provides an incentive to \nencourage more employers to consider telework for their employees. \nTelework should be a regular part of the 21st century workplace. The \nbest part of telework is that it improves the quality of life for all. \nTelework also reduces traffic congestion and air pollution. It reduces \ngas consumption and our dependency on foreign oil. Telework is good for \nfamilies--working parents have flexibility to meet everyday demands. \nTelework provides people with disabilities greater job opportunities. \nTelework helps fill our nation's labor market shortage. It can also be \na good option for retirees choosing to work part-time.\n  A task force on telework initiated by Governor James Gilmore of \nVirginia made a number of recommendations to increase and promote \ntelework. One recommendation was to establish a tax credit toward the \npurchase and installation of electronic and computer equipment that \nallow an employee to telework. For example, the cost of a computer, fax \nmachine, modem, phone, printer, software, copier, and other expenses \nnecessary to enable telework could count toward a tax credit, provided \nthe person worked at home a minimum number of days per year.\n  My legislation would provide a $500 tax credit ``for expenses paid or \nincurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic \ninformation equipment which are used to enable an individual to \ntelework.'' An employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year to \nqualify for the tax credit. Both the employer and employee are eligible \nfor the tax credit, but the tax credit goes to whomever absorbs the \nexpense for setting up the at-home worksite.\n  A number of groups have previously endorsed the Telework Tax \nIncentive Act including the International Telework Association and \nCouncil, ITAC, Covad Communications, National Town Builders \nAssociation, Litton Industries, Orbital Sciences Corporation, Consumer \nElectronic Association, Capnet, BTG Corporation, Electonic Industries \nAlliance, Telecommunications Industry Association, American Automobile \nAssociation Mid-Atlantic, Dimensions International Inc., Capunet, \nTManage, Science Applications International Corporation, AT, Northern \nVirginia Technology Council, Computer Associates Incorporated, and Dyn \nCorp.\n  On October 9, 1999, legislation which I introduced in coordination \nwith Representative Frank Wolf from Virginia was signed into law by the \nPresident as part of the annual Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. S. 1521, the National \nTelecommuting and Air Quality Act, created a pilot program to study the \nfeasibility of providing incentives for companies to allow their \nemployees to telework in five major metropolitan areas including \nPhiladelphia, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Houston and Denver \nhave been added as well. I am pleased that the Philadelphia Area Design \nTeam has been progressing well with its responsibility of examining the \napplication of these incentives to the greater Philadelphia \nmetropolitan area. I am excited that this opportunity continues to help \nto get the word out about the benefits of telecommuting for many \nemployees and employers.\n  On July 14, 2000 the President signed legislation which included an \nadditional $2 million to continue efforts in the 5 pilot cities, \nincluding Philadelphia, to market, implement, and evaluate strategies \nfor awarding telecommuting, emissions reduction, and pollution credits \nestablished through the National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n  Telecommuting improves air quality by reducing pollutants, provides \nemployees and families flexibility, reduces traffic congestion, and \nincreases productivity and retention rates for businesses while \nreducing their overhead costs. It's a growing opportunity and option \nwhich we should all include in our effort to maintain and improve \nquality of life issues in Pennsylvania and around the nation. According \nto statistics available from 1996, the Greater Philadelphia area ranked \nnumber 10 in the country for annual person-hours of delay due to \ntraffic congestion. Because of this reality, all options including \ntelecommuting should be pursued to address this challenge.\n  The 1999 Telework America National Telework Survey, conducted by Joan \nH. Pratt Associates, found that today's 19.6 million teleworkers \ntypically work 9 days per month at home with an average of 3 hours per \nweek during normal business hours. In this study, teleworkers or \ntelecommuters are defined overall as employees or independent \ncontractors who work at least one day per month at home. These research \nfindings impact the bottom line for employers and employees. \nTeleworkers seek a blend of job-related and personal benefits to enable \nthem to better handle their work and life responsibilities. For \nemployers, savings just from less absenteeism and increased employee \nretention may total more than $10,000 per teleworker per year. Thus an \norganization with 100 employees, 20 of whom telework, could potentially \nrealize a savings of $200,000 annually, or more, when productivity \ngains are added.\n  Work is something you do, not someplace you go. There is nothing \nmagical about strapping ourselves into a car and driving sometimes up \nto an hour and a half, arriving at a workplace and sitting before a \ncomputer, when we can access the same information from a computer in \nour homes. Wouldn't it be great if we could replace the evening rush \nhour commute with time spent with the family, or coaching little league \nor other important quality of life matters?\n  I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation which \npromotes telework and helps encourage additional employee choices for \nthe workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. \n        Wellstone):\n  S. 522. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to conduct a pilot program to raise awareness about \ntelecommuting among small business employers, and to encourage such \nemployers to offer telecommuting options to employees; to the Committee \non Small Business.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Cleland, and Senator Wellstone, in introducing \nlegislation, the Small Business Telecommuting Act, to assist our \nnation's small businesses in establishing successful telecommuting, or \ntelework programs, for their employees. Congressman Udall will be \nintroducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  Across America, numerous employers are responding to the needs of \ntheir employees and establishing telecommuting programs. In 2000, there \nwere an estimated 16.5 million teleworkers. By the end of 2004, there \nwill be an estimated 30 million teleworkers, representing an increase \nof almost 100 percent. Unfortunately, the majority of growth in new \nteleworkers comes from organizations employing over 1,500 people, while \njust a few years ago, most teleworkers worked for small- to medium-\nsized organizations.\n  By not taking advantage of modern technology and establishing \nsuccessful telecommuting programs, small businesses are losing out on a \nhost of benefits that will save them money, and make them more \ncompetitive. The reported productivity improvement of home-based \nteleworkers averages 15 percent, translating to an average bottom-line \nimpact of $9,712 per teleworker. Additionally, most experienced \nteleworkers are determined to continue teleworking, meaning a \nsuccessful telework program can be an important tool in the recruitment \nand retention of qualified and skilled employees. By establishing \nsuccessful telework programs, small business owners would be able to \nretain these valuable employees by allowing them to work from a remote \nlocation, such as their home or a telework center.\n  In addition to the cost savings realized by businesses that employ \nteleworkers, there are a number of related benefits to society and the \nemployee. For example, telecommuters help reduce traffic and cut down \non air pollution by staying off the roads during rush hour. Fully 80 \npercent of home-only teleworkers commute to work on days they are not \nteleworking. Their one-way commute distance averages 19.7 miles, versus \n13.3 miles for non-teleworkers, meaning employees that take advantage \nof telecommuting programs are, more often than not, those with the \nlongest commutes. Teleworking also gives employees more time to spend \nwith their families and reduces stress levels by eliminating the \npressure of a long commute.\n  Our legislation seeks to extend the benefits of successful \ntelecommuting programs to more of our nation's small businesses. \nSpecifically, it establishes a pilot program in the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, to raise awareness about telecommuting among small \nbusiness employers and to encourage those small businesses to establish \ntelecommuting programs for their employees.\n  Additionally, an important provision in our bill directs the SBA \nAdministrator to undertake special efforts for businesses owned by, or \nemploying, persons with disabilities and disabled America veterans. At \nthe end of the day, telecommuting can provide more than just \nenvironmental benefits and improved quality of life. It can open the \ndoor to people who have been precluded from working in a traditional \noffice setting due to physical disabilities.\n  Our legislation is also limited in cost and scope. It establishes the \npilot program in a maximum of five SBA regions and caps the total cost \nto five million dollars over two years. It also restricts the SBA to \nactivities specifically proscribed in the legislation: developing \neducational materials; conducting outreach to small business; and \nacquiring equipment for demonstration purposes. Finally, it requires \nthe SBA to prepare and submit a report to Congress evaluating the pilot \nprogram.\n  Several hurdles to establishing successful telecommuting programs \ncould be cleared by enacting our legislation. In fact, the number one \nreported obstacle to implementing a telecommuting program is a lack of \nknow-how. Our bill will go a long way towards educating small business \nowners on how they can draft guidelines to make a telework program an \naffordable, manageable reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Small \nBusiness Telecommuting Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Telecommuting \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) telecommuting reduces the volume of peak commuter \n     traffic, thereby reducing traffic congestion and air \n     pollution;\n       (2) the Nation's communities can benefit from \n     telecommuting, which gives workers more time to spend at home \n     with their families;\n       (3) it is in the national interest to raise awareness \n     within the small business community of telecommuting options \n     for employees;\n       (4) the small business community can benefit from offering \n     telecommuting options to employees because such options make \n     it easier for small employers to retain valued employees and \n     employees with irreplaceable institutional memory;\n       (5) companies with telecommuting programs have found that \n     telecommuting can boost employee productivity 5 percent to 20 \n     percent, thereby saving businesses valuable resources and \n     time;\n       (6) 60 percent of the workforce is involved in information \n     work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990), allowing and \n     encouraging decentralization of paid work to occur; and\n       (7) individuals with disabilities, including disabled \n     American veterans, who own or are employed by small \n     businesses could benefit from telecommuting to their \n     workplaces.\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill entitled the ``Building Better Health Centers Act of \n2001''; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important piece \nof new legislation to help an essential part of our health care safety \nnet, our nation's health centers, serve the uninsured and medically-\nunderserved.\n  The Building Better Health Centers Act will promote health centers' \nmission of providing care to anyone who needs it by getting rid of an \nartificial distinction existing in current law. Right now, federal \ngrant dollars to health centers can be used for most things a health \ncenter needs to do, including salaries, supplies, and basic upkeep. But \nfederal grants to health centers cannot be used for one of the most \ncritical and expensive needs a health center, or any business or \nnonprofit organization, will ever face--capital improvements.\n  Unless we correct this silly distinction, many of our health centers \nare destined to be shackled to slowly deteriorating facilities. Over \ntime, this will sap their ability to provide care. If we are serious \nabout maximizing health centers' ability to deal with our health care \naccess needs, we must allow federal grant dollars to be used to meet \nour health centers' capital needs.\n  I've been down here on the Senate floor many times to talk about \nhealth centers, but let me cover the basics once again. Health centers, \nwhich include community health centers, migrant health centers, \nhomeless health centers, and public housing health centers, address the \nhealth care access problem by providing primary care services in \nthousands of rural and urban medically-underserved communities \nthroughout the United States.\n  And as we all know, the health care access problem remains a serious \nissue in our country. Many health care experts believe that Americans' \nlack of access to basic health services is our single most pressing \nhealth care problem. Nearly 50 million Americans do not have access to \na primary care provider, whether they are insured or not. In addition, \n43 million Americans lack health insurance and have difficulty \naccessing care due to the inability to pay.\n  Health centers help fill part of this void. More than 3,000 health \ncenter clinics nationwide provide basic health care services to nearly \n12 million Americans, almost 8 million minorities, nearly 650,000 \nfarmworkers, and almost 600,000 homeless individuals each year. The \ncare they provide has been repeatedly shown by studies to be high-\nquality and cost-effective. In fact, health centers are one of the best \nhealth care bargains around, the average yearly cost for a health \ncenter patient is less than one dollar per day.\n  I believe that one of the most effective ways to address our health \ncare access problem is by dramatically expanding access to health \ncenters. And I am pleased to report a strong consensus is developing to \ndo exactly that. Last year, the Senate voted in support of a proposal I \nhave made with Sen. Hollings to double access to health centers by \ndoubling funding over a five-year period. In addition, President Bush \nhas proposed that we double the number of people that health centers \ncare for over the next five years.\n\n  But over the next few years, as we hopefully see additional resources \nflow to health centers, we will increasingly encounter problems that \nstem from an artificial distinction we see in current law. As I \nmentioned, federal health center grants are currently allowed to be \nused for most purposes--including salaries for health professionals and \nadministrators, medical supplies, basic upkeep of clinic facilities, \neven lease payments if the health center rents. But they simply cannot \nbe used for capital improvements.\n  This means that unless health centers can find some other way to \nfinance their capital needs--and I will talk in a moment about the \nsignificant barriers they face in doing this--major projects that could \nprovide substantial benefit to patients will never happen.\n  It means that an urban community health center that has been slowly \nexpanding staff and services over many years until it's bursting at the \nseams of its modest two-story building will have to continue to find \nways to cope, even if that prevents additionally-needed expansion or \neven if upkeep costs on the old building begin to spiral out-of-\ncontrol.\n  It means that a rural community health center in an area desperately \nin need of dental services may not be able to expand the facility and \npurchase dental chairs, X-ray machines and other major dental equipment \nneeded for the desired expansion into dental services.\n  It means that even if federal government is will to commit grant \nfunds to open a new health center in one of the hundreds of underserved \ncommunities nationwide which lacks any health care professionals for \nmiles around, the new center may never come to be due to lack of \nfunding for a facility in which to house it.\n  This is more than theory, the evidence shows that many existing \nhealth centers operate in facilities that desperately need renovation \nor modernization. Approximately one of every three health centers \nreside in a building more than 30 years old, and one of every eight \noperate out of a facility more than half a century old.\n  Moreover, a recent survey of health centers in 11 states showed that \nmore than two-thirds of health centers had a specifically-identified \nneed to renovate, expand, or replace their current facility. The \naverage cost of a needed capital project was $1.8 million, and the \nneeds ranged from ``small'' projects of $400,000 to major $5 million \nefforts. The survey demonstrates that there may be as much as $1.2 \nbillion in unmet capital needs in our nation's health centers.\n  And that is just for existing health centers. As I mentioned, \nhundreds of\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nmedically-underserved areas lack--and could desperately use--the \nservices of a health center. This further shows the need for new \nfacilities, and more capital, as we expand access to new communities.\n  So what about other possible sources of capital? There are plenty of \nways--in theory--that health centers might be able to get money for \ncapital improvements. Business, large and small, do it all the time. So \ndo other nonprofit organizations like universities and hospitals. They \nuse built-up equity. They take out loans. They float bonds. They raise \nmoney through private donations as part of a capital campaign.\n\n  But unfortunately, health centers just aren't quite like most other \nbusinesses or nonprofits, and many times these options are unrealistic \nas a way to provide the entire cost of a major project.\n  Health centers simply don't have loads of cash in the bank. The \nrevenue these clinics are able to cobble together from federal grants, \nlow-income patients, Medicaid, private donations, and other health \ninsurers is typically all put back into patient care.\n  Heath centers already work hard to maximize the money they can raise \nthrough private donations and non-federal grant sources. In fact, an \naverage of 13 percent, one-seventh of their budget, of health care \ncenter revenue comes from these sources. Most of this private and \npublic funding is used to meet operating expenses, and it is difficult \nto go back to the same sources to request further donations for capital \nneeds. In fundraising, health centers also face a huge disadvantage \ncompared to nonprofit organizations like universities and hospitals \nbecause health centers lack a natural middle- and upper-class donor \nbase. And raising private funds is particularly hard in isolated rural \nareas that are often quite poor and which can have the most dire heath \ncare access problems.\n  Finally, health centers have difficulties obtaining private loans for \ncapital needs for a variety of reasons. The high number of uninsured \npatients health centers treat and the poor reimbursement rates received \nfrom most Medicaid programs mean health centers rarely have significant \noperating margins. Without these margins, banks are leery about loans \nbecause they don't feel assured that a health center will have \nsufficient cash flow to successfully manage loan payments. Banks are \nmade even more nervous by the high proportion of health center revenue \nthat comes from sometimes-unreliable government sources, such as the \nhealth centers' grant funding and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n  So what should we do? This isn't exactly rocket science. We have a \nneed, many health centers require significant help to build or maintain \nadequate facilities because they can't raise the money or obtain the \nloans themselves. And we have an existing law that prevents the federal \ngovernment from using health center funding to do exactly that.\n  We simply need to get rid of the artificial distinction we have right \nnow and allow our health center grant dollars to go to further the \nhealth center mission in the best way possible, and that is going to \nmean at times that we should support some new construction or major \nrenovation projects. If a crumbling building is constantly in need of \nrepair, is soaking up money, and is reducing the number of patients a \nhealth center can reach out to, the federal government should help with \nthe major renovation or the new construction needed.\n  The Building Better Health Centers Act authorizes the federal \ngovernment to make grants to health centers for facility construction, \nmodernization, replacement, and major equipment purchases. If our goal \nis to help health centers provide high-quality care to as many \nuninsured and medically-underserved people as possible, we need to get \nrid of barriers to doing that, including capital barriers.\n\n  Beyond just the possibility of grant funding, the bill goes further \nand permits the federal government to guarantee loans made by a bank or \nanother private lender to a health center to construct, replace, \nmodernize, or expand a health center facility. This loan guarantee is \nan additional tool that will help allay the fears of banks and other \nprivate lenders by limiting their exposure if a health center defaults \non a loan. An additional advantage of loan guarantees is that you can \nstretch funds farther. When guaranteeing a $1 million loan, the federal \ngovernment need only set aside a much smaller amount of appropriated \nmoney, perhaps only a twelfth to a tenth of the loan total, to insure \nagainst that loan's possible default. This multiplier factor means that \nfor every dollar appropriated for this purpose, many dollars worth of \nloans can be guaranteed.\n  There is actually tremendous potential for these two new options, the \nfacility grants and the facility loan guarantees, to work together. \nSharing in up-front costs through grant funding, and helping further by \nguaranteeing a loan that covers the remainder of a project's cost may \nwell be the best approach. This will balance the need to make sure \nspecific projects get enough grant funding to make them realistic and \nthe need to spread capital assistance among as many projects as \npossible.\n  Let me try to respond in advance to a few potential criticisms of \nthis legislation. First, to those who simply think on principle that \nthe government should stay out of private-sector bricks and mortar \nprojects, I would say we're already at least halfway pregnant. In just \nabout every appropriations bill, we have dozens if not hundreds of \nspecific projects earmarked for major building or renovation projects.\n  Some might worry that the potential large costs of construction \nprojects could get out of hand and squeeze out funding actually used \nfor patient care. But let me point out that we limit capital assistance \nto five percent of all health center funding. Based on this year's \nfunding level, this would mean up to $58.5 million for facility grants \nand loan guarantees. Because the loan guarantee program would allow \nsome of this money to be stretched, this level of support could easily \nmean help for more than $200 million in health center projects. But the \nmain point is that capital projects are absolutely limited to five-\npercent of health center funding, which prevents any possible runaway \nspending.\n  Finally, we should ask ourselves whether or not federal assistance is \ngoing to give a free pass to communities, which really should be \nexpected to help out with public-minded projects like the construction \nor renovation of a health center. In my bill, local communities are \nexpected to help. No more than 75 percent of the total costs of a major \nproject can come from federal sources--and this is the absolute upper \nlimit. Much more likely are evenly-shared costs or situations in which \nfederal support represents a minority of the capital investment. This \nbill does not give local areas a free ride.\n  The quick rationale for this bill is simple. Many health centers are \nhampered in their efforts to provide health care to the medically-\nunderserved by inadequate facilities. It doesn't make sense to help \nthese vital community clinics only with day-to-day expenses if their \nbuilding is literally crumbling around them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. This \nyear, we are scheduled to reauthorize the Consolidated Health Centers \nprogram, along with other vital health care safety net programs like \nthe National Health services Corps. I hope to include this bill--the \nBuilding Better Health Centers Act--in this larger safety net \nreauthorization legislation. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee to aggressively help our nation's health centers \nmeet their dire capital needs by making this bill law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Nelson \n        of Nebraska):\n  S. 525. A bill to expand trade benefits to certain Andean countries, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill along with my \ncolleagues Senators DeWine, Hagel, Breaux, McCain, Dodd, Thompson, \nBiden, and Ben Nelson to introduce the ``Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Acts,'' a bill that would provide additional trade benefits \nto the countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act, commonly known as ATPA, was passed \nin 1991. That legislation is set to expire. If we are serious about \nhalting the flow of drugs into this country, we must not let this \nhappen. If we are committed to stabilizing the situation in Colombia, \nwe must act this year, to both extend and expand those trade benefits.\n  The office of the United States Trade Representative recently \npublished a report assessing the operation of the Andean trade \nagreement so far. The report concluded that this agreement is \nstrengthening the legitimate economies of countries in the region and \nis an important component of our efforts to contain the spread of \nillicit activities. Export diversification in beneficiary countries is \nincreasing, net coca cultivation has declined slightly. Although there \nis still progress to be made, these countries are working \nconstructively with the United States on issues of concern including \nworking conditions and intellectual property protection.\n  Despite this success, renewal of ATPA in its current form is not our \ngoal. The landscape has changed since 1991.\n  Perhaps the most significant alteration was last year's passage of \nthe ``Trade and Development Act of 2000,'' which provided significant \nnew trade benefits to countries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. As a \nresult of enhanced trade benefits to these countries, the Andean region \nstands to lose a substantial number of apparel industry jobs--up to \n100,000 jobs in Colombia alone. At least 10 U.S.-based companies that \npurchase apparel from Colombian garment manufacturers have already \nindicated their near-term intentions to shift production to Caribbean \ncountries due to the significant cost savings associated with the new \ntrade benefits afforded the region. Some of these U.S. companies have \nutilized Colombia as a manufacturing base for more than 10 years, \nproviding desperately needed legitimate employment to the Colombian \neconomy.\n  The immediate reaction of these companies to enhanced Caribbean trade \nbenefits creates a dilemma. Clearly, it does not make sense for \nCongress to provide foreign aid on the one hand, and implement trade \nlegislation that puts tens of thousands of people out of work on the \nother. This bill will address that critical, unintended contradiction \nby harmonizing the trade benefits of the Caribbean and Andean nations.\n  Specifically, our bill would extend duty-free, quota-free treatment \nto apparel articles assembled, cut or knit in Andean beneficiary \nnations using yarns and fabric wholly formed in the United States, and \nprovide benefits to non-apparel items that were previously excluded \nfrom the Andean trade preferences package. These new benefits will \ncreate parity with the Caribbean Basin Initiative nations as well as \nexpand an important source of economic and employment growth for the \nU.S. textile and apparel industry.\n  The United States is at now a critical juncture with its neighbors in \nthe Andean region.\n  Last year, the United States government responded generously to \nColombia's needs by providing a supplemental appropriations package of \nmore than $1.6 billion dollars to help the country in its time of \ncrisis. These funds were in addition to over $4.0 billion being spent \nby Colombia itself.\n  Fundamental to Plan Colombia, and to the government's ability to \nsucceed in its efforts to safeguard the country, will be efforts to \nencourage economic growth and provide jobs to the Colombian people. \nToday in Colombia more than one million people are displaced, the \nunemployment rate is nearly 20 percent and Colombia is experiencing the \nworst recession in 70 years. Without new economic opportunities, more \nand more Colombians will turn to illicit activities to support their \nfamilies or seek to join the growing numbers of people who are leaving \nthe country to find a better, safer future for their families.\n  This ``trade plus aid'' approach to stabilizing the Andean region has \nbeen widely embraced. In its March 2000 report. ``First Steps Toward a \nConstructive U.S. Policy in Colombia,'' a Task Force I co-chair with \nGeneral Brent Scowcroft recommended the extension of the ATPA, to \ninclude the same benefits as those contained under the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative.\n  Although this bill provides benefits to all ATPA beneficiaries, it is \nparticularly critical to Colombia, which in 1998 exported 59 percent of \nall textiles and apparel from the Andean region to the U.S., two-thirds \nof which were assembled and/or cut from U.S. yarns and fabric. \nColombian President Pastrana recognizes this. In his visit to \nWashington last week he stressed that access to U.S. markets was among \nthe top priorities.\n  On a more comprehensive scale, passage of this legislation is \ncritical to ensure that all nations in the Western Hemisphere can \nmaintain their long-term competitiveness with Asian nations, \nparticularly in the textile industry. At present, the textile products \nof most Asian nations are subject to quotas imposed by the Multi-Fiber \nAgreement, now known as the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. This \nrestriction on Asian textiles has enabled the nations of the Western \nHemisphere to remain competitive, and further, the Andean region--\nspecifically Colombia--has become a significant market for fabric woven \nin U.S. mills from yarn spun in the U.S. originating from U.S. cotton \ngrowers.\n  However, in 2005, these Asian import quotas will be phased out. At \nthat time, textile production in both the Andean region and the \nCaribbean basin will be placed at a distinct and growing disadvantage. \nDisinvestment in the region will occur, reducing the incentive to use \nany material from U.S. textile mills or cotton grown in the United \nStates.\n  The Congress must act this year to renew and expand trade benefits \nfor the Andean countries. If we do not move forward, the current \nbenefits will expire and these countries will lose an important means \nof developing legitimate industries and employment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the illicit drug trade in the Andean \nregion of South America is thriving. Lagging economies, weak law \nenforcement, and corrupt judiciary systems among many countries in the \nregion have created an environment ideal for drug trafficking.\n  The chaotic situation in Colombia illustrates this. The nation is \nsuffering its worst recession in over 70 years. The unemployment rate \nis at nearly 20 percent. Not surprisingly, as the Colombian economy has \nworsened, the country's coca cultivation has skyrocketed, becoming the \nsource of nearly 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United \nStates. To make matters worse, as the illicit drug money has poured in, \nviolent insurgent groups in Colombia have used it to fund their \nguerilla movements, movements creating instability not only within \nColombia, but also across the entire Andean Region.\n  Because of the dangerous and increasingly chaotic situation in the \nregion, my colleagues--Senators Graham, McCain, Hagel, Breaux, Dodd, \nand Thompson--and I are introducing the ``Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act,'' a bill that will help establish much-needed stability \nand security in the Andean Region by promoting a strong economic \nenvironment for enhanced trade throughout the Western Hemisphere.\n  This legislation is timely and important. The current Andean Trade \nPreference Act, which authorizes the President to grant certain \nunilateral preferential tariff benefits to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, \nand Peru, is set to expire on December 4, 2001. We need to renew and \nexpand this trade act not only because of its benefits for U.S. \ncompanies trading in the region, but also because it encourages \neconomic development in Andean countries and economic alternatives to \ndrug production and trafficking. I fear, Mr. President, that if the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act is not renewed by the end of this year, \nthe economic and political situation in the Andean Region likely will \ndestabilize further, threatening to expand an already booming illicit \ndrug trade.\n  The economic situation in the Andean Region is growing worse by the \nday. The nations within the region have been struggling to pull \nthemselves out of one of the worst economic crises in decades. The \nrecession has been more severe than anticipated, and the Andean \nDevelopment Corporation recently forecast negative rates of growth for \nnext year in Colombia, Ecuador and\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nVenezuela. Only Peru and Bolivia will grow at all, and marginally at \nbest.\n  The Colombian civil war and its spillover effect have further \nweakened domestic economies. Political instability has deterred foreign \ninvestment, and increased capital flight has put pressure on domestic \ncurrencies. While there are a few signs of possible recovery--including \nan increase in oil prices that will be helpful for Ecuador, Colombia \nand Venezuela--there is concern that the Andean region could experience \na destabilizing financial crisis similar to the recent one in Asia.\n  Last year, Congress and the Clinton Administration tried to address \npolitical instability in the Andean region through passage of ``Plan \nColombia''--the emergency supplemental plan developed to address the \npolitical and social instability in the Andean region. The Plan \nestablished programs to strengthen Colombian government institutions \nand promote alternative crop development programs throughout the \nregion. A key element of Plan Colombia is that it recognizes that if we \nfight only the Colombian drug problem, we risk creating a ``spillover'' \neffect, where Colombia's drug trade shifts to adjacent countries in the \nregion.\n  For Plan Colombia to succeed, it is crucial that we help bolster the \nfaltering economies of the Andean countries--namely Colombia, Peru, \nBolivia, and Ecuador--so they don't turn to the drug trade as an means \nfor economic livelihood. The legislation we are introducing today--the \nAndean Trade Preference Expansion Act--will help embolden Plan Colombia \nand will help it succeed by increasing trade and economic opportunities \nwithin the region. Let me explain.\n  The recent implementation of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which \nprovides enhanced trade benefits to nations trading with Caribbean \ncountries, is having the unintended consequence of shifting economic \nopportunities away from the Andean Region to the Caribbean Basin. Such \na shift is further shrinking the economies within the Andean Region. \nColombia, for example, stands to lose up to 100,000 jobs in the apparel \nindustry because of the CBI. The simple fact is that companies, \nincluding U.S.-based businesses, are moving production to the Caribbean \nBasin to capitalize on the significant cost savings associated with the \nnew CBI law. Already, at least 10 U.S.-based companies that purchase \napparel from Colombian garment manufacturers have indicated their \nintentions to shift production to the Caribbean.\n  Our Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act would help correct for this \nunintended economic displacement by working in tandem with the CBI, so \nthat we don't rob one region in our hemisphere to pay another. \nSpecifically, our bill extends duty-free, quota-free treatment to \napparel articles knit, assembled, or cut in an ATPA beneficiary nation \nthat use yarns and fabrics wholly formed in the United States. This \ncreates a measure of parity with Caribbean nations that currently \nreceive trade preferences under the CBI. In addition, goods other than \napparel that previously were not eligible for trade preferences under \nthe current Andean Trade Preference Act would receive the NAFTA tariff \nrate.\n  Although our bill provides benefits to all ATPA beneficiaries, it is \nparticularly critical to Colombia, which, in 1998, exported to the \nUnited States 59 percent of all textiles and apparel from the Andean \nregion. Two-thirds of those exports were assembled and/or cut from U.S. \nyarns and fabrics. We cannot allow Colombia's economy to take this kind \nof hit. Plan Colombia simply cannot be effective unless Colombia can \nimprove its economy and create and maintain job opportunities. I \nbelieve that our new legislation will help prevent further economic \ndestabilization and stands to promote future economic growth.\n  Ultimately, we--as a nation--stand to lose or gain, depending on the \neconomic health of our hemispheric neighbors. A more aggressive trade \npolicy in the hemisphere is not only important for increasing markets \nfor U.S. companies, but it also enhances stability and promotes \nsecurity in the hemisphere. It is important to remember that a strong, \nand free, and prosperous hemisphere means a strong, and free, and \nprosperous United States. It is in our national interest to pursue an \naggressive trade agenda in the Western Hemisphere to combat growing \nthreats and promote prosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act. It is the right thing to do for our neighbors \nand for our businesses here at home.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to join with Senators Graham, \nHagel, DeWine, Dodd, Biden, Breaux, and Thompson today in introducing \nthis important legislation to reauthorize the Andean Trade Preference \nAct. This legislation will renew and expand duty-free tariff treatment \nto our important trade partners: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. \nI would like to emphasize to my colleagues the importance of acting on \nthis legislation, because the existing Andean Trade Preference Act will \nexpire on December 4.\n  Having recently visited the region, I would like to assure my \ncolleagues that this program plays an important role in aiding the \neconomic development of our Andean allies, and stabilizing fragile \ndemocracies in the region. The existing Andean Trade Preference Act has \nhelped two-way trade between the United States and the region to nearly \ndouble in the 1990s. During this time, U.S. exports grew 65 percent and \nU.S. imports increased 98 percent. In addition, the program is \nresponsible for an increase in industrial and agricultural imports from \nthe Andean beneficiary countries. This economic diversification is \nbeneficial for economic growth in the Andean region, and will reduce \npressure for the citizens of the region to become involved in the drug \ntrade.\n  However, this program must be expanded to be truly effective. \nAccording to a recent study by the Congressional Research Service, only \n10 percent of the imports from the Andean region enter the United \nStates exclusively under the provisions of the existing Andean Trade \nPreference Act. I join with my colleagues in supporting Senator \nGraham's legislation, because it plays an important first step in the \nreauthorization process by extending to the Andean region similar trade \nbenefits to what the Congress voted to give the Caribbean region last \nyear. During his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Ambassador \nZoellick called for a ``renewed and robust Andean Trade Preference \nAct.'' I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will consider the United \nStates Trade Representative's recommendations, and those of our allies \nin the Andean region, who have proven that they need expanded duty and \nquota-free treatment for their imports.\n  Many of us have had the benefit of traveling to Colombia over the \npast few months to observe the American-funded drug eradication efforts \nthere, and to discuss Plan Colombia with the region's leaders. During \nmy visit to Colombia in February, President Andres Pastrana made clear \nthat liberalized trade with the United States, in the form of renewal \nand expansion of the Andean Trade Preference Act, was a critical pillar \nof his strategy to promote alternatives to the drug trade in his \ncountry. Plan Colombia is premised upon reducing the power and allure \nof the narco-traffickers and their rebel supporters who threaten \nAmerica's interest in a democratic, prosperous, and stable Western \nHemisphere. While the military component of America's assistance \npackage remains controversial at home, expanding our trade relationship \nwith Colombia, a nation of industrious people and vast natural \nresources, is a logical extension of our compelling interest in \nstrengthening the Colombian state and providing its people with \nrewarding economic opportunities in the legitimate economy.\n  It is also important to view renewal and expansion of the Andean \nTrade Preference Act in terms of our larger trade agenda with our Latin \nAmerican neighbors. Early reauthorization of this program will show our \ntrade partners that the United States is seriously engaged in \nstrengthening our trade relations and promoting interdependence in the \nregion. It is my belief that the United States should pursue four \npolicies this year in order to accomplish our mutually beneficial trade \nobjectives with our Latin American partners:\n  1. Early renewal of the Andean Trade Preference Act;\n  2. Passage of trade promotion authority for the President;\n  3. Completion of negotiations on a free trade agreement with Chile; \nand\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  4. Accomplishment of serious progress on the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas negotiations in order to meet an early conclusion of these \nnegotiations in 2003.\n  I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues in the \nSenate to pass this legislation in a timely manner before the December \nexpiration. It is in our nation's economic and national security \ninterests to reauthorize and expand trade benefits for the Andean \nregion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide that \nrail agreements and transactions subject to approval by the Surface \nTransportation Board are no longer exempt from the application of the \nantitrust laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue that is of \ngreat concern to many of my constituents and to me. That is the issue \nof unchecked monopoly power of the nation's freight railroad industry.\n  Since the supposed deregulation of the rail industry in 1980, the \nnumber of major Class I railroads has declined from approximately 42 to \nonly four major U.S. railroads today. Rather than achieving the \ncompetitive framework intended by deregulation, today's freight \nrailroad industry can be best described as a handful of regional \nmonopolies that rely on bottlenecks to exert maximum market power. Four \nmega-railroads overwhelmingly dominate railroad traffic, generating 95 \npercent of the gross ton-miles and 94 percent of the revenues, \ncontrolling 90 percent of all U.S. coal movement; 70 percent of all \ngrain movement and 88 percent of all originated chemical movement.\n  This drastic level of consolidation has left rail customers with only \ntwo major carriers operating in the East and two in the West, and has \nfar exceeded the industry's need to minimize unit operating costs. But \nconsolidation alone has not produced these regional monopolies. Over \nthe years, regulators have systematically adopted policies that so \nnarrowly interpret the procompetitive provisions of the 1980 statute \nthat railroads are essentially protected from ever having to compete \nwith each other.\n  In my state, it costs $2,300 to move one rail car of wheat from North \nDakota to Minneapolis, approx. 400 miles. Yet for a similar 400 mile \nmove, between Minneapolis and Chicago, it costs only $238 to deliver \nthat car. Move that same car another 600 miles to St. Louis, Missouri \nand it costs only $356 per car.\n  Since the deregulation of the railroad industry, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission, now the Surface Transportation Board, has been \ncharged with the responsibility to make sure that the pro-competitive \nintent of that law was being carried out, so that those rail users \nwithout access to true market based competition would be protected by \n``regulated competition.''\n  That clearly hasn't happened. Competition among rail carriers is \nvirtually nonexistent in part because the ICC and the STB have \nconsistently chosen to protect railroads from such competition, and \nhave done little to protect rail customers that have no alternatives.\n  It is time for Congress to make it very clear that true market \ncompetition among railroads is what we originally intended then and \nwhat we require now. This is the same approach we have taken with \ntelecommunications and natural gas pipelines, and it is the center of \nour deliberations regarding the future of the airline industry. \nCompetition among railroads is critical for large sectors of our \nnational economy.\n\n  That is why today, along with Senator Jay Rockefeller, I am \nintroducing the Rail Competition Enforcement Act to reinstate the \nJustice Department's review of proposed railroad mergers under \nantitrust laws. The bill would require both the Surface Transportation \nBoard and the Justice Department to approve new mergers.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this most important \nmatter. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 7. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with profound honor and reverence \nthat I, together with my friend and colleague, Senator Cleland, \nintroduce a bi-partisan constitutional amendment to permit Congress to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the American flag.\n  The American flag serves as a symbol of our great nation. The flag \nrepresents in a way nothing else can, the common bond shared by an \notherwise diverse people. Whatever our differences of party, race, \nreligion, or socio-economic status, the flag reminds us that we are \nvery much one people, united in a shared destiny, bonded in a common \nfaith in our nation.\n  Nearly a decade ago, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens reminded \nus of the significance of our unique emblem when he wrote:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas. . . . So it is with the American flag. It is \n     more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, \n     and the gifts of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling \n     colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of \n     equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill \n     for other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  Throughout our history, the flag has captured the hearts and minds of \nall types of people, ranging from school teachers to union workers, \ntraffic cops, grandmothers, and combat veterans. In 1861, President \nAbraham Lincoln called our young men to put their lives on the line to \npreserve the Union. When Union troops were beaten and demoralized, \nGeneral Ulysses Grant ordered a detachment of men to make an early \nmorning attack on Lookout Mountain in Tennessee. When the fog lifted \nfrom Lookout Mountain, the rest of the Union troops saw the American \nflag flying and cheered with a newfound courage. This courage \neventually led to a nation of free men; not half-free and half-slave.\n  In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt called on all Americans to \nfight the aggression of the Axis powers. After suffering numerous early \ndefeats, the free world watched in awe as five Marines and one sailor \nraised the American flag on Iwo Jima. Their undaunted, courageous act, \nfor which three of the six men died, inspired the allied troops to \nattain victory over fascism.\n  In 1990, President Bush called on our young men and women to go to \nthe Mideast for Operations Desert Shield and Desert storm. After an \nunprovoked attack by the terrorist dictator Saadam Hussein on the \nKingdom of Kuwait, American troops, wearing arm patches with the \nAmerican flag on their shoulders, led the way to victory. General \nNorman Schwarzkopf addressed a joint session of Congress describing the \nAmerican men and women who fought for the ideals symbolized by the \nAmerican flag:\n\n       [W]e were Protestants and Catholics and Jews and Moslems \n     and Buddhists, and many other religions, fighting for a \n     common and just cause. Because that's what your military is. \n     And we were black and white and yellow and brown and red. And \n     we noticed that when our blood was shed in the desert, it \n     didn't separate by race. It flowed together.\n\n  General Schwarzkopf then thanked the American people for their \nsupport, stating:\n\n       The prophets of doom, the naysayers, the protesters and the \n     flag-burners all said that you wouldn't stick by us, but we \n     knew better. We knew you'd never let us down. By golly, you \n     didn't.\n\n  The pages of our history show that when this country has called our \nyoung men and women to serve under the American flag from Lookout \nMountain to Iwo Jima to Kuwait, they have given their blood and lives. \nThe crosses at Arlington, the Iwo Jima memorial, and the Vietnam \nMemorial honor those sacrifices. But there were those who did not.\n  In 1984, Greg Johnson led a group of radicals in a protest march in \nwhich he doused an American flag with kerosene and set it on fire as \nhis fellow protestors chanted: ``America, the red, white, and blue, we \nspit on you.'' Sadly, the radical extremists, most of whom have given \nnothing, suffered nothing, and who respect nothing, would rather burn \nand spit on the American flag than honor it.\n  Contrast this image with the deeds of Roy Benavidez, an Army Sergeant \nfrom Texas, who led a helicopter extraction force to rescue a \nreconnaissance team in Vietnam. Despite being wounded in the leg, face, \nback, head, and abdomen by small arms fire, grenades, and hand-to-hand \ncombat with vicious North Vietnamese soldiers, Benavidez held off the \nenemy and carried several wounded to the helicopters, until finally \ncollapsing from a loss of blood. Benavidez earned the Medal of Honor. \nWhen Benavidez was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, the honor \nguard placed an American flag on his coffin and then folded it and gave \nit to his widow. The purpose of Roy Benavidez' heroic sacrifice--and \nthe purpose of the American people's ratification of the First \nAmendment--was not to protect the right of radicals like Greg Johnson \nto burn and spit on the American flag.\n  The American people have long distinguished between the First \nAmendment right to speak and write one's political opinions and the \ndisrespectful, and often violent, physical destruction of the flag. For \nmany years, the people's elected representatives in Congress and 49 \nstate legislatures passed statutes prohibiting the physical desecration \nof the flag. Our founding fathers, Chief Justice Earl Warren, and \nJustice Hugo Black believed these laws to be completely consistent with \nthe First Amendment's protection of the spoken and written word and not \ndisrespectful, extremist conduct.\n  In 1989, however, the Supreme Court abandoned the history and intent \nof the First Amendment to embrace a philosophy that made no distinction \nbetween oral and written speech about the flag and extremist, \ndisrespectful of the flag. In Texas v. Johnson, five members of the \nCourt, for the first time ever, struck down a flag protection statute. \nThe majority argued that the First Amendment had somehow changed and \nnow prevented a state from protecting the American flag from radical, \ndisrespectful, and violent actions. When Congress responded with a \nfederal flag protection statute, the Supreme Court, in United States v. \nEichman, used its new and changed interpretation of the First Amendment \nto strike it down by another five-to-four vote.\n\n  Under this new interpretation of the First Amendment, it is assumed \nthat the people, their elected legislators, and the courts can no \nlonger distinguish between expressions concerning the flag that are \nmore akin to spoken and written expression and expressions that \nconstitute the disrespectful physical desecration of the flag. Because \nof this assumed inability to make such distinctions, it is argued that \nall of our freedoms to speak and write political ideas are wholly \ndependent on Greg Johnson's newly created ``right'' to burn and spit on \nthe American flag.\n  This ill-advised and radical philosophy fails because its basic \npremise--that laws and judges cannot distinguish between political \nexpression and disrespectful physical desecration--is so obviously \nfalse. It is precisely this distinction that laws and judges did in \nfact make for over 200 years. Just as judges have distinguished which \nlaws and actions comply with the constitutional command to provide \n``equal protection of the laws'' and ``due process of law,'' so to have \njudges been able to distinguish between free expression and \ndisrespectful destruction.\n  Certainly, extremist conduct such as smashing in the doors of the \nState Department may be a way of expressing one's dissatisfaction with \nthe nation's foreign policy objectives. And one may even consider such \nbehavior speech. Laws, however, can be enacted preventing such actions \nin large part because there are peaceful alternatives that can be \nequally powerful. After all, right here in the United States Senate, we \nprohibit speeches or demonstrations of any kind, even the silent \ndisplay of signs or banners, in the public galleries.\n  Moreover, it was not this radical philosophy of protecting \ndisrespectful destruction that the people elevated to the status of \nconstitutional law. Such an extremist philosophy was never ratified. \nSuch a philosophy is not found in the original and historic intent of\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nthe First Amendment. Thus, in this Senator's view, the Supreme Court \nerred in Texas v. Johnson and in United States v. Eichman.\n  Since Johnson and Eichman, constitutional scholars have opined that \nan attempt by Congress to protect the flag with another statute would \nfail in light of the new interpretation currently embraced by the \nSupreme Court. Thus, an amendment is the only legal means to protect \nthe flag.\n  This amendment affects only the most radical forms of conduct and \nwill leave untouched the current constitutional protections for \nAmericans to speak their sentiments in a rally, to write their \nsentiments to their newspaper, and to vote their sentiments at the \nballot box. The amendment simply restores the traditional and historic \npower of the people's elected representatives to prohibit the radical \nand extremist physical desecration of the flag.\n  Nor would restoring legal protection to the American flag place us on \na slippery slope to limit other freedoms. No other symbol of our bi-\npartisan national ideals has flown over the battlefields, cemeteries, \nfootball fields, and school yards of America. No other symbol has \nlifted the hearts of ordinary men and women seeking liberty around the \nworld. No other symbol has been paid for with so much blood of our \ncountrymen. The American people have paid for their flag, and it is our \nduty to let them protect it.\n\n  In recent weeks, my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle \nhave called for a new bipartisan spirit in Congress. This amendment \noffers these senators the chance to honor their words.\n  Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not, nor should it \nbe, a partisan issue. Approximately sixty senators, both Republicans \nand Democrats, have joined with Senator Cleland and myself as original \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  Polls have shown that over 70 percent of the American people want the \nopportunity to vote to protect their flag. Numerous organizations from \nthe American Legion to the Women's War Veterans to the African-American \nWomen's clergy all support the flag protection amendment. Forty-nine \nstate legislatures have passed resolutions calling for constitutional \nprotection for the flag.\n  I am therefore proud to rise today to introduce a constitutional \namendment that would restore to the people's elected representatives \nthe right to protect our unique national symbol, the American flag, \nfrom acts of physical desecration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the proposed \namendment be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I am very honored to be a cosponsor with my dear \nfriend from Georgia, Senator Cleland. I appreciate the efforts he has \nput forth in this battle, and having served in the military as he has \ndone with distinction, courage and heroism, he has a great deal of \ninsight on this issue. I am proud and privileged to be able to work \nwith him.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 7\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within 7 years after the date of its submission for \n     ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I cosponsor this legislation, \nintroduced by the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, which would empower Congress to prohibit the \nburning or other desecration of the American Flag. I do so out of my \nconviction that the American Flag should be placed, preeminent and \ntranscendent, as the inviolable representation of our great country, \nour greatest principles, and our highest ideals.\n  Our democratically elected leaders and our representative government \ndo not always live up to these principles and ideals. However, they \nhave sustained and inspired our governance for over 200 years. They are \nthe principles and ideals for which, throughout our history, so many \nbrave men and women have given their lives. They are the principles and \nideals, embodied in the American Flag, which have been consecrated with \ntheir blood.\n  I came to this realization several years ago, when I visited the \nAmerican Cemetery just off Normandy Beach in France. There stand almost \n10,000 simple, white crosses in long, silent rows. Each one marks the \ngrave of an American soldier, who gave his or her life on behalf of our \ncountry, on behalf of our principles and ideals, and on behalf of their \npreservation throughout the world.\n  These brave and mostly young soldiers did not necessarily agree with \nevery decision made by their government and its leaders at the time. \nNor did the brave men and women who gave their lives in wars before or \nafterward. Yet they made their supreme sacrifices on each of our, and \nall of our, behalfs. They gave up the rest of their lives, their \nfamilies, their hopes, and their dreams, so that we might live under \nthe American Flag and enjoy all of its freedoms, privileges, and \nopportunities.\n  Surely, that supreme sacrifice should be sanctified, honored, \nrespected and forever made inviolate.\n  Many of my friends and trusted advisers have told me I am wrong to \ncosponsor this Constitutional Amendment. They say it violates the very \nfirst principle for which these courageous Americans gave their lives. \nThey say that such an amendment will weaken our First Amendment rights \nfor future protests, disagreements, and expressions of personal and \npolitical conscience.\n  I fully agree with their goals; yet, in this single instance, I \ndisagree with their conclusions. No one supporting this amendment wants \nto compromise the essential freedoms of our First Amendment. In fact, \nby our seeking a Constitutional Amendment to protect the American Flag, \nits sponsors and supporters are acknowledging the sanctity of the \nUnited States Supreme Court's decision, which includes the burning or \ndesecration of the American Flag as a Constitutionally protected form \nof ``Free Speech.'' In other words, virtually all expressions of \npolitical protest, disagreement, disrespect, and discontent are \npermitted.\n  They should be. And after this Amendment is adopted, they will be. \nThat protection of our essential freedoms, first granted and forever \nguaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, \nremain inviolable. By this Amendment, we acknowledge them, respect \nthem, and would place above them only the one ultimate symbol of our \ncountry, our freedoms, and our great democracy: the American Flag.\n  Mr. President, I respect all of my colleagues and fellow citizens who \ndisagree with our purpose through this legislation. However, I hope \nthat they will not misunderstand our intent. Contrary to what some \ncontend, this Constitutional amendment will not weaken either the First \nAmendment or the United States of America. In fact, it will strengthen \nboth. It will remind all of us that there is something greater than \nourselves, something greater than our individual opinions, something \ngreater than our individual prerogatives. That something is greater \nthan all of us, because it is all of us; it is the Flag of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof Senator Hatch's joint resolution which would amend the United States \nConstitution to prohibit the desecration of our flag. Opponents to this \nmeasure contend that the right to desecrate the flag is the ultimate \nexpression of speech and freedom. I reject that proposition as I \nbelieve that the desecration of our flag is a reprehensible act which \nshould be prohibited. It is an affront to the brave and terrible \nsacrifices made by millions of American men and women who willingly \nleft their limbs, lives, and loved ones on battlefields around the \nworld.\n  It is an affront to these Americans who have given the greatest \nsacrifices because of what the flag symbolizes. To explain what our \nflag represents, former United States Supreme Court Chief Justice \nCharles Evans Hughes in his work, ``National Symbol,'' said:\n\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n\n       The flag is the symbol of our national unity, our national \n     endeavor, our national aspiration.\n       The flag tells of the struggle for independence, of union \n     preserved, of liberty and union one and inseparable, of the \n     sacrifices of brave men and women to whom the ideals and \n     honor of this nation have been dearer than life.\n       It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance.\n       It means America united, strong and efficient, equal to her \n     tasks.\n       It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion \n     of your ancestors, that to each generation comes its \n     patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness to sacrifice \n     and endure as those before you have sacrificed and endured \n     rests the national hope.\n       It speaks of equal rights, of the inspiration of free \n     institutions exemplified and vindicated, of liberty under law \n     intelligently conceived and impartially administered. There \n     is not a thread in it but scorns self-indulgence, weakness, \n     and rapacity.\n       It is eloquent of our community interests, outweighing all \n     divergencies of opinion, and of our common destiny.\n\n  Former President Calvin Coolidge, echoed Chief Justice Hughes in \n``Rights and Duties:''\n\n       We do honor to the stars and stripes as the emblem of our \n     country and the symbol of all that our patriotism means.\n       We identify the flag with almost everything we hold dear on \n     earth.\n       It represents our peace and security, our civil and \n     political liberty, our freedom of religious worship, our \n     family, our friends, our home.\n       We see it in the great multitude of blessings, of rights \n     and privileges that make up our country.\n       But when we look at our flag and behold it emblazoned with \n     all our rights, we must remember that it is equally a symbol \n     of our duties.\n       Every glory that we associate with it is the result of duty \n     done. A yearly contemplation of our flag strengthens and \n     purifies the national conscience.\n\n  Given what our flag symbolizes, I find it incomprehensible that \nanyone would desecrate the flag and inexplicable that our Supreme Court \nwould hold that burning a flag is protected speech rather than conduct \nwhich may be prohibited. I find it odd that one can be imprisoned for \ndestroying a bald eagle's egg, but may freely burn our nation's \ngreatest symbol. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to pass this \nresolution so that our flag and all that it symbolizes may be forever \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 59--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MARCH 11 THROUGH MARCH \n               17, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL GIRL SCOUT WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, \nMrs. Carnahan, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Landrieu, \nMrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 24\n\n       Whereas reflex sympathetic dystrophy (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``RSD'') is an extremely painful progressive \n     disease of the nervous system resulting from a simple trauma, \n     infection, or surgery that can lead to chronic inflammation, \n     spasms, burning pain, stiffness, and discoloration of the \n     skin, muscles, blood vessels, and bones;\n       Whereas RSD can strike at any time, and currently afflicts \n     an estimated 7,000,000 children and adults, the majority of \n     whom are women;\n       Whereas RSD is a complex and little-known disease, \n     inhibiting the early diagnosis and treatment needed for \n     recovery and contributing to dismissals of patients' pain and \n     suffering;\n       Whereas there is no known cure for RSD and treatment \n     involves multiple medications and therapies with costs that \n     can be prohibitive;\n       Whereas Betsy Herman established the RSDHope Teen Corner in \n     1998 and she and countless others advocates have worked \n     tirelessly to provide information and support to RSD \n     sufferers and their families and friends and to bring \n     national attention to this crippling disease; and\n       Whereas each May is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Awareness \n     Month, the goal of which is to educate the public about the \n     nature and effects of this terrible disease: Now, \n     therefore,be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) all Americans should take an active role in combatting \n     reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) by recognizing its \n     symptoms (which often follow an injury or surgery), such as \n     constant burning pain, skin irritation, inflammation, muscle \n     spasms, fatigue, and insomnia;\n       (2) national and community organizations should be \n     recognized and applauded for their work in promoting \n     awareness about RSD and for providing information and support \n     to its sufferers;\n       (3) health care providers should continue to increase their \n     efforts to diagnose the disease in its earliest possible \n     stages to increase the likelihood of remission; and\n       (4) the Federal Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise awareness about the importance of the \n     early detection and proper treatment RSD;\n       (B) work to increase research funding so that the causes \n     of, and improved treatment and cure for, RSD may be \n     discovered; and\n       (C) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, health care services for detecting and treating \n     RSD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/13/senate-section/article/S2231-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 23--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH \nRESPECT TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN LIBYA IN THE TERRORIST \n          BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Torricelli, \nMr. Dodd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Byrd, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A RULE RELATING TO ERGONOMICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Academy of Sciences issued a report \n     entitled ``Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace--Low \n     Back and Upper Extremities'' on January 18, 2001. The report \n     was issued after the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration promulgated a final rule relating to \n     ergonomics (published at 65 Fed. Reg. 68261 (2000)).\n       (2) According to the National Academy of Sciences, \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the low back and upper \n     extremities are an important and costly national health \n     problem. An estimated 1,000,000 workers each year lose time \n     from work as a result of work-related musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       (3) Conservative estimates of the economic burden imposed \n     by work-related musculoskeletal disorders, as measured by \n     compensation costs, lost wages, and lost productivity, are \n     between $45,000,000,000 and $54,000,000,000 annually.\n       (4) Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act \n     of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to ``assure so far as \n     possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and \n     healthful working conditions,'' and charged the Secretary of \n     Labor with implementing the Act to accomplish this purpose.\n       (5) Promulgation of a standard on workplace ergonomics is \n     needed to address a serious workplace safety and health \n     problem and to protect working men and women from work-\n     related musculoskeletal disorders. Any workplace ergonomics \n     standard should take into account the cost and feasibility of \n     compliance with such requirements and the sound science of \n     the National Academy of Sciences report.\n       (b) Authority to Issue Rule.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall, in accordance with \n     section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \n     (29 U.S.C. 655), issue a final rule relating to ergonomics. \n     The standard under the final rule shall take effect not later \n     than 90 days after the date on which the rule is promulgated. \n     The standard shall--\n       (A) address work-related musculoskeletal disorders and \n     workplace ergonomic hazards;\n       (B) not apply to non-work-related musculoskeletal disorders \n     that occur outside the workplace or non-work-related \n     musculoskeletal disorders that are aggravated by work; and\n       (C) set forth in clear terms--\n       (i) the circumstances under which an employer is required \n     to take action to address ergonomic hazards;\n       (ii) the measures required of an employer under the \n     standard; and\n       (iii) the compliance obligations of an employer under the \n     standard.\n       (2) Authorization.--Paragraph (1) shall be considered a \n     specific authorization by Congress in accordance with section \n     801(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to the \n     issuance of a new ergonomic rule.\n       (3) Prohibition.--In issuing a new rule under this \n     subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall ensure that nothing \n     in the rule expands the application of State workers' \n     compensation laws.\n       (4) Standard setting authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to restrict or alter the authority of the \n     Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to adopt health or safety \n     standards (as defined in section 3(8) (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) of \n     such Act) for other hazards pursuant to section 6 (29 U.S.C. \n     655) of such Act.\n       (5) Information and training materials.--The Secretary of \n     Labor shall, prior to the date on which the new rule under \n     this subsection becomes effective, develop information and \n     training materials, and implement an outreach program and \n     other initiatives, to provide compliance assistance to \n     employers and employees concerning the new rule and the \n     requirements under the rule.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 81.

AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A RULE RELATING TO ERGONOMICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Academy of Sciences issued a report \n     entitled ``Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace--Low \n     Back and Upper Extremities'' on January 18, 2001. The report \n     was issued after the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration promulgated a final rule relating to \n     ergonomics (published at 65 Fed. Reg. 68261 (2000)).\n       (2) According to the National Academy of Sciences, \n     musculoskeletal disorders of the low back and upper \n     extremities are an important and costly national health \n     problem. An estimated 1,000,000 workers each year lose time \n     from work as a result of work-related musculoskeletal \n     disorders.\n       (3) Conservative estimates of the economic burden imposed \n     by work-related musculoskeletal disorders, as measured by \n     compensation costs, lost wages, and lost productivity, are \n     between $45,000,000,000 and $54,000,000,000 annually.\n       (4) Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act \n     of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to ``assure so far as \n     possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and \n     healthful working conditions,'' and charged the Secretary of \n     Labor with implementing the Act to accomplish this purpose.\n       (5) Promulgation of a standard on workplace ergonomics is \n     needed to address a serious workplace safety and health \n     problem and to protect working men and women from work-\n     related musculoskeletal disorders. Any workplace ergonomics \n     standard should take into account the cost and feasibility of \n     compliance with such requirements and the sound science of \n     the National Academy of Sciences report.\n       (b) Authority To Issue Rule.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall, in accordance with \n     section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \n     (29 U.S.C. 655), issue a final rule relating to ergonomics. \n     The standard under the final rule shall take effect not later \n     than 90 days after the date on which the rule is promulgated. \n     The standard shall--\n       (A) address work-related musculoskeletal disorders and \n     workplace ergonomic hazards;\n       (B) not apply to non-work-related musculoskeletal disorders \n     that occur outside the workplace or non-work-related \n     musculoskeletal disorders that are aggravated by work; and\n       (C) set forth in clear terms--\n       (i) the circumstances under which an employer is required \n     to take action to address ergonomic hazards;\n       (ii) the measures required of an employer under the \n     standard; and\n       (iii) the compliance obligations of an employer under the \n     standard.\n       (2) Authorization.--Paragraph (1) shall be considered a \n     specific authorization by Congress in accordance with section \n     801(b)(2) of title 5, United States Code, with respect to the \n     issuance of a new ergonomic rule.\n       (3) Prohibition.--In issuing a new rule under this \n     subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall ensure that nothing \n     in the rule expands the application of State workers' \n     compensation laws.\n       (4) Standard setting authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to restrict or alter the authority of the \n     Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to adopt health or safety \n     standards (as defined in section 3(8) (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) of \n     such Act) for other hazards pursuant to section 6 (29 U.S.C. \n     655) of such Act.\n       (5) Information and training materials.--The Secretary of \n     Labor shall, prior to the date on which the new rule under \n     this subsection becomes effective, develop information and \n     training materials, and implement an outreach program and \n     other initiatives, to provide compliance assistance to \n     employers and employees concerning the new rule and the \n     requirements under the rule.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 95.
