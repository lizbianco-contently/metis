Mr. President, I rise to speak on the tax relief for \nworking families that the Senate passed a few weeks ago and was signed \ninto law by President Bush.\n  This is the second in a series of speeches I am giving to highlight \nthe details of this bipartisan tax cut that provided significant relief \nto millions of Americans.\n  In today's speech I want to focus on the many provisions in the \nbipartisan bill that provide tax relief for working families and \nparticularly families with children.\n  First, I wish to discuss the efforts to address the marriage penalty \nthat existed throughout the structure of the income tax. For far too \nmany years, the Tax Code penalized working families where both the \nhusband and wife work. It is simply wrong that we had a Tax Code that \npenalized marriage.\n  The bipartisan tax cut completely ends the marriage penalty for many \nlow- and middle-income families and makes significant strides in \nreducing the marriage penalty for all other families.\n  This is accomplished through two actions. First, the bill provides \nthat the standard deduction for those who are married filing jointly \nwill be set at two times the rate of a single individual.\n  For example, when everyone filed their tax returns this last April \n15, the standard deduction for singles was $4,400. However, the \nstandard deduction for married filing jointly was only $7,350. If the \nnew tax law had been fully enacted for tax year 2000, the standard \ndeduction for married filing jointly would have been $8,800.\n  The second step we took was for the 10 percent and 15 percent \nmarginal rate brackets for married filing jointly to be set at two \ntimes the rate of a single individual.\n  Again, to illustrate. If the first $6,000 of a single individual is \ntaxed at 10 percent, then the first $12,000 of a married individual \nfiling jointly will be taxed at 10 percent.\n  These two efforts will provide complete elimination of the marriage \npenalty for low- and many middle-income working families and will also \nbenefit married couples with higher incomes.\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, almost one-half of married couples take \nthe standard deduction. These couples tend to be in the lower income \nbrackets and they will get relief upfront.\n  The doubling of the 10 percent marginal rate bracket is done \nimmediately. The remainder of marriage penalty relief is phased in over \nseveral years. The increase in the standard deduction is phased in over \na 5-year period beginning in 2005 and the doubling of the 15 percent \nrate bracket also is phased in beginning in 2005 and is phased in over \na 4-year period.\n  Many Senators were active in providing marriage penalty relief, but \ncertainly Senator Hutchison of Texas was a leader in this issue.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to address the point some pundits \nhave made about the fact that some of the marriage penalty relief \nprovisions, as well as other provisions in the bill, are phased in. The \nrequirement of phase-ins simply reflects the reality of the guidance we \nwere provided by the budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution effectively requires us to phase in these, and \nother, provisions in the bipartisan tax bill. The budget resolution \nallows for more tax cuts over time as the economy grows and we see \ngreater surpluses year-by-year.\n  The last piece of the bill that addresses marriage penalty is an \nexpansion of the earned income credit, EIC, for married families with \nchildren. The EIC provides a cash payment to low-income working \nfamilies. EIC is targeted particularly to help working families with \nchildren.\n  The EIC provision in the tax bill extends out the point at which the \nEIC begins to phase out for married families with children by $1,000 in \n2002 increased to $3,000 by 2008. For example, this year, the EIC \nbegins to phase out for married families with two children at roughly \n$13,000 of income. Under the new law, next year, the phase out for EIC \nwill be approximately $14,000.\n  The EIC program directly benefits working families with children and \nthis expansion sends a strong message to married couples that hard work \nwill be rewarded under the tax code.\n  The extension of the EIC is certainly a tribute to Senator Jeffords' \nhard work.\n  All told, approximately $60 billion in tax reductions and outlays \nwere devoted to addressing the marriage penalty. This bipartisan \nlegislation provides marriage penalty relief to every family that pays \nincome tax. In addition, millions of families who pay only payroll \ntaxes, receive marriage penalty relief.\n  This is the most significant marriage penalty relief in over 30 \nyears. And I would say 30 years is a long time. Finally, we're \nrecognizing the value of marriage and stable families.\n  Mr. President, I have outlined the efforts to address marriage \npenalty in the bipartisan tax bill, and as you can see these provisions \nare strongly geared toward providing relief for low-and middle-income \nmarried couples.\n  Let me turn now, to another provision, the expansion of the child \ncredit. The increase of the child credit will be a major benefit to the \nlives of millions of children in this country.\n  Under prior law, the child credit is $500 and only available to \nfamilies that pay income tax. Further, this child credit phases out for \nsingle parents with income over $75,000 and $110,000 for married \nindividuals filing jointly.\n  The bipartisan tax relief bill inreases the child credit to $600 \nimmediately, and over time increases it to $1,000.\n  The bill protects middle income families from being hit by the \nalternative minimum tax, AMT, because of the child credit by making the \nchild credit allowable against AMT. This provision helps ensure that \nmiddle-income families will realize the full benefit of the child \ncredit. The AMT relief for middle-income families is due to Senator \nLincoln's strong advocacy.\n  In addition to increasing the child credit, the tax relief bill \nprovides that millions of low-income children who previously did not \nbenefit from the child credit because their parents did not have \nsufficient taxable income will now also benefit from the child credit. \nThe bipartisan tax relief bill makes the child credit refundable for 16 \nmillion kids.\n  This expansion of the child credit program to low-income families \nhappens immediately. I would say that this is a hallmark of the bill, \nthat we sought to have provisions that help low- and middle-income \nfamilies take place as soon as possible.\n  The refundable child credit provides that for every $1,000 above \n$10,000 that a family with a child makes, they will get $100 in child \ncredit, up to the maximum amount of the child credit. In essence, a \nbonus of 10 percent for every dollar the working family makes over \n$10,000. For example, a single mother with one child making $16,000 \nwill now get a check for $600. This is over and above the amount that \nsingle mother would receive from EIC. Thus, this single mother will pay \nno income taxes and will receive EIC as well as an additional $600.\n  Mr. President, let me make that clear: Last year, that single mom did \nnot get one dime of child credit, this year because of this legislation \nthat working mother will get a check for $600.\n  How many times have we heard complaints from the harsh critics of \nthis legislation that it does nothing for those who pay only the \npayroll tax. That is just plain wrong. Under this legislation, the \nworking mom, who pays no income tax receives a refund for this year of \n$600. Now, it doesn't come in the checks, but she gets it through an \neven bigger paycheck.\n  Let's take a look at another example: Under this example, a married \ncouple with two children making $20,000 will now get $1000 from the new \nexpanded child credit and will also benefit from the expansion of the \nEIC for married couples with children. Again, that is $1000 that family \ndid not receive last year and now will receive because of the \nbipartisan tax cut.\n  Even better news for these families, the ten percent rate of payment \nfor the child credit will increase from 10 percent to 15 percent in \n2005. For example,\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nthe single mother I cited above, would get a 15-percent bonus for every \ndollar above $10,000 and given that the child credit will be increased \nto $700 in 2005, that single mother will receive the entire $700 child \ncredit.\n  It is estimated that 16 million children from low-income working \nfamilies will benefit from this expansion of the child credit. We have \na lot of complaints from the critics of this legislation that low-\nincome kids are left out. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let \nme report 16 million children benefit right away from this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  There is no question that the expansion of the child credit and EIC \nis a tremendous benefit to millions of working families. Approximately \n$170 billion of the bipartisan tax relief bill is dedicated to the \nchild tax credit.\n  It is particularly vital that we make sure that hardworking families \nthat pay no income tax are made aware of these new benefits that are \navailable to them. It is also important that these families hear an \nimportant message of this bill: work pays.\n  We have sent out a notice to millions of Americans who pay income tax \ntelling them the check is in the mail. However, we haven't informed the \nmillions of American families with children who work full-time, but do \nnot pay income tax, about the enormous benefits this tax relief bill \nhas for their families.\n  I intend to write Secretary Thompson of HHS and Secretary O'Neill of \nTreasury encouraging them to seek avenues that will educate and inform \nworking Americans about these new provisions that put real money in the \npockets of working families. I am particularly concerned that there be \noutreach to the millions of new Americans that speak Spanish, \nVietnamese, Russian, and dozens of other tongues.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this outreach to inform low-income \nfamilies about the new child credit and expanded EIC is necessary. For \nclearly, anyone reading the New York Times or the Washington Post would \nhave very little idea that the Congress passed, and President Bush \nsigned into law, legislation that provides such great benefits to low-\nincome families.\n  For example, the Washington Post on June 24, 2001, provided a summary \nof the tax provisions giving examples of the tax relief for different \nfamilies at different incomes. Every example starts at $25,000 or \nhigher.\n  Not a single example is given of the benefits of this legislation for \na mother making say $14,000, $16,000, or $18,000. Nor is there a single \nexample of the benefits for a married couple with two children that is \nmaking $17,000, $25,000, or $30,000.\n  I am stunned that these newspapers, that claim to be champions of \nworking families, would completely ignore these major new benefits. \nMaybe the simple truth is they're a little embarrassed to admit that \nthis bipartisan tax relief bill signed by President Bush actually does \na great deal to help millions of working families that struggle to \nescape poverty.\n  So clearly there is a need to educate and inform because the \nnewspaper editors are deciding that ``all the news that's fit to \nprint'' is only news of interest to their middle-income and high-income \nreaders and not their low-income readers.\n  Let me also add, that when we come to revisit welfare reform, I think \nit is important to bear in mind the billions of dollars that have been \nprovided in this bill to encourage struggling families to enter the \nworkforce or expand the number of hours they work. Too often, we get \nfocused on the welfare-specific provisions and completely forget or \nignore the major efforts to encourage work that are contained in the \nTax Code.\n  Mr. President, that highlights the significant efforts the tax bill \nhad to expand and increase the child credit. While many Senators were \nadvocates of increasing the already existing child credit, and several \nSenators supported expanding the child credit and making it \nrefundable--there is no question that Senator Snowe was the key to \nmaking it a reality.\n  Now, I would like to discuss the provisions in the bipartisan tax \nbill to help working families meet the costs of child care.\n  The tax bill helps with the costs of child care in two provisions. \nFirst, the tax relief bill provides greater incentives for employer-\nprovided child care with the creation of a tax credit for employer-\nprovided child care facilities.\n  The tax relief act provides taxpayers a tax credit equal to 25 \npercent of qualified expenses for employer-provided child care and 10 \npercent of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral \nservices. The maximum credit is $150,000 per year. This is $1.4 billion \nin tax incentives to encourage businesses to assist in providing child \ncare for their workers.\n  This new tax initiative will help mothers and fathers to obtain child \ncare--and hopefully child care near their place of work which will \nallow them the opportunity to spend more time with their children. \nSenator Kohl has long advocated this proposal and deserves great credit \nfor making this part of the Tax Code.\n  The second provision regarding child care expands the already \nexisting dependent care tax credit. This is a tax credit that \nparticularly helps low- and middle-income families who pay for child \ncare for their young children.\n  Thanks to Senator Jeffords' work, the bipartisan tax bill expands \nthis program and will allow low and middle income families to take as a \ntax credit more of their costs of child care. The tax bill provides \nnearly $3 billion in additional tax relief for working families \nstruggling to meet the costs of having their children in day care.\n  Thus, the bipartisan tax bill helps working mothers and fathers by \nencouraging employers to provide child care and also easing the cost \nburden of child care.\n  Let me turn now to the final provision I wish to discuss today in \nthis speech that focuses on the provisions in the bipartisan tax relief \nbill that help working families and children. That provision is the \nexpansion of the adoption tax credit.\n  I have long been a strong advocate of encouraging adoptions and know \nit brings joy to the children and the families. I am very pleased that \nthe tax bill provides significant encouragement for families to adopt \nand reduces the costs of adopting parents.\n  Prior law provided for a $5,000 tax credit for qualified adoption \nexpenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer in making an adoption. That \namount was $6,000 for a special needs child. This full tax credit \namount started to phaseout for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross \nincome of over $75,000.\n  I am very pleased that the bipartisan legislation signed by President \nBush increases the tax credit up to $10,000 for qualified adoption \nexpenses and $10,000 for special needs children, regardless of whether \nthere are qualified adoption expenses.\n  In addition, the new tax law expands the number of families eligible \nto take advantage of the adoption tax credit by having the credit begin \nto phaseout at $150,000 modified adjusted gross income.\n  This is a major expansion of the adoption tax credit and provides \nover $3 billion in tax incentives for families to adopt. Senators Craig \nand Landrieu are to be commended for their efforts in this matter.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my comments today on the tax relief \nact. As is plainly true, the tax relief accomplishes President Bush's \ngoal of giving back the people's money. What is also plain and true is \nthat a great deal of the tax relief is focused on helping working \nfamilies with children.\n  I know many in the Capitol are very upset about the bipartisan tax \nbill because the tax relief means less money for them to spend. \nIncredibly, the Democratic leader in the other body has called for a \ntax increase.\n  But let me assure my colleagues, we do far better by allowing working \nfamilies to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  The benefits of the tax relief bill will be realized in millions of \nsmall, unseen, quiet acts and decisions that don't make the evening \nnews and unfortunately for the politicians, don't involve cutting \nribbons and making speeches.\n  I see working families now, because of the bipartisan tax bill, \nhaving more money in their pocket and being able to finally do the \nthings they've planned or hoped for: be it buying a computer for their \nchildren; moving to a bigger apartment in a neighborhood with better \nschools; or purchasing healthier food for the dinner table.\n  These are just a few examples of the multitude of priorities that \nonly the\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nfamilies can best decide--and not the bureaucrats in Washington.\n  It is my belief that with families getting to keep more of their \nhard-earned paycheck--the quiet talks at the kitchen table, after the \nchildren have been put to bed, will be more about opportunities and \npossibilities rather than fears and concerns.\n  Mr. President, I hope this speech will make those who have recently \ncalled for a tax increase to think again. My hope is that they may now \nbetter appreciate the enormous benefits of this legislation and think \nlong and hard before they try to undermine its accomplishments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nMexican trucks.\n  I want to applaud Senator Murray and Senator Shelby for their efforts \nto craft a common-sense solution on this issue. Their provision would \nensure strong safety requirements and would be consistent with our \nobligations under NAFTA.\n  As most people are well aware, the last Administration delayed \nopening the border to Mexican trucks because of serious safety \nconcerns.\n  Indeed, numerous reports have documented these concerns--failing \nbrakes, overweight trucks, and uninsured, unlicensed drivers--to name \njust a few.\n  The most recent figures of the Department of Transportation indicate \nthat Mexican trucks are much more likely to be ordered off the road for \nsevere safety deficiencies than either U.S. or Canadian trucks.\n  While a NAFTA arbitration panel has ruled that the United States must \ninitiate efforts to open the border to these trucks, we need to be \nclear about what the panel has said.\n  The panel indicated:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms. . . . U.S. \n     authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \n     within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States, \n     Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  Moreover, the panel also indicated that U.S. compliance with its \nNAFTA obligations ``would not necessarily require providing favorable \nconsideration to all or to any specific number of applications'' for \nMexican trucks so long as these applications are reviewed, ``on a case-\nby-case basis.''\n  In other words, the U.S. government is well within its rights to \nimpose standards it considers necessary to ensure that our highways are \nsafe.\n  The Administration has suggested that it is seeking to treat U.S., \nMexican, and Canadian trucks in the same way--but we are not required \nto treat them in the same way. That's what the NAFTA panel said.\n  With Mexican trucks, there are greater safety risks. And where there \nare greater safety risks, we can--and must--impose stricter safety \nstandards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8254-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8254-S8259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of the \ncloture vote that is upcoming. I also rise to speak on the amendment \nthat is pending called the Murray-Shelby amendment, which is in \nviolation of NAFTA.\n  As a person who believes very much in reducing barriers to trade \nbetween countries--and particularly for the benefit of America because \nother countries have much higher barriers than the United States--as we \nbring down barriers to trade and other countries, going to our level, \nit is obviously going to help the United States have a more level \nplaying field in order to export our products and to be able to do it \nin a way that creates jobs in America. We all know export-related jobs \nare jobs that pay 15 percent above the national average.\n  While we have had a very big expansion in trade as a result of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement between the countries of Canada, \nthe United States, and Mexico, we now have a rider on this bill \nproviding an opportunity to put in place some restrictions which may in \nfact bring retaliatory action on the part of Mexico.\n  Obviously, when I hear a threat against American agricultural \nproducts as one form of retaliation, it gets my attention, being from \nan agricultural State, particularly when we work so hard to get lower \nbarriers on trade in these international agreements. Quite frankly, \nbarriers to trade are much greater on agriculture than they are for \nmanufactured products and for services, because the worldwide tariff on \nagricultural products is 45 percent, whereas for most other products \nthe average is about 10 percent to 12 percent.\n\n  U.S. tariffs and obstacles to trade are very low in agriculture \ncompared to other countries.\n  As indicated in a letter, which I cosigned, to our colleagues for \nthem to consider when voting on this provision of the bill, I am as \nconcerned about safety of trucks from other countries using our \nhighways. But I also understand that our Department of Transportation \nis also concerned about that and is going to put in place very shortly \nthe very successful California system for inspection of trucks so we \ncan make sure the trucks and drivers from other countries are using our \nhighways safely.\n  But it was suggested yesterday by the Economic Minister of Mexico \nthat if the Senate approves this provision and it becomes law, as the \nReuters news article of yesterday indicated, ``It would leave us''--\nmeaning the country of Mexico--``with no other recourse than to take \nmeasures against the United States.'' The Economic Minister of Mexico, \naccording to this report, said one option would be to block imports of \nhigh-fructose corn syrup from the United States.\n  This issue has already been one source of friction between our two \ncountries. Mexico has already been placing prohibitive tariffs on our \nsweeteners. The United States won a World Trade Organization decision \nagainst Mexico on this issue. We will be putting in jeopardy the \ncompliance of that measure if they retaliate.\n  I don't know why any Member of the Senate from an agricultural \nState--a very important industry in their respective States--would want \nto vote in support of the Shelby-Murray provision if there were a \nchance of retaliation against agricultural products, particularly those \nfrom the Middle West where corn is such an important agricultural \nproduct, and put in jeopardy our exports to China along the lines of \nthe threat of the Economic Minister of Mexico.\n  I call upon Members of both parties who understand the importance of \nagriculture and understand the importance of our ability to export our \nagricultural production. We produce 40 percent more than we consume \ndomestically, and the profitability of agriculture is very much tied to \nexports. Why would they want to do anything that would bring \nretaliation against American agriculture, particularly in the Midwest \nwith products such as corn?\n  I hope every Member in every state where agriculture is an important \nproduct, where they are concerned about profitability of agriculture, \nand where they are particularly concerned about the ability to export \nour products, will consider the threat of the Economic Minister of \nMexico and what they might do in retaliation. We ought to abide by the \nspirit of the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject the \nprovisions of the appropriations bill that would restrict some of the \ninternational obligations of the United States.\n  I hope every Member will make sure they see their vote as a vote that \ncould negatively affect American agriculture, particularly as it \naffects corn farmers in America. Why would anybody want to hurt \nAmerican agriculture by voting for this provision?\n  American agriculture has benefited from the North American Free Trade\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nAgreement. We are exporting much more agricultural products to Mexico \nthan we did 7 years ago when this agreement was put in place. We should \nrespect the spirit of it. International trade is a two-way street. We \ncannot expect just to export everything to other countries and not \nimport as well.\n\n  I want to make sure that people understand that this vote could be \npotentially negative to American agriculture. I ask them to consider \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from Lee \nKlien, president of the National Corn Growers Association, and Charles \nF. Conner, president of the Corn Refiners Association, speaking to \ntheir concern about the Murray-Shelby amendment and asking us to take \ninto consideration the position of the Mexican Government, that they \nmight retaliate against American agriculture, particularly American \ncorn and corn products exported to Mexico.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 26, 2001.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The National Corn Growers Association \n     and Corn Refiners Association, Inc. urge that the Senate not \n     permit unrelated trade actions to destroy the $90 million \n     market for U.S. high fructose corn syrup shipped to Mexico.\n       The Government of Mexico has clearly stated that if \n     legislation to restrict access of the Mexican trucking \n     industry to the U.S. becomes law, they will retaliate by \n     placing restrictions on U.S. exports of high fructose corn \n     syrup. These exports have already been dampened by trade \n     actions of the Mexican government and could be ended entirely \n     if the Mexican trucking measure passed by the House becomes \n     law. Exports of high fructose corn syrup to Mexico put over \n     $35 million in the hands of U.S. corn farmers and provide a \n     much needed market for U.S. grain.\n       The U.S. recently won a case in the World Trade \n     Organization contesting existing Mexican restrictions on high \n     fructose corn syrup exports. This case, and other \n     developments, could point to achieving a much larger market \n     for U.S. agriculture in the years to come. Our groups \n     strongly support measures and actions to open, not close, \n     trade between the U.S. and our NAFTA partners.\n       We urge that you protect this market for U.S. agriculture \n     and reject unwarranted protection that can damage U.S. trade \n     and violate the intent of NAFTA.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lee Kline,\n       President, National Corn Growers Associations.\n     Charles F. Conner,\n       President, Corn Refiners Association, Inc.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum. And I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum \ncall be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Republican side there are 20 minutes 43 \nseconds; on the Democratic side there are 35 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, in every part of our country Americans are \nfrustrated by the transportation problems that we face every day. We \nsit in traffic on overcrowded roads. We wait through delays in \ncongested airports. We have rural areas that are trapped in the past \nwithout the roads and the infrastructure they need to survive. We have \nmany Americans who make their living along our shores, fishing or \nboating. They count on the Coast Guard to keep them safe. But today the \nCoast Guard does not have the resources to fully protect us. We have \nmany families who live near oil and gas pipelines. They are afraid that \nthose aging, untested pipelines could rupture, and with very good \nreason, given all the tragedies we have had lately. They want us to \nmake pipelines safer.\n  Our transportation problems frustrate us as individuals, and they \nfrustrate our Nation's economy, slowing down our productivity and \nputting the brakes on progress. It is time to help Americans on our \nhighways, our railways, our airways, and our waterways. We can do so by \npassing this transportation appropriations bill.\n  For months, Senator Shelby and I have worked in a bipartisan way with \nvirtually every Member of this Senate to meet the transportation needs \nin all 50 States. They told us their priorities, and we found a way to \naccommodate them. We have come up with a balanced, bipartisan bill that \nwill make our highways safer, our roads less crowded, and our country \nmore productive. Now is our chance to put this progress to work for the \npeople we represent.\n  Our bill has broad support from both parties. It passed the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously. It passed the \nfull Appropriations Committee unanimously. Now it is before the full \nSenate ready for a vote, ready to go to work to help Americans who are \nfed up with traffic congestion and airport delays.\n  In a short time, the Senate will vote to move forward on this very \nimportant bill. I hope the Senate will vote to invoke cloture so that \nwe can begin working on the many solutions across the country that will \nimprove our lives, our travel, and our productivity.\n  This vote is about fixing the transportation problems that we face, \nand it is about ensuring the safety of our transportation \ninfrastructure. If you vote for cloture, you are voting to give your \ncommunities the resources they need to escape from crippling traffic \nand overcrowded roads.\n  If you vote for cloture, you are saying that our highways must be \nsafe and that trucks coming from Mexico must meet our safety standards \nif they are going to share our roads. But if you vote against cloture, \nyou are telling the people in your State that they will have to keep \nwaiting in traffic and keep wasting time in congestion.\n  If you vote against cloture, you are voting against the safety \nstandards in this bill. A ``no'' vote would open up our borders to \ntrucks that we know are unsafe, without inspections, and without the \nsafety standards we expect and deserve.\n\n  This vote is not about partisanship or protectionism. It is about \nproductivity and public safety.\n  I want to highlight how this bill will improve highway travel, \nairline safety, pipeline safety, and Coast Guard protection.\n  First and foremost, this bill will address the chronic traffic \nproblems facing our communities. In fact, under this bill every State--\nevery single State--will receive more highway construction funding than \nthe President requested. And with this bill, every State would receive \nmore highway construction funding than they would under the levels \nassumed in TEA-21.\n  Our bill improves America's highways. Our bill also includes money to \nincrease seatbelt use so we can save lives on our roads.\n  Let's vote for cloture so we can begin sending help to our States.\n  Secondly, this bill will improve air transportation, and it will make \nair travel more safe. This bill provides additional funding to hire 221 \nmore FAA inspectors. The administration's budget did not provide this \nfunding, but our bill does because it is a national priority.\n  Let's vote for cloture so we can begin putting these new inspectors \non the job for our safety.\n  Third, our bill boosts funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety by \nmore than $11 million above current levels. That means: funding all new \n26 positions requested by OPS; $4.7 million for pipeline safety \nresearch and development; $8 million for testing and best safety \npractices; and $3.4 million to improve community right-to-know and to \nupdate our national mapping system\n  Let's vote for cloture so we can begin making America's pipelines \nsafer before another tragedy claims more innocent lives.\n  Fourth, this bill will give the Coast Guard the funding it needs to \nprotect us and our environment. Our subcommittee has held several \nhearings on this issue, and we have great respect for the men and women \nof our Coast Guard. We want them to be able to do their jobs safely \nwith the training and support they need.\n  Our bill will help modernize the maritime 911 system. It will address \nserious staffing, training, and equipment shortfalls at search and \nrescue stations. And our bill funds the mandatory pay and benefit costs \nfor our Coast Guard service members.\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\n  Let's vote for cloture so we can begin making our waterways safer.\n  These examples show how this bill will help address the \ntransportation problems we all so desperately face at home.\n  This vote, though, is also about making our highways safe, so I want \nto turn to the issue of Mexican trucks. And I want to clear up a few \nthings.\n  Some Members have suggested that Senator Shelby and I have refused to \nnegotiate on this bill. That simply is not the case. As I have said \nseveral times in this Chamber, we are here, we are ready, and we are \nlistening. And we have had extensive meetings, bringing both sides \ntogether.\n  On Tuesday, our staffs met until well after midnight. Again \nyesterday, Wednesday, our staffs met from midafternoon until 3 a.m. \nthis morning. We have worked, as well, this morning, meeting one more \ntime. We have worked with all sides to move this bill forward.\n  I want to point out something else to those who say we must \ncompromise, compromise, compromise. The Murray-Shelby bill itself is a \ncompromise. It is a balanced, moderate compromise between the extreme \npositions taken by the administration and the House of Representatives.\n  On one hand, we have the administration, which took a hands-off \napproach to let all Mexican trucks across the border and then inspect \nthem later, up to a year and a half later. Even though we know these \ntrucks are much less safe than American or Canadian trucks, the \nadministration thinks it is fine for us to share the road with them, \nwithout any assurance of their safety.\n  At the other extreme was the ``strict protectionist'' position of the \nHouse of Representatives. It said no Mexican trucks can cross the \nborder and that not one penny could be spent to inspect them. Those are \nthe extreme positions.\n  The administration said: Let in all the trucks without ensuring our \nsafety. The House of Representatives said: Don't let any trucks in \nbecause they are not safe.\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard. We have found a balanced, \nbipartisan, commonsense compromise. We listened to the safety experts, \nto the Department of Transportation's own inspector general, to the \nGAO, and to the industry. We came up with a compromise that will allow \nMexican trucks onto our highways and will ensure that those trucks and \ntheir drivers are safe. With this balanced bill, free trade and highway \nsafety can move forward side by side.\n  This bill doesn't punish Mexico, and that is not our intention. \nMexico is an important neighbor, ally, and friend. Mexican drivers are \nworking hard to put food on their own families' tables, and we want \nthem to be safe, both for their families and for ours.\n  NAFTA was passed to strengthen our partnerships and to raise the \nstandard of living in all three countries. We are continuing to move \ntowards that goal, and the bipartisan Murray-Shelby compromise will \nhelp us get there.\n  Right now Mexican trucks are not as safe as they should be. According \nto the Department of Transportation inspector general, Mexican trucks \nare significantly less safe than American trucks. Last year, nearly two \nin five Mexican trucks failed their safety inspections. That compares \nwith one in four American trucks and one in seven Canadian trucks.\n  Furthermore, Mexican trucks have been routinely violating the current \nrestrictions that limit their travel to the 20-mile commercial zone. \nThe Department of Transportation's own inspector general has found that \n52 Mexican trucking firms have already operated illegally in more than \nhalf of the United States.\n  We have, as Members of the Senate, a responsibility to ensure the \nsafety of America's highways. The Murray-Shelby compromise allows us to \npromote safety without violating NAFTA.\n  During this debate we have heard from some Senators who say that they \nthink ensuring the safety of Mexican trucks would violate NAFTA. We \nhave heard that some White House advisers think ensuring the safety of \nMexican trucks would violate NAFTA. I appreciate all of their opinions, \nbut with all due respect, there is only one authority, only one \nofficial body that decides what violates NAFTA and what does not. That \norganization, established under the NAFTA treaty itself, is the \narbitration board known as the Arbitral Panel. Here is what that \nauthority said:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms . . .\n       U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe operations of \n     trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United \n     States, Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  Those are not my words. Those are from the people who decide, the \nNAFTA arbitration panel. It is that simple. We can ensure the safety of \nMexican trucks and comply with NAFTA. This bill shows us how with a \ncommonsense safety measure.\n  Under our bill, when you are driving on the highway behind a Mexican \ntruck, you can feel safe. You will know that truck was inspected and \nthat the company has a good track record. You will know an American \ninspector visited their facility and examined their records, just as we \ndo with Canadian trucking firms. You will know the driver is licensed \nand insured and the truck is weighed and is safe for our roads and \nbridges. You will know we are keeping track of which drivers are \nobeying our laws and which ones are not. You will know drivers who \nbreak our laws won't be on our roads because their licenses will be \nrevoked.\n\n  You will know that the person behind the wheel of an 18-wheeler has \nnot been driving for 20 or 30 straight hours. You will know that the \ntruck didn't just cross our border unchecked but crossed where there \nwere inspectors on duty. That is a real safety program. That will make \nme feel comfortable driving my family on our highways.\n  The administration's plan is just far too weak. Under the \nadministration's plan, trucking companies would mail in a form saying \nthey are safe and begin driving on our highways--no inspections for up \nto a year and a half. The White House is telling American families that \nthe safety check is in the mail. I don't know about anybody else, but I \nwouldn't bet my family's safety on that.\n  I want an actual inspector looking at that truck, checking that \ndriver's record, making sure that truck won't threaten me or my family.\n  The White House says: Take the trucking company at its word that its \ntrucks and drivers are safe. Senator Shelby and I say: Trust an \nAmerican safety inspector to make sure that truck and driver will be \nsafe on our roads.\n  This is a solid compromise. It will allow robust trade while ensuring \nthe safety of our highways. The people of America need help in the \ntransportation challenges they face every day on our crowded roads. \nThis bill provides real help and funds the projects for which our \nMembers have been asking.\n  Some Senators apparently would hold every transportation project in \nthe country hostage until they have weakened the safety standards in \nthe Murray-Shelby compromise. That is the wrong thing to do. Let's keep \nthe safety standards in place so that when you are driving down the \nhighway next to a truck with Mexican license plates, you will know that \ntruck is safe. Let's vote for safety by voting for cloture on this \nbill.\n  In closing, this vote is about two things: Helping Americans who are \nfrustrated every day by transportation problems, and ensuring the \nsafety of our transportation infrastructure. Today I urge my colleagues \nto vote for cloture so we can put this good, balanced bill to work for \nthe American people.\n  Voting for cloture means we can begin making our roads less crowded, \nour airports less congested, our waterways safer, our railroads better, \nand our highways safer. Virtually every Member of this Senate has come \nup to me and told me about the transportation challenges in their \nState. Senator Shelby and I have listened. We have done everything we \ncan to meet America's priorities.\n  Those who vote for cloture are voting to begin making progress across \nthe country in ensuring the safety of our highways. Those who vote \nagainst cloture are voting to keep our roads and our airports crowded \nand to expose Americans to new dangers on our highways.\n  The choice is simple. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we \ncan\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nbegin putting this good, balanced bill to work for the people we \nrepresent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time under the quorum call be equally \ndivided and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I just want to make a few points before \nwe vote on cloture. It is unfortunate that we are even at this point, \nbut if cloture is the only way to move forward on the Transportation \nappropriations bill, then I urge my colleagues to support cloture.\n  This isn't a partisan issue--there is no such thing as Republican or \nDemocrat roads. When the Transportation bill finally passes, I suspect \nthat we will have all but a handful of Senators supporting the final \nbill.\n  You have to ask yourself who the winners and losers are in the \nsituation we find ourselves today. I think it is hard to pick the \nwinners, but clearly the loser in this situation is the administration. \nThe amount of time that we have had to spend on this bill to this \npoint--and that we will have to spend to complete action on it--pushes \nthe appropriations process into an area that is dangerous for the \nadministration.\n  The worst thing that can happen for the administration and budget \nhawks--I have been accused of being a budget hawk and a budget spender. \nI do not know how you do both--is to have appropriations bills back up \nagainst the end of the fiscal year. Unfortunately, the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves in this chamber today makes it much more likely \nthat the President will be facing an omnibus appropriations bill.\n  If we have learned any lesson from the past few years, it is this: \nspending will increase in an omnibus bill. I know this President is \ncommitted to limiting the growth in government spending but, \nunfortunately, the Senate is making his job harder by failing to \nexpeditiously move these spending measures.\n  Yesterday, the Department of Transportation, the Office of Management \nand Budget, and the White House all told me that Senators Gramm and \nMcCain do not speak on behalf of the President--that the President \nspeaks for himself.\n  So even if we could come to agreement on the Mexican truck safety \nprovisions, we have no assurance that we have addressed the concerns \nthat the President has with this measure.\n  The simple solution is to move this issue to conference. Although, I \nrespect the rights accorded every Member of this body. I fail to \nunderstand why a small faction in the Senate to desire to tie up the \nSenate floor until this bill completely reflects their views.\n  The Senator from Washington and I have spent a great deal of time \ntrying to understand and work with those Senators and their staffs to \nresolve these issues in the finest traditions of the Senate.\n  In fact, I remained hopeful that we could come to closure on a \npackage that we could all support until shortly before noon this \nmorning. Unfortunately, I believe we are at an impasse and it is time \nto let the Senate work its will.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I compliment the managers of this bill. \nThey have put an enormous amount of time and effort and work into \nbringing the bill to the floor, marking it up in committee, and \nconducting hearings on it. I believe the Senate is in their debt.\n  This is a bill that is needed. It has important appropriations in it \nfor our country and it is a bill that comes to the floor in a situation \nin which we are very constrained for time. We have the August recess \nfast approaching. We have already reported from the committee seven \nappropriations bills in addition to the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  The committee will be meeting this afternoon to report two additional \nappropriations bills. Thus, we will have nine appropriations bills \nreported by the committee, in addition to the supplemental, which has \nalready been signed into law.\n  Here we are, with only a week remaining before the August break. \nPresumably, we will go home and not tackle this enormous task before we \nreturn. We have all these conferences that have to take place on these \nbills. I have talked with the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee just this morning. He agrees with me that we need to move \nahead with these conferences. I have urged we at least get our staffs \nto work on the preliminary differences that exist between the two \nHouses, especially on my own bill, the Interior appropriations bill. So \nthe two Houses, through the chairmen, are working together, not just \nthe chairman. We also include our ranking member, Senator Stevens, and \nin the case of my own bill, there is also, of course, Mr. Obey and Mr. \nDicks.\n  So we have work to do. I hope the Senate will invoke cloture on this \nmotion. We must get on with our work. It is not my choice that we delay \nour work. Every Senator has certain rights. I respect the rights of any \nSenator to offer amendments, to debate, speak, even to delay. I have \nevery respect for that. Those things are within Senate rules.\n  Again, I commend the managers of the bill. I commend our leader, Mr. \nDaschle; our assistant leader, Mr. Reid of Nevada; and I hope Senators \nwill respond to the demands of the moment, the demands being that we \nutilize our time, get on with the work of the Senate, pass this \nappropriations bill, and send it to conference.\n  There are 13 regular bills. Those bills have to be passed before we \ngo home. They have to be passed to keep the Government running. I don't \nwant to see an omnibus bill. I am against omnibus appropriations bills; \nthings are done in a hurry. They are more costly because things are \nadded which otherwise might not be added, and all too often the \nadministration is virtually given an open invitation to come into the \nconference when there is an omnibus bill and we reach the fiscal \ndeadline.\n  We have done very well thus far this year. We have a lot of work to \ndo and I hope the Senate acts today to save time and act upon this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the time now \nis for the two leaders; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to Senator Murray, I have been \nimpressed with her in days past. We worked together on a number of \ndifferent issues. Her work this week in this appropriations bill has \nbeen exemplary. She has been tenacious. She has been willing to \ncompromise, as a legislator must do. I think she and Senator Shelby \nhave done an outstanding job. It will be a real shame, in my \nestimation, if we do not have a bipartisan vote this afternoon to \ninvoke cloture on this very important piece of legislation.\n\n  For me and the State of Nevada, this legislation is important. \nTransit, airports, highways--this is a bill that is vital to the people \nof the State of Nevada.\n  I want the ability shown by the Senator from Washington spread on the \nRecord of the Senate. She has been a good, good legislator. I am proud \nto work with her, and I think, as far as the traditions of the \nAppropriations Committee are concerned, she is right there with the \nbest.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmajority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington for her outstanding work and leadership in bringing us \nto this point. She inherited a very difficult and challenging \nlegislative set of circumstances. She has maneuvered through those \ncircumstances admirably. I am grateful to her for the leadership and \nthe direction she has provided the caucus.\n  Let me say as he walks on to the Senate floor, I am also very \ngrateful for the outstanding leadership and cooperation provided by the \ndistinguished ranking member from Alabama, Mr. Shelby. The two have \nshown what real bipartisanship on complicated matters can be, and they \npersonify it. I am grateful to both of them.\n  I think it is important to say what this issue is not, then say what \nit is, and then I think we ought to have a vote. What this issue is not \nis any threat to NAFTA, any threat to free trade. There have been \nrumors, in the last 48 hours in particular, that somehow the language \npresented in this bill would violate NAFTA. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. I think Senator Baucus made that point very eloquently \non the floor just recently. I am grateful to him. But this is NAFTA-\ncompliant. There is nothing about which we will now vote that has \nanything to do with violating NAFTA, so let's make that point clear at \nthe beginning.\n  Second, there are those, in the last several days, who have somehow \ntried to imply that to be in favor of the Murray-Shelby language is to \nbe anti-Hispanic. That is not only disappointing, it does a disservice \nto this debate. That kind of rhetoric ought not be excusable. This is a \nbona fide, very thoughtful, deliberate consideration about what ought \nto be American policy with regard to safety. No one in this country--no \none--should deny the importance of our relationship with Mexico. No one \nshould deny in any way, shape, or form the importance of open and free \ntrade with Mexico as we consider all the important ramifications of \nthis trade.\n  But for anyone to say that somehow to be supportive of this makes one \nanti-Hispanic, in my view, is a direct confrontation with the prestige \nand the extraordinary reputation of the two Senators who are authors of \nthis bill, along with many other members of the Hispanic caucus and \nMembers on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle who \nwant to find a resolution to this matter.\n  This legislation is simply an effort to deal with a problem that is \ngrowing in importance and concern. We have a safety problem in this \ncountry that has to be addressed. We have standards that are adhered to \nby every trucking company, every truckdriver, every State in the \ncountry. All we are saying is, simply, if we are going to have \ncontinued trade with Mexico, if we are going to have Mexican trucks, \nlet's at least ensure that Mexican trucks meet our safety standards. \nThat is all the Murray-Shelby language does. It ensures some degree of \nconfidence that we can address the question of truck safety.\n  This is not the extraordinary language that was added to the House \nbill. This is a recognition that we can find middle ground. I will say \nbefore the vote, and it ought to be emphasized, how grateful I am that \nthese two Senators in particular spent all the last several days--in \nfact, we accommodated them with our floor schedule--to try to find \ncommon ground with those who oppose this language. They were here last \nnight until 2 o'clock in the morning. I give them credit for making the \neffort to try to achieve the common ground we failed to achieve as a \nresult of these negotiations.\n  Let there be no mistake: This vote is a vote about truck safety. This \nvote is an absolute necessity if we are going to move this \nTransportation bill forward. I will have no other choice but to pull \nthe Transportation appropriations bill and move on to other issues, \ngiven the extraordinary amount of work that has to be done in the brief \ntime we have between now and the August recess.\n  Let me end where I began by thanking the distinguished chair and \nranking member and all of those who have demonstrated good, bipartisan \nleadership in reaching a solution to this very complex issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned about unsafe \nMexican trucks entering the United States and endangering American \nmotorists. I have no doubts that there will be accidents and lives will \nbe lost.\n  I very strongly believe that the U.S. Senate must stand firm and do \neverything in our power to make sure trucks are not allowed to travel \nthroughout the U.S. unless they comply with all U.S. safety rules and \nregulations. This includes making sure Mexican drivers hold valid \ndrivers licenses, retain adequate American insurance, and abide by U.S. \nhours of service limits.\n  Right now on our border, even if a Mexican truck crossing into the \nUnited States is inspected, the safety inspector has no idea how long \nthe Mexican driver has been driving. I believe we should not let a \ndriver who has been driving 20 hours into the United States because \ndoing so would endanger American lives.\n  I have spoken with the Mexican Ambassador on this issue, and we both \nagreed that Mexican trucks should meet all U.S. laws. I don't want to \ndiscriminate against Mexican trucks, but we need to have the proper \nprocedures in place before these trucks expand their travel throughout \nthe United States. There are clearly not enough inspections at the \nborder right now because only 1 or 2 percent of the trucks crossing the \nborder are given safety inspections.\n  I believe strongly in this issue, and I raised these concerns with \nSenator Murray, the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and I think she has done an excellent job to include \nprovisions to address safety while still ensuring the language is NAFTA \ncompliant.\n  The Murray-Shelby provisions will keep our highways safe, while \nmeeting our obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  I strongly believe that we must make safety the highest priority and \nthat is exactly what the Murray-Shelby provisions do.\n  Last year, more than 5,300 Americans died in accidents involving \ncommercial trucks. As the Department of Transportation's Inspector \nGeneral said last Wednesday, 5,300 fatalities would mean an airline \ncrash every two weeks.\n  Now just think about that. If there were a catastrophic \ntransportation incident every 2 weeks, would we want to do something to \nworsen the danger and increase fatalities? I hope we wouldn't, but that \nis exactly what we are doing if we allow the Bush Administration to \nproceed and open up the entire U.S. highway system to Mexican trucks.\n  Mexican trucks pose significant safety threats when out on the roads. \nU.S. safety inspectors have found that, on average, 36 percent of the \nMexican trucks inspected have significant safety defects. This means \nover one-third of all Mexican trucks have serious safety violations, \nsuch as defective breaks, inoperative steering, and bald tires. Truck \ndrivers might also not have a valid drivers license, lawful insurance, \nor logbooks to document how many hours they have been driving without \nsleep.\n  True, U.S. trucks have an ``out-of-service'' rate of over 20 percent, \nbut the rate for Mexican trucks at 36 percent is still well above the \nU.S. average.\n  More importantly, safety inspectors can only evaluate 1 or 2 percent \nof the 4.5 million trucks that cross the U.S.-Mexican border each year.\n  I believe that until our Nation has the people and the infrastructure \nat the border necessary to inspect Mexican trucks sufficiently, they \nmust be contained in the 20-mile commercial zone where they now \noperate.\n  There are three different approaches to address how to keep our roads \nsafe:\n  First, the House has said, ``no matter what, keep the trucks out.'' \nOn June 26 the House passed an unconditional ban on Mexican trucks, and \nthat is one option.\n  Second, the administration and Senators working with the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\non this issue have said, ``open the border as soon as possible.'' Now, \nthey do call for some safety requirements and some enforcement to be in \nplace, but this is not an issue where we should provide a half-loaf \nsolution.\n  And third, there is the option that I support--the option chosen \nunanimously by the members of the Appropriations Committee--to put \nsafety first and not open the border until specific safety requirements \nare in place.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has provided $103.2 million not \napproved by the House to pay for more resources at the border. The bill \nincludes $13.9 million for additional safety inspectors, $18 million \nfor grants to border states, and $71.3 million for facilities along the \nU.S.-Mexican border.\n  Even with the steps being taken, the Department of Transportation's \nInspector General has said that ``additional actions are needed to \nreasonably ensure the safety of commercial vehicles and drivers as they \nenter at the southern border, operate within the commercial zone, and \ntraverse the United States.''\n  To address these concerns, the Appropriations Committee included \ncomprehensive safety provisions in this bill. Most importantly, Mexican \ntrucks will stay within the commercial zone and off all other U.S. \nhighways until they meet the safety standards demanded by American \nmotorists.\n  Specifically, under the bipartisan Murray-Shelby provisions, Mexican \ncarriers will be given full safety reviews before they will be allowed \nto operate in the United States and the Department of Transportation \nwill keep a watchful eye on how they operate once they are found to be \nsafe carriers through a follow-up safety audit.\n  In addition, the following steps must be taken by the Department of \nTransportation and the 190 Mexican carriers that are awaiting permits \nto send their trucks throughout the United States:\n  The Department of Transportation must:\n  Certify that all border crossings have complete coverage by trained \ninspectors during all operating hours;\n  Certify all 80 new border inspectors as ``safety specialists'';\n  Provide adequate facilities to conduct inspections and place unsafe \ntrucks out of service;\n  Conduct a sufficient number of inspections to maintain safe roads; \nand\n  Certify that there is an accurate system to verify Mexican drivers \nlicenses, vehicle registrations, and insurance certificates on the \nborder.\n  Mexican carriers must:\n  Comply with U.S. hours-of-service rules so that U.S. inspectors know \nhow long a trucker has been driving when they arrive at the border; and\n  Provide proof of valid insurance granted by a U.S. firm.\n  It is essential to recognize that the Murray-Shelby provisions don't \nopen the border until safety standards are met, but the Bush \nadministration wants to open the border as soon as possible and monitor \nsafety while trucks are operating throughout the United States.\n  Should we not err on the side of caution and have our inspectors and \ninfrastructure in place before Mexican trucks are allowed north?\n  As I mentioned, I have met with the Mexican Ambassador, Juan Jose \nBremer, on this issue and we both agree that Mexican trucks should meet \nU.S. safety standards.\n  Because--at this stage--Mexican trucks present a greater danger than \nother trucks on our roads, we must protect American motorists.\n  I am encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken to work with the United \nStates--not just on this issue, but on others as well. Yet, I am a \nstrong supporter of the provisions authored by Senator Murray because I \nbelieve some more steps need to be taken on both sides to address \nsafety before Mexican trucks travel throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield my 1 hour to the manager of the \nbill on this side, Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 1030 to \nthe substitute to the bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1168 to Amendment No. 1030\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent violations of United States commitments under \n                                 NAFTA)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, amendment No. 1168. I call up this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator McCain and ask for its immediate consideration. I ask it be \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1168 to amendment No. \n     1030:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Provided, \n     That notwithstanding any other provision of Act, nothing in \n     this Act shall be applied in a manner that the President \n     finds to be in violation of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this pending amendment is about as clear as \nthe amendment can be. Basically, what the amendment says is that in \nterms of implementing this restriction on funding, notwithstanding any \nother provision of this section, which consists of 22 restrictions on \nthe fulfillment of NAFTA in its transportation clause, that those \nprovisions would be binding except to the extent the President finds \nthem to be in violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  This amendment is very important because it gets down to the heart of \nthe issue before us. The issue before us is when the President \nnegotiates an agreement with sovereign foreign nations--as he did with \nthe NAFTA, the most important trade agreement ever negotiated in the \nhistory of the Americas, with Mexico and Canada--when the President \ncommits the Nation with his signature, as he did in San Antonio, TX, \nwhen he signed NAFTA, and then when Congress approves that trade \nagreement by an affirmative action of both Houses of Congress and the \nPresident's signature, whether we are bound by that agreement.\n  Having negotiated the agreement and having ratified the agreement, no \nmatter how popular it may be, no matter what special interest group it \nmight satisfy, we cannot give the word of our President and the \nratification of our Congress and then come back after the fact and say \nwe do not want to live up to our end of the bargain.\n  We have invoked cloture, which at some point 30 hours from now will \nbring a vote on the Murray amendment. The Murray amendment has many \nprovisions. Many of those provisions violate NAFTA--the agreement that \nwe entered into in San Antonio and ratified in the Congress--and, in \ndoing so, go back on the word of the United States of America.\n  I object to this for a lot of reasons, but the biggest reason is \nwhether one is an individual or whether they are the greatest nation in \nthe history of the world, when they commit themselves to something, if \nthey do not live up to it they lose their credibility.\n  It is an interesting paradox that we are in the Chamber of the Senate \ntoday going back on the commitment we made under NAFTA at the very \nmoment that our President, our Secretary of State, and our trade \nrepresentative are urging our trading partners all over the world to \nlive up to agreements they have made with the United States of America.\n  All over the world today, parliaments and congresses are meeting. And \njust as it is true outside in the hallway here, there are \nrepresentatives of powerful special interests there that are saying: Do \nnot live up to this agreement with the United States because it is \ngoing to hurt some domestic economic and political interest. They are \ntrying to make a decision: Should they live up to the commitment they \nmade to the United States or should they go back on their word?\n  We are trying to exert moral authority and suasion in saying to them: \nLive up to the commitments you made to the United States. We are living \nup to our part of the agreement. We expect you to live up to your part \nof the agreement.\n  The biggest reason I am concerned by the action that we are starting \nto take here is that we are going back on our word, and not just our \nword in general, but our word to a neighbor that shares a 2,000-mile \nborder with the United States of America. We are going back on our word \nwith a neighbor that has had the equivalent of a political revolution \nand has elected a President who is more favorable toward trade, more \nfavorable toward a strong and positive relationship with the United \nStates, than any leader in Mexican history.\n\n  We all applaud what President Fox is doing and saying, his \nleadership, his reform. But I ask my colleagues what kind of signal are \nwe sending to President Fox and what kind of position are we putting \nhim in when we go back on an agreement that we have made with Mexico? \nThis was not an agreement that was made by President George W. Bush \nalone; this was not an agreement made by President Clinton alone; this \nwas not an agreement that was made by President Bush alone. This was an \nagreement that was made, ratified, and enforced by three Presidents--\ntwo of whom are Republicans and one on whom is a Democrat. It is an \nagreement that was ratified by a Congress that clearly understood that \nwe were undertaking obligations in that agreement.\n  As some of my colleagues may have seen, there is a Reuters news story \nout this morning that describes Mexico's first response to what we are \ndoing in the Senate. The headline on the Reuters news story is: \n``Mexico Warns Retaliation Against U.S. on Truck Ban.'' The article \ngoes on to say:\n\n       Mexico warned on Wednesday it would retaliate with trade \n     measures against the United States if the U.S. Senate \n     approves a measure prohibiting Mexican trucks from greater \n     access to American roads.\n       ``In the event the Senate approves this and it becomes law, \n     it would leave us no other recourse than to take measures \n     (against the United States),'' Economy Minister Luis Ernesto \n     Derbez told reporters.\n       He said one option would be to block imports of high \n     fructose corn syrup from the United States, long a source of \n     trade friction. . . .\n\n  I am concerned about starting a trade war with Mexico.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will when I get through.\n  I am not just concerned about starting a trade war with Mexico. I am \nconcerned about what we are doing to President Fox when we are taking \naction that violates the treaty we entered into with Mexico. I don't \nknow what kind of position we put him in with his own people when the \nmost important agreement we have ever entered into with Mexico is being \nabrogated by an action on an appropriations bill in the Senate.\n  What I do in the pending amendment is make it clear that in \nimplementing the provisions of the Murray amendment, nothing in that \namendment will apply in a manner that the President finds will violate \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement. Now, our colleagues who \nsupport the Murray amendment say the amendment does not violate NAFTA. \nIf the amendment does not violate NAFTA, then this amendment will do it \nno violence. But if, in fact, the amendment does violate NAFTA, and I \nbelieve it is obvious to any objective observer that it does, then this \namendment will say that those provisions that violate NAFTA will not be \nenforced. That is what the amendment does.\n  Let me try to explain further, because this is a very complicated \nissue. What often happens in any great deliberative body is that people \ncloak objectives in very noble garb. What we have before the Senate is \nan amendment that claims to be about safety, when most of the amendment \nis about protectionism and about preventing America from living up to \nthe obligation that it made under NAFTA.\n  Let me outline what I want to do. First, let me outline what NAFTA \nsays, what it commits us to. Then I will draw a clear distinction in \nfour or five examples about what violates NAFTA and what does not \nviolate NAFTA. Then I will go through the provisions in this bill that \nviolates NAFTA. Then I will conclude by reserving the remainder of my \ntime and letting other people speak.\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\n  First, in Chapter 12 of the North American Free Trade Agreement as \nsigned by the President and approved by Congress, reference is made to \nAmerica's and Mexico's and Canada's obligation on cross-border trade \nand services. Our agreement was not just about goods coming across the \nborder, but it was about services coming across the border.\n  Obviously, the service we are talking about today is trucking. Here \nare the two obligations to which we agreed in the NAFTA. I will read \nthem because it is important people understand exactly what we are \ntalking about.\n  The first article is called ``National Treaty.'' What it says in \nEnglish, and in Spanish, too, is that when we enter into this \nagreement, we are going to give Mexican companies and Canadian \ncompanies the same treatment we give to our own nationals. In other \nwords, they are going to be treated the same. Hence the term ``national \ntreatment.''\n  Specifically, it says ``Each party shall accord the service providers \nof another party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \nlike circumstances to its own service providers.'' That is the exact \nlanguage of NAFTA.\n  Now, what does that language mean? It says if you are a Mexican \ntrucking company, you will face the same requirements, the same \nobligations, the same rules, the same laws, as you would face if you \nwere an American trucking company and the same rules, the same laws, \nthe same obligations, the same regulations that you would face if you \nwere a Canadian trucking company.\n  There is another provision which is very similar to the national \ntreatment provision, but called the most-favored-nation treatment \nprovision. When we entered into this agreement with Canada and Mexico, \nwe not only said we were going to treat them as we treat ourselves in \nthis cross-border trade and services, but we committed we would treat \nthem as well as we treated any other nation.\n  That language is as follows: ``Each party shall accord to service \nproviders of another party treatment no less favorable than it accords \nin like circumstances to service providers of any other party or of a \nnonparty.''\n  In other words, what we committed to Mexico on that day in the mid-\n1990s was they could provide services on a competitive basis with \nservices provided by American providers and by Canadian providers, and \nthat they would be treated the same in like circumstances.\n  Now, we did have a proviso, a reservation. That reservation is in \nAnnex I. I want to make sure that people understand that reservation in \nno way applies to the bill we are talking about here. The first \nreservation said that within 3 years of the date of the signature of \nthe agreement, cross-border truck services to or from border States \nwould be allowed to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. That is \nwhere trucks are currently operating today. Then, within 3 years there \nwould be an agreement concerning cross-border bus service. And finally, \nwithin 6 years after the agreement went into force--and it went into \nforce in 1994--cross-border trucking services would be allowed.\n  So that is the agreement we entered into. There is a distinction that \nneeds to be drawn to explain the problem with the Murray amendment. The \ndistinction is as follows: If circumstances in Mexico are different \nthan they are in Canada or the United States, so long as the standards \nwe apply are the same, we don't have to enforce them exactly in the \nsame way.\n\n  For example, we have had a long association with Canada. As a result \nyou can apply on the Internet for a license in Canada to operate a \ntruck in the United States. You can pay $300 and you are in business. \nBecause we are beginning a new process with Mexico, obviously we have \nto have a more stringent regimentation than that.\n  Senator McCain and I have proposed--and it is perfectly within the \nNAFTA agreement's purview--that to begin with, we inspect every single \nMexican truck; inspect every single Mexican truck, and require that \nthey meet every standard American trucks have to meet with regard to \nsafety.\n  There is no debate here about safety. Everybody is for safety. I will \njust say that Senator McCain and I both have numerous Mexican trucks \noperating in our States today. The chairman and ranking member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Committee have no Mexican trucks \noperating in their States. I would say, since my people are affected \nmore today and will be affected more when NAFTA is fully implemented \nthan either of the States that are represented by the chairman and \nranking member, I am obviously at least as concerned about safety as \nthey are.\n  But there is a difference between safety and protectionism. Here is \nwhere the difference lies. Under NAFTA, we have every right to set \nstandards and every obligation to set safety standards so Mexican \ntrucks have to meet the same standards as trucks of the United States. \nBecause the situation in Mexico is different, we can have differences \nin how they are implemented. In fact, today we inspect Canadian trucks. \nWe inspect about 48 percent of the Canadian trucks that come into the \nUnited States. We inspect 28 percent of U.S. trucks. In fact, today, \neven though trucks are limited to the border area, we inspect 73 \npercent of Mexican trucks. Today we are inspecting Mexican trucks at a \nrate almost three times the rate we are inspecting American trucks, and \nthat is eminently reasonable because we are establishing the safety of \nMexican trucks.\n  There is no argument that we should have the right initially to \ninspect every single Mexican truck until we establish the quality of \nthose trucks. But here is where the line is drawn. We can inspect them \ndifferently. We can inspect them initially, as long as there is any \nreason to believe they are different, more intensely. But we cannot \napply different standards. That is where the Murray amendment runs \nafoul of NAFTA.\n\n  Let me talk about four ways the amendment clearly violates NAFTA. The \nfirst is a fairly simple measure, but it tells you what is going on in \nthis amendment. Today most Canadian trucks are insured by London \ncompanies such as Lloyd's of London. Today some Canadian trucks are \ninsured by Canadian insurance companies, and some by American insurance \ncompanies. Most American trucks are insured by American insurance \ncompanies; some are insured by foreign insurance companies. The plain \ntruth is, many of the companies we know are located all over the world, \nso the insurance domicile distinction really doesn't mean as much as it \nonce did.\n  Under NAFTA, we have the right to require that Mexican trucks have \ninsurance. I believe with regard to the health and safety of our own \npeople we have an obligation to require that they have insurance. But \nwe cannot put a requirement on them that is different from the \nrequirement we put on ourselves or on Canada. The Murray amendment \nviolates that principle by saying Mexican truck operators have to carry \ninsurance from companies that are domiciled in the United States of \nAmerica. American companies do not have to have insurance from \ncompanies domiciled in the United States of America. Canadian companies \ndo not have to have insurance from companies domiciled in the United \nStates of America. Most of them have insurance from companies domiciled \nin Great Britain. But the Murray amendment says Mexican trucks have to \nbe insured by companies domiciled in the United States of America.\n  That is a clear violation of NAFTA. NAFTA says we have to treat \nMexico and Canada the way we treat our own providers. We do not require \nour providers to have American insurance, and indeed some of them do \nnot. They have insurance from companies domiciled elsewhere. We do not \nrequire Canadian trucks to have American insurance, and very few of \nthem do. They have British insurance, and they have Canadian insurance. \nAnd we have no right under NAFTA to require Mexican trucks to meet a \nrequirement that our trucks and Canadian trucks do not have to meet.\n  Second, if a company finds itself unable to operate for some reason--\nmaybe it has lost business, maybe it is subject to some suspension of a \nlicense, maybe there is some restriction imposed on it--it has the \nright to lease its trucks. If you are in the trucking business and you \nhave these rigs that cost huge amounts of money sitting in your\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nparking lot, and for some reason you cannot serve your customer and you \ncannot use this rig, it is a standard business procedure in the United \nStates and in Canada to lease those trucks to somebody who can put them \nto use. That obviously is trying to protect your business from going \nbroke.\n  We would have the right, under NAFTA, to say that Mexican trucks \ncannot be leased under a certain set of circumstances to another \nprovider, as long as we did the same thing to our own trucks and to \nCanadian trucks. We have every right in the world to say to a trucking \ncompany that if they are subject to suspension, restriction, or \nlimitations, they cannot lease their trucks. We have the national \nsovereign right, under NAFTA, to do that. But we do not have the right \nto say American companies can lease their trucks, Canadian companies \ncan lease their trucks, but Mexican companies cannot lease their trucks \nunder exactly the same circumstances. That is a clear violation of \nNAFTA--no ifs, ands or buts about it. You cannot have two different \nstandards: One standard applies to the United States and to Canada and \nanother standard applies to Mexico.\n\n  Under this amendment, if a Mexican company is found to be in \nviolation of this provision, they can be barred from operating in the \nUnited States. In reading the language, this apparently could be a \npermanent ban. We have the right to ban any trucking company in America \nfrom having the right to operate if it should have a violation. And if \nwe did that, since any big trucking company at any one time certainly \nwill have a violation--maybe many violations--we could then we could \napply it to Canada and Mexico and it would be NAFTA-legal. Of course we \nwould all go hungry if we did that. It would be a crazy policy to do \nthat, but we could do it.\n  But what we cannot do under NAFTA is say: OK, we have a regime of \npenalties for American companies and we apply that regime to Canadian \ncompanies, but for Mexican companies, we will apply a different regime \neven though we entered into a treaty--signed by the President and \nratified by Congress--where we said we would treat them exactly as we \ntreat ourselves.\n  We can't now come along and say that if you are an American trucking \ncompany or a Canadian trucking company these are your penalties, but if \nyou are a Mexican trucking company the only penalty is the death \npenalty--i.e., we are going to put you out of business. That is a clear \nviolation of NAFTA. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It is a \nclear violation of NAFTA.\n  In 1999 we wrote a law that dealt with truck safety: the Motor \nCarrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. When we wrote that law, we \nasked the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations for \nits implementation. It turned out that it wasn't easy to do. The \nClinton administration didn't get it done, and the Bush administration \nhasn't gotten it done yet.\n  We could say that until these regulations called for in this law are \nwritten and implemented, we will not allow any truck to operate in \nAmerica. We could say that. That would not violate NAFTA. We could say \nthe Federal Government has not written a regulation and, therefore, we \nare not going to let trucks operate in America. It would not violate \nNAFTA, because we wouldn't let Mexican trucks operate, we wouldn't let \nAmerican trucks operate, and we wouldn't let Canadian trucks operate. \nWe could do that. It would be crazy. I suspect people would be marching \non the Capitol and the Senate would change it very quickly. But we \ncould do it. It would not violate NAFTA.\n  But that is not what we are doing here. What we are saying here is \nthat until the regulations that are called for in this act are written \nand implemented, American and Canadian trucks can operate freely. \nAmerican trucks can roll right up and down the road with the radio \ngoing full blast, everybody happy. Canadian trucks can operate, come \nacross the border, come and go wherever they want to. But until this \nlaw is implemented, Mexican trucks cannot come into the United States.\n\n  By saying that, we would be violating the national treatment standard \nof NAFTA. NAFTA says if you want to do something--no matter how crazy \nit is--as long as you do it to yourself, you can do it to Mexico and \nyou can do it to Canada. But what you cannot do under NAFTA is simply \nsay, arbitrarily: I don't want Mexican trucks operating in the United \nStates. Until February 29 falls on a Thursday, we are not going to let \nMexican trucks operate in the United States. That is about as arbitrary \nas the provisions of this amendment. There is no basis for doing that. \nIt is arbitrary and it violates NAFTA.\n  There are many other things that could be violations. I have outlined \njust four. My amendment very simply does the following: It says that \nthe Murray amendment would stand unless its provisions violate NAFTA. \nIf they did violate NAFTA and remember that ratified treaties under the \nConstitution, to quote the Constitution, are the ``supreme law of the \nland'' then they would not be enforced. And I have outlined four \nexamples of where the Murray amendment violates NAFTA.\n  I will conclude and reserve the remainder of my time, and let others \nspeak. Here is the principle at issue: We can, should, and must require \nthat Mexicans meet the same standard. We don't have to enforce them \nexactly in the same way.\n  For an example of something that would not be a violation to begin \nwith but might become a violation: the checking of the driver's license \nof every trucker coming into the United States from Mexico. We don't do \nthat for people coming in from Canada. We don't do that for every truck \noperating in the United States. We might choose to do that for people \ncoming in from Mexico, until we establish the pattern for Mexican \ndrivers.\n  Interestingly enough, so far our inspections show that the failure \nrate--the number of times that you don't let the driver on the road, \nyou take them out of the truck--for American truckdrivers is 9 percent, \nand for Canadian truckdrivers it is 8.4 percent. Interestingly enough, \nonly 6 percent of Mexican drivers are found to be in violation.\n  The plain truth is that most Mexicans who are driving big rigs are \ncollege graduates. The truth is, at least so far it appears, is that \nMexican drivers are safer in terms of meeting our regimentation and \nrequirements--if that in fact those requirements measure safety, and \nsupposedly that is what they do--than our own drivers. That is data \nbased just on trucks operating in our border States.\n  We would have every right to initially stop every truck and check \nevery driver's license. But once we had established that there is no \nparticular problem, then stopping every Mexican truck when we don't do \nit with our own trucks and we don't do it with Canadian trucks after we \nhave established the pattern that Mexican drivers are just as qualified \nand licensed as ours would be a violation of NAFTA. Basically, the \nrequirements don't have to be the same, but they do have to be \nreasonable in terms of burden relative to the problem.\n  I would think if our colleagues want to pass this bill, if they want \nto move this process forward, and if they don't want to violate NAFTA, \nthey would simply accept this amendment. This would be a major step \nforward in fixing the problems we have with the bill. I wish they would \naccept it. They should accept it. They say this provision does not \nviolate NAFTA, but then if they are right, the adoption of the \namendment would have no impact on them.\n  Why is the amendment important? The amendment is important because we \nmade an agreement with our neighbor to the south. We are in the process \non the floor of the Senate, whether it is our intention or whether it \nis not our intention, of discriminating against Mexico, of saying to \nthem that you are not really an equal partner in NAFTA. We said we were \ngoing to give you these rights, but we have decided we are not going to \ngive you the same rights we give to Americans and we are not going to \ngive you the same rights we give to Canadians. Quite frankly, I think \nit is outrageous.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that we are not saying you can't have \ndifferent ways of enforcing our safety rules. We are simply saying in \nNAFTA you can't have a different set of rules.\n  Senator McCain and I and the President support inspecting every \nMexican truck and checking the license of every\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\nMexican driver as they come across the border. But at some point when \nthe patterns are set and we are through this transition period, we are \ngoing to have to treat them as we treat our own trucking companies when \nthey have proven themselves. Why are we going to have to do that? We \nare going to have to do it because that is what NAFTA says.\n  I know there is a powerful special interest involved here. I know the \nTeamsters Union does not want Mexican trucks to operate in the United \nStates. They are not out saying we don't want trucks operating in the \nUnited States because we are greedy, we are self-interested, and we do \nnot want competition. They are not saying that.\n\n  I don't remember anybody ever coming to my office saying: Protect me \nfrom competition. I don't want to have to compete. I want to sell at a \nhigher price. I want to make more money. I want to have a place in \nColorado. And I want you to cheat the consumer to protect me. Nobody \never came into my office and said that. But they do come into my office \nand say: Protect me from this unfair competition. Protect me from these \nproducts that are not safe. Protect me from this. Protect me from that.\n  What the Teamsters are against is competition. You can argue that we \nought not to have Mexican trucks in America because we ought not to \nallow competition. But the point is, it is too late. We signed an \nagreement. We ratified the agreement. Now it is time to live up to the \nagreement.\n  Under the Murray amendment, we are going back on our agreement. The \nproponents of this amendment can say until they are blue in the face \nthat it does not violate NAFTA. But if it does not, accept this \namendment. But I do not believe they are going to do that, because I \nbelieve their amendment does violate NAFTA. That is why Mexico is \ntalking about retaliation today. That is why the President said that he \nis going to veto this bill.\n  In the end, we are going to have to fix this situation. We are going \nto spend weeks now, it looks to me, fooling around with this issue, \nwhen everybody knows in the end that it is going to have to be worked \nout. But we don't have any recourse now except to do it the way we are \ndoing it.\n  I am not going to let the President be run over on this. I am not \ngoing to let Mexico be discriminated against. I do not think this is \nright. I do not think it is fair. And I think it destroys the \ncredibility of the United States of America. So I am not going away. We \nhave four more cloture votes. I want to say to my colleagues, don't \nfeel that you have to vote with me against cloture. Vote for cloture. \nIt is obvious that the forces who are against putting NAFTA into effect \nwith regard to trucks have the votes. So I am not asking anybody to \nvote with me. But I am just saying that we are going to end up having \nto vote on cloture four times to get this bill to conference.\n\n  It can be fixed very easily. Simply take out the parts of the Murray \namendment that violate NAFTA. That is what we are going to have to do. \nWe can do it now. We obviously are not going to, but we could. We can \ndo it next week. We can do it in September. But we are going to do it \neventually.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1055\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly about amendment No. 1055, which has been filed and is at the \ndesk. This is an amendment which I understand will be included in the \nmanagers' package. I thought it might be useful to make a comment or \ntwo about it.\n  This amendment is necessary in order to clarify congressional intent \non the highway congestion relief program created under the 1998 TEA-21 \nhighway authorization bill. Under the ITS, Traffic.com, a Wayne, PA, \ncompany employing some 150 workers, competed for and won an initial $8 \nmillion contract to create a traffic management system to monitor \ncongestion in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The bidders competing for \nthis initial contract expected and were led to believe that the winner \non the first phase of the contract would automatically receive the \nfollow-on contract.\n  The intent of the TEA-21 ITS provision was to eventually expand this \nprogram beyond Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and award the next phase of \nthe contract to the same team that won the first phase.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Transportation Appropriations Act contained a \n$50 million earmark to further fund an intelligent transportation \nsystem, ITS, section 378, Public Law 106-346. This intelligence \ntransportation system project was originally conceived under TEA-21 to \nserve as a national, interoperable program that would allow local \nresidents and trucking companies to receive up-to-date information on \ntraffic patterns and congestion.\n  TEA-21 section 5117 (b)(3)(B)(v) set forth that the ITS program \nshould utilize an advanced information system designed and monitored by \nan entity with experience with the Department of Transportation in the \ndesign and monitoring of high-reliability, mission-critical voice and \ndata systems.\n  It was thought at the time by the draftsmen that this provision would \ncover the $50 million, but there has been a determination by general \ncounsel for the Department of Transportation that this language is \ninsufficient. We had thought we might correct it with a colloquy, but \nwe have been advised that there needs to be a so-called legislative \nfix.\n  In that light, I have submitted the amendment, which is No. 1055, \nwhich has been reviewed by the Department of Transportation. And we \nhave been assured, I have been assured that the language in the \namendment will be satisfactory.\n  This is an important matter to my constituents. It is a Wayne, PA, \ncompany employing some 150 workers.\n  I have conferred with Senator Warner, who was a party to the initial \ntransaction where, as is the case with many highway projects, the \narrangements were worked out that the firm winning the first contract \nof $8 million, which was, as I say, Traffic.com, would get the second \ncontract. But the legislative draftsmen were not sufficiently precise, \nas I have said. Senator Warner confirmed to me yesterday that was the \nintent at that time, and he is prepared to confirm that.\n  The distinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, chairman and \nmanager of this report, had wanted confirmation from the authorizing \ncommittee that this was acceptable, as is the practice, if a matter \nlike this is included in an appropriations bill. The appropriate \nprocess is to have the authorizers agree that it may be inserted, not \nto have any jurisdiction taken away.\n  I had consulted with the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, \nwho is the subcommittee chairman, who is on the floor now and hears \nwhat I am saying, and also with the distinguished chairman, Senator \nJeffords. They have concurred in this.\n\n  As I say, it is my expectation, having just conferred with the \nchairman, Senator Murray, that it be included in the managers' package. \nI thought it would be useful for the record to have this brief \nexplanation as to precisely what happened and what the intent of the \namendment will be as included in the managers' package.\n  As they say at wedding ceremonies, Senator Murray and Senator Reid, \nif you have anything to say, speak now or forever hold your peace.\n  I thank the Chair. They used to call that an adoptive admission \nbefore they were declared unconstitutional, when I was a prosecuting \nattorney.\n  I thank Senator Murray, Senator Reid, and my other colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise, obviously, in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Texas. The reason the Senator's amendment\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nshould be really approved without a single dissenting vote is that the \namendment says exactly what the proponents of this so-called Murray \nlanguage in the appropriations bill are alleging. They are alleging \nthat the language to which we and the administration object is not in \nviolation of NAFTA.\n  I don't know the number of times--I would be glad to have a scholar \nresearch the number of times the Senator from Washington has said this \nis not a violation of NAFTA; this is not a violation of NAFTA; this is \nnot in violation of NAFTA. So if the language is not in violation of \nNAFTA, then she should have no problem in approving this amendment, \nwhich says:\n\n       Provided that notwithstanding any other provision in the \n     Act, nothing in this Act shall be applied in a manner that \n     the President finds to be in violation of the North American \n     free trade agreement.\n\n  Mr. President, during the previous two administrations, I supported a \nlot of legislation that gave the President of the United States a great \ndeal of leeway in determining foreign policy issues. I did that because \nof my fundamental belief that the President of the United States should \nbe the individual who conducts foreign policy, obviously, with the \nadvice and consent of the Congress of the United States. So this \namendment seems to me to be perfectly in keeping with the rhetoric of \nthe proponents of the present legislation as it stands.\n\n  I don't quite understand the objections to it, when the allegations \nare that the language in the appropriations bill is perfectly in \ncompliance with NAFTA and doesn't violate it.\n  I want to mention again, particularly in light of the last vote that \nwas taken--and we all know we only got 30 votes on the cloture motion \nand we needed 41--first, I am still confident that, as to the vote \nyesterday and other votes that will be taken, we have sufficient votes \nto sustain a Presidential veto. As we all know, the President has said \nhe would regretfully have to exercise that option.\n  I also want to point out for the benefit of my colleagues, we have \njust affirmed a very dangerous practice, in my view. That practice--\nwhich in the years I have been here has gradually increased year after \nyear after year--is a proclivity to legislate on appropriations bills. \nWe now have major policy changes, major legislative initiatives, \nincluded on appropriations legislation. So when the cloture was voted a \nshort time ago, it not only affirmed, unfortunately, the right--or new \nright of appropriators to legislate on appropriations bills, but it \nalso can set a very dangerous precedent for the future.\n  There may be other amendments on other appropriations bills, which \nindividual Senators view is in violation--in this case, of course, in \nviolation of a solemn treaty agreement, but it may be in violation and \naffect issues that are important to them.\n  Senators who are not members of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenators who are simply members of authorizing committees, have \nsuffered under the impression that any major policy changes or \nlegislation would originate in their committees of which they are \nmembers, the authorizing committees. Instead, we now see an \nabrogation--a growing abrogation--and an affirmation of that abrogation \nof the responsibilities of those who are members on the authorizing \ncommittees--in my view, a grossly unwarranted assumption of authority \non the part of the Appropriations Committee.\n  We all know what the purpose of an Appropriations Committee is, and \nthat is to appropriate funds for previously authorized programs. I will \nbe glad to read to my colleagues what the charter of the Appropriations \nCommittee is. I must say, when I first came here--and I think the \nSenator from Texas who came here a couple years before me would agree--\nit was a very unusual circumstance when you would see an appropriations \nbill that had a legislative authorizing impact. We would find the pork \nbarrel projects, although they were dramatically less; we would find \nthe earmark. But now we have a custom, that is increasing year by year, \nwhere the Appropriations Committee, in direct violation of their \ncharter, are now setting parameters, which in this case affect a solemn \ntreaty between three nations.\n  Not only does this particular language, which is called, ``not in \nviolation of NAFTA,'' clearly authorize on an appropriations bill, but \nit even goes so far as to affect a solemn trade agreement.\n  I might add that is not just my view. That happens to be the view of \nthe President of the United States and, almost as important, the view \nof the President of Mexico. Already the Mexican Government, in reaction \nto this pending legislation, has threatened sanctions which could reach \na billion or more dollars against U.S. goods and services. Relations \nbetween the United States and Mexico, in my view--and coming from a \nborder State I think I have some expertise on this subject--have never \nbeen better.\n  We have a new party in power in Mexico, a new leader, and for the \nfirst time we are seeing border cooperation the likes of which we have \nnever seen before, including the apprehension and extradition of drug \ndealers, something we could not only not achieve before, I remember \nback in the 1980s when a U.S. drug agent was kidnapped, tortured, and \nmurdered by individuals that at least allegedly could have had \nconnections with the Mexican Government. We have come a long way in our \nrelations.\n  I note the President's first state dinner will be in September in \nhonor of President Fox of Mexico. The relationship between our \nPresident and the President of Mexico is close, it is cooperative, and \nit will act to the great benefit of all Americans, particularly those \nof us who represent border States because we have so many outstanding \nborder issues: immigration, drugs, pollution, transportation, among \nothers.\n  What do we do early in President Fox's administration? According to \nthem, we violate a solemn treaty that was consummated years ago by \nprevious administrations.\n  The provisions of Senator Gramm and I require it, every vehicle \nbeyond the commercial zones to be authorized and to display on their \nvehicle a decal of inspection, and the list goes on and on. State \ninspectors that detect violations will enforce such laws and \nregulations, and it goes on and on.\n  According to our legislation, we are not giving blanket approval to \nMexican carriers to come across the border. What we are doing is \nimposing some reasonable restrictions which would then stay in \ncompliance with the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Let me read from a letter we received from the NAFTA Coalition For \nSafe trucks:\n\n       During its consideration of the bill to provide \n     appropriations for the Department of Transportation for \n     fiscal year 2002, we urge the United States Senate to adopt \n     the McCain-Gramm amendment regarding the treatment of cross \n     border trucking operations under the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n       We represent the manufacturers, shippers and the \n     transporters of the goods crossing the border, and want to \n     ensure all necessary steps are taken to ensure the safe, \n     reliable and efficient transportation of those goods between \n     the United States and our trading partner to the South.\n       Both the House-passed language and the language included by \n     the Senate Committee on Appropriations violate NAFTA and will \n     result in a ``closed'' border for the foreseeable future. \n     While we commend the Senate Committee for seeking a solution \n     to the outright ban contained in the House Bill, several of \n     the requirements simply cannot be met and are unnecessary to \n     ensure the safe operations of Mexican domiciled trucks when \n     operating in the United States.\n       Should the Congress vote to require the United States \n     Government to continue to violate our obligations under \n     NAFTA, Mexico will be free to impose extensive sanctions on \n     U.S.-produced products. This will certainly lead to a loss of \n     jobs for U.S. workers, particularly in manufacturing, which \n     has already seen 785,000 lost jobs since July of 2000.\n       We urge support of the McCain-Gramm Amendment, which will \n     allow the United States to honor its commitments while \n     establishing a safe and reliable flow of goods between the \n     United States and our neighbor, trading partner and friend to \n     the South.\n\n  It is signed by the American Trucking Association, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Grocery Manufacturers of America, U.S.-\nMexico Chamber of Commerce, Agricultural Transporters Conference, \nBorder Trade Alliance, United States Chamber of Commerce, National \nForeign Trade Council, the Fertilizer Institute, and TASA Trucking, the \nvery people who will be sharing the highways and bridges of America on \nboth sides of the border with Mexican transportation carriers.\n  What we have done here--and I think it is important to put it in a \ncertain\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\nperspective because there is a lot of heat of the moment; there are \nconversations about what the Teamsters will or will not do, how \nimportant it is for Republicans to gain the support of the Teamsters, \nand underlying it all is sort of a concern about really what would \nhappen if these Mexican carriers came into the United States.\n  As the Senator from Texas pointed out, they are 25 miles inside of \nour border States. We are proud of the relationship we have with our \nMexican neighbors to the South. We are proud of their friendship. We \nare proud of the progress that they have made, both politically and \neconomically. We are proud to call them our neighbors.\n  What we have done, intentionally or unintentionally, is adopt \nlanguage in an appropriations bill which was unknown to those of us on \nthe Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, unknown to the \nauthorizing committee on which I am the ranking member. Language was \nadopted which, in the view of the President of the United States, in \nview of the President of Mexico, and I am sure the Canadian Government, \nand I am sure the NAFTA panels that judge these things, is a violation \nof a solemn trade agreement.\n  I do not want to waste time reviewing the enormous economic benefit \nthat has accrued to all three countries as a result of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. They are phenomenal. When NAFTA was \nadopted in 1996, there was $300 million worth of trade a day between \nthe United States and Canada. Today there is a billion dollars a day of \ntrade between the United States and Canada.\n  The numbers are comparable in the south. We have seen the \nmaquiladoras. We have seen the growth of the economy in the northern \npart of Mexico far exceed the rest of Mexico. Why is that? It is \nbecause of the enormous increase in goods and traffic and services \nbetween the United States and Mexico.\n  We have seen now one of the most successful treaties, from an \neconomic standpoint and I argue cultural and other aspects, now being \nundermined or violated by an act of the appropriations subcommittee of \nthe Senate, without a hearing.\n  We did have a hearing on Mexican trucks in the Commerce Committee. We \nnever acted. There was never a bill proposed. There was never any \nlegislation proposed for consideration and markup by the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. No, it was stuck into an \nappropriations subcommittee bill.\n\n  Here is where we are: The repercussions of this action are \nsignificant and severe, not only to the people of my State but the \npeople of this country.\n  We do not grow a lot of corn in Arizona; I wish we grew more, but \nclearly corn is one of the first areas where the Economic Minister of \nMexico has said they may have to impose sanctions because they are \nentitled to impose sanctions as of this very day.\n  We have also just heard that telecommunications equipment might be \nthe next target of sanctions enacted by the Mexican Government. Why \nwould they do that? With all due respect, because they have significant \nmanufacturing capabilities within Mexico of telecommunications \nequipment and it probably would not be too bad for Mexico in the \nshortrun if they were not subject to foreign competition, although we \nall know the unpleasant and unwanted consequences of the lack of \ncompetition in all products. That is the situation we are in. It is \nvery unfortunate.\n  The Senator from Texas has an amendment which basically says none of \nthe provisions in the appropriations bill would be applied in a manner \nthat the President of the United States finds to be in violation of \nNAFTA. Literally, every bill we pass out of this body that has to do \nwith foreign policy has a national security provision stating if it is \nin the interests of national security, the President can act if he \ndeems so. Basically, that is sort of what this amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas is all about.\n  I also want to make one other comment about this issue and what we \nhave done. The Senator from Texas and I were allowed to propose one \namendment, which was voted on, and we had many other amendments. \nObviously, that effort is going to be significantly curtailed because \nof a cloture vote. I view that as unfortunate, too, because if in the \nfuture Members of the Senate are seeking a number of amendments to be \nconsidered, and cloture is imposed without them being able to have all \ntheir amendments considered, then I think we are obviously setting \nanother very bad precedent for the conduct of the way we do business in \nthe Senate.\n  For all of those reasons, I not only intend to slow this legislation, \nbut I think we will have to try to see that this issue, no matter how \nit is resolved, resurfaces on several different vehicles in the future. \nI am not sure that there are many other issues before the Senate that \nare this important. We may have to, even after we have exhausted--if we \ndo--all of our parliamentary options, exercise others as well.\n  I say that not only because of the impact on this issue but the \nimpact on the way we do business in the Senate. I was very proud during \nconsideration of the campaign finance reform bill that everybody had an \namendment. Anybody who had an amendment, we considered it; we voted on \nit; and we worked on it for 2 weeks. On the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwe worked on it; we had amendments; everybody was heard from; and \neverybody got their say.\n\n  That is not the case with this legislation. It is not the case with \nthis appropriations bill. I regret that. I have been here not as long \nas many but long enough to know when a very dangerous trend, a very \ndangerous precedent has been set, I recognize that. I will continue to \ndo what I can to see that every Senator has the right to exercise his \nand her rights as Members of this body to see that their issues, their \nconcerns, and particularly those that affect international agreements, \nare fully examined and voted upon and discussed and debated.\n  I intend, obviously, to talk more on the specifics of what we are \ndoing, but I hope my colleagues have no illusions as to what is being \nattempted on an appropriations bill where there is absolutely no place \nfor this legislation. Those who are only members of authorizing \ncommittees, take note, my friends, because you may be next.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Obviously, the Senator shares with me the fact that we \nrepresent States that border Mexico, and in that process we both have \nhad an opportunity to work with President Fox. Would the Senator agree \nwith me that of all the people who have ever been heads of state in \nMexico, that he is, perhaps, the most pro-American in terms of his \noutlook and willingness to work with us of anyone we have ever dealt \nwith?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response, I say to my friend, I don't think we have \never seen a friend of this nature in the history of the country of \nMexico. We all know that there was one-party rule since the 1920s. We \nall know that when one party rules any country for an inordinate length \nof time, there is corruption. This is a breath of fresh air.\n  The Senator mentioned we come from border States. Our States are \ngoing to be affected first by Mexican carriers coming across our \nborder. In the State of Washington and on the northern tier, there is \nfree access of carriers from Canada. So I kind of wonder about the \ncontrast there. The State of Washington has free movement of trucks \nback and forth across their border. Yet Representatives of the State of \nWashington want to restrict flow across our borders with our southern \nneighbor. I find that interesting.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Could I ask another question? You obviously know President \nFox, and know Mexican politics. What kind of position do you think it \nputs President Fox in when he has staked his whole political future on \na good relationship with the United States, and has committed himself \nto enforcing NAFTA in his own country, when the Senate is in the \nprocess of adopting a provision on an appropriations bill that clearly \nviolates the NAFTA agreement? What kind of position do you think it \nputs him in?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The answer, obviously, I say to the Senator from Texas, \nis it must be somewhat embarrassing for him. I think that was very much \nappreciated by President Bush. President Bush has expressed on several \noccasions his concern with what is happening and has taken a very \npersonal interest in these proceedings.\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\n  That is another point I emphasize. The relationship between President \nFox and President Bush is as close and cooperative and good as any in \nthe history of this country. I appreciated President Reagan's \nrelationship with his southern neighbor as Governor of California. I \nbelieve the relationship of President Bush and President Fox opens up a \nvista for relations with Mexico the likes of which we have never seen, \nwhich there has already been manifestations of, by the extradition to \nthe United States of drug dealers from Mexico. That would never have \nhappened under a previous regime.\n  I think President Fox, obviously, could not be very pleased today and \nmay have to answer to some of his critics, of which there are many \nsince he just unseated a party that had been in power for 60 years.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I am sure there are people who \nwonder why we take this issue so seriously. It seems to me our \ncolleagues should be concerned about our relationship with this good \nman who is president of Mexico and our friend, and with the kind of \nposition it puts him in, and with the message it sends that somehow we \ntreat our neighbors to the north differently than we treat our \nneighbors to the south. It seems to me that socialists and anti-\nAmerican politicians in Mexico from the very beginning of our \nrelationship with Mexico have preyed on this point: that we don't \nrespect Mexico, that we don't respect their people, that we treat them \ndifferently, that they are our poor neighbors. I conclude with the \nfollowing question. Don't you believe that this amendment, in all of \nits terrible manifestations, plays into exactly the kind of demagoguery \nthat has traumatized our relationship with Mexico for all these years?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I agree with the Senator from Texas. But \nalso let me point out that because of this action that is taking place \nright now, the Mexican Government and the President are having to \nrespond to domestic discontent with the threat of sanctions, and they \nare judged to be able to enact sanctions because the panel determined \nwe are in violation of NAFTA as we speak. Until this legislation was \npending, there was no word out of Mexico that they would impose these \nsanctions. But in the last day, the last 24 hours, the Mexican \nGovernment has felt compelled to say they will enact sanctions. Why? \nBecause the legislation before us makes permanent the blocking of the \nborder to Mexican carriers, which was allowed according--not only \nallowed, but a part, an integral part of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  I mention again to my friend from Texas a letter from the Secretary \nof the Economy, Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista:\n\n       We have been following the legislative process regarding \n     cross border trucking on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This \n     is an issue of extreme importance to Mexico on both legal and \n     economic grounds. From a legal standpoint, Mexico expects \n     non-discriminatory treatment from the U.S. as stipulated \n     under the NAFTA. The integrity of the Agreement is at stake \n     as is the commitment of the U.S. to live up to its \n     international obligations under the NAFTA. I would like to \n     reiterate that Mexico has never sought reduced safety and \n     security standards. Each and every truck company from Mexico \n     ought to be given the opportunity to show it complies fully \n     with U.S. standards at the state and federal levels.\n       The economic arguments are clear-cut: Because of NAFTA, \n     Mexico has become the second largest U.S. trading partner \n     with $263 billion of goods now being exchanged yearly. About \n     75% of these goods move by truck. In a few years, Mexico may \n     surpass Canada as the U.S. largest trading partner and \n     market. Compliance with the panel ruling means that products \n     will flow far more smoothly and far less expensively between \n     our nations. Doing so will enable us to take advantage of the \n     only permanent comparative advantage we have: that is our \n     geographic proximity. The winners will be consumers, \n     businesses and workers in the three countries.\n       We are very concerned after regarding the Murray amendment \n     and the Administration's position regarding it that the \n     legislative outcome may still constitute a violation of the \n     Agreement. In this light, we hope the legislative language \n     will allow the prompt and non-discriminatory opening of the \n     border for international trucking.\n       Finally I would like to underline our position, that to the \n     Mexican government the integrity of the NAFTA is of the \n     outmost importance.\n\n  That is from the Secretary of the Economy of the country of Mexico.\n  I see my respected friend, the Senator from North Dakota, on the \nfloor. I know his views on NAFTA. I do not know if many of the Mexican \ntrucks will be getting up to North Dakota. But I do know that the \nMexican Government right now is deeply concerned about this \nlegislation, and if it passes, I can see no other action the Mexican \nGovernment would take but to enact sanctions. As the Senator pointed \nout, this is a critical stage of our relations with that country.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have great respect for my friend from \nArizona and, for that matter, for my friend from Texas. I might say my \ncolleague from Arizona and I agree on a lot of things and we work \ntogether on a lot of things. I do not necessarily agree with a lot of \nthings with my colleague from Texas. We tend more often to come down on \nopposite sides of the spectrum. But I did want to respond a bit to a \ncouple of questions that were raised.\n  I just came from the Senate Appropriations Committee. I had to be \nthere because we were marking up an appropriations bill. I was on the \nfloor earlier intending to ask the Senator from Texas a question, but I \nwas not able to be here when he finished his comments. One of the \nthings he said I found very interesting.\n  Do you know what he said? He said if we do not allow Mexican long-\nhaul trucks into this country, Mexico is going to take action against \nthe United States. Do you know what they are going to do? He was \nquoting a Mexican official. He said they are going to impose sanctions \nor tariffs on high-fructose corn syrup from the United States to \nMexico.\n  Do you know what? They have already done that. They are already in \nviolation of NAFTA. An arbitration panel has found Mexico is in \nviolation on high-fructose corn syrup. In fact, they have a high grade \nand low grade. Guess what. Mexico imposes the equivalent of 43 percent \ntariff on the low-grade corn syrup and the equivalent of a tariff of 76 \npercent on the high-grade corn syrup. So my friend from Texas says \nMexico is now threatening to do something with respect to high-\nfructose corn syrup when in fact they are already violating \ninternational trade agreements in terms of the tariffs and the \nobstructions they put in the way of high-fructose corn syrup going from \nthe United States to Mexico.\n\n  God forbid we be upset about that, that Mexico is going to do \nsomething to us that they are already doing in violation of the trade \nagreement.\n  I heard a long discussion by my colleague from Texas saying we may \nnot and we must not violate NAFTA. I said yesterday and I will say \nagain, there is nothing in any trade agreement, including NAFTA, \nnothing that will ever require us to compromise safety on America's \nroads. There is nothing that makes that requirement of the United \nStates.\n  I would also say this. If one would allege that what we are about to \ndo would be to violate NAFTA on behalf of American road safety and \ncomplain about that, I wonder then whether someone would complain about \nMexico, for example, violating trade agreements with respect to the \nobstructions and the tariffs applied to high-fructose corn syrup that \nwe now send to Mexico, or that we now try to send to Mexico.\n  This cuts both ways. But it only cuts one way when you talk about \nthings that really matter; that is, highway safety in this country. The \nUnited States and Mexico have had a half dozen years to understand the \nconsequences of allowing long-haul Mexican trucks into this country. \nThey have had a half dozen years to prepare for this. What have they \ndone? Nothing. Now we are told in 5 months the United States border \nmust be open to Mexican trucks to come into this country for long \nhauls.\n  I will say again what I said yesterday. I am sorry if it is \nrepetitious to some, but it is important to say it. The anecdotal \nevidence obtained by a reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle, I \nthink quite masterfully presented to us in that feature story, is \ncompelling. The San Francisco Chronicle sent a reporter to Mexico to \nride\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nwith a long-haul trucker who began that ride in Mexico City and went \n1,800 miles to Tijuana. That trucker was driving an 18-wheel truck that \nwould not have passed inspection in this country, with a crack in its \nwindshield among other things. That truck driver drove 3 days, 1,800 \nmiles, and slept a total of 7 hours; had no logbook, no limits on his \nhours of service, and was never stopped for an inspection along the \nway. Now we are told: By the way, it is our requirement to allow that \nkind of truck to come into this country.\n  It is not our requirement. It is not. My colleagues will say: But \nwhat we are really saying is we want to inspect every truck. There is \nnot a ghost of a chance of that happening, and we all know it.\n  Let me put up a chart that describes the differences in standards \nbetween the United States and Mexico. Hours of service: 10 hours of \nconsecutive driving, and no more, in this country--10 hours, and no \nmore. I am telling you, this reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle \nrode 3 days, 1,800 miles, with that truck driver, and the truck driver \nslept 7 hours in 3 days because there are no limitations on hours of \nservice in Mexico. There are no limitations on the driver. These are \ndrivers who make, on average, $7 a day, sleep 7 hours in 3 days. Is \nthat what you want in your rearview mirror: A truck weighing 80,000 \npounds with 18 wheels coming down the highway, perhaps with no brakes, \nwith a driver that has been awake for 21 straight hours? Is that what \nwe want in this country? I do not think so. And there is no trade \nagreement ever written--none--that requires this country to compromise \nsafety on its roads.\n  I know some say: well, no one is suggesting a trade agreement would \ndo that. They say they are suggesting a robust area of inspections. Not \ntrue. There is no requirement being proposed that investigators go into \nMexico to investigate compliance of the Mexican trucking industry to \nmake sure that when someone presents themselves at the border with a \nlogbook, they have filled it out one-half hour before they arrived at \nthe border. They simply fill out their logbook. They have been driving \n21 straight hours, but they present a logbook saying they have only \nbeen on the road for 3 hours.\n  There is nothing remotely resembling a broad-scale compliance program \nor a broad inspection program at the border that would provide the \nmargin of safety this country needs.\n  We have, I believe, 27 border entry points. Only two of them are \nstaffed during all commercial operating hours. Most of them don't have \ntelephone lines to access a driver's license database. Most of them \ndon't have parking places where you can park a truck that is pulled out \nof service.\n  We asked the inspector general who testified last week: Why do you \nwant a parking space if a truck shows up from Mexico that is not safe \ntrying to come into this country? Why not just turn it around and send \nit back? He said: Let me give you an example. A truck shows up at the \nborder and has no brakes. It happens. Are we going to send an 18-wheel \ntruck back with no brakes? No. We have to park it.\n  The fact is that we only inspect a small percentage of trucks \ncrossing the border. It is not a large percentage as has been alleged. \nWe actually inspect a very small percentage of trucks coming into this \ncountry.\n  The proposal for additional investigators and inspectors is far short \nof what is needed to have a broad regimen of inspections. It is just \nfar short of what is needed. I just did the math. I asked the Secretary \nof Transportation and the inspector general: Am I not right that you \nare short, and you don't have the people? The inspector general said: \nYou are right, we are short of inspectors, because these numbers don't \nadd up.\n  To those who say let's open the borders and somehow we will inspect \nall of these trucks, I say to them even if you could do that, where are \nthe inspectors? They are not being proposed. They have some, but not \nnearly enough.\n  What about the compliance reviews of sending someone into Mexico to \nmake sure the industry is going to require the kind of compliance that \nis necessary? I mentioned the requirement of logbooks. Mexico requires \nlogbooks. They do. But nobody has them. It is just like Mexican laws \nwith respect to the environment. They have very stringent laws with \nrespect to pollution and the environment. They are not enforced. You \ncan have wonderful laws, but if they are not enforced, they are \nirrelevant.\n  There is in Mexico a requirement for a standardized logbook. It is \nnot enforced. Virtually no trucker in Mexico uses a logbook.\n  Alcohol and drug testing in this country, yes; Mexico, no.\n  Driver's physical considerations: In this country, a separate medical \ncertificate, and an examiner's certificate is renewed every 2 years. In \nMexico, a physical examination is required as part of licensing, But no \nseparate medical card is required.\n  We have a weight limit of 80,000 pounds in this country. It is \n135,000 pounds in Mexico.\n  Hazardous materials: I don't even want to describe the difference \nhere. You can only imagine the difference.\n\n  Strict standards, training, and inspection regime in this country; \nthere, a lax program, few identified chemicals and substances, and \nfewer licensure requirements.\n  Vehicle safety inspections: Here, yes, of course.\n  There they are not yet finalized.\n  Insurance: Incidentally, the inspector general pointed out that when \nthey come across the border, they buy insurance for 1 day.\n  Some have questioned why I should care about this issue. One of my \ncolleagues said: Senator Dorgan is from North Dakota, Mexican trucks \nprobably won't even get to North Dakota.\n  But in fact they have already been found to be improperly operating \nin North Dakota. They have been stopped for a range of infractions and \ndifficulties.\n  There is supposed to be a 20-mile limit for long-haul Mexican trucks \nin this country.\n  If someone says it is not going to affect North Dakota, they are \nwrong. It already has. They have already been apprehended on our roads.\n  Let me say, with this one question of inspections and all of the \nsoothing words about, we will just inspect all those trucks, and there \nis not going to be any problem with the big 18-wheeler coming down the \nhighway--let me describe where we are with inspections.\n  Out-of-service rates at El Paso, TX, 50 percent but only 24 percent \nat Otay Mesa, CA where they have a full inspection process.\n  I could put up 25 border crossings and you would find exactly the \nsame thing.\n  It is preposterous to allege that in 5 months we are going to have a \nregime of inspections and compliance audits that will provide the \nmargin of safety that we expect for our country's highways. It is not \ngoing to happen. There is not a ghost of a chance of it happening.\n  Let me again say that it is true, I voted against NAFTA.\n  Before this trade agreement which our trade negotiators negotiated \nwith Mexico and Canada, we had a very small trade surplus with Mexico. \nIt quickly turned into a very large deficit. Is it a trade agreement \nthat works in our interest? I don't think so. We had a reasonably \nmodest trade deficit with Canada. It quickly doubled. Is that a trade \nagreement that works in our interests? I don't think so.\n  Yes, I voted against the trade agreement. I have from time to time \nsuggested that perhaps, just as we do in the Olympics, we require them \nto wear a jersey so they can look down and see a giant ``U.S.A.'' \nprinted on this jersey to see whom they are working for, so they \nremember from time to time whom they represent. I am so tired of our \ntrade negotiators negotiating agreements that they lose in the first \nweek.\n  Will Rogers once said that the United States of America has never \nlost a war and never won a conference. Surely he must have been talking \nabout our trade negotiators. It takes them just a moment to begin \nnegotiating with some country and give away the store. That is the case \nwith NAFTA.\n  But I say this: There is nothing in that trade agreement--nothing in \nNAFTA--that requires our country to sacrifice safety on America's \nhighways--nothing. We have had 6 years, I say to my colleague from \nTexas, for both countries to prepare for Mexican\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nlong-haul trucks to come into America, and neither country has done \nanything. Now we are told by the President that on January 1 we are \ngoing to take the lid off this 20-mile limit and Mexican long-haul \ntrucks are coming in.\n  My position is this: There is not a ghost of a chance of our having \nthe compliance and inspection capability to assure the American people \nthat we have safety on our highways. I don't want my family, or yours, \nand I don't want any American family driving down the road looking in a \nrearview mirror and seeing an 18-wheeler coming with 80,000 pounds \nperhaps without brakes, with the driver having driven the rig for 21 \nstraight hours, in a truck that has not been inspected. I don't want \nthat for the American people, and no trade agreement requires that it \nhappen.\n  To those of us who have come to the floor in the last several days on \nthis issue, I say this isn't about trying to be discriminatory against \nanyone. If it were Norway, I would be saying the same thing. Canada has \na reasonably similar system with trucking. We suspended trucking \nprivileges for Canada for a number of years until they came into \ncompliance. We restored them.\n  With airlines, what we do is very simple. We understand the safety \nissue with airlines. With airlines, we send compliance inspectors to \nairlines all around the world to insist and demand, if airlines want to \ncome into our country, they must meet rigid compliance standards. We \naudit them and require them to comply. There are 13 countries in which \ntheir airlines are not allowed into the United States of America. Why? \nBecause we have not deemed it safe to allow those airlines to come in.\n  That is the issue here with these long-haul trucks. It is very \nsimple. This is not an issue about the Murray-Shelby language versus \nthe Gramm-McCain amendment. There are more than two sides; there are \nthree.\n  I happen to believe we ought to have the House language simply \nprohibiting funding for the issuing of licenses or permits to allow \nlong-haul trucks to come in during the next fiscal year. I say no. If \nat the end of the next fiscal year it can be described to us that we \nhave a full regime of compliance, investigators, and inspectors at the \nborder, and if we set up all of the burdens to show us that this will \nwork, then I will be the first to admit it and say I am with you. But \nthat is not the case now. It will not be the case in January. In my \njudgment, it will not be the case in a year and a half.\n  Until that time, on behalf of the American people, we ought to \ninsist--we ought to demand--on behalf of highway safety in this country \nthat we take this issue seriously.\n  In my judgment, what we ought to do, at some point before this debate \nis over, is take the House language, the Sabo amendment that the House \npassed 2-1, put it on this bill, put it in conference, and keep it \nthere; and say to the President: If you want to veto it, that is your \nchoice. But if you want to do it, you are wrong. This Congress is going \nto do the right thing. If you want to do the wrong thing, that is up to \nyou. But our job is to do the right thing right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have a statement in support of Senator \nDorgan's comments, but Senator Gramm had something he wished to do for \na minute or two. If I could yield to him and reclaim my time, I would \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me yield myself 3 minutes off my time. \nIf you would let me know when that time is up, I will stop. And I thank \nSenator Byrd, who came over to speak, for letting me do this.\n  Mr. President, when I was a boy and my brothers and I got into \narguments, my mama would always say: Argue about whether something \nmakes sense, but don't argue about facts. So I am not going to get into \nan argument with our dear colleague from North Dakota. But I want to \nreiterate what the facts are.\n  When we entered into NAFTA, we had every right in our obligations \nunder NAFTA to enforce safety standards in the United States of \nAmerica. Any safety standard that we impose on our own truckers and \nCanadian truckers, we can impose on Mexican truckers. We could inspect \nevery single truck coming into the United States from Mexico so long as \nwe can show that inspection was needed to assure Mexican compliance \nwith American law. But what we cannot do, what NAFTA clearly says is a \nviolation, is setting one standard for American trucks and Canadian \ntrucks, and then another standard for Mexican trucks.\n  It is interesting that our colleague decided to talk about Mexican \ntruckers, because even though Mexican trucks are operating only in the \nborder States now, our experience with inspecting the Mexican drivers \nhas been very encouraging. In fact, of all the drivers inspected in \nAmerica last year--where the truck was inspected and the driver was \ntested in terms of their log, their license, and their training--\nCanadian truckdrivers failed that test 8.4 percent of the time. \nAmerican truckdrivers failed that test 9 percent of the time. Mexican \ntruckdrivers failed that test 6 percent of the time.\n  Why is that so important? Because they are operating only in border \nareas. The trucks coming across are not even big 18-wheelers; they are \nsmall trucks basically carrying produce. The point I want to make is \nthat we cannot have two different sets of rules under NAFTA. Many of \nthe Mexican drivers that are going to be driving 18-wheelers are \ncollege graduates. Our experience, thus far, indicates that we are \ngoing to have many problems, but drivers are not going to be one of \nthem. My point is that under NAFTA we can set whatever standards we \nwant on Mexican trucks, but they have to be the same standards that we \nset on our own trucks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is what is being violated by the amendment before us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I do still have the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado, by previous order, \nis entitled to be recognized at this time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would like to give a statement, but if the Senator \nhas a response for a minute or two, I do not mind yielding to him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would be kind enough to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to observe that the Senator from \nTexas said he doesn't think our States are involved because we have a \n20-mile limit. My point is, Mexican truckdrivers have been stopped in \nNorth Dakota already exceeding the 20-mile limit, so of course we are \ninvolved. Twenty-four States have found that similar condition.\n\n  No. 2, the Senator from Texas said he didn't want to talk about the \nfacts. The facts are that when Mexico alleged they are going to take \naction against our high-fructose corn syrup, does the Senator from \nTexas agree a panel has already ruled against Mexico, and they are now \nunfairly imposing tariffs on high-fructose corn syrup in violation of \nNAFTA? Does the Senator agree with that assertion?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would respond that if you are trying to \nget somebody to live up to their agreement, are you in a stronger \nposition if you live up to your end of it, or is your position weakened \nwhen you stop living up to your end of it?\n  If you want to enforce the agreement, then we need to live up to it. \nWe need to be like Caesar's wife; we need to be above suspicion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is, alleging somehow Mexico will hurt this \ncountry if we don't allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this country, \nwith respect to high-fructose corn syrup, and actions they will take--\nthe facts are stubborn. The Mexicans are already doing that unfairly.\n  I am a little tired of saying, ``let's blame America for something we \nmight do.'' How about blaming Mexico for something they are doing with \nrespect to high-fructose corn syrup that is in violation of NAFTA.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, there are no Hispanic members of the \nSenate or I am sure they would say what I am about to with an equal \namount of outrage. But since most Hispanics who trace their ancestry to \nMexico are also part Native of the Americas, I think I can speak for \nthem.\n  I am very disturbed that any Member of this body, regardless of party \naffiliation, would transform an issue of truck safety into a racial \nissue.\n  I take a back seat to no one in this body supporting Hispanics, like \neconomic opportunity, race relations, English only, and a host of other \nissues. In fact, I believe I have the largest number of Hispanic staff \nmembers of any Senator in this body.\n  I am as concerned about jobs for Mexican workers as I am for American \nworkers. I also know the only way to reduce illegal immigration is by \nstabilizing the Mexican economy. I want to do that. Does that mean I \nhave to put my children's lives at risk on American highways? I won't \ndo it, nor will I risk any American life in the name of free trade.\n  I would remind my colleagues that of the twenty Hispanic Members of \nthe House, half of them voted for more restrictive measures than the \nproposed Murray-Shelby language.\n  I would strongly suggest that those who are using the race card in \nthis debate for personal or political gain, put a lid on it and \nrecognize that we have a duty to protect the lives and property of the \npeople who sent us here.\n  Now that I have that off my chest, let me use a graphic illustration \nof just one--just one--of the reasons why we should be careful in \nallowing free access to our highways. The problems of hours of service, \nage of the trucks, drug testing, and monitoring compliance have been \ndiscussed by other Senators.\n  Since I am a certified CDL driver, let me focus on that facet of this \nproblem. This is an enlarged page from a daily driver's log. These logs \nare required by the Federal Government and are reviewed and monitored. \nMexican drivers have log books, too, but almost no oversight of their \norder. Note this area here on the log book. It is broken down into \nminute by minute sections of a 24-hour day.\n  Each working day, American drivers are required to fill out this form \nwhich enables Federal officials to track exactly what the driver was \ndoing. I know of no other job in America, with exception of airline \npilots, that has such a high degree of scrutiny. That scrutiny is meant \nto ensure safety on our highways. Why is it unfair to ask foreign \ntrucks to comply with the same standards?\n  Let me now say a few words about the trucks themselves. We know that \nthe American fleet averages 3 to 5 years old, while the Mexican fleet \naverages 15 years old. If the average is 15 years old, that means some \ntrucks are 30 years old with all the inherent problems of old \nmachinery.\n  What has not been mentioned is the use of the high-tech equipment \nthat is on most new American fleets but rarely on older trucks. Modern \nU.S. trucks have CB radios, weather band radios, cell phones, and GPS \ntracking systems. This not only makes them more efficient but helps \nkeep the driver out of trouble. His boss, the carrier, can tell at any \ngiven moment exactly where he or she is, what speed they are traveling, \nif there are bad road conditions ahead, if there are accidents or \ncongestion that would require re-routing, and a host of other pertinent \nfacts about both the driver and his vehicle.\n  The point is this. Do you think any company which pays as little as \n$7.00 per day to their drivers is going to invest the thousands of \ndollars to equip their trucks with this state-of-the-art efficiency and \nsafety equipment? Not likely, particularly when you factor in the \ninitial cost of $100,000 for each of those new tractors and for the \n$30,000 for those new trailers in the American fleet.\n  It is not always the big things that add up to safer highways. \nSometimes subtle things are equally important. As an example, no driver \nor company that I know will run retreads on their front tires. There \nmay be laws addressing this, but any driver with a lick of sense knows \nthat the risk factor for himself and everyone near him goes up if, \nwhile thundering down the road at speed, pulling 80,000 pounds, a front \ntire blows out. They may run recaps on back tires because other tires \nwill distribute the load in case of a blow out. But not the front.\n  Do Mexican trucks run recaps on front tires? Many do and again I \nwould ask, do you think anyone paying his drivers $7.00 per day, will \nbuy $400.00 tires for the front wheels when he can buy caps for a \nquarter of the price?\n  I stand before this body not just as a concerned Senator but as a \nlicensed commercial truck driver. This amendment attempts to provide \nequal and fair standards. For my colleagues who believe this amendment \nviolates components of our trade agreements, I challenge them to tell \nthe American people they are willing to sacrifice the safety of our \nroads for the economic vitality of our neighbors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend from Arizona--we came to the \nHouse together; we came to the Senate together--stated a number of \nthings in the last hour or so. He said, and I have it from the official \ntranscript:\n\n       I regret that. And I have been here not as long as many but \n     long enough to know when a very dangerous trend or a very \n     dangerous precedent has been set that I recognize it.\n\n  He further went on to say, again from the transcript:\n\n       Cloture vote. I view that unfortunate, too, because if in \n     the future Members of the Senate are seeking a number of \n     amendments to be considered and cloture is imposed without \n     them being able to have all their amendments considered, then \n     obviously we are setting another, I think, very bad precedent \n     for the conduct of the way we do business in the United \n     States Senate.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       I also want to make another comment about this issue and \n     what we have done here. The Senator from Texas and I were \n     allowed to propose one amendment, one amendment which was \n     voted on, and we had many other amendments. But, obviously, \n     that effort is going to be significantly curtailed.\n\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, said that a dangerous \nprecedent has been set. No amendments could be offered. The senior \nSenator from Texas offered an amendment. It was tabled, defeated.\n  Senator Murray and I have begged for people to come and offer \namendments, literally legislatively begged for people to come and offer \namendments, day after day. No, there has been no dangerous precedent \nset.\n  This is the way the Senate has operated, by the rules. We want to \nmove on with other legislation. The Senator from Arizona has refused to \nlet us go forward, as has the Senator from Texas, to go forward on a \nTransportation appropriations bill that is vitally important to every \nState in the Union. Senator Shelby and Senator Murray have worked very \nhard on this very important appropriations matter.\n  There was no choice but the leadership had to move to invoke cloture. \nWhat does that mean? It means stop unnecessary, dilatory debate. It was \ndone on a bipartisan basis. This is not Democrat versus Republican. \nThis is Democrats and Republicans wanting to move on with the business \nof this country; therefore, the business of the Senate.\n  We should move forward with this legislation. We are not doing that. \nBecause of these dilatory tactics on this matter, we have been unable \nto move forward on other important legislative matters for this \ncountry.\n  Madam President, before we leave for the recess we have to finish the \nExport Administration Act. This is extremely important, and it expires \nAugust 14. This legislation is the most important aspect of the high-\ntech legislative agenda. The high-tech industry, by the way, is \nhurting. Just look at what is happening in the stock market. They need \nhelp. One of the things we can do to help is to change the rules so \nthey can compete with the rest of the world. We don't want these jobs \nto be sent overseas. That is what is happening. We have a handful of \nSenators out of 100 who don't want us to move forward. Holding this up \nis wrong. The Export Administration Act is extremely important.\n  Madam President, the food and fiber in this country is produced by \nfarmers and ranchers all over America. America is the greatest producer \nof food in the world. But we have another bill that we must take up \nbefore we leave to help the farmers and ranchers of America. It is \ncalled the agricultural supplemental bill. We have to do this\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\nbecause if we don't, the farmers of this country, by virtue of some \nbudgetary provisions that are placed in the law, will lose over $5 \nbillion. This is essential to the very survival of many farmers and \nranchers in America. We can't move forward on that because of the \ndilatory tactics on this issue. No, there is no bad precedent set. We \nare following the precedent established in the Senate to move forward \nwhen dilatory tactics are being used.\n  I repeat, we have stood here and asked for amendments to be offered. \nAll day Tuesday we were in quorum calls. All day. Yesterday, almost all \nday. So we need to move forward. We not only need to pass the \nagricultural bill that is so important, which I have referred to, we \nhave to finish the conference on that bill before August. We need to \nmove expeditiously with the Export Administration Act. Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski have spent many days of their lives working on another \nappropriations bill, VA/HUD and Independent Agencies, which is worth \napproximately $50 billion to this country, to keep the institutions of \nGovernment running. That needs to be finished before the August recess. \nBut, no, we are being held up in a filibuster--that is what it is--and \nthe Senate, on a bipartisan basis today, said enough is enough.\n  I think this is wrong. We need to move forward. When my friend says \nthat a dangerous precedent is set, I respectfully disagree. The Senate \nis working as it has for 200 years--in fact, more than that. We are the \ngreat debating institution. That is what we are called. But there comes \na time, under our rules, when enough debate is enough, enough stalling \nis enough, enough dilatory tactics is enough. That was confirmed today \non a bipartisan vote.\n  The Senate has done the right thing. We need to move off of this \nlegislation and move forward with other important matters to this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wonder if I may have 15 minutes of \nSenator McCain's time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there a time \nlimitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is operating under cloture. Each \nSenator has a maximum of 1 hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask to use 15 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I may even take 5 or 10 more. I think maybe 15 minutes \nis more than I ought to use.\n  First, I want my colleagues to know that I am not here as part of any \ndilatory tactics. I wish we could resolve this issue. But I thought \nthat at least I ought to add a little bit to the notion of the kind of \nproblem we have--that it is serious, which has the potential of very \nserious repercussions; or rather is this a typical problem on the \nSenate floor?\n  I came to the Chamber because I suggest there is a sea change \noccurring in this hemisphere between the United States and Mexico. It \nis a great and positive sea change. If we look at our history, it is \nincredible that we have come to the year 2001 and we still have a great \ncountry on our border with which, for some reason or another, the \nUnited States has not had a long and abiding friendship with that has \nyielded benefits for both countries.\n  We have been the victims of Mexican leadership that blamed America. \nThere were a number of their Presidents who, when things didn't go well \nin Mexico, chose to say: It is America's problem. They are so wealthy \nthat they ought to take care of things. They are letting all our \nworkers go there and get jobs when we need them over here.\n  Today, however, sitting right on our border is potentially the \ngreatest trading partner we could have in the world. What we need to do \nis what the NAFTA agreement called for and let Mexico grow and prosper, \nso that as neighbors, we become gigantic partners in trade. Many of the \nsore spots between our countries will disappear if Mexico has a chance \nto grow and prosper.\n  All of a sudden, there is on the horizon, as a result of a very \ndifferent election in Mexico, a new kind of President. There is nobody \nwriting about Mexico that says anything different than that. A new kind \nof President was elected in the most democratic election they have ever \nhad. We all see him. We all admire him. I understand he was in the city \nof Chicago to have a meeting and to speak with those who might be \nconcerned about Mexican problems, and 50,000 people showed up in \nChicago to hear President Fox speak.\n  What has he said? He has said this about America: You are not our \nproblem. I am not going to blame America for our economic situation. I \nwant to be a friend, neighbor, and partner; and I want the Mexican \npeople to have their own jobs. He said: I want them to grow and \nprosper. All I want is fair treatment from the United States.\n  Whether people like international agreements or not, we did approve \nand ratify an agreement with Mexico and Canada on this hemisphere \nregarding free trade. That is of the most serious type of agreement.\n  I noted that my good friend, Senator Reid, was on the floor \ndiscussing with Senator Byrd the issue of a great book out there named \n``John Adams,'' who was one of our great Founding Fathers. Would you \nbelieve that in the first 300 pages out of 600 pages of that book, \nwhich I am reading now, John Adams used the words ``America thrives on \nfree trade.'' Think of this now; that was just after or during the \nRevolutionary War. ``Without free trade America cannot abide in this \nworld, but we must sell our abundance in the world.'' John Adams said \nthat more than one time.\n\n  Look at how long it took us to get an understanding that, with \nreference to Mexico and our neighbor Canada, we would open our borders \nand get rid of taxes that impose limitations upon free trade and move \nahead together.\n  What else has the President of Mexico said? Believe it or not, he has \nactually said that he does not like the situation where Mexican men and \nwomen have to come here to find jobs. He does not like the situation \nwith illegals coming here and getting jobs--not because he is angry at \nany of his people; he is saying they ought to be robust enough where \nthat doesn't have to happen. He is saying: Let's work it out so we \ndon't have the border conflicts over immigration that we are having \ntoday, which lead to big arguments and very serious sores between the \ntwo nations.\n  Right now, that country is growing. In fact, their gross domestic \nproduct is growing faster than America's. I wish we could turn around \nand reach that soon. So here is a rare opportunity to let this man lead \nMexico and let the Mexican people become our friends and openly be \nsympathetic to us right now, as they are under his leadership. I can't \nthink of anything worse than to turn that relationship around and have \nthe Mexican leadership say that we are discriminating and treating them \nunfairly and watch this relationship sink into some kind of condition \nthat will not let us, during the term of this new President who gets \nalong with them very well, achieve the significant things that we can \nachieve together in this hemisphere. It will take some time.\n  I have come to the Chamber to give an example of how far we have \ncome.\n  First of all, we have traveled a long road on this issue. The House \nof Representatives voted to ban Mexican trucks' access to the United \nStates--period--and then put all kinds of limitations, including you \ncannot spend any money to help certify them or the like, which means we \nclose the borders. That is essentially what the House amendment means: \nNo trucks going back and forth. Everybody knows that would be a very \nserious mistake.\n  Some Senators here--minimal in number--had voiced their approval of \nthis action of the House. Thankfully, Senator Murray did not. Senator \nMurray, chairman of this subcommittee, did not accept the House \nlanguage, but proceeded to write her own language. She has attempted to \ncraft something balanced to meet our obligation under NAFTA, while \nensuring safety concerns.\n  Frankly, this Senator is as concerned as anyone about safety, but I \ndo not believe implementing the NAFTA agreement, rather than breaking \nit, is inconsistent with safety, nor that it need be. I believe NAFTA \ncan be implemented in such a way that we do no violence to it and we do \nnot breach it or break it and still we have significant safety \nadvantages over what we have today or\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nwhat we can expect today. I believe that is what we ought to do in due \ncourse.\n  I suggest that probably there is no part of our transportation system \nthat does more good for American trade and American commerce than the \ntrucking industry, be it large or small, be it those who are members of \nthe Teamsters or independents. The trucking industry in America spends \na lot of money on making sure trucks are as safe as they can be.\n  We are all having trouble getting people to be truckdrivers and \ntrained to do the right job. For certain, the wages are pretty good and \nare moving in the right direction. America can be very proud of that.\n  We ought to say we want those trucks to have an opportunity to go to \nMexico, and we want Mexico to move in the direction of having trucks as \nsafe as ours and, indeed, adopt safety regulations and certification \nrules together with Mexico, not separate, but together with them which \nwill make sure we can say the same things are happening in Mexico with \nreference to their future.\n  Now, I come to the point. Senator Murray, as I just said, tried very \nhard to produce an amendment. It is very detailed. We have a \ndisagreement about what the amendment does. I still have people telling \nme it violates NAFTA; that is to say, if we were to adopt it and keep \nit in law, there would be a justification for Mexico to say: Since you \ndo not abide by NAFTA, we have an opportunity to say we are not going \nto abide by some other things, and take their action against us.\n  The Minister of Economy for the Republic of Mexico, with whom I had \nthe privilege of meeting 5 months ago, has voiced his concern about the \nlanguage. The President of the United States has voiced his concern \nabout the language.\n  I believe, after talking to fellow attorneys and those schooled in \nNAFTA, it does violate NAFTA, but I do not want somebody to think by \nsaying that, I am accusing anybody of doing anything intentionally \nwrong. Not at all. It is just there are others who say it does not \nviolate NAFTA.\n  Here we are in the Senate Chamber with a group of Senators, albeit at \nthis point smaller in number, saying it does violate NAFTA, and another \ngroup, larger, saying it does not. I submit, and actually since the two \npeople who have the most to do with this are here, I submit that at \nleast we ought to adopt an amendment--I am not saying this amendment--\nbut we ought to adopt an amendment that simply says it is not the \nintention of this legislation to violate NAFTA. It is pretty simple \nlanguage. Do not bulk it up with a whole bunch of things. Just say, \nsince both sides seem to say it does not violate NAFTA, why don't we \nadopt an amendment to say it is not the intention of any of these \namendments that have to do with Mexican-American trucking to violate \nNAFTA.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If I thought that would move the legislation along, I would \nbe happy to speak to the manager and the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not the one moving the legislation along, nor am I \nthe one trying to stall it. I am stating that I believe there is a \ncommon ground which at some point we ought to adopt unequivocally, and \nthat is that there is no intention to violate NAFTA.\n  Mr. REID. If I can ask my friend one more question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. The senior Senator from New Mexico and I have served \ntogether on the Appropriations Committee since I came here. He is \ncertainly someone from whom I have learned a great deal. I am fortunate \nto have been on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee with the \nSenator from New Mexico for many years. We have been the chairman and \nranking member off and on over those time periods.\n  After Senator Byrd, no one has as much experience as the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I say to the Senator, you are a peacemaker. I understand \nthat. Legislation is the art of compromise. I say to my friend from New \nMexico, this is not an issue with which I have been heavily involved, \nbut we do know the House has passed a very tough provision. In effect, \nwhat their provision says is no Mexican trucks coming to the United \nStates, whereas the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nWashington have come up with a provision that is much softer than the \nHouse provision.\n  My point is, I cannot understand why this matter is not taken to \nconference and worked out there. That is where it is going to be worked \nout anyway, no matter what happens. I ask my friend if he will use his \nexperience and the friendship everyone feels for him and the need to \nmove this legislation along in an attempt, with his good offices, to \nwork out a situation where we can take this to conference and work it \nout there.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes of \nhis 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did Senator Reid's comments count against my time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yielded for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that it not be counted.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nconsumed be charged against me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself another 5 minutes, so I have 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes off my hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will conclude, hopefully not using the \ntime I have allowed for myself. We have gotten to this point without \nanybody understanding how we got here. All of a sudden we are in an \nextreme logjam about something on which fundamentally we do not \ndisagree.\n  I repeat, there is probably no Senator here who wishes Mexico and \nAmerica to break off their ongoing friendly relationships which move in \nthe direction of Mexico growing and prospering and together having a \ngreat trading relationship.\n  I have done the best I can to explain why free trade is important and \nwhy Canada, America, and Mexico can be important for all free peoples \nand how ludicrous it was we did not have this years ago, but now we \nhave it.\n  I have concluded there are not very many Senators who want to openly \ndefy and break that and cause Mexico to say we can now have \nrepercussions on commodities that America is selling to Mexico by \nimposing duties. I don't think anyone wants that. We want the two \ncountries to be able to work out, under NAFTA, a set of rules and \nregulations built around safety, fairness, and nondiscrimination toward \nMexico.\n  That is very simple. That is what we ought to try to do. If I were to \npose that question to Senators, I think there would be agreement. I \ncame to the floor merely to suggest there ought to be a way to arrive \nat a conclusion that reaches the fundamentals.\n  It is strange that two groups of Senators say they are doing the same \nthing yet the things they are saying we should do are very different. \nFor instance, those who favor the Murray amendment language--and I have \njust praised the Senator for her hard work and for how far she has come \nfrom the House proposal--there is a larger group who would say there is \nno intention to break the law and to break it and violate it in this \nMurray amendment.\n  It is interesting, on this side, if there are some people of bad \nfaith--and I don't know of any of bad faith--it seems we are at each \nother's throats here. There appear to be relationships that are not \nworking for some reason. On our side there are Senators--I am one--who \nthink we do violate NAFTA with the amendment and its specificity, and \nit does discriminate against Mexico as compared with Canada, and we are \nnot supposed to be doing that.\n  If we both--good, solid groups of Senators--think in that manner, \nthat it doesn't violate, it does violate, or vice versa, why not find a \nway to not violate NAFTA? I cannot do it, I am not in control of this \nlegislation. Why not find a way to unequivocally say we are not \nviolating, there is no intention to violate NAFTA, it is not our \nintention, we want NAFTA to be implemented--\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nlanguage that is affirmative about what we are doing?\n  Having said that, I have a pending amendment, and I would strike a \nportion of it. It is the amendment of which I am speaking. It says it \nis the intention that we not violate NAFTA in this bill. I cannot bring \nit up now. It is not my intention. Nor do I intend to wait around and \nuse that as a dilatory tactic.\n  Whatever time I reserved I yield back, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, pursuant to rule XXII, I hereby yield 1 hour \nfor Senator McCain and 1 hour to Senator Gramm.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use a portion of \nmy time on a subject that is not germane to the matter before the \nSenate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself time under my time \nallotment.\n  Mr. President, I have been watching the debate intermittently this \nafternoon on the issue of trucks under the NAFTA agreement. I am really \namazed that we are having this debate because I don't think there \nshould be a question at all that we are going to make the safety of our \nhighways the highest priority. I don't think anything in NAFTA says you \ncan't. NAFTA does say that we will agree there is parity among Canada, \nthe United States, and Mexico. There are ways to implement the \ndifferences in safety rules through negotiations. But the idea that we \nwould give up the right to control the safety of our highways is a \nnonstarter.\n  I think we are very close in agreement on what those safety \nrequirements should be. I think the administration and the Department \nof Transportation have been sitting at the table with many of us who \nare debating this issue. I think we are very close in substance with \nSenator Gramm, Senator McCain, Senator Murray, and Senator Shelby. \nEveryone has been involved in the process. I think we all agree that we \nhave the ability for safe highways, to assure that we have safety on \nour highways, and that we are going to be evenhanded.\n  I really think what we are talking about is process. We are really \ntalking about when we come to that determination. Many of us are \nconcerned that if we don't talk about exactly what is going to be the \nend result, maybe it is not going to come out that way. But I think we \nhave the ability to talk across the aisle.\n  I am certainly supportive of the stricter definitions that are in the \nbill. It is certainly better than what the House passed, which \nabrogates the responsibility under NAFTA.\n  I do not think we are very far apart. For all the heat that is being \ngenerated, I think we are very close to the language in the Murray \namendment with the language the Department of Transportation is \nseeking. I think we are very close to coming to a conclusion. I hope we \ncan agree in due time on that final language, or at least a process to \nget there. I think we are talking process, even though it seems there \nis a lot of heat being generated on the issue.\n  I am going to call up an amendment at the appropriate time, No. 1133, \nthat will assure we have the ability to weigh trucks at a crossing \nwhere at least 250 trucks a year go across, where there will be \ncommercial scales available to weigh trucks.\n  One of the differences between Mexico and the United States is weight \nlimits. There is also a difference between Canada and the United States \non this issue.\n  This is an important issue because, of course, our highways are \nmaintained based on our weight limits. The heavier a truck is, the more \nwear and tear there is on our highways. So we do need to make sure that \nwe have a system, once we agree on what the weight limits are going to \nbe, to check those weights and assure that everyone is meeting the \nrequirements.\n  So I am hoping my amendment No. 1133 will be adopted in due course. \nSenator Domenici is a cosponsor of my amendment. We are two Senators \nfrom border States who understand very much the wear and tear on \nhighways. I would also say that the bill that is before us, thanks to \nSenator Murray and Senator Shelby, has enough money to equip these \nstations.\n  Another action that the House took was to wipe out the money that \nwould allow us to inspect these trucks. The House just went into a hole \nand hid. We cannot do that. The bill before us that has been laid out \nby the appropriations subcommittee does have good regulations. There \nshould be some changes in the language, but I think we are close to \ncoming to that agreement. And it does have the money for the inspection \nstations. I want to make sure that included in that agreement also are \nweigh stations, if there are going to be any number of trucks that go \nthrough at any one time.\n  We have lived with the 20-mile commercial zone in Texas, which has \nthe most border crossings. Texas has 1,200 miles of border of the \n2,000-mile border with Mexico. So we do have the most crossings, of \ncourse. We have the most highways. We have had a 20-mile commercial \nzone that was established by NAFTA in the interim period while we were \nworking on these regulations.\n  There have been some problems within these commercial zones. Many \npeople who live on the border are very concerned about seeing trucks \nthat do not have the clear safety standards that American trucks are \nrequired to have. Only 2 of the 27 U.S.-Mexico border crossings are \ncurrently properly equipped with infrastructure and manpower to enforce \nthe safety regulations. That is why I have worked so hard with Senator \nMurray and Senator Shelby on the committee to restore the President's \nrequest for border safety activities.\n  This bill does have $103 million dedicated to border safety \nactivities. So most certainly, I think we are on the right track to \nmaking sure that families who are traveling on American highways are \nnot going to have to worry about substandard trucks from any other \ncountry being on that highway.\n  We agree that we should have agreements with Mexico and that Mexico \nshould be comfortable in that they are not being discriminated against. \nThat is not even a question, although it has certainly been a question \nin the Senate debate.\n  I hear from my border constituents. I talk to people in El Paso and \nLaredo and McAllen and Harlingen. They are the most concerned of all \nabout the trucks they are seeing in this 20-mile commercial zone, where \nwe have Mexican trucks that are legal as NAFTA provided in this early \ntransition time. It is those people who are complaining the most about \nMexican trucks that might not meet the same safety standards.\n  We have had a lot of debate. It is legitimate debate. But I do not \nthink anyone in this Senate Chamber intends to violate NAFTA. I do not \nthink anyone in this Senate Chamber intends for us to have unsafe \ntrucks on American highways. So if we can all agree on those two \npoints, I think it is time for us to come to an agreement on the \nprocess.\n  Let's have strict safety requirements; let's have a process by which \nwe can inspect Mexican trucks, where Mexican authorities can inspect \nU.S. trucks that want to go into Mexico,\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\nand where we can have a certification process that requires that every \ntruck must be inspected; but if it is inspected at a site before it \ncrosses the border, and it gets a sticker, then we will agree that that \ntruck can go through. But we also must have the facilities for those \ntrucks that are not inspected and will not have that certification \nsticker.\n\n  We have to make sure that we provide the money for those inspection \nstations. This bill has the money. I want to make sure that weighing \nstations are as much a part of those border safety inspection \nfacilities as are the checks that we would make for brakes, for \nfatigue, for driver qualifications, for good tires, and all of the \nother things that we would expect if we had our families in a car going \non a freeway. We would hope that we would be safe from encroachment by \na truck that did not meet the standards that we have come to expect in \nour country.\n  So I hope very much that we can come to a reasonable and expedited \nconclusion. I think we are all going for the same goal. I think there \nis no place in this debate for pointing fingers or name-calling. We do \nnot need that. We need good standards, good regulations for the safety \nof our trucks, and to treat Mexican trucks and United States trucks in \na mutually fair way. That is what we are trying to do.\n  I want to work with all of the parties involved. I think we have a \ngood start in this bill, and I think we will be able to perfect this \nlanguage in conference. I think everyone has shown the willingness to \ndo that. I hope we can roll up our sleeves and pass what I think is a \nvery good Transportation Appropriations Committee product. I think it \nis a good bill. It certainly adequately funds the major things that we \nneed to do. With some changes in the Mexican truck language, which the \nsponsors of the legislation are willing to do, I think we can have a \nbill that the President will be proud to sign. That is my goal.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Cantwell).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to support an amendment to \nincrease the Coast Guard's funding by $46.1 million. Unfortunately, \nunder the funding levels in the pending bill, the Coast Guard would be \nforced to reduce routine operations by 20 percent. The increase \nprovided by our amendment will address the Coast Guard's current \nreadiness needs and raise the Coast Guard's law enforcement \ncapabilities to the levels enacted in the budget resolution.\n  The past two national defense authorization bills mandated pay \nraises, new medical benefits, recruiting and retention incentives, and \nother entitlements that exceeded the funds appropriated during the \nconsideration of the regular Transportation appropriations bills. \nCompounding this, the Coast Guard has had to face rising energy costs, \naging assets, and missions that grow increasingly complex. To pay for \nthese increases the Coast Guard has had to dip into its operational \naccounts resulting in reduced law enforcement patrols.\n  Without the funding authorized in this amendment, the Coast Guard \nwill again be forced to reduce its level of operations. These routine \noperations are extremely important. As you know, the Coast Guard is a \nbranch of the Armed Forces, but on a day-to-day basis, they are a \nmulti-mission agency. Last year alone, the Coast Guard responded to \nover 40,000 calls for assistance, assisted $1.4 billion in property, \nand saved 3,355 lives.\n  These brave men and women risk their lives to defend our borders from \ndrugs, illegal immigrants, and other national security threats. And in \n2000, the Coast Guard seized a record 132,000 pounds of cocaine and \n50,000 pounds of marijuana through successful drug interdiction \nmissions. They also stopped 4,210 illegal migrants from reaching our \nshores. They conducted patrols to protect our valuable fisheries stocks \nand they responded to more than 11,000 pollution incidents.\n  On April 6 Senior DeWine, myself, and 10 of the colleagues offered an \namendment to the budget resolution which was adopted by the Senate that \naddressed this very issue. That amendment increased funding for the \nCoast Guard by $250 million.\n  The amendment that we are offering today, will go a long way toward \nrepairing the fundamental problems facing the Coast Guard. It will \nincrease funding by $46.1 million in fiscal year 2002 so that the Coast \nGuard will not need to reduce its routine operations.\n  Now, during the drafting of the fiscal year 2002 Transportation \nappropriations bill, Senators Murray and Shelby had a daunting task in \ncrafting a bill that would cover a wide range of priorities within the \nallocations provided to their subcommittee. Fortunately, they both \nrecognize the importance of the Coast Guard to their home States and \nthe Nation and their bill provides a significant increase above the \nPresident's budget request accordingly. However, based upon the Coast \nGuard's estimates, this increase will not eliminate the need for \noperational cutbacks.\n\n  The $46.1 million increase we are asking for in this amendment is \nwell below the $250 million the Senate agreed to in April, but the \nCoast Guard has assured us that they have taken a careful look at the \nfunding allocations provided in this bill and that this small increase \nis all that is needed to restore the Coast Guard's operations and \nreadiness. This will allow the Coast Guard to address an alarming spare \nparts shortage, maintain operations, and take care of other basic \nreadiness problems.\n  By supporting this amendment, my colleagues will be saying that it is \nunacceptable to reduce these critical law enforcement missions and \nsupplying the Coast Guard with the resources and tools they need to \nfulfill the mandates Congress has given them. It provides the Coast \nGuard with the foundation needed to do its job.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment, and I thank Senators Graham and \nDeWine for their efforts on behalf of the Coast\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nGuard. This is noncontroversial amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, for those who toil in the clandestine \nworld of national security, where the dictates of secrecy cloak heroes \nactions in vaults full of files marked with code words and warnings, \nthere are precious few opportunities to stand before bright lights and \nlisten to applause. Today, a group of men were honored who kept their \nsecret from 1942 until 1968, when their talents and contributions in \nwinning the war in the Pacific were finally declassified. Today was \ntheir turn in the sun, as the President awarded the original 29 Navajo \nCode Talkers the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Now the world knows how these men gave the U.S. military a decisive \nedge in communications during the war in the Pacific theater and \nelsewhere. Their presence at Iwo Jima, at Guadalcanal, and throughout \nthe Pacific provided U.S. military units with secure communications and \nthe element of surprise that allowed U.S. forces to overwhelm dug-in \nJapanese units and win some of the bloodiest battles in World War II. \nThe Navajo Code Talkers' unique contribution to the nation's security \ncan be counted in those victories and in the number of servicemen who \nsurvived the war and returned home to their families.\n  The story behind the development of the Navajo Code Talkers is \nfascinating. Every American knows the history behind December 7, 1941, \nthe ``day that will live in infamy,'' as Japanese forces launched a \nsurprise attack on U.S. military bases in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Almost \nsimultaneously, having assured themselves that the U.S. could not react \nmilitarily, the Japanese attacked and overwhelmed other islands \nthroughout southeast Asia and the Pacific. U.S. losses were staggering, \nand reaction was immediate--the U.S. declared war against Japan and the \nother Axis powers within hours.\n  Declaring war and waging war, however, are two very different \nanimals. The Pacific theater of war presented U.S. military forces with \nunique challenges. Distances were large, and the Japanese defenders \nwere able to ``dig in,'' creating bastions from which small numbers of \nJapanese troops could hold off invading forces and inflict terrible \nlosses upon the military men of the United States. Synchronizing air, \nland, and seaborne forces in coordinated attacks proved to be a major \nchallenge. And the Japanese held an early intelligence advantage.\n  An elite group of English-speaking Japanese soldiers would intercept \nU.S. radio communications and then sabotage the message or issue false \ncommands that led American forces into ambushes. The U.S. responded by \ncreating ever more complex military codes, but his effort had its own \nproblems. At Guadalcanal, military leaders faced a two-and-a-half hour \ndelay in sending and decoding a single message. Something needed to be \ndone.\n  That something was first suggested by Philip Johnston, a World War I \nveteran who was familiar with the use of Choctaw Indians as Code \nTalkers during that war. Johnston, the son of a missionary who was \nraised on a Navajo Indian reservation and who spoke Navajo fluently, \nbelieved that the Navajo language was the ideal candidate for service \nas a military code. Navajo is an unwritten language of great linguistic \ncomplexity. It would be doubtful indeed to suppose that the Japanese \nArmy would possess any fluent Navajo speakers. Mr. Johnston contacted \nthe U.S. Marine Corps with his proposal in early 1942, and after a \ndemonstration of his concept, a group of twenty-nine Navajo speakers \nwas recruited to become Marine Corps radio operators.\n  Those first twenty-nine men, and the others that followed them and \nwho will be receiving a Congressional Silver Medal in a ceremony next \nmonth, developed a code so successful that it became one of the war's \nmost closely held secrets. The first twenty-nine recruits developed the \noriginal code vocabulary of some 200 terms. Then, in a novel way of \naddressing other words outside that initial vocabulary, the group \ndeveloped an ingenious method of spelling out any other word using any \nNavajo words that would, when translated into English, begin with the \ninitial letter that was desired. Thus, if a Code Talker wanted to spell \n``day,'' for instance, they could use the Navajo word for ``dog'' or \n``dig'' or ``door'' followed by any Navajo words that translated to a \nword beginning with ``a'' and ``y.'' Thus any five radio operators \ncould pick a different combination of Navajo words that would, when \ntranslated, spell ``day.'' ``Dog'' ``ant,'' and ``yellow'' or ``door,'' \n``apple,'' ``yawn'' would both give you the initials ``d,'' ``a,'' and \n``y'' in the correct order. Combined with the unique linguistic and \ntonal qualities of the Navajo language, such flexibility made the \nNavajo Code bewildering to the Japanese yet speedy and flexible to use.\n  Military commanders credited the Code Talkers with saving the lives \nof countless American soldiers and with providing a decisive edge in \nsuch battles as those that took place in Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, \nIwo Jima, and Okinawa. Major Howard Connor, the 5th Marine Division \nsignal officer at Iwo Jima, had six Navajo Code Talkers working nonstop \nduring the first 48 hours of the battle for Iwo Jima. Those six men \nsent and received more than 800 error-free messages during that period. \nMajor Connor stated that ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines \nwould never have taken Iwo Jima.'' The raising of the American flag at \nIwo Jima was captured on film--I can see it now--captured on film as \none of the war's most compelling images, one that was translated into \nbronze at the Marine Corps memorial here in Washington, here in the \ncity.\n  Today the Department of Defense has an Undersecretary of Defense for \nwhat is termed ``C4ISR'' which stands for Command, Control, \nCommunications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and \nReconnaissance. Billions of dollars are spent in an effort to keep \nswift-moving combined military forces coordinated in an attack and \naware of the dangers around them. In World War II, such things were \nmore rudimentary. Communications were largely confined to open radio \nwaves, making U.S. forces vulnerable to exactly the kind of intercept \nand sabotage practiced by Japanese forces. The Navajo Code Talkers, \nlike World War I's Choctaw Code Talkers, represented an innovative and \nhugely successful answer to a problem that plagues military forces to \nthis day. It is not surprising that the Department of Defense wanted to \nkeep the Navajo Code Talkers a closely guarded military secret until \n1968. What is laudable is that the Code Talkers kept their secret so \nwell, despite every temptation to brag and every disappointment in \nhaving their priceless contribution remain hidden behind a Top Secret \nstamp.\n  In receiving the Congressional Gold Medal, the Navajo Code Talkers \njoin a very short list of American heroes and luminaries that began \nwith General George Washington on March 25, 1776. Their service merits \nthis, the long-overdue thanks of a grateful nation and the award of the \nCongressional Gold Medal. To each Navajo Code Talkers, I offer the \nsincere thanks and deep appreciation of the United States Senate. My \nthanks also go to Senator Jeff Bingaman for sponsoring the legislation \nin the Senate authorizing the\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\naward of the Congressional Gold Medal to this gathering of heroes, the \nNavajo Code Talkers. It should never be too late to recognize and \nreward the heroism of those who risk much to preserve the freedom and \nliberty that we all enjoy. It is all too common to heap the laurels on \nthe general, admirals, and other leaders, and to overlook the \ninvaluable contribution made by each soldier, sailor, airman, and, in \nthis case, each radio operator who put just as much on the line as did \nthose with more braid and brass on their collars. The Navajo Code \nTalkers were an essential element in each victory, as much as the man \nat the top who gave the command to attack.\n  I close on that thought with the words of John Jerome Rooney, who \nwrote the following lines in his poem, ``The Men Behind the Guns.'' I \ngive you his first and last stanzas.\n\n     A cheer and salute for the Admiral, and here's to the Captain \n           bold,\n     And never forget the Commodore's debt when the deeds of might \n           are told!\n     They stand to the deck through the battle's wreck when the \n           great shells roar and screech--\n     And never they fear when the foe is near to practice what \n           they preach:\n     But off with your hat and three times three for Columbia's \n           true-blue sons,\n     The men below who batter the foe--the men behind the guns!\n\n     Oh, well they know how the cyclones blow that they loose from \n           their cloud of death,\n     And they know is heard the thunder-word their fierce ten-\n           incher saith!\n     The steel decks rock with the lightning shock, and shake with \n           the great recoil,\n     And the sea grows red with the blood of the dead and reaches \n           for his spoil--\n     But not till the foe has gone below or turns his prow and \n           runs,\n     Shall the voice of peace bring sweet release to the men \n           behind the guns!\n\n  Today, Mr. President, I tip my hat and offer three times three to the \nNavajo Code Talkers.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President earlier today I was honored to join \nPresident Bush, four of the five surviving Navajo Code Talkers, their \nfamilies, and the families of all the Code Talkers in a ceremony in \nwhich the President awarded the Code Talkers the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  The ceremony also included other members of Congress, Indian tribal \nleaders, and dignitaries from around the Nation.\n  For far too many Americans, bred on cynicism and hopelessness, these \nmen remind us what real American heroes are all about.\n  It is unfortunate that we could not have recognized these men and \ntheir contributions sooner than this.\n  Think of this--just 77 years before World War II, the grandfathers of \nthese heroes were forced at gunpoint with 9,000 other Navajos from \ntheir homeland and marched 300 miles through the burning desert. For \nfour long years the Navajo people were interned at the Bosque Redondo.\n  For these men and their comrades to rise above that injustice in \nAmerican history and put their lives on the line speaks of their \ncharacter and their patriotism.\n  Just as the Japanese were never able to break the Navajo Code, it is \nalso a mystery why it took so long for our Nation to recognize the \ncritical role the Code Talkers played in achieving victory in the \nPacific.\n  The answer may lie in the secrecy of their mission.\n  The Navajo Code Talkers took part in every major assault the U.S. \nMarines conducted in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945. It was their duty \nto transmit messages in their native language, Dine Bizaad, a code the \nJapanese were never able to decipher.\n  Mr. Philip Johnston, the son of a missionary to the Navajos and one \nof the few non-Navajos who spoke the Navajo language fluently, was the \nindividual responsible for recognizing the potential of the Navajo \npeople and language and the contributions they could make to World War \nII.\n  A World War I veteran who knew the value of secure communications, \nJohnston was reared on the Navajo reservation, and recommended the \nNavajo language be used for this purpose.\n  The Navajo language is complex because it has no alphabet or symbols \nand fit the military's need for an ``undecipherable code''.\n  Johnston staged tests under simulated combat conditions with the \ncommanding general of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet.\n  The tests demonstrated that Navajos could encode, transmit, and \ndecode a three-line message in 20 seconds. After the simulation the \nNavajo were recommended to the Commandant of the Marine Corps to serve \nas Code Talkers. It was recommended that the Marines recruit 200 \nNavajos.\n  In May 1942, the first 29 of the 200 requested Navajo recruits \nattended boot camp. During this time they developed and memorized a \ndictionary and numerous words for military terms.\n  After the successful completion of boot camp, the Code Talkers were \nsent to a Marine unit deployed in the pacific theater. At this duty \nstation it became the primary job of the Code Talkers to transmit \ninformation on tactics, troop movements, orders, and other vital \nbattlefield communications over telephones and radios.\n  The Navajos were praised for their skill, speed, and accuracy in \ncommunications throughout the war.\n  At Iwo Jima, Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division Signal officer, \ndeclared, ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have \ntaken Iwo Jima.'' Connor had six Navajo Code Talkers who worked around \nthe clock during the first two days of the battle sending and receiving \nover 800 messages--all without error.\n  The Japanese, who were skilled code breakers, were confused by the \nNavajo language. The Japanese chief of intelligence, Lieutenant General \nSeizo Arisue said that while they were at times able to decipher the \ncodes used by the other armed forces, they never were able to crack the \ncode used by the Marines and Navajos.\n  American Indians and their commitment to this Nation can be described \nin one quote from David E. Patterson, of the 4th Marine Division, \n``When I was inducted into the service, one of the commitments I made \nwas that I was willing to die for my country--the U.S., the Navajo \nNation, and my family. My [native] language was my weapon.''\n  I would like to thank the Navajo Code Talkers who served in World War \nII for their dedication and bravery to our Nation.\n  They believed in what they fought for and were willing to sacrifice \ntheir lives to create a communication system that was unbreakable.\n  Without these brave men and their knowledge of their language, the \nsuccess of our Nation's military efforts in the Pacific would not have \nbeen possible.\n  I urge all Americans to thank these brave men for their uncommon \nvalor and dedication to a cause higher than themselves.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise to formally pay tribute to the \nNavajo Code Talkers, who today received the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The award of the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our Nation's \nhighest honors, is a fitting tribute to the Navajo Code Talkers for \ntheir relentless efforts, sacrifice and dedication during the decisive \nbattles for the Pacific in World War II. I am proud and honored to \nwitness our country's long overdue recognition of the Navajo Code \nTalkers' place in history.\n  I salute my friend, Senator Bingaman, for leading the effort to bring \nnational attention to the crucial role the Navajo Code Talkers played \nin the history of our country, and indeed, the world.\n  The Navajo Code Talkers began as an idea by Phillip Johnston, a \nMarine Corps officer living in Los Angeles, CA, whose father was a \nProtestant missionary on the Navajo reservation. He was aware that the \nMarine Corps was deeply troubled over Japan's ability to break American \ncodes.\n  In late April of 1942, two recruiting officers were sent to the \nNavajo reservation. In May, 29 Navajos were sworn in at Ft. Wingate, \nNM, and taken to Camp Elliott where they became the first all-Navajo \nplatoon in Marine Corps history--Platoon 382.\n  This was not an easy recruitment. Many Navajos were willing to help, \nbut not as many were literate in the English language. The Navajo \nrecruits adjusted well to boot camp, considering few had ever been off \nthe reservation before. Many had never met ``Anglos'' before.\n  They fought across an ocean they had never seen, against an enemy \nthey had never met. To ensure their own land would not be in danger, \nthey\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\njoined in the effort with the United States.\n  The Navajo Code Talkers made a major contribution to WWII. They \nprovided instantaneous technical, detailed communication. None of their \ncodes were written; they were only memorized. The Navajo Code Talkers \ncame to be known as extremely dependable. They were called upon for \ntasks other than just code talking; they also had duties as Marines.\n  The Navajo code was used almost exclusively during the battle of Iwo \nJima. They were credited for sending and receiving over 800 messages \nwith out an error.\n  ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo \nJima,'' stated Major Howard M. Conner, signal officer for the Fifth \nDivision.\n  Eventually there would be over 400 Marine Code Talkers who would play \na vital part in the United States winning the war against Japan.

Madam President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Graham, as a sponsor of the Spaceport \nEquality Act.\n  Space commercialization holds great promise for the development of \nnew drugs, ultrapure materials with incredible strength and \nflexibility, and even space tourism. To make space commercialization a \nreality, the US needs to support the growth of its domestic commercial \nspace launch facilities or ``spaceports.'' It's a sad state of affairs, \nbut U.S. satellite manufacturers are facing increasing pressure to use \nforeign launch services due to a lack of a sufficient domestic launch \ncapability.\n  The purpose of the Spaceport Equality Act is to ensure a strong U.S. \nlaunch capability. This act will provide tax exempt status for \nspaceport facility bonds, just like we do for publicly-owned airports \nand seaports. The government will not be directly funding the \ncommercial space transportation business, but creating the conditions \nnecessary to stimulate private sector capital investment in these \nspaceports. Coupled with the development of ``reusable launch \nvehicles,'' these spaceports will be ``aero-space ports'' that will \naccommodate both air and space vehicles. Reusable launch vehicles are \nessential to reduce the cost of access to space by a factor of 10 to \n100 from its present level of $2000/pound.\n  My home State of Nevada has an important role to play in space \ncommercialization. As part of NASA's Space Launch Initiative, a public-\nprivate team will use the Nevada Test Site for orbital flights. This \nsets the stage for commercial space operations in Nevada as early as \n2003-4.\n  The Spaceport Equality Act simply puts spaceports on equal footing \nwith airports by treating them the same for purposes of exempt facility \nbond rules. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which is \nessential to opening the space frontier for continued civil exploration \nand commercial development.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, earlier this month, the United States and \nthe country of Kazakhstan successfully completed one of the most \nambitious nonproliferation projects undertaken in history--the securing \nof one of the world's largest stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium \nunder the auspices of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nprogram. The security surrounding some three tons of plutonium--\nsufficient to make some 400 bombs--was enhanced and, commencing in \n1998, the fuel assemblies containing spent nuclear fuel were packaged \nto prevent theft.\n  In August of 1998, I visited a torpedo factory in Almaty, then the \ncapital of Kazakhstan, that had been converted to manufacture the big \nsteel cannisters in which the plutonium-rich assemblies were packaged \nand sealed. The last cannister was sealed and lowered into a cooling \npond in early July of this year.\n  Last week, the Washington Times carried a special report by \nChristopher Pala on this program under the title of ``Kazakh Plutonium \nStores Made Safe.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record and urge all of my colleagues to inform \nthemselves about a real success story in U.S.-Kazakhstan relations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 21, 2001]\n\n                   Kazakh Plutonium Stores Made Safe\n\n                         (By Christopher Pala)\n\n       Almaty, Kazakhstan.--U.S. officials last week voiced quiet \n     satisfaction after one of the world's largest stockpiles of \n     weapons-grade plutonium, located in a sensitive zone, was \n     successfully made theft-proof in what the Energy Department \n     called ``one of the world's largest and most successful \n     nonproliferation projects.''\n       More than three tons of plutonium, enough to make about 400 \n     bombs, had been stored in a fast-breeder reactor on the \n     Caspian Sea shore in security conditions one early visitor \n     described as similar to those of an office building.\n       Today, the plutonium has been fully secured, said Trisha \n     Dedik, director of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of \n     Nonproliferation Policy, in an interview July 13 in Almaty, \n     Kazakhstan's economic capital. ``It's been a great success.''\n       A day earlier, Miss Dedik and others took part in a \n     ceremony at Aktau with Kazakh officials celebrating \n     completion of the project.\n       The plutonium was produced by a BN-350 fast-breeder nuclear \n     reactor on the arid northwestern shore of the Caspian, a few \n     miles from the city of Aktau. Both the city and 350-megawatt \n     power plant on the Mangyshlak Peninsula, the first-ever \n     commercial breeder reactor, owed their location to \n     considerable uranium deposits that were mined nearby.\n       The plutonium had been intended to be shipped to other \n     parts of the Soviet Union for use as fuel in other reactors \n     like it, but only one, the BN-600, was ever built. Located \n     near Yekaterinburg on the eastern slope of the Urals nearly \n     900 miles north-northeast of Aktau, it ultimately took little \n     or no plutonium from the BN-350, so the material just piled \n     up.\n       The plant closed in 1999, at the end of its useful life.\n       After 26 years of providing electricity and water (by \n     powering a desalination plant) to the Aktau region, the plant \n     had an accumulation of 3,000 15-foot cylinders, called fuel \n     assemblies, containing spent nuclear fuel.\n       About 7,250 pounds of weapons-grade plutonium could be \n     extracted from the assemblies with relative ease, according \n     to the Energy Department.\n       Nearly half the assemblies emitted little radiation and \n     could be safely handled by workers wearing light protection. \n     The other half were too ``hot'' to be handled by anything but \n     robots. All spent years in a cooling pond the size of a \n     football field at the plant.\n       ``When I walked in there the first time back in 1995, it \n     had all the security of a modern office building,'' said \n     Fredrick Crane, an American physicist familiar with the \n     plant.\n       ``It was a clean and well-run reactor,'' said Mr. Crane. \n     There were some guards, but otherwise all you needed was one \n     code, like in an airport terminal, and you were in.''\n       With each fuel assembly weighing 300 pounds, a couple of \n     strong men with accomplices inside could spirit out the half-\n     dozen cylinders it would take to make a nuclear bomb.\n       ``It was attractive material, and it was accessible,'' said \n     Miss Dedik of the Energy Department.\n       Just 500 miles to the south along the Caspian coastline \n     lies Iran and what U.S. officials say is a covert nuclear-\n     weapons program. Eight hundred miles to the southeast is \n     Afghanistan, base and refuge of accused terrorist mastermind \n     Osama Bin Laden, and due west, straight across the Caspian, \n     Chechnya smolders.\n       ``There are fast-breeder reactors in Western Europe and \n     Japan, but the plutonium produced there doesn't accumulate \n     like it did in Aktau. It's reprocessed pretty quickly,'' Miss \n     Dedik said.\n       ``There just aren't any big stockpiles. Remember, most \n     weapons-grade plutonium is produced by dedicated reactors, \n     controlled by the military, and they're usually much better \n     guarded than this one was.''\n       So in 1996, the government of President Nursultan \n     Nazarbayev, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the \n     United States quietly set up a program to immediately enhance \n     security and, starting in 1998, to package the fuel \n     assemblies to prevent theft.\n       Miss Dedik and Mr. Crane were among several dozen Americans \n     who worked on the\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\n     project, which was funded by the U.S. Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction Program under the Nunn-Lugar Act. The law was named \n     for its sponsors, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, Indiana Republican, \n     and then-Sen. Sam Nunn, Georgia Democrat.\n       A torpedo factory in Almaty that had been converted to \n     civilian work was assigned to manufacture big steel canisters \n     in which four or six of the plutonium-rich assemblies--some \n     ``hot,'' some ``cooled''--were packed together and sealed \n     before being returned to the cooling pond.\n       Weighing more than a ton, the filled canisters are far too \n     heavy to be handled by anything but a large robot, and all of \n     them now emit lethal doses of radiation.\n       Last month, after nearly three years and $43 million in \n     U.S. support, the 478th and last canister was welded shut and \n     lowered into the pond.\n       At the plant, Mr. Crane said, there are now manned gates, \n     closed-circuit TV cameras, X-ray machines and turnstiles with \n     magnetic cards, along with sensors that monitor the nuclear \n     materials around the clock.\n       The packing is designed to last 50 years, but the plutonium \n     isn't destined to stay at the closed Aktau plant that long.\n       Eventually, under a decree signed six months ago by Mr. \n     Nazarbayev, the canisters will be taken 2,750 miles by train \n     to the former nuclear-testing grounds at Semipalatinsk, on \n     the other side of this country four times the size of Texas.\n       There, silos will be dug into the steppe and the fat \n     cylinders will be buried, using a technique perfected in the \n     United States.\n       ``It will be the longest rail shipment of plutonium ever \n     attempted,'' said Miss Dedik. ``They will have to design \n     special transportation casks.''\n       And since the rail line wanders through what is now Russia \n     and Kyrgyzstan, special loops will have to be built so that \n     the plutonium stays in Kazakhstan during its whole voyage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8277-S8278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONTROLLING THE PROLIFERATION OF SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, last week I came to the floor to \nexpress my concern about U.S. policy at the U.N. Conference on the \nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.\n  This was the first effort by the international community to address \nthe issue of the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons \nat the United Nations. I believed it was imperative that the United \nStates take a leadership role in the conference rather than being an \nimpediment to progress.\n  It seemed to me, that the position staked out by Undersecretary \nBolton in his opening statement at the conference--a position which I \nfound to be unwarranted and unwise--had created the very real \npossibility the conference, because of the U.S. position, would be \ndoomed to failure.\n  The conference did not fail--a consensus on a program of action was \nachieved. But the conference was far from a total success.\n  The conference had presented the international community with an \nunparalleled opportunity to take meaningful and concrete steps to \ndevelop and implement a clear international plan of action.\n  Instead the program of action, approved by the conference, is all too \noften silent on important issues, and all too often weak and equivocal \nin places where a course of action is needed.\n  The program of action does contain provisions addressing such \ncritical issues as: establishing national regulations on arms brokers; \nthe need for greater security of weapons stockpiles held by states; a \ncommitment to carry out more effective post-conflict disarmament and \ndemobilization programs, including the destruction of surplus stocks; \nand, criminalizing the illegal production, possession, stockpiling, and \ntrade of small arms and light weapons.\n  If individual nations and the international community are able to \neffectively follow through in these areas it will mark a significant \nstep forward on this issue.\n  And, just as importantly, the program of action calls for a follow-up \nconference, no later than 2006, the time and place to be determined by \nthe 58th United Nations General Assembly.\n  Unfortunately, consensus on the program of action was only achieved \nafter lengthy and sometimes acrimonious negotiations.\n  Many of the participants--especially those from sub-Saharan Africa, \nwhich has been hit so hard by the scourge of small arms and light \nweapons--have come away with a deep sense of disappointment that more \nwas not accomplished.\n  And they are laying the blame for much of the conference's \nshortcomings squarely at the feet of the United States.\n  A number of critical issues were left out of the final program of \naction, including: failure to reach a commitment to negotiate \ninternational treaties on arms brokering or the marking and tracing of \nweapons; absence of any reference to regulate civilian ownership of \nweapons; no reference to protecting human rights; and, a lack of \ncommitment to greater transparency on the trade in small arms and light \nweapons.\n  In addition, in all too many cases the forward looking action that \nwas agreed on is to take place ``within existing resources'' rather \nthan with the additional resources that are required to address this \nissue--or to only be carried out ``as appropriate'' allowing wide \nlatitude for interpretation.\n  Considering the strong commitments for such issues as international \nagreements on brokering and the marking and tracing of weapons in the \nearlier drafts of the Program of action, it is very disappointing that \nthese items were blocked from inclusion in the final document.\n  While some of the blame must also be allotted to others, the United \nStates must face up to the role it played in impeding action on some of \nthese issues--including in areas where the United States itself already \nhas strong laws on the books.\n  For example, there were legitimate questions about what the \nappropriate language for the program of action should have been \nregarding private ownership of small arms and light weapons. But it is \nimportant to recognize that U.S. law and numerous Supreme Court rulings \nrecognize that government regulations on private ownership of weapons \nis legitimate, notwithstanding somewhat spurious arguments about the \nnature of the Second Amendment raised by some who influenced the U.S. \nposition at the conference.\n  The National Firearms Act and the assault weapons ban are just two of \nthe laws that the United States has on the books which control private \nownership of small arms and light weapons and pass constitutional \nmuster.\n  For the United States to stand in the way of a non-binding document \nsuggesting international efforts to seek ways, consistent with \nindividual national constitutional and political structures, to control \nprivate ownership of small arms and light weapons is, to me at least, \nmind boggling.\n  This is especially important given the clear nexus between legal \ntrade and private ownership and the growth of the international black \nmarket in small arms and light weapons.\n  According to the independent Small Arms Survey 2001 by the Graduate \nInstitute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, the black \nmarket often operates on a individual basis, where a small numbers of \nlegally purchased guns are sold to illegal buyers across international \nborders.\n  Such individual black market transfers have a dramatic cumulative \neffect. The United States, with its huge stores of privately-held \nfirearms, is both a source, a supplier, and a recipient of these \ntransfers.\n  Although it is very difficult to quantify illicit arms trafficking in \nthe United States, there are clear indicators that a number of criminal \ngangs operating on U.S. territory are active in the trafficking of \nsmall arms and light weapons into Canada and Mexico.\n  The United States is the largest source of illegal weapons for \nMexico, for example, with this arms trade directly linked to the drug \ntrade.\n\n  I believe that Ambassador McConnell and Assistant Secretary \nBloomfield and others on the U.S. delegation acted to the best of their \nabilities to represent the United States. But I am also concerned that \nthe unrelenting unilateralist position taken by the United States has \nserved to undermine and damage our reputation as a leader in the \ninternational community.\n  The majority of delegations at the conference expressed displeasure \nwith the U.S. attitude and approach to the meetings, sometimes in terms \nthat verged on the undiplomatic.\n  For example, Camilio Reyes of Colombia, the president of the \nconference--who deserves recognition for\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nhis hard work on this issue--said at the conference's close that: ``I \nmust express my disappointment over the conference's inability to agree \ndue to the concerns of one State on language recognizing the needs to \nestablish and maintain controls over private ownership of these deadly \nweapons and the need for preventing sales of such arms to nonstate \ngroups.'' Both of these issues were blocked by the United States.\n  As I stated on the floor last week, I believe that the global flood \nof small arms is a real and pressing threat to peace, development, \ndemocracy, human rights, and U.S. national security interests around \nthe world.\n  These weapons are cheap: An AK-47 can be bought for as little as $15 \nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n  They are durable and easy to transport and to smuggle across \ninternational boundaries.\n  And, with little or no training, anyone--including children--can use \nthese weapons to deadly effect.\n  According to the independent Small Arms Survey 2001, small arms are \nimplicated in well over 1,000 deaths around the world every single day.\n  The goals of the United Nations conference was not to infringe on \nnational sovereignty or to take guns away from their legal owners. And \nit would not have, in my opinion, even with the inclusion of some of \nthe language to which the United States objected.\n  The freedoms and rights of American citizens would not have been \ndiminished by a stronger, more forward looking program of action.\n  As Secretary General Annan stated, the goals of the conference were \nto address the problems created by ``unscrupulous arms dealers, corrupt \nofficials, drug trafficking syndicates, terrorists and others who bring \ndeath and mayhem into streets, schools and towns throughout the \nworld.''\n  The conference's program of action represents an important first step \nby the international community toward developing an international \nframework for cooperation and collaboration to promote better national \nand international laws and more effective regulations to eliminate the \nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons.\n  In fact, the United States has not formally consented to the program \nfor action, so this is a step I urge the Administration to take as soon \nas possible.\n  And much more will be needed in the future. Many important issues \nthat should have been addressed by the conference were not and other \nissues that were did not receive sufficient emphasis.\n  I am hopeful that, looking ahead, the United States will be able to \nplay a more constructive leadership role as we work towards developing \nreal and binding international norms and agreements on these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8278-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

CASSIN YOUNG, DD-793\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to an \nimportant date in the history of a valiant ship, the U.S. Navy \nDestroyer U.S.S. Cassin Young, DD-793.\n  The ship today is moored with the U.S.S. Constitution in Charlestown, \nMA, and has been open to the public under the custody of the National \nPark Service since 1981.\n  The Cassin Young was constructed at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyards in \nSan Pedro, CA, and commissioned on December 31, 1943. She was named for \nCaptain Cassin Young, a true naval hero who received the Medal of Honor \nfor valor during the attack on Pearl Harbor and who later lost his life \nduring the great naval battle off Guadalcanal on Friday, November 13, \n1942.\n  From early 1944 until the end of World War II in 1946, the U.S.S. \nCassin Young was involved in active combat operations. She suffered \nstrafing off the island of Formosa in 1944 and withstood two Japanese \nkamikaze attacks, one of them causing heavy damage. Despite this \ndamage, the U.S.S. Cassin Young was repaired locally and returned to \nthe battle line. The ship was the last destroyer to be struck by a \nkamikaze during the fight for Okinawa, a battle that was so destructive \nto the U.S. destroyer fleet. The U.S.S. Cassin Young lost 21 crew \nmembers and saw approximately 100 others injured in combat.\n  At war's end, the U.S.S. Cassin Young rested in mothballs until the \nKorean War brought expansion of the U.S. fleet and she was \nrecommissioned on September 7, 1951, in Long Beach, CA. During her \nsecond tour of active duty, the U.S.S. Cassin Young operated with both \nthe Atlantic and the Mediterranean Fleets and completed a voyage around \nthe world to the Philippines and Korea. She returned to the western \nhemisphere via the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet \nin April 1960.\n  In addition to her many Service Ribbons and Battle Stars, the U.S.S. \nCassin Young received the Navy Unit Citation and the Philippine \nPresidential Unit Citation for her actions during World War II and also \nwas given the Korean Presidential Unit Citation during the Korean War.\n  In 1978, the National Park Service acquired the U.S.S. Cassin Young \nand painstakingly restored her to the configuration under which she \nsailed in the 1950s. Ceremonies commemorating the second commissioning \nof the U.S.S. Cassin Young are scheduled to take place on August 18, \n2001, when the ship will undertake a towed sea trial of Boston Harbor. \nSome 500 individuals, including many of the original crew members from \nboth of her tours of duty, will be on board the ship as it tours the \nwaters off Massachusetts' capital city. Former crew members and friends \nof the ship have created the U.S.S. Cassin Young Association, which \ncounts more than 400 men and women among its members.\n  Through the U.S.S. Cassin Young, the citizens of this country and \nvisitors from abroad have the opportunity to experience firsthand an \nheroic vessel that represents the sacrifices of our Naval personnel \nduring not one, but two, wars.\n  It is my sincere desire that the U.S.S. Cassin Young remain available \nto the people of this country far into the future so that she and those \nwho served aboard her may continue to receive the honor they so \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8278-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8278-S8279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PRAISE ON THE 11TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today in praise of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act on the occasion of its 11th anniversary. The \nadvances in law, health care, education and technology promoted in this \nhistoric legislation over the past 11 years have given Americans with \ndisabilities a new lease on life.\n  Today, 53 million Americans live with a disability, and 1 in 8 of \nthem is severely disabled. According to the most recent data available, \nthere are approximately 117,701 individuals sixteen years or older \nliving with a disability in South Dakota and 57,233 who have a severe \ndisability. Yet due to the landmark Americans with disabilities Act, \nthe stereotypes against these persons are crumbling and they are able \nto lead increasingly integrated and fulfilled lives. The Act has \nguaranteed that people with disabilities be able to live in the most \nintegrated settings possible in their communities. The Americans with \nDisabilities Act has also spurred research and improved care for \nseniors, children and mentally\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\ndisabled persons.

The contributions of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act over the past 11 years are an \ninspiration for what can be done to improve the lives of Americans \nliving with disabilities, and a proponent of more progress in the \nfuture.\n  Once again, it gives me great pleasure to recognize and honor today's \ncelebration on behalf of the millions of disabled Americans throughout \nthis country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8279-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding achievement resulting from a century of hard work and \nperseverance. This spring, the Kuhlman Corporation, a family-owned, \nToledo-based company that provides Northwest Ohio and Southeast \nMichigan with quality concrete and building supplies, celebrated its \n100th anniversary. This is quite a milestone--a testament to the \nKuhlman Corporation's commitment to its customers.\n  In 1901, German immigrant and bricklayer, Adam Kuhlman, helped \nestablish the Toledo Builders Supply Company. Mr. Kuhlman put up much \nof his own money to provide the Toledo Builders Supply Company with new \nbrick oven equipment. The purchase of this equipment was a risky \ninvestment, but Mr. Kuhlman had the foresight to sacrifice his own \nmoney for the good of the company. The investment proved to be a good \none, and, with his strong work ethic and solid business sense, Mr. \nKuhlman turned Toledo Builders Supply into a very successful brick \nbusiness.\n  In the mid-1920's, he became the majority stockholder and founded a \nnew company, called Kuhlman Corporation--a fitting tribute to the man \nwho shaped the early success of the company. Since then, the Kuhlman \nCorporation has remained a family-owned and operated business and \nmaintains the values that made it so successful--hard work and \ninnovation.\n  In 1928, the Kuhlman Corporation set the precedent for Northwest Ohio \nbuilding suppliers by becoming the first company in the region to enter \nthe ready-mixed concrete business. With a fleet of advanced mixing \ntrucks, the Kuhlman Corporation traveled all over Northwest Ohio and \nSoutheast Michigan, helping build structures, like Scott and Waite High \nSchools in Toledo, Anthony Wayne Bridge in Toledo, the Toledo Zoo, and \nthe Medical College of Ohio.\n  The Kuhlman Corporation has survived two World Wars, a depression, \nsevere inflation, and the constant fluctuation of the construction \nmarket to remain a leader in concrete and building supplies, now \naccumulating annual revenue of $36 million. The company has helped the \npeople of Ohio and Michigan to build their dreams. At the same time, \nthe Kuhlman Corporation has achieved the American dream.\n  So today, I salute the Kuhlman Corporation for a century of demanding \nwork, inspiration, and commitment to the Toledo community. I wish them \nall the best for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8279-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF SPENDING BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DURING THE \n  FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 IN SUPPORT OF PLAN COLOMBIA--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 3204(e) of Public Law 106-246, I hereby transmit \na report detailing the progress of spending by the executive branch \nduring the first two quarters of Fiscal Year 2001 in support of Plan \nColombia.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \ntransitional medical and dental care for members of the Armed Forces \nreleased from active duty to which called or ordered, or for which \nretained, in support of a contingency operation; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, our Nation's Reserve components are \nassuming increasingly greater roles in the U.S. military. Today we have \nmore commitments around the world but fewer Active Forces. For these \nreasons, we have increasingly come to depend on our Reserve components.\n  Since the gulf war, our Army and Marine Corps have increased their \noperations abroad by 300 percent. Air Force deployments have quadrupled \nsince 1986. And our Navy now deploys 52 percent of its forces on any \ngiven day.\n  These deployments would be impossible without guardsmen and \nreservists. Last year's Reserve components served a total of 12.3 \nmillion duty days, compared to 5.2 million duty days in 1992.\n  It is time to recognize the contribution of our reservists and given \nthem the benefits they deserve. We must find a way to provide immediate \nshort-term relief to reservists who stand in need of our support, those \nwho have just returned home from deployments abroad.\n  Last month, Senator Leahy and six other colleagues set a goal to \nprovide health care for all National Guard members and reservists. \nSenator Leahy's legislation recognizes the role that Reserve components \nnow play in our national security. This bill authorizes a Defense \nDepartment study to develop the most feasible plan to provide health \ncare for all Reserve components.\n  Providing coverage to all reservists is a monumental task. It will \nrequire intense analysis in developing a cost-effective approach. But \nit is a worthy goal, one that will prove important to sustaining our \nforce strength and our military morale.\n\n  Today I am introducing legislation that will take the first step \ntowards Senator Leahy's goal for covering reservists. The bill will \nsignificantly improve the quality of life for our men and women in the \nNational Guard and Reserves. Reservists like SSG Jonathan Reagan, this \nyoung Army reservist just returned home from an 8-month peacekeeping \nmission in Kosovo. He served in the 313th hospital surgical unit \nproviding care to military personnel and needy Kosovars. Yet when he \nreturned home to Missouri, he found himself without health care \ncoverage of his own.\n  Sergeant Reagan had just finished graduate school and was looking for \na job as a physical therapist. Currently the law allows military \npersonnel to extend their military health coverage for 30 days after \nthey return home. Well, that was not enough for Sergeant Reagan. He was \nuninsured and was forced to purchase his insurance out of his own \npocket.\n  Sergeant Reagan is not alone. Sergeant Jason Dunson served on that \nsame deployment. He did not have health care coverage when he returned \nhome to Springfield, MO, either. Luckily before he deployed, he \ntransferred his 3-year-old daughter's health care coverage to his \nwife's plan. Unfortunately, his employer will not be able to cover him \nfor a number of months.\n  But the case of CPT Terri McGranahan is the most troubling. She \nvolunteered to be a part of our peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. During \nher service, she worked at a health clinic that had been newly painted \nwith a toxic sealant.\n  When she returned home, her private health insurance company refused \nto retain her. Working in this clinic had made her very ill. Her \ncondition resulted in pneumonia and eventually a spot on her lung.\n  She did not detect the condition right away. When she finally sought \nmedical treatment, the 30 days of TRICARE coverage had already expired.\n  She asked the Army for help but was turned down. Moreover, her \nprivate insurer refused to cover her for a condition acquired during \nmilitary service.\n  Eventually, she would be able to obtain reimbursements from the \nDepartment of Defense, once it was fully clarified that her illness was \nservice related. But how long will she have to\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nwait before she receives this relief? And why should she and her family \nbe forced to undergo such stress as she endures a serious ailment, \ncontracted while in the military service?\n  Senators DeWine, Leahy, Daschle, Johnson, Landrieu, Snowe, and I have \njoined together to propose a short-term solution. Our legislation will \nallow Reserve and National Guard personnel to extend their TRICARE \ncoverage for up to 1 year after their deployment.\n  Already, the Carnahan-DeWine bill has been endorsed by organizations \nacross the country, including the National Guard and Reserve Committee \nof the Military Coalition, the Reserve Officers Association, National \nGuard Association, Enlisted Association of the National Guard, and \nseveral other organizations promoting quality of life to serve men and \nwomen.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have indicated that this legislation would \nhave a positive impact on military quality of life and retention rates. \nThey further believe that such extension of benefits would assist \nmembers who, following activation and deactivation, decide to leave \ntheir civilian employment.\n  We are not asking for an overly extensive benefit for Reserve \ncomponents. Some may think this proposal is far too modest. I \nunderstand that in the other body there is a proposal to provide an \neven more comprehensive approach. But I believe that before we attempt \nto establish a full health care program for these service men and \nwomen, it is essential that we authorize the Pentagon to explore the \nmost feasible option. The bill and the legislation authored by Senator \nLeahy will work to achieve this goal.\n  In the meantime, I am proud to be pursuing this initiative in the \nname of our Missouri National Guard and Reservists, as well as our \ncountry's other citizen soldiers. As the Kansas City Star stated in a \nrecent editorial:\n\n       The United States has come to rely more and more heavily on \n     the military reserves and the National Guard.\n       The men and women who make so many sacrifices to serve in \n     those forces should not have to worry about inadequate health \n     insurance coverage as soon as they return to civilian life.\n\n  Mr. President, let's do the right thing for our Nation's citizen \nsoldiers.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Senator \nCarnahan on the introduction of S. 1250. I am an original co-sponsor of \nher legislation that deals with health care shortfalls among members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve. This bill will enable citizen-soldiers \nto receive health insurance coverage for up to one year following an \nextended deployment. It is an important part of a larger effort to \nensure that all members of the National Guard and Reserve have adequate \nhealth insurance.\n  This bill arises out of the changing role of the National Guard and \nReserve in defending our Nation. During the Cold War, the military \nreserves served as an ace-in-the-hole, ready to fight but held back as \na force of last resort. As our military posture has shifted, reservists \nhave started supplementing active forces and taken up a greater share \nof the burden of projecting our national military presence abroad.\n  In many cases, these proud men and women are serving side-by-side \nwith their active duty counterparts in deployments that can last upward \nof six months. I will not repeat many of the facts and figures that \nSenator Carnahan so adeptly underscored in her statement, but, suffice \nto say here, our citizen-soldiers are experiencing all of the same \nhardships, challenges, dangers that full-time servicemembers go through \nevery time they leave their barracks or launch into the skies.\n  This courage and sacrifice deserves our support, both in symbolic and \nconcrete terms. Unfortunately, many are experiencing difficulties as \nthey transition back-and-forth between their usual, employer-provided \nhealth coverage and the military TRICARE Prime coverage they receive \nwhen they deploy longer than 60 days. More disturbing are the cases \nwhere a reservist might be between jobs in their professions, go on an \nextended deployment, and return to that unemployed status with no \nhealth insurance coverage at all. There are innumerable variations on \neach one of these stories, but each points towards a larger problem.\n  Cases like those add up, inevitably impacting military readiness and \nraising troubling moral questions. Military readiness diminishes when \nsoldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen arrive for deployment less \nhealthy than possible. Basic questions of fairness come into play when \ntwo people can do exactly the same job, but receive different levels of \nrespect and gratitude from the country. Congress has the responsibility \nto deal with these inequities and tailor a solution to address the \nproblem.\n  Recently, Senators Carnahan, DeWine, Daschle, Cochran, Johnson, and \nSnowe joined me to introducing S. 1119, the Selected Reserve Health \nCare Act. This bill commissions an independent, detailed study of the \nhealth insurance needs of our citizen-soldiers, but, more importantly, \nexpresses the sense of Congress that every reservist should have full \nhealth care coverage. This is a long-term goal that may take some time \nto achieve. In the meantime, though, we should take steps to move us in \nthe right direction.\n  Senator Carnahan's legislation will ensure a smooth transition back \nto civilian employment after an extended deployment. It increases the \ntime that a member of the reserve can remain on TRICARE following \ndeployment from one month to a year. Though it merely extends an \nexisting benefit, it will provide a much-needed stopgap for those who \nare unemployed or facing difficulties with their civilian insurance \nproviders. This legislation is sensible and affordable, finding a \nbalance between our responsibilities to our servicemembers and our \nresponsibilities as caretakers of the national treasury.\n  Senator Carnahan has shown tremendous leadership on this issue, not \nonly co-sponsoring a companion legislation that I introduced almost a \nmonth ago, but, more importantly, by coming up with a realistic, \nconcrete step to start addressing this complex problem today. I am \nhappy to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with her to enact both of these bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1251. A bill for the relief of Nancy B. Wilson; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation for the relief of Nancy Wilson of \nBremen, ME, who has been denied widow's benefits from Social Security \ndespite the very extenuating circumstances of her case.\n  Nancy Wilson was denied Social Security widow's benefits because she \nhad not been married to the late Alphonse Wilson for the required nine-\nmonth period prior to his death even though they had lived together as \na couple for 19 years. Alphonse had been unable to marry Nancy earlier \nbecause Massachusetts law forbade him from divorcing his first wife, \nEdna, due to her being institutionalized with a mental illness. Upon \nEdna's death on April 12, 1969, Alphonse and Nancy were married just 20 \ndays later, with Alphonse dying on December 5, 1969.\n  While the nine-month requirement for receiving widow's benefits was \nunderstandably created to prevent marriages in anticipation of death, \nthe reason for Nancy Wilson's delayed nuptials were clearly unique. \nGiven the extenuating circumstances, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis private relief bill for Nancy Wilson.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing legislation for the private relief of Nancy B. Wilson. \nNancy's compelling case merits such action.\n  In 1945, Al Wilson was married with two children when tragedy struck \nthe family. His wife Edna was institutionalized following a severe \nmental breakdown, and Al was left with no one to care for his children. \nFive years later, he met Nancy Butler, who took up residence with Al \nand began caring for his two children, as well as her own son. The \neldest child has written that Nancy ``is the person who brought me up \nin place of my biological mother, who was institutionalized. I think of \nNancy as my real mother.''\n  Though Al and Nancy wished to get married, Al was prohibited from \ndivorcing his first wife under a Massachusetts law barring divorce for \nreasons of insanity or institutionalization for insanity. Time passed, \nand although not legally married, Al and Nancy raised their family \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n  Edna Wilson died on April 12, 1969, and Al and Nancy were married \ntwenty days later. Tragically, just seven months after their wedding, \nAl died of cancer. Though only married for those seven months, Al and \nNancy had lived together for 19 years.\n  When Nancy turned 64 she applied to the Social Security \nAdministration for survivor's insurance benefits. She was told that a \ncouple must be married for 9 months for the spouse to be eligible to \ncollect survivor benefits, and that her legal marriage failed to meet \nthat threshold. Nancy has since exhausted the administrative appeals \nprocess to no avail.\n  The private relief bill we are introducing will simply allow Nancy to \nreceive widow's benefits from her husband's earnings. Though Al and \nNancy were legally prevented from being married for all but seven \nmonths of their years together, they were, for all practical purposes, \nmarried for 19 years. She raised his children, allowing him to work and \naccumulate a Social Security benefit.\n  These unique circumstances illustrate why Congress must enact private \nrelief legislation from time to time. Certainly, Nancy's unique \nsituation fulfills the intent of the Social Security Act, and it is a \nsituation that will not be repeated due to a change in Massachusetts \nlaw repealing the legal hurdle that prevented Al and Nancy from being \nmarried in the first place. Mrs. Wilson's case is truly compelling, and \nmerits this corrective action by Congress. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1254. A bill to reauthorize the Multifamily Assisted Housing \nReform and Affordability Act of 1997, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Mark-to-\nMarket Extension Act of 2001 with my colleagues Senator Reed and \nSenator Allard, the chair and ranking member of the Housing and \nTransportation Subcommittee of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee. This legislation will extend the Multifamily Assisted \nHousing Restructuring and Affordability Act of 1997, MAHRAA, for an \nadditional five years.\n  The legislation will ensure that HUD continues to have the authority \nto restructure the rents and the mortgages of its FHA-insured section 8 \nproject-based portfolio. These properties have been operating for the \npast 20 years on long term rental subsidy contracts, many of which are \ncurrently paying above-market rents. The program we seek to reauthorize \nprovides HUD with the tools to reduce those rents to market levels and \nrestructure the underlying mortgages so that the new, lower rents will \nbe sufficient to cover the debt. At the same time, the program provides \nfor the rehabilitation of these projects, and requires another long \nterm commitment to keep the properties affordable.\n  This program expires in September. Both HUD and the General \nAccounting Office believe the program should be reauthorized in order \nto continue the progress in getting these projects restructured, \nrehabilitated, and on a sound footing for the taxpayer, for the owner, \nand for the resident.\n  In a hearing on this program held on June 19, we heard from all the \nstakeholders, HUD, and the GAO. We have adopted many of the \nrecommendations heard at that hearing in this legislation. Some of the \nchanges we have included should further reduce the costs of the program \nto the federal government, while simultaneously allowing for more \nextensive rehabilitation and more economic certainty for property \nowners. The bill also extends the authorization for funding for \ntenants, non-profits, and public agencies that participate in the \nrestructuring process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Section-by-Section of the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2001\n\n       This legislation reauthorizes the ``Multifamily Assisted \n     Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997'' (MAHRAA) with \n     some amendments.\n       Section 1--Short Title.\n       Section 2--Purposes.\n       Section 3--Definitions.\n       Section 4--Provides for reauthorization of grants for \n     tenant services, non-profits, and public entities engaged in \n     the restructuring process; readjustment of calculation of \n     properties eligible for exception rents; use of enhanced \n     vouchers; notice regarding rejection of restructuring plan; \n     voluntary participation of Preservation projects in mortgage \n     restructuring upon sale or transfer of property; discretion \n     for the Secretary in requiring owner contributions for new \n     features in addition to basic rehabilitation; establish \n     consistent rent standard; provide for GAO reports on physical \n     and financial condition of the property and HUD's oversight; \n     and, allow for resizing of second mortgages.\n       Section 5--Provides for consistent rent standard for \n     projects undergoing restructuring, and for tenant-based \n     vouchers.\n       Section 6--Provides for HUD-held mortgages to go through \n     FHA's streamlined refinance process established by section \n     237(a)(7) of the National Housing Act; provides for the term \n     of such loans to be up to 30 years.\n       Section 7--Technical correction to renumber a section of \n     the law.\n       Section 8--Eliminate the requirement that the Director of \n     the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring, \n     OMHAR, be confirmed by the Senate; make the Director report \n     to the FHA Commissioner; extend the program and Office for 5 \n     years; and make the limitation on subsequent employment 1 \n     year, consistent with Congressional rules.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1255. A bill to encourage the use of carbon storage sequestration \npractices in the United States; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Brownback and I are \nintroducing legislation that uses a simple, scientifically sound and \nentirely voluntary approach to combat global warming. It's not \nregulatory, and it's not revolutionary, except for the fact that this \napproach could account for and solve up to 50 percent of the United \nStates' atmospheric carbon problem. The Carbon Sequestration and \nReporting Act will expand the Nation's forested lands, protect \nwatersheds, conserve agricultural lands and put forests and farms on \nthe frontlines in the battle against global warming. The legislation is \nentirely voluntary and incentive-based. It makes new resources \navailable to private landowners through State-operated revolving loan \nprograms and USDA conservation programs to provide assistance for tree \nplanting, other forest management actions, and soil conservation for \nthe purposes of carbon sequestration. Both of these programs will lead \nto better water quality, less runoff pollution, better wildlife habitat \nand an additional revenue source for farmers and forest land owners.\n  Thirty-eight industrialized countries account for one-half of the \ncarbon released into the atmosphere. The U.S., all alone, accounts for \none-quarter of the total carbon released into the atmosphere. This \ncountry cannot afford to be a bystander on the climate change issue, \nand yet two days ago the headlines read: ``Climate Agreement Leaves \nU.S. Out in the Cold;'' ``Isolated on Global Warming;'' ``178 Nations \nReach Climate Accord; U.S. Only Looks On.'' I am convinced that it is \npossible to put together a bipartisan alternative to inaction. I \nstarted that process with the Forest Resources for the Environment and \nEconomy Act. Today, I continue that process with Senator Brownback as \nwe introduce The Carbon Sequestration and Reporting Act.\n  We cannot afford to sit out this debate as it goes on around us. It \ncosts between $2 and $20 per ton to store carbon in trees and soil but \nalternative strategies such as emissions reductions can cost up to $100 \nper ton. Sequestering carbon in forests and soil is a scientifically \nsound and cost-effective strategy that can reduce carbon dioxide levels \nby up to 50 percent. My approach has been to use trees for carbon \nsequestration; Senator Brownback's approach has been to sequester \ncarbon in agricultural soil. Our legislation joins the best of both \nthese approaches.\n  I am not saying that carbon sequestration should be the only tool in \nour toolbox. We need all the tools available to address the enormous \nissue of global climate change. But we believe this approach, this \nbill, will provide a jump start to a stalled political process. Carbon \nsequestration is a technology that can begin working right now, today, \nto reduce the negative effects of climate change.\n  Investing in healthy forests today is an investment in the well-being \nof our\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\nplanet for decades to come. In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more \nthan critical environmental resources, they are also a cornerstone of \nour economy. The same is true for agriculture. Last year, in Oregon \nalone, agriculture accounted for over $3 billion in trade and business \nrevenues. Investing in improved land management and conservation to \noffset greenhouse gases is a win for the environment, a win for \nagriculture and a win for local economies.\n  According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United \nStates are only storing one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately \nstore. Just tapping a portion of this potential by expanding and \nincreasing the productivity of the Nation's 737 million acres of \nforests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow global \nwarming. The forestry component of this bill works through a revolving \nloan fund for private, non-industrial landowners to be used to plant \ntrees for carbon sequestration and conservation purposes. The forestry \nloans are not limited by time, but can be forgiven if the landowner \ndecides to institute a permanent easement on his or her land for the \npurposes of conservation and carbon sequestration. This bill also takes \nan important first step toward sequestering greenhouse gases on Federal \nlands: it directs the Forest Service to report to Congress on options \nto increase carbon storage in our national forests.\n  The agriculture portion of the bill will encourage landowners to \noffer the best plans detailing practices they would be willing to \nundertake to store additional carbon in the soil. The program is \nlimited to 5 million acres, and is not a set aside. Rather, this bill \nencourages conservation practices like no-till, buffer strips and \nbiomass production, to name a few, which are known to enhance soils' \nability to store carbon. Using funding similar to current CRP payments, \nthe agricultural contracts under this bill would be for a minimum of 10 \nyears and USDA would be required--in conjunction with other agencies--\nto finalize criteria for measuring the carbon-storing ability of \nvarious conservation practices.\n  We know these types of approaches work because of the leadership of \nour home states in carbon sequestration practice and research: Oregon \nfor forestry and agriculture and Kansas for agriculture. The objectives \nof this bill will be greatly aided by institutions like Oregon State \nUniversity and Kansas State University, who are already conducting \nsignificant research on various carbon-storing practices.\n  This bill also makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of \n1992: it would strengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of \ngreenhouse gas reductions from forestry and agricultural activities. \nThe bill directs the Secretary of Energy to develop new guidelines on \naccurate and cost-effective methods to account for and report real and \ncredible greenhouse gas reductions. These guidelines are absolutely \nnecessary because without them we could be doing all the environmental \ngood in the world, but we have no record of it and, therefore, no \nconcept of the progress we would have made. The guidelines will be \ndeveloped with the input of a new Advisory Council representing \nagriculture, industry, foresters, States, and environmental groups.\n  As in the last Congress, the forestry portion of the bill will pay \nfor itself by using money that polluters pay when they are caught \nviolating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act as there are currently \nno guarantees that these penalties, which revert to the General Fund, \nare used to improve our environment, but our bill would put the \npenalties toward this goal. We would use these fines to expand our \nforests, protect streams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases \nfrom the air. The agricultural portion of this bill will be paid for by \nconservation appropriations to the USDA.\n  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. \nIt's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable \nforestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for \nrural communities. For these reasons, the forestry portion of this bill \nhas already received positive reactions from timber companies and \nenvironmental organizations alike, including the National Association \nof State Foresters and the Society of American Foresters, American \nForest and Paper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense, \nGovernor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, PacifiCorp, The Nature \nConservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust. The agricultural portion of \nthis bill has received positive reactions from many of these same \ngroups.\n  I look forward to pursuing this common-sense step toward protecting \nthe environment and supporting our forest workers and agricultural \ninterests.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nthe Carbon Sequestration and Reporting Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill is a combination of two previously \n     introduced bills, S. 820 and S. 785, introduced by Senators \n     Wyden and Brownback respectively.\n       Title I: Carbon Advisory Council: Guidelines for Accurate \n     Carbon Accounting for Forests. The bill directs the Secretary \n     of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the \n     Forest Service, to establish scientifically-based guidelines \n     for accurate reporting, monitoring, and verification of \n     carbon storage from forest management actions. The bill \n     establishes a multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory \n     Council to assist USDA in developing the guidelines.\n       Title II: Forest Carbon Management: State Revolving Loan \n     Programs/Cooperative Agreements. The bill provides assistance \n     to plant and manage underproducing or understocked forests to \n     increase carbon sequestration by authorizing a state-run \n     revolving loan program. Assistance is provided through \n     Cooperative Agreements with State or local governments, \n     American Indian Tribes, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and \n     private-nonprofit entities; or through loans to nonindustrial \n     private forest landowners. The Federal share of funding for \n     Cooperative Agreements and the loan program will come from \n     penalties that are being assessed against violators of the \n     Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act (civil penalties \n     assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45 million).\n       Title III: Carbon Sequestration Program: Agriculture \n     Conservation Program. The bill authorizes USDA contracts for \n     a minimum of 10 years for farmers who wish to conserve land, \n     improve water quality and sequester carbon by employing \n     conservation practices, like no-till farming and the use of \n     buffer strips to enhance carbon sequestration. The USDA would \n     be required--in conjunction with other agencies--to finalize \n     criteria for measuring the carbon-storing ability of various \n     conservation practices. This bill allows farmers to submit \n     plans on how they would store carbon on their land. \n     Landowners already employing carbon-conservation practices \n     would also be eligible. Participation in this program is \n     completely voluntary, and is limited to 20 million total \n     acres at a maximum $20 per acre.\n       Title IV Reports: Report on Options to Increase Carbon \n     Storage on Federal Lands: The bill directs the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, through the Forest Service, to report to \n     Congress on forestry options to increase carbon storage in \n     the National Forest System. Forestry and Agriculture \n     Reporting: This bill will provide for a documented carbon \n     database reported by participants to the Administrator of \n     Energy Information Administration. The Administrator shall \n     develop forms to keep track of both domestic and \n     international sequestration gains. This data will provide a \n     road map for dealing with climate change through independent \n     carbon market offsets in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dayton, \n        Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Reid, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Schumer,\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Thompson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and \n        Mr. Carper):\n  S. 1256. A bill to provide for the reauthorization of the breast \ncancer research special postage stamp, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and \nmyself and 71 other Senate cosponsors, I rise today to offer \nlegislation to extend the life of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for \nan additional six years.\n  I was surprised by the U.S. Postal Service's recent rule-making which \ncould possibly terminate the Breast Cancer Research Stamp program by \nnext July. The Postal Service effectively decided to permit only one \nstamp to be issued at a time to raise funds for a specific cause.\n  This rule would therefore force competition for survival among a \nnumber of other potential and worthy fund-raising stamps. This action \nwould be a terrible mistake.\n  The Breast Cancer Research Stamp has demonstrated itself to be a \nhighly effective and self-supporting fund-raiser.\n  To date, the stamp has raised $21.1 million for research in addition \nto the $60,000 the Postal Service has recovered for administrative \ncosts.\n  Every year the stamp has existed, it has generated strong consumer \nsales. In two months of operation in fiscal year 1998, consumers bought \n9.2 million stamps, generating $700,000 for research on net sales of \n$3.68 million.\n  In fiscal year 1999, consumers bought 101.2 million stamps, yielding \n7.5 million for research on net sales of $40.48 million.\n  In fiscal year 2000, consumers purchased 119.9 million stamps, \ngarnering $8 million for research on net sales of $47.96 million.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the program continues to be vital. With two \nmonths remaining, consumers have already bought 75.2 million stamps, \nraising $4.8 million for research on sales of $30.08 million.\n  In total, the American people have purchased 305 million Breast \nCancer Research stamps. This means that, on average, more than one \nstamp has been purchased for every citizen in our Nation and 100 \nmillion stamps were sold per year since the stamp was first introduced \nin August 1998.\n  Clearly, the program continues to have a strong and committed \ncustomer base.\n  We should also recognize that the National Cancer Institute and the \nDepartment of Defense have put these research dollars to good use by \nfunding novel and innovative research in the area of breast cancer.\n  According to Dr. Richard Klausner, National Cancer Institute \ndirector, these awards benefit ``over a dozen critical areas of breast \ncancer research.''\n  Millions of Americans have bought the stamps to honor loved ones with \nthe disease, to highlight their own personal battle with breast cancer, \nor to promote general public awareness. Virtually everywhere I travel, \npeople tell me they buy the stamps in the hopes of helping to find a \ncure.\n  Moreover, one cannot calculate in dollars or cents the value the \nstamp has played in increasing the visibility of the disease and the \nneed for additional research funding.\n  The life of such an extraordinary program should not prematurely end \nbecause of an administrative decision.\n  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far \nreaching effects on our nation: breast cancer remains the leading cause \nof cancer among women. In 2001, approximately 192,200 women will get \nbreast cancer. This year 40,200 women will die from breast cancer. \nBreast cancer represents 31 percent of all new cancers faced by women. \nApproximately 3 million women in the United States are living with \nbreast cancer. Of these individuals, 2 million know they have the \ndisease, and 1 million remain unaware of their condition.\n  We have learned over the past few years how effective the Breast \nCancer Research Stamp is at promoting public awareness of the disease. \nYet, we still must reach out to the one million American women who do \nnot know of their cancer.\n  Some may argue that the Breast Cancer Stamp should end so that other \nsemi-postal stamps can have their turn at raising funds for a cause.\n  But it is a faulty premise that only one semi-postal stamp can \nsucceed at a time. I believe there is room for multiple fund-raising \nstamps at the same time.\n  Every year, the Postal Service issues dozens of commemorative steps. \nIn 2001, for example, the Postal Service sold stamps commemorating \ntopics as various as diabetes awareness, Black Heritage, and military \nveterans. Many of these stamps have sold extraordinarily well.\n  The viability of a postage stamp depends on its appeal to postal \ncustomers. Over a three year period, the Breast Cancer Research has \ndemonstrated a sustained and committed customer base.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation \nto grant the Breast Cancer Stamp another six years.

Res. 139\n\n       Whereas the use of illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol \n     and nicotine constitute the greatest threats to the well-\n     being of the Nation's children;\n       Whereas surveys conducted by the National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University have \n     consistently found that children and teenagers who routinely \n     eat dinner with their families are far less likely to use \n     illegal drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol;\n       Whereas teenagers who virtually never eat dinner with their \n     families are 72 percent more likely than the average teenager \n     to use illegal drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes;\n       Whereas teenagers who almost always eat dinner with their \n     families are 31 percent less likely than the average teenager \n     to use illegal drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes;\n       Whereas the correlation between family dinners and reduced \n     risk for teenage substance abuse are well-documented;\n       Whereas parental influence is known to be 1 of the most \n     crucial factors in determining the likelihood of substance \n     abuse by teenagers; and\n       Whereas family dinners have long constituted a pillar of \n     family life in America: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 24, 2001, as ``Family Day--A Day \n     to Eat Dinner With Your Children'';\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\n       (2) recognizes that eating dinner as a family is an \n     important step toward raising drug-free children; and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon--\n       (A) the parents of the children of the United States to \n     observe the day by eating dinner with their children; and\n       (B) the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President I rise today with my colleague Senator \nGrassley to introduce a resolution to designate Monday, September 24, \n2001 as ``Family Day: A Day to Eat Dinner With Your Children.'' A \nsimilar resolution has been introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Representative Rangel.\n  Last year, the Senate passed the first Family Day resolution. Since \nthat time, a number of States have followed suit. The Governors of \nseveral States--including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, \nMaine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, and South Carolina, \nhave already issued Family Day proclamations and additional States are \nexpected to do so in the near future. Family Day has been endorsed by \nthe National Family Partnership, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National Fatherhood Initiative, \nthe National Restaurant Association, Join Together, the National \nCouncil on Family Relations, and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of \nAmerica. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is also urging its member \nchambers to adopt Family Day.\n  The idea for the resolution grew out of research done by The National \nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA, a \nNew York-based research organization led by former Secretary of Health \nEducation and Welfare Joseph A Califano, Jr. Among CASA's many projects \nis an annual survey of the attitudes of teens and their parents on \nissues related to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.\n  In its past three surveys, CASA has found that the more often a child \neats dinner with his or her parents, the less likely that child is to \nuse addictive substances. The results from the 1999 survey were the \nmost striking, revealing that teens who almost always eat dinner with \ntheir families are 31 percent less likely than the average teen to \nsmoke, drink or use illegal drugs and that teens who virtually never \neat dinner with their families are 72 percent more likely to engage in \nthese activities.\n  Of course, having dinner as a family is just a proxy for spending \ntime with kids. It is not the meat, potatoes and vegetables that alter \na child's likelihood to use drugs. It is the everyday time spent with \nmom and dad, the two most important role models in most kids lives.\n  I do not believe that this resolution will be the silver bullet to \nsolving this Nation's drug problem. But I do feel these statistics are \ntelling. CASA President Joe Califano talks about ``Parent Power.'' It \nis important that parents know the power they have over their \nchildren's decisions and the power that they have to deter kids from \ndrinking, smoking or using drugs. For example, nearly half of the teens \nwho have never used marijuana say that it was lessons learned from \ntheir parents that helped them to say no.\n  Unfortunately, many parents are pessimistic about their ability to \nkeep their kids drug-free; forty-five percent admit that they are \nresigned to the fact that their child will use an illegal drug in the \nfuture.\n  This pessimism is often reinforced by news reports that indicate that \nwhile most parents say that they have talked to their kids about the \ndangers of drugs, only a minority of teens recall the discussion. \nRather than be discouraged by this apparent disconnect, I think it \nshould teach us an important lesson: that talking to kids about drugs \nought not just be a one-time conversation. Rather, it must be an \nongoing discussion.\n  Keeping up on children's lives, including knowing who their friends \nare and what they are doing after school, is critical. The experts tell \nus that some of the telltale signs that a child is drinking or using \nillicit drugs include behavior changes, change in social circle, lack \nof interest in hobbies and isolation from family. These changes can be \nsubtle; picking up on them requires a watchful eye.\n  Eating dinner as a family will not guarantee that a child will remain \ndrug-free. But family dinners are an important way for parents to \ninstill their values in their children as well as remain connected with \nthe challenges that children face and help them learn how to cope with \nproblems and pressures without resorting to smoking, drinking or using \ndrugs.\n  I sincerely hope that all of my colleagues join me to support this \nresolution and send a message to parents that they can play a powerful \nrole in shaping the decisions their kids make regarding drinking, \nsmoking and drug use.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Biden in introducing a bi-partisan resolution designating \nSeptember 24, 2001 as ``Family Day: A Day to Eat Dinner With Your \nChildren.'' This resolution recognizes the benefits of eating dinner as \na family, especially as a way to keep children from using illegal \ndrugs, tobacco, and alcohol.\n  Many of us here in this Chamber are parents, and some of us are even \ngrand parents. We know the trials and difficulties of raising children. \nBut we also know the rewards, as a father, one of my proudest moments \nis seeing the success of my children as they raise their own families. \nWhat I know, what many parents have come to realize, and what we are \ntrying to emphasize through Family Day, is spending time with your \nchildren, having dinner with them regularly, is one of the best ways to \ndevelop and maintain a healthy family, and encourage our children to \nmake healthy choices.\n  Senator Biden spoke about the most recent survey from the National \nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse. And those are scary numbers, \nbut also hopeful ones. Kids listen. Teens do recognize what their \nparents say. They see what their parents do. Communication is the key \nto all of this, and communication at the dinner table is a wonderful \nplace for this to happen. All of this shows how essential it is for \nparents to get involved in their children's lives.\n  The family unit is the backbone of this country. Solutions to our \ndrug problems involve all of us working together. Parents and \ncommunities must be engaged and I am committed to help making that \nhappen. Parents need to provide a strong moral context to help our \nyoung people know how to make the right choices. They need to know how \nto say ``no,'' that saying no is okay, that saying no to drugs is the \nright thing to do--not just the safe or healthier thing, but the right \nthing.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Biden, the National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of \nAmerica, and the National Restaurant Association in designating \nSeptember 24, 2001, as ``Family Day: a Day to Eat Dinner With Your \nChildren.'' I urge our colleagues to join us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/26/senate-section/article/S8293-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 61--TO WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF THE \nLEGISLATIVE REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1970 WHICH REQUIRE THE ADJOURNMENT OF \n                   THE HOUSE AND SENATE BY JULY 31ST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

and\n       (H) measures are in place in the NAFTA country, similar to \n     those in place in the United States, to ensure the effective \n     enforcement and monitoring of license revocation and \n     licensing procedures.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1172.
