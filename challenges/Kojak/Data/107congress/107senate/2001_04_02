The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been a long and interesting \ndebate, and before I begin my final remarks I would like to thank my \nsuperb staff, the senior member of which is Tam Somerville. Now staff \ndirector of the Rules Committee, she is a long-time veteran of these \nwars going back to the filibusters of 1988--a good friend and a great \ncolleague. I thank her for her outstanding work over the years on this \nsubject. And Hunter Bates, my chief of staff, has done superb work on \nthis and a great many other matters\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nover the years, and an old friend going back well over a decade. And \nnew members of the team: Andrew Siff, the general counsel of the Rules \nCommittee, who Senator McCain and I would have to agree sort of staffed \nboth sides at times during this debate and did an outstanding job; \nBrian Lewis, also of the Rules Committee, and John Abegg of my staff, \nwho have been marvelous in this whole debate.\n  Now, Mr. President, the theory of this bill, the underlying theory, \nis that there is too much money in politics, in spite of the fact that \nlast year Americans spent more on potato chips than they did on \npolitics.\n  Then the other theory of the bill is, well, if we can't squeeze all \nthe money out of politics, at least we can get at that odious soft \nmoney. Well, I think it is important for our colleagues to know that \nthe average soft money contribution to the Republican Senatorial \nCommittee last year was $520. That is about one-tenth of 1 percent of \nthe total amount of money we raised. The largest contribution to either \nthe Republican National Committee or the Republican Senatorial \nCommittee was $250,000. Admittedly, that is a lot of money, but any one \nof those donations would only have amounted to one-half of 1 percent of \nwhat was raised by the committees.\n\n  Now if we were concerned about the appearance of a large \ncontribution, we had an opportunity to address that when we had a vote \non the Hagel amendment which would have capped non-Federal money, just \nas for many years we have capped Federal money. But, no, the Senate \nopted for prohibition, not moderation. Now we know what has happened \nwhen we have gone down that path before with prohibition. Of course, \nnothing would be prohibited.\n  We had an opportunity to recognize that there is nothing inherently \nevil about non-Federal money and that the only issue really the Senate \nwas trying to address was the size of the contributions; we could have \ndealt with that in the Hagel amendment, but that was defeated.\n  Now other countries, many of them allies of ours, unburdened by the \nFirst Amendment, have squeezed the money all the way out of politics. A \ngood example of that is the Japanese. The Japanese have gotten all the \nmoney out of politics.\n  Let me tell you what it is like to run for office in Japan. The \nGovernment determines how many days you can campaign, the number of \nspeeches you can give, the places you can speak, the number of \nhandbills or bumper stickers you can hand out, and the number of \nmegaphones you get--one, one megaphone per candidate. This was all in \nresponse to the need, it was widely perceived, to get money out of \npolitics so people's view of the Parliament would go up.\n  Well, after passing all of these draconian measures, now 70 percent \nof the Japanese people have no confidence in the legislature and \nturnout continues to decline. So it is obvious that had no impact \nwhatsoever.\n  What we have done here, in an effort to get money out of politics, is \nto take the parties out of politics, as I pointed out last week, and \nlet me briefly touch again on what we have done.\n  In a 100-percent hard money world, this would be the impact on the \nparty committees. Looking at the last cycle, last year, if you just \napplied the current system, the Republican National Committee had $75 \nmillion in net hard money to spend on its candidates; under McCain-\nFeingold, it would have had $37 million. The Democratic National \nCommittee under the current system had $48 million net hard money for \ncandidate efforts; under McCain-Feingold, it would have had $20 \nmillion. The Republican Senatorial Committee had net hard money to \nspend on candidates of $14 million; under McCain-Feingold, it would \nhave had $1 million. The Democratic Senatorial Committee had $6 million \nhard money; under McCain-Feingold, it would have had $800,000. And over \non the House side--a real disaster. Under the current law, the \nRepublican Congressional Committee had $22 million net hard money; the \nDemocratic committee over in the House, minus $7 million. Under McCain-\nFeingold both of them would have been substantially below water: $13 \nmillion in the case of the congressional committee on the Republican \nside and $20 million on the Democratic side.\n  In a 100-percent hard money world, as defined by McCain-Feingold, \nwhat we will do is take none of the money out of politics; we will just \ntake the parties out of politics. And when we take the parties out of \npolitics, what is the impact of that? Parties are the one entity in \nAmerica that will support a challenger. Parties are filters. They will \nsupport a Republican whether he is a liberal Republican or a \nconservative Republican. Interest groups won't always do that. Parties \nwill go to bat for their members no matter what.\n  If we look at the upcoming 2002 cycle, the coordinated expenditure \nlimit for Senate campaigns will be $15 million. Applying the new \nMcCain-Feingold standard, the Republican Senatorial Committee and \nDemocratic Senatorial Committee will be able to fund the coordinated \nexpenditures in North Carolina. That is about it.\n  In addition to that, in this new world with substantially fewer \nFederal hard dollars, the national committees will have to do a lot \nmore. To provide some examples: All the redistricting efforts by both \nnational parties will have to be paid for with 100-percent hard \ndollars; new responsibilities paid for with 100-percent hard dollars. \nAll national party get out the vote, voter registration and voter \nidentification efforts will have to be paid for with 100-percent hard \ndollars. Any support from national party committees to State and local \ncandidates will have to be 100-percent hard dollars. I would venture to \nsay that the national conventions, which the press has declared boring \nfor some time now, are probably a thing of the past.\n  Host committees for national conventions are abolished. Last year it \ntook each party $80 million to put on their national conventions. They \ngot $15 million from the Treasury. All the rest of it was this odious \nsoft money which is going to be abolished. In order to continue to put \non the national conventions in hard dollars, the two committees will \nhave to come up with about $60 million each in hard dollars to put on \nthe national conventions.\n  My guess is they will decide they might as well let the national \nconventions become a relic of the past because they will not be able to \nafford to put on the conventions and also help the candidates. Given \nthat choice, they clearly will want to help the candidates. The \nconventions may or may not happen again or they may be very short, \nmaybe a half-day convention. I recommend they come to Louisville, KY. I \nthink we could handle the size of the convention now. We haven't been \nable to apply for it in the past.\n  In addition to that, McCain-Feingold is so sweeping it is likely to \npreclude Senators from raising money for churches and charities because \nthere is written into the bill an effort to restrict the ability to \nraise money for 501(c)s. A query: Will Senator McCain or myself be able \nto raise money for the International Republican Institute or Senator \nKennedy raise money for the Special Olympics? I doubt it.\n  In addition to that, there is a very serious question of what to do \nwith the soft money already raised. Both parties are having their \ndinners this year as if everything is pretty much the same. Typically \nat these party dinners, about 80 percent of the dollars raised are \nsoft. Under McCain-Feingold, not one penny of soft money in any account \ncontrolled by either a Member of Congress or a national party committee \ncan be directed to, donated to, transferred to, or spent. Let me say \nthis again: All the non-Federal money already collected is going to be \ndead money. You can't do anything with it. You can't direct it. You \ncan't donate it. You can't transfer it. You can't spend it. As I read \nthat, it couldn't be transferred to a State party, donated to a \ncharity, or even directed to the U.S. Treasury. So it is going to sit \nthere, frozen, useless assets.\n\n  Who wins?\n  As I said the other day, who wins are people such as Jerome Kohlberg. \nThis is the billionaire who has decided this is going to be his legacy. \nThis is the full page ad he ran in the Washington Post the other day on \nbehalf of this legislation. I suspect a lot of the lobbyists out in the \nhall right off the Senate floor are either on his payroll directly or \nindirectly. People such as Jerome Kohlberg and the big charitable \nfoundations are underwriting the reform\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\nmovement, hand in hand with the editorial pages of the Washington Post \nand the New York Times, which have editorialized on this subject an \naverage of once every 6 days over the last 27 months.\n  At least in the Senate, they are going to get their way shortly, but \nthis new world won't take a penny out of politics, not a penny. It will \nall be spent. It just won't be spent by the parties. It will be spent \nby the Jerome Kohlbergs of the world and all of the interest groups out \nthere. As everyone knows, the restrictions on those interest groups \nwill be struck down in court, if we get that far.\n  Welcome to the brave new world where the voices of parties are \nquieted, the voices of billionaires are enhanced, the voices of \nnewspapers are enhanced, and the one entity out there in America, the \ncore of the two-party system, that influence is dramatically reduced.\n  I strongly urge our colleagues to vote against this legislation. It \nclearly moves in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side be \nextended an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Chair notify me when I have \nconsumed 2 minutes.\n  The Senate today is taking long awaited action to approve legislation \nto address what the American people have come to believe is the single \nmost egregious abuse of our campaign finance system. That is the \nunlimited flow of soft money. If the McCain-Feingold legislation did \nnothing else but close the soft money loophole, this is true reform and \nneeded reform.\n  My colleagues have accomplished much more. I congratulate Senators \nMcCain and Feingold for their vision in recognizing the powerfully \nnegative influence that the money chase has had on our political \nsystem. I also congratulate their dogged persistence over these past \nnumber of years, and patience, in striving to craft a consensus on \nreform legislation that seeks to address the worst aspects of the \ncurrent system.\n  I thank the Democratic leader Tom Daschle. No Member has done more or \nbeen more consistent in their support of this legislation or worked \nharder behind the scenes to hold the Democratic caucus together in \nsupport of this measure. Without those votes on the Democratic side, \nthis matter would not become law.\n  I have been privileged and honored to serve as floor manager of this \nbill, along with the Senator from Kentucky. I thank my staff, Kennie \nGill, Andrea LaRue, and others, along with the staff of my friend from \nKentucky, for the very fine job they have done.\n  This has been a good debate. It has been one of the finer moments in \nthe Senate.\n  One final point, the great Justice Learned Hand once spoke of liberty \nas the great equalizer among men. In his words:\n\n       The spirit of liberty is the . . . lesson . . . (mankind) \n     has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there \n     may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and \n     considered side by side with the greatest.\n\n  That should be the ultimate test of whether any matter considered by \nthis body is worthy of our support. The McCain-Feingold bill passes \nthat very noble test.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, improving the campaign finance system is \nan important priority. Without a doubt constructive criticism works to \nhelp cleanse the system. More importantly, good debate helps reduce \npublic cynicism. That is why I would like to commend my colleagues for \nthe good discussions we have had in the past 2 weeks.\n  My goals for campaign finance reform have long included improved \ncitizen participation, enhanced public discourse, full public \ndisclosure and safeguarding the right of Americans to organize and \npetition their government. To accomplish these objectives, I want \nreform to give individuals a bigger role in the political process, \nincrease up-front participation of political parties, protect corporate \nshareholders and union members from being forced to bankroll candidates \nthey oppose, discourage misconduct by political campaigns with swift \nand sure punishment, and require full public disclosure of contribution \nsources.\n  Therefore, in evaluating any campaign finance legislation I ask \nmyself, does this bill accomplish these goals?\n  I believe that we made progress with the McCain-Feingold bill by \nproviding for greater disclosure such as requiring all television and \nradio stations to include in their ``public file'' all media buys for \nall political advertising, by requiring additional disclosure for \nFederal candidates and national political parties, and requiring the \nFederal Election Commission to provide the information on the Internet \nwithin a reasonable amount of time. I also believe that it was prudent \nof us to increase the individual hard money contribution limit set back \nin 1974. Furthermore, we increased the penalties for election law \nviolators.\n  On the other hand, I was disappointed that the Senate failed to agree \nto several amendments that I feel would have been good reform. Such \namendments were those to provide disclosure and consent to corporate \nshareholders and union members regarding the use of their funds for \npolitical activities and the effort to limit soft money, instead of a \ncomplete ban which will likely be thrown out by the Courts.\n  However, there is a more egregious problem with this legislation. \nThis bill fails to protect an individual's right to organize and \npetition their government and engage in full public disclosure.\n  Virtually every American has a ``special interest,'' whether its \nlower taxes, endangered species, education, or international trade \nagreements. To get individual voices heard above the din of American \npolitics, individuals organize to exercise their first amendment rights \nof free speech. However, this McCain-Feingold bill severely restricts \nthe groups which average citizens join to express themselves: issue \nadvocacy groups and political parties. Therefore, wealthy individuals \nand the media have a larger role in the political process and the \nindividual role is diminished.\n  I would like to point out three specific ways the McCain-Feingold \nbill violates our first amendments rights: 1. Issue Advocacy--This bill \nimposes limits on communications about issues regardless of whether the \ncommunication ``expressly advocates'' the election or defeat of a \nparticular candidate and restricts the time that issue advocacy \ncommunications can be distributed. 2. Coordination--This legislation \ngrossly expands the concept of coordinated activity between candidates \nand citizen groups. This regulates and prohibits all but the most \ninsignificant contacts and actions from citizen groups as a \n``contribution'' or ``expenditure'' to a specific campaign. 3. \nPolitical Parties--This reform measure limits the role of political \nparties to simply electing politicians. The restrictions on soft money \nrestrict political parties in their ability to support grassroots \nactivity, candidate recruitment and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n  In the 21st Century, it's easy to forget that America's Founding \nFathers sacrificed all to give Americans political freedom. These \npatriots fought and risked their lives and everything they had to \nsecure and protect free political speech, dissent or assent, of all \nkinds. Free political speech protects us from tyranny.\n  The first amendment forbids Congress to make any law ``abridging the \nfreedom of speech,'' especially political speech. I swore to uphold the \nConstitution. Therefore, I cannot vote for a bill that I believe \nviolates our first amendments rights.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 27, the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001. I have been a consistent \nsupporter and cosponsor of campaign finance reform because I believe we \nmust do everything we can to ensure that there is not even a perception \nof undue influence in Federal elections.\n  The debate of the last 2 weeks has provided us with a unique \nopportunity to examine a wide range of issues related to the financing \nof political campaigns. The result is a bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport. This landmark legislation, if signed into law, will succeed in \nbanning soft or unregulated money in Federal elections. The unlimited\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nflow of money into party coffers creates the greatest opportunity for \nspecial interests to seek favor with politicians. The reality that \nbusinesses or organizations can be tapped for such vast sums has \ndramatically changed the atmosphere surrounding the work of our \nlegislative and executive branches of Government.\n  With this legislation, we are also finally getting at one of the most \ntroublesome areas of unregulated and unreported spending in Federal \nelections, so-called sham issue ads. This legislation does not ban \nissue advocacy or limit the right of groups to air their views. Rather, \nthe disclosure provisions in the bill require that these groups step up \nand identify themselves when they run issue ads which are clearly \ntargeted for or against candidates.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 has left us \nwith the difficult task of devising a system of financing campaigns \nwithout suppressing free speech. Our Founding Fathers were resolute in \ntheir defense of speech and we must continue to protect the first \namendment right. We do so, however, with the understanding that we must \nreconcile free speech with a competing public interest. This interest, \nas articulated in Buckley v. Valeo, is preventing corruption of Federal \nelected officials or even the appearance of corruption. Let me be \nclear, I do not believe that our system is corrupt or that elected \nofficials are corrupted by campaign contributions. However, I agree \nthat we must combat the perception of corruption.\n  It isn't difficult to understand why a majority of American citizens \nare convinced that the presence of special interest money in politics \nbuys influence. The vast majority of those citizens do not participate \nin contributing to political candidates--in a recent survey, 6 percent \nof the electorate said they gave any money to a political candidate and \nless than one-tenth of one percent even contribute at the current \n$1,000 contribution limit--so it is no wonder that most Americans \nbelieve that they can't compete with the few who do give and who often \ngain access as a result. Many Americans believe that their voices are \nnot heard.\n  Whether the presence of unlimited political contributions is \ncorrupting or whether it just creates the appearance of corruption, the \ndamage is done. Americans are disaffected with politics and political \ncampaigns and have voted against the current system with their feet: \nFor decades we've seen a gradual decline in voter turnout. In 1952, \nabout 63 percent of eligible voters came out to vote. That number \ndropped to 49 percent in the 1996 election. We saw a minor increase in \nthis past election with voter turnout at 51 percent of eligible voters, \nhowever, not a significant increase given the closeness of the \nelection. Non-Presidential year voter turnout is even more abysmal.\n  Our representative democracy is harmed by eroding participation. As \nelected officials, we have a responsibility to try to address the \nsources of voter disaffection. And, that is ultimately what campaign \nfinance reform is all about, restoring the confidence of the American \npeople in our elected government.\n  I am keenly aware of how fortunate I am to be able to finance my own \ncampaigns. I do not accept contributions from political action \ncommittees and I am not burdened with the task of raising vast amounts \nof money to run for office. However, during debate on this bill I was \nwilling to support amendments which would help level the playing field \nfor all candidates. That is why I supported the DeWine amendment which \nraised the contribution limits for candidates whose opponents spend \ntheir own money to fund their campaigns. That is also why I was willing \nto support the Thompson-Feinstein amendment to increase contribution \nlimits in a reasonable way, beyond the limits set back in the \nseventies. And that is why I supported the Torricelli amendment to give \npolitical candidates the opportunity to buy advertising time at the \nlowest unit cost, as originally intended in the Federal Election \nCampaign Act.\n  It is my hope that this legislation is signed into law. I fear if \nthis bill becomes bogged down in a conference or if the President \nvetoes it, we will have missed a rare opportunity to achieve meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. The unprecedented time we have spent debating \nthis issue--and a wonderful debate it has been, fast-paced and \nunscripted--will not be repeated any time soon.\n  Finally, I want to commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ \nFeingold. He has been dogged in his pursuit of campaign finance reform. \nFor 5 years now, he has championed this issue, even when it was not \nalways popular with his colleagues. He has forged a potent partnership \nwith Senator McCain and they have waged a campaign across the country \nand in the Senate to rally the American people for the reforms we are \nadopting today. While he has been unbending in his desire to move this \nforward, he has also compromised and adjusted so that we could address \nthe worst abuses of the system. He has earned the respect of all \nWisconsinites for his leadership on campaign finance reform.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to vote to overhaul \nour nation's campaign finance system. The McCain-Feingold legislation \nrepresents a step forward that is long overdue. In recent years, it has \nbecome clear that our campaign finance system is broken. There's too \nmuch money in elections. It's too hard for average citizens to be \nheard. Their voices are being drowned out by big-money special \ninterests and wealthy contributors. It's getting harder for citizens of \naverage means to run for office. The system is too secretive. There are \nundisclosed groups giving money and trying to influence elections with \nno sunshine and no public disclosure. And especially after this last \nelection, many people are wondering if their vote will count. As a \nresult, Americans are cynical about elections and aren't participating. \nWe need to turn that around.\n  Ever since I came to the Senate, I've fought for campaign finance \nreform. I've consistently voted to get the Senate to debate campaign \nfinance reform. In 1997, I served on the Leadership Task Force on \nCampaign Reform. In 1998, I offered an amendment for full disclosure. \nAnd in my own reelection campaign in 1998, I went above and beyond the \nlegal requirements, and I disclosed everyone who supported me, whether \nthey contributed $5 or $500.\n  Given the problems in the system, I developed a set of principles for \nreform that have guided my decisions throughout this debate. My \nprinciples for reform are: First, there should be less money in \npolitics. Second, I want to make sure that average voters aren't \ndrowned-out by special interests or the wealthy. Third, we must demand \nfar more disclosure from those who work to influence elections. When \nvoters see an ad on TV or get a flyer in the mail, they should know who \npaid for it. There must be disclosure for telephone calls and voter \nguides. Citizens have a right to know who's trying to influence them. \nWe've seen a disturbing increase in the number of issue ads, which are \noften negative attack ads. Too often, voters have no idea who's \nbankrolling these ads. Voters deserve to know and that is why I have \ncalled for far greater disclosure. Fourth, we need to keep elections \nopen to all Americans. We need to ensure that average citizens not just \nmillionaires can run for office. When I ran for the Senate in 1992, the \nmost I'd ever earned was $23,000 a year. I wasn't a millionaire. I \nwasn't a celebrity, but I was able to run for office and win a seat in \nthe Senate because the system was open to anyone. That's getting more \ndifficult today. Finally, we need to make it easier, not harder, for \npeople to vote. We need to make sure that when citizens vote their \nvotes are counted.\n  The bill now before the Senate makes some progress toward the \nprinciples I've outlined. I am disappointed this legislation does not \ngo further. Some amendments have strengthened the bill. Other \namendments, including raising the limits on hard money, have weakened \nthe bill. The hard money limit in particular will inject more money \ninto politics at a time when I, and most Americans, want to reduce the \namount of money in politics. This bill also has the potential to give a \ndisproportionately larger role in elections to third party \norganizations. I'd rather see citizens and candidates have a stronger \nvoice than third party organizations.\n  I know my colleagues recognize that this is a carefully balanced \nbill. If, at some point in the future, the courts invalidate some \nportion of this bill, Congress should return to the legislation\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\nto restore the balance of fairness in our nation's elections laws. \nCampaign finance reform should not be a gift to either party, but \nshould instead return our democracy to its rightful owners, the \nAmerican people.\n  Before I close I would like to remind my colleagues that our work on \nelection reform is far from completed. Unfortunately, this legislation \ndoes nothing to ensure that every citizen's vote counts in an election, \nsomething that is sorely needed in the wake of the Presidential \nelection. If Congress is to truly restore the people's faith in our \nelection system, we must ensure that every vote counts. On that matter, \nthis legislation stands silent.\n  On the whole, however, this bill is a significant step forward. It \nshould help restore citizens' faith in our electoral process. It also \nillustrates the Senate's ability to address issues of concern to the \nAmerican people.\n  I cast my vote in favor of this much-needed reform.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to take a few moments to explain why I \nwill oppose S. 27 on final passage. At the outset, however, I want to \ncongratulate my colleague John McCain for bringing this matter to a \nsuccessful conclusion in the Senate. He has fought long and hard to get \nto this point.\n  If this bill becomes law, we know that the Supreme Court will have \nthe final say as to its constitutionality. Few doubt that the bill at \nleast raises issues about the fundamental liberties guaranteed in the \nFirst Amendment. Having taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, I \ncannot vote for a bill I believe the courts are almost certain to \nstrike down. Both the restrictions on issue advocacy contained in Title \nII of this bill, and the bill's total ban on soft money contributions \nto parties are, in my opinion, likely to be declared unconstitutional.\n  Like the proponents of the bill before us, I believe that it is too \ndifficult to mount a viable challenge to an incumbent Member of \nCongress; that Members of Congress spend too much of their time raising \nfunds for their campaigns; that voter turnout is lower than it ought to \nbe; and that advertisements by outside groups often drown out the \nvoices of candidates. Worst of all, there is the lingering concern that \nfundraising considerations can affect Members' decisions.\n  But, whereas the proponents of the bill before us contend that their \nreforms will promote participation, competition, and disinterested \ndeliberation within our politics, I am concerned that passing this \nbill, if anything, will have the opposite effect. I am especially \nconcerned about the bill's adverse effect on our two great political \nparties, which are the primary targets of S. 27.\n  It is political parties that help challengers to overcome the \nsignificant advantages incumbents enjoy, and help candidates, incumbent \nand non-incumbent alike to fight back against attacks from outside \ngroups.\n  It is political parties that do much of the voter registration and \nget-out-the-vote organizing that bring new voters to the polls.\n  And because a party will provide support to any credible candidate \nwho will run on its line, it provides a counterweight to single-issue \ncommittees which can spend large sums of money defining the candidate.\n  As has been widely reported, the bill before us targets political \nparties by prohibiting them from receiving so-called ``soft money'' \ndonations. It imposes particularly severe restrictions on party \norganizations in the 50 states, preventing them from using funds, other \nthan federally-regulated ``hard dollars'', even under state law for \nparty-building activities and constitutionally protected issue advocacy \nduring any time-frame that coincides with a federal election. To \nrealize that most state and local contests are conducted concurrently \nwith federal campaigns is to realize how stifling such restrictions are \ngoing to be.\n\n  To the extent that there is credible evidence of corruption of \nofficeholders by unlimited soft money contributions, it might be \nconstitutional to limit the amount of such contributions, as opposed to \nbanning them altogether. For that reason, I supported Senator Hagel's \nproposal to cap soft money contributions to parties at $60,000. \nImposing such a cap would achieve the objective of preventing a donor \nfrom potentially corrupting those to whom he donates while heeding the \nSupreme Court's warning that any such limitation be tailored as \nnarrowly as possible to meet that objective.\n  Senator Hagel's alternative, which I supported and the Senate \nrejected, would arguably also have weakened political parties, but it \nwould not have marginalized them, the way S. 27 is likely to do. The \nHagel bill, by combining its restrictions on parties with a hard-money \nlimit increase, offered a reasonable bargain: moderate the influence of \nparties, while increasing the ability of candidates to get their own \nmessage out.\n  The bill before us imposes much more stringent limits on parties, \nwhile providing much more modest relief to candidates in the form of a \nhard-money limit increase.\n  By causing a contraction of the supply of money available to parties \nand candidates, this arrangement will lead to either an attenuation of \npolitical debate or the movement of funds into the coffers of outside \nsingle-issue groups. They and the media will take the place of the \nparties and the candidates in carrying the messages of the campaign.\n  Again, this is assuming that the Supreme Court upholds a soft money \nban. There are several legal precedents that make this assumption \ndifficult to sustain.\n  In 1976, in the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court \nheld that restrictions on political donations and expenditures impinge \non the rights of speech and association protected by the First \nAmendment, and, therefore, are subject to the most stringent level of \nconstitutional scrutiny.\n  In a 1996 case, Colorado Republican Party v. FEC, the Court made it \nclear that these guarantees extend to political parties, as well as to \nindependent citizens and groups, noting that, as Justice Thomas wrote \nin a concurring opinion, ``political associations allow citizens to \npool their resources and make their advocacy more effective, and such \nefforts are fully protected by the First Amendment.''\n  It is true that a common manifestation of that protected advocacy is \nthe type of communication that has, not altogether inaccurately, been \ndescribed as the ``sham issue ad.'' But the Buckley court anticipated \nthat ``the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and \nadvocacy of the election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in \npractical application,'' yet insisted that ``discussion of public \nissues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to \nthe operation of the system of government established by our \nConstitution.'' ``The First Amendment,'' said the Court, ``affords the \nbroadest protection to such political expression in order to assure the \nunfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and \nsocial changes desired by the people.''\n\n  In light of these holdings, it is difficult to imagine that the \ncourts could find a prohibition aimed at preventing the parties from \nengaging in this type of advocacy to be anything but an infringement on \nthe free speech rights of those organizations. If, as I believe they \nwill, courts strike down these provisions of the bill, and unions, \ncorporations, and other entities are allowed to use unregulated funds \nfor issue advocacy, S. 27's soft money ban on contributions to parties \ncould give rise to a very plausible equal protection claim.\n  Of course, activity by independent entities does not fall outside the \nscope of the bill before us. The proponents of the bill suggest that we \nwho worry about its impact on parties and non-incumbents should be \nconsoled by the restrictions it places on the ability of such citizen \ngroups to advance their views and coordinate their activities with \npolitical parties.\n  These provisions provide me with no consolation. As I noted, these \nrestrictions will not likely survive judicial scrutiny. That outcome is \none that we should welcome, because these restrictions are misguided.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues who confronted the issue of \nconstitutionality and tried to craft a way to permit ``genuine'' issue \nads while cracking down on ``phony'' ones. They attempt to identify a \npermissible subcategory of issue advertisements\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nthat constitute ``electioneering'' without expressly advocating the \nelection or defeat of a candidate.\n  But I believe that using the threat of mandatory disclosure of donor \ninformation or outright bans on advocacy as a lever to regulate the \nquantity, timing, and content of issue advocacy communications is \nfundamentally at odds with the First Amendment's injunction to Congress \nto ``make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or of the \nright of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of \ngrievances.''\n  Congress cannot be in the business of outlawing criticism of itself. \nOf course, I do not appreciate the unfair attacks that are all too \nfrequently presented in single-issue advertisements. But I think that \nwe would do well to resist the urge to silence those who would \ncriticize us, even those who criticize us when we are most sensitive to \ncriticism--at election time.\n  Unfortunately, passage of this bill leaves us with three unappetizing \npossibilities: that our work may be struck down in toto; that it might \nbe refashioned by the courts into something altogether different than \nwhat was intended; or that it might be left as it is, which would leave \nus with a democracy less vital than the admittedly imperfect one it is \nour privilege to be a part of.\n  It is my hope that this bill will be modified in the House of \nRepresentatives to avoid those three results.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to pass S. 27, \nthe McCain-Feingold bipartisan campaign reform bill. The momentum for \nthe bill is building. The President has announced that he is \ndisinclined to veto this bill. We could be on the brink of enacting the \nfirst significant campaign reforms in a generation.\n  I would like to make a few observations.\n  First, I want to salute the bill's sponsors, Senators McCain and \nFeingold. We are considering this bill only because of the sheer force \nof their collective will. They have suffered innumerable set-backs \npushing for this legislation over the past several years. But they \nnever got discouraged; they never let up. Their dedication to this \ncause has been extraordinary.\n  I also want to commend the majority and minority leaders and the \nbill's managers, Senators McConnell and Dodd, for crafting a way to \nconsider the bill that has been a breath of fresh air here in the \nSenate. For the past 2 weeks, we have operated in a way the Senate was \nmeant to operate. We have been the deliberative body the Founding \nFathers meant for us to be. I hope the spirit in which we have \nconducted debate on this bill continues long after we vote on its final \npassage.\n  Numerous public opinion polls have indicated that the American people \noverwhelmingly support campaign reform, but don't rank the issue as a \npriority. I think that's because they have grown discouraged about the \nlikelihood of Congress passing such reform. Maybe--just maybe--we will \nshow the American people that we are capable of beating the odds, of \ncoming together and doing something difficult.\n  With regard to the bill, we have beaten back several amendments \ndesigned to cripple it or drive away its supporters.\n  We have defeated the so-called ``paycheck protection'' amendments \nthat were aimed right at the heart of organized labor.\n  We have voted to ban soft money, convincingly. That is key.\n  We have defeated an attempt to strip the bill of the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions regarding sham ``issue advocacy'' by independent, often \nanonymous, groups that face no donor contribution limits or disclosure \nrequirements.\n  We have defeated an attempt to make the bill nonseverable.\n  Most important, we have come to a reasonable compromise with regard \nto raising some of the existing hard money contribution limits for \nindividuals by modest amounts, and indexing those limits for inflation.\n  I am proud that I helped to negotiate that compromise, along with the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee and several other Members from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  The Senate voted 84-16 to approve the compromise we worked out.\n  Our compromise: doubles the limit on hard money contributions to \nindividual candidates from $1,000 per election to $2,000 per election; \nincreases the annual limit on hard money contributions to the national \nparty committees by $5,000, to $25,000; increases the annual aggregate \nlimit on all hard money contributions by $12,500, to $37,500; doubles \nthe amount that the national party committees can contribute to \ncandidates, from $17,500 to $35,000; and; indexes these new limits for \ninflation.\n  The Thompson-Feinstein amendment will reinvigorate individual giving. \nIt will reduce the incessant need for fundraising. It will give \ncandidates and parties the resources they need to respond to \nindependent campaigns. It will reduce the relative influence of PACs.\n\n  I know that some campaign reform advocates are uncomfortable raising \nany hard money contribution limits by any amount.\n  I would argue that modest increases are imperative for the simple \nreason that the current limits were established under the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, FECA, amendments of 1974, Public Law 93-443, and \nhaven't been changed since. That was 27 years ago.\n  I have spoken previously about how the costs of campaigning have \nrisen much faster than ordinary inflation over the past 27 years these \nlimits have been frozen.\n  The advantage of modestly lifting some of the limits is that doing so \nwill reduce the time candidates have to spend fund-raising, time better \nspent with, prospective, constituents.\n  During this past election, my campaign had over 100 fundraisers. That \ntook time. Time to call. Time to attend. Time to say thanks. And that \nwas time I couldn't spend doing what my constituents want me to do.\n  The task of raising hard money in small contributions unadjusted for \ninflation is just too daunting, for incumbents and challengers alike.\n  Particularly in the larger States like California, where extensive \ntelevision and radio advertising is imperative, it is not uncommon for \nSenators to begin fundraising for the next election right after the \npresent one ends and they often find themselves ``dialing for dollars'' \ninstead of attending to other duties.\n  Let's be honest with each other and the American people: campaigning \nfor office will continue to get more and more expensive because \ntelevision spots are getting more and more expensive.\n  Meanwhile, independent campaigns conducted by groups that are \naccountable to no one threaten to drown out any attempt by candidates \nor the parties to communicate with voters.\n  Spending on issue advocacy by these groups, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, rose from $135 million in 1996 to as \nmuch as $340 million in 1998. Then it rose again, to $509 million in \n2000. Most of this money is used for attack ads that the American \npeople have come to loathe.\n  It is likely that spending on so-called issue advocacy, most of which \nis thinly disguised electioneering, probably will surpass hard money \nspending, and very soon. It has already surpassed soft money spending.\n  Clearly, the playing field is being skewed. More and more people are \nturning to the undisclosed, unregulated independent campaign.\n  The attacks come and no one knows who is actually paying for them. I \nbelieve this is unethical. I believe it is unjust. I believe it is \nunreasonable and it must end.\n  We have to raise the limit on hard money contributions to individual \ncandidates and the parties. The pressure on them has grown \nexponentially, especially now that we are about to ban soft money.\n  The Thompson-Feinstein amendment the Senate adopted last Wednesday \nmakes S. 27 possible. It becomes easier for us now to staunch the \nmillions of unregulated soft dollars that currently flow into the \ncoffers of our political parties, and replace a modest portion of that \nmoney with contributions that are fully regulated and disclosed under \nthe existing provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  People aren't concerned about individual contributions of $1,000, and \nI don't think they will be concerned about donations of $2,000.\n  No, what concerns people the most about the current system are the \nchecks for $250,000, or $500,000, or even $1 million flowing into \npolitical parties.\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\n  These gigantic contributions are what warp our politics and cause \npeople to lose faith in our Government and they must be halted. They \ngive the appearance of corruption.\n  The Thompson-Feinstein amendment, by increasing the limit on \nindividual and national party committee contributions to federal \ncandidates, will reduce the need for raising campaign funds from \npolitical action committees, PACs.\n  Our amendment, therefore, will reduce the relative influence of PACs, \nmaking it easier to replace PAC monies with funds raised from \nindividual donors.\n  The concern about PACs seems unimportant now, compared with the \nproblems that soft money, independent expenditures, and issue advocacy \npresent. But we shouldn't dismiss the fact that PACs retain \nconsiderable influence in our system.\n  I represent California, which has more people--34 million--than 21 \nother States combined. I just finished my twelfth political campaign. \nFor the fourth time in 10 years, I ran statewide. Running for office in \nCalifornia is expensive: I have had to raise more than $55 million in \nthose four campaigns.\n  I can tell you from my experiences over the years that I am committed \nto campaign reform, and I am heartened that we are close to passing S. \n27.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No. Will it be subject to challenges in court? \nUndoubtedly. But I think S. 27 is a strong bill and I am optimistic \nthat it will withstand the Courts' scrutiny. And as I said earlier, it \nis our best chance at reform in a generation.\n  We have an electricity crisis in California and much of the West. Our \neconomy shows serious signs of weakening. We definitely have to address \nthese issues, and others.\n  But the last 2 weeks that we have spent considering S. 27 have been \ntime well-spent. Campaign reform goes to the heart of our democracy.\n  The way we currently finance and conduct our campaigns is a cancer \nmetastasizing throughout the body politic.\n  It discourages people from running for office and it disgusts voters. \nSo they simply tune out, in larger and larger numbers.\n  Discouragement, disgust, frustration, apathy--these feelings don't \nbolster our democracy, they weaken it.\n  We have an opportunity here, a rare opportunity, to do the right \nthing here with S. 27. I hope we don't squander such a precious \nopportunity.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of campaign \nfinance reform. I appreciate the Leadership's willingness to so fully \ntake up this issue. It is a debate that has been a long time in coming. \nAnd the need has never been more urgent. Money has a stranglehold on \ndemocracy under our current system. It is clear that we must take \naction now to restore the public's faith in our political system.\n  Every year we talk and talk about reforming the system. We bemoan the \nrole of special interests. We're forced to spend an inordinate amount \nof time raising money. We have to worry about financing the next race \nthe day after we get elected.\n  That's not why we're here and it's not what we were elected to do.\n  Ideally, I would like to wipe the slate clean. Start over with a \nclean campaign finance system and a level playing field. For now, let's \nstart by addressing soft money and the abuse of issue advocacy \nadvertising. Exactly what McCain-Feingold, as amended, does.\n  Soft money only serves to further taint the image Americans have \nabout politics. As soft money contributions increase, so does the \nperception that special interests own us. As a result, cynicism towards \nCongress and its activities continues to grow.\n  The use of unregulated soft money contributions must be curbed in \nFederal campaigns. Soft money, as a percent of total funding, has more \nthan doubled since 1992. This is not a partisan issue. Soft money has \nmore than doubled for both parties.\n  My entire state of Montana could fit through the soft money \nloopholes. The last time Congress considered such a thorough overhaul \nof campaign finance law was 1974. We thought then that regulations \nplaced on hard money would straighten up the system. Instead, the use \nof soft money to the parties and groups has exploded. We've all heard \nthis number over these days of debate, but I think it warrants being \nmentioned again: Last year's election parties collected a record $490 \nmillion dollars in soft money. That's obscene. With $490 million, \nschool construction projects could be completed so our kids aren't \nlearning in overcrowded classrooms. With $490 million, we could move \ntowards implementing a prescription drug benefit. Let's straighten out \nour priorities and have folks contribute instead to the projects that \nreally need it.\n  The problem we're really facing is how grey the campaign finance laws \nhave become. McCain-Feingold, as amended, would make them black and \nwhite. Just take issue advocacy advertising as an example. In the last \ncouple campaigns, the lines have been blurred between express advocacy, \nwhich requires federal disclosures, and issue advocacy.\n  We can all recall advertisements in our own state that just barely \nskirted the lines. In Montana, the unregulated soft money ads started \nearly. Close to a year before the election, groups started attacking \ncandidates with mud-slinging ads. Groups with benign sounding names \nthat hid their partisan bent. Ads that attacked candidates, and even \ntold people where to call, but somehow fell under the ``issue \nadvocacy'' definition, And were exempt from campaign finance laws.\n  Aren't we missing the point? The spirit of the ad is what's \nimportant. By attacking only one candidate, that leads to the obvious \nconclusion that the ad is supporting the opposition. And that should \nsubject the money used to pay for the ad to regulation and disclosure.\n  A new, clear definition of issue advocacy is necessary--one that \ncloses the loopholes. I supported the original bill language that would \nban ``grey'' issue advocacy ads that fall within 60 days of the general \nelection or 30 days of a primary and was specific to corporate and \nUnion treasury funds. However, I believe the Wellstone amendment, \nextending coverage to all third-party expenditures, makes McCain-\nFeingold a better and more balanced bill.\n  Now, there is one area where I differ with McCain-Feingold, and that \nis in my support for a non-severability clause. The bill, as it now \nstands, is fair and balanced legislation. Non-severability is the only \ntool available to guarantee that the balance and fairness of McCain-\nFeingold stands. By allowing the Court to strike down individual parts \nof the bill, we run the serious risk of a final bill that is very \ndifferent than what was voted on. I am hopeful that the final bill will \nnot encounter opposition by the Supreme Court and that severability \nwill become a non-issue.\n  I applaud Senators McCain and Feingold for continuing to raise this \nissue. I believe that we can pass a comprehensive bill and achieve \ntrue, bipartisan campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nbelief that the campaign-finance reform legislation we have before us \naddresses one of the most important issues facing America today. The \ninfluence of special interests and the enormous amount of money \nrequired to effectively run a modern political campaign have created a \nrift between the Congress and the American people.\n  The fact is our political system today is dominated by huge \ncontributions to the national parties of ``soft money.'' Sometimes, \nthese donations circumvent the parties and flow through other avenues \nthat lack public disclosure under the guise of issue advertisements. \nThese large donations and suspect advertisements have cast a cloud of \ndoubt over the entire political process. And this doubt has caused many \nAmericans to lose faith in the system.\n  Is the McCain-Feingold bill the answer? It's not the total answer, \nbut it's a step in the right direction. What we need to do is take our \nbest hold and step forward and reform the law, right now.\n  Banning ``soft money'' from the system will go a long way toward \nremoving the appearance of corruption that plagues the system today; \nand, the legislation's new disclosure requirements will add much-needed \nsunshine to the process.\n  Candidates, and the American people have a right to know the \nidentities of the groups and people behind the so-\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\ncalled issue ads that increasingly dominate the airways during campaign \ntime.\n  Although I favor public financing, we're not at the point that we can \npass public financing. So what are we going to do? My preference is, we \nchange the system with the legislation we have before us. The people \nwant reform; the country needs it; we should do it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nopposition to the McCain-Feingold bill. To be clear, I am not opposed \nto the impetus behind this legislation, which is to reform our current \ncampaign finance system. I concur with my colleagues--who support this \nbill--that the present system is inadequate and inherently flawed. But, \nunfortunately, this is where our parallel viewpoints diverge.\n  While I agree that the present campaign finance system is imperfect, \nI believe that the McCain-Feingold alternative to that system is even \nmore so. This legislation, once enacted, likely will hurt the status \nquo more than it will help. And, ultimately, I predict it will foster \ncampaign finance regression, rather than institute campaign finance \nreform.\n  From the beginning, I have worked with my colleagues to negotiate a \nmore fair and balanced package that, I believe, would have achieved \nthorough reform. Key parts such as the Hagel amendment on soft money \ncontributions and the amendment on non-severability are not included in \nthis final bill. Had they been included, these amendments would have \nmade the legislation much more effective and comprehensive, and \nconsequently, much more likely to receive my support.\n  To be fair and consistent, certain aspects of this final bill are \nlaudable and do have my support. I am pleased that the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision and the Hagel amendment regarding disclosure are included. \nIncreased accountability and transparency for special interest groups \nare important to the overall reform effort. Moreover, the Wellstone \namendment, which extends the Snowe-Jeffords provision to independent \nadvocacy groups, will help remove the facades behind which these groups \nhide. For too long, special interest groups have funded so-called issue \nads whose main objective is to distort the facts. It is encouraging \nthat this bill, as amended, confronts that issue.\n  The ability of state parties to carryout traditional activities such \nas voter registration, is another issue addressed by the Levin \namendment, which I was pleased to join as an original co-sponsor. State \nand local candidates rely on get-out-the-vote efforts and voter \nregistration activities which are usually funded by the state party. \nSince this campaign finance reform bill, prior to the Levin amendment, \nwould have severely limited state parties, it became apparent that we \nneeded to ensure that such crucial activities are not abolished as \nwell. Without question, I am encouraged by the inclusion of this \namendment. It, and the ones regarding increased disclosure, are \ndefinitive steps in the direction of genuine campaign finance reform.\n  That being said, any ground gained by these steps is lost through the \nban on soft money and the defeat of the non-severability clause. \nMcCain-Feingold bans soft money contributions only to the national \nparties. As I have said before, this measure is ineffective, an \nultimately unproductive. The soft money ban in this bill will likely be \nmore of a temporary road block than a true dead end. I believe that \neventually soft money will find a detour, and it will flow into federal \nelections from another direction.\n  A more realistic approach to the unfettered flow of soft money that \npollutes our current campaign finance system, would have been to \ninclude the Hagel amendment, which would have capped soft money \ncontributions at $60,000. The Hagel measure was pragmatic and essential \nto real reform. With the absence of this language in the final bill, we \nare left with a plan than falls short on efficacy and long on futility.\n  Without the inclusion of a cap, instead of a ban on soft money to \nnational parties, my support for this bill declined, but the nail on \nthe coffin, so to speak, was the defeat of the severability clause. The \nnon-severability amendment was characterized by its opponents as the \n``poison pill'' of campaign finance reform. Quite frankly, I thing the \ntotal package before us today would have been easier to swallow if it \nhad been included.\n  The non-severability amendment would have prevented the courts from \nstriking down some provisions and leaving others. Once the courts act, \nit is possible that the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law as \npassed by Congress will look nothing like the McCain-Feingold finance \nreform law tweaked by the courts. For this reason, the severability \nprovision only weakens the bill and extends the inequalities fostered \nby the present system.\n  My conviction that the current campaign finance system is flawed \nremains unchanged. Comprehensive reform is undoubtedly needed; however, \nI do not believe this legislation will achieve that goal. It's often \nbeen said that something is better than nothing. Well, in this \ninstance, the reverse rings true. Nothing is better than something. \nTherefore, I will vote accordingly and reserve my support for a more \ncomprehensive and equitable campaign finance reform package.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the thrust of McCain-Feingold was to \neliminate soft money. Now, the final bill doesn't eliminate soft money \nbut, rather, redirects it. Soft money has been taken away from the \npolitical parties and redirected to the special interests. The thrust \nof McCain-Feingold was to minimize the influence of the special \ninterests. It has now become maximized. And finally, the thrust of \nMcCain-Feingold was to eliminate the obscenity of the outrageous \namounts of money that it takes in politics to be elected. The final \nbill now doubles this obscenity. But Senator McCain has become such a \nsymbol. McCain-Feingold has become such a message that Senators, in \ndisregard of the substance but totally on message, will vote for it. I \nsaid at the beginning that there was no doubt that under Buckley v. \nValeo, the Supreme Court would find McCain-Feingold unconstitutional. \nWhile the Court hurt us in Buckley, perhaps this time the Court will \nsave us by finding McCain-Feingold unconstitutional. At least I am \nsober enough to vote no.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after two weeks of floor consideration, we \nare now approaching the final vote on the campaign finance reform \nlegislation. I have taken the floor on several occasions over the past \ntwo weeks to express my serious concerns with the various provisions of \nthe bill. Given my concerns, and the failure of this body to vote to \ncorrect some of the problems, I will be voting against final passage of \nthis well-intended, but seriously flawed legislation.\n  The one silver lining in the legislation that will likely pass this \nevening is a provision I authored that passed, which will give \nexpedited judicial review by the Supreme Court of challenges to the \nconstitutionality of the legislation. All of us, supporters and \nopponents alike, stand to gain by a prompt and definite determination \nof the constitutionality of many of the bill's controversial \nprovisions. Because the harm these provisions will cause is serious and \nirreparable, it is imperative that we afford the Supreme Court the \nopportunity to pass on the constitutionality of this legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n  Let me say again that I commend and respect the authors of this \nlegislation for their attempts to address a troubling and unfortunate \npublic perception about our political system. However, we also must \nrespect the freedom of speech granted to every American by our \nConstitution. While the bill may alter or change our system of campaign \nfinance, I think it will do little in actually reform it or making it \nbetter. In fact, McCain-Feingold, if passed and enacted into law, will, \nin my opinion, exacerbate the very problems that it seeks to solve.\n  The primary provision of McCain-Feingold essentially bans soft money \nby making it unlawful for national political party committees and \nfederal candidates to solicit or receive any funds not subject to the \nhard money limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. It also \nnationalizes the state party structure by subjecting state parties to \nthe regulations of the Federal Election Commission when candidates for \nfederal office appear on the general ballot. The net result of this \nsoft money restriction on parties will be to emasculate the present \ntwo-party system and to increase the power\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nand influence of the special interests. Ironically, special interest \npower and influence is exactly what the bill's sponsors purport is \nwrong with American politics today.\n  Even more importantly, the party soft money ban is an infringement on \nthe rights of free speech and free association protected by the \nConstitution's First Amendment. It appears to violate several decisions \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, particularly the holding of he seminal case \nof Buckley v. Valeo. The ban will severely weaken the ability of \nparties to engage in electoral advocacy.\n  Yet, political parties have the same First Amendment rights as any \nother group. The restrictions on political party speech, without any \nspecific showing of a potential for corruption or other necessity for \ndoing so, and not on the speech of other associations and individuals \nnot only infringes the First Amendment, but it also violates the \nprinciple of equal protection of the laws that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment guarantees.\n  The other main provision of the bill is the so-called Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision. Under current law the only electoral speech that may \nconstitutionally be regulated is so-called ``express'' advocacy, that \nis, speech that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. All other political speech is termed ``issue'' advocacy, \nwhich the government can almost never abridge.\n  Snowe-Jeffords blurs the distinction between the two categories of \nspeech by creating a catch-all third termed ``electioneering \ncommunications.'' Merely ``referring to a clearly identified \ncandidate'' magically turns heretofore protected issue advocacy into \nregulated electioneering communication. This part of the McCain-\nFeingold would coerce disclosure of donors' identities, and this \ndisclosure would destroy the right to free association recognized in \nvarious Supreme Court cases.\n  Snowe-Jeffords also completely bans corporate and union political \n``electioneering communication'' speech. Again, this term sweeps in \nissue advocacy, which Congress may not ban, unless they meet the strict \nscrutiny standards prescribed by the Supreme Court, which in my opinion \nCongress has failed to do. Government has no business and no interest \nin banning the opinions of business or labor. They are already \nprohibited, and I bet most Americans do not know this, from directly \ncontributing to candidates. This is important because the possibility \nof bribery, and even the appearance of a quid pro quo, is already \nameliorated by law. Therefore, no justification exists for censoring \nthe opinions of corporations and labor unions that this provision \nmandates. It too violates the Constitution's free speech requirements.\n  I believe there is also an equal protection problem in that the media \nis exempted from Snowe-Jeffords. Now, let me say that I love the media, \nas I do any institution that brings knowledge to the American people. \nBut the media should not have more rights to free speech than any other \ngroup, and McCain-Feingold gives the media a monopoly. Some Americans \nfeel that the media is already all-powerful. Personally, I think this \nis an exaggeration. But if this bill passes, they very well might be.\n  I have often said that I am an advocate of Oliver Wendell Holmes' \nview of free speech as a competition in the market place of ideas. The \nremedy of the wealthy and powerful buying speech is not censorship. \nThis is not the American way. The remedy is more speech. We Americans \nhave always banded together and pooled our money to compete. Joining is \nthe American way. Banning is not. Let's have competition, no \ncensorship.\n  I do admit that a problem exists within our system of government. \nThat problem, the real problem, is that people feel detached and \ndisassociated from their government. They feel that others, whomever \nthey are, the rich, the special interests, labor, business, just not \nthem--have more access to their leaders and more influence with them. \nThe American people want more. They want more access, more \naccountability, more of a say in the decisions that effect their daily \nlives.\n\n  I suggest that the solution is not making it more difficult for \npeople to get involved in politics. It's not shutting down the parties, \nwhich represent the most accessible means for most people to engage in \npolitical activity.\n  Real finance reform will only come when the size of the federal is \nreduced. Until that happens, there will be a powerful incentive for \nspecial interests to seek a piece of the federal pie. Real campaign \nfinance reform is passing a tax cut so that the people will be able to \nspend their own money instead of big government spending their money on \nbehalf of special interests. That is what I have fought for in my 25 \nyears of public service in the Senate.\n  My esteemed colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin have spent \ncountless hours doing what they believe is the right thing. their \nefforts are laudable. I sincerely applaud them for the work that they \nhave put into this debate. However, I must vigorously disagree with \ntheir solution. More speech--not less--is the answer. I believe that \nthe correct way to solve the problem is to lift the limits on \ncontributions; increase disclosure, and stiffen the penalties.\n  Unfortunately, my attempts to increase disclosures by corporations \nand labor unions were defeated, probably because of the pressures by \nthe same special interest labor unions, that the authors of this \nlegislation wanted to address. But today, instead of advocating these \npolicies, I must oppose the McCain-Feingold bill. I must attempt to \nturn the so-called ``reform movement'' away from the very dangerous \npath down which it is now proceeding. Hopefully, at some point, we can \ndiscuss some real, and I must say Constitutional alternatives.\n  Let me focus on Title I of McCain-Feingold and describe why I believe \nthe bill is likely to have constitutional challenges. Title I of the \nMcCain-Feingold is labeled ``Reduction of Special Interest Influence.'' \nIndeed, this is the primary intent of the entire bill--to diminish the \n``influence'' of so-called ``special interest groups.'' While I cannot \nfault the bill's supporters for their genuine efforts, I do not believe \nthat the bill effectively solves the problem that it seeks to. Indeed, \npassage of McCain-Feingold will increase the influence of special \ninterests, and it will do so by effectively ruining the political \nparties. I will not support McCain-Feingold, in part, because it, in my \nopinion, unconstitutionally suppresses the voices of the political \nparties.\n  In its effort to regulate ``soft money,'' McCain-Feingold has two \ndramatic adverse effects on political party activity. First, it \ndramatically limits the issue advocacy, legislative, and organizational \nactivities of political parties. Second, it imposes federal election \nlaw limits on the state and local activities of national political \nparties.\n  It is important to recall the U.S. Supreme Court's comment in \nColorado Republican Party that ``[w]e are not aware of any special \ndangers of corruption associated with political parties. . . .'' \nPolitical parties are merely the People associating with others who \nshare their values to advance issues, legislation, and candidates that \nfurther those values. When they do these things, they are just doing \ntheir historic job as good citizens. The notion that they are somehow \ncorrupt for doing so is both strange and constitutionally infirm.\n  Let me first describe the beneficial role of political parties in \nAmerican democracy. I don't need to tell any of my fellow Senators what \npolitical parties do or how they do it. Nor do I need to tell them that \nthe focus of political parties is to win elections. They also already \nknow how the parties go about winning elections. For the most part the \nparties do it by spending money. They spend their money--their own \nmoney--to promote their views and convince others of them. They fund \nactivities like voter registration drives, get out the vote activities, \nand advertising.\n  Political parties have many beneficial effects on American democracy. \nThe Senate recognized their importance when it passed the FECA in the \nmid-1970s and expressed its desire to strengthen political parties. The \nCommittee Report accompanying FECA observed then that ``a vigorous \nparty system is vital to American politics.'' It was true then, and it \nremains true today. The Committee Report noted that parties perform \n``crucial functions in the election apart from fund-raising.''\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n  In our country, while one man has one vote, inevitably citizens will \ngather to pool their votes into blocks. It has always been this way, \nand it will continue to be so regardless of whatever legislation we \npass. The problem with these interest groups or voting blocks is that \nthey focus on their own very narrow issues and not on what is best for \nthe country at large.\n  James Madison identified these groups as ``factions.'' He noted in \nThe Federalist 10 that there are no means of controlling the ``evils of \nfaction that are consistent with liberty. The only way to eliminate \nfaction is to eliminate liberty, which is worse than the disease'' of \nfaction.\n  Madison's celebrated solution to the problem presented by factions--\nembodied in the Constitution--was to create a system that pitted \ninterest groups against each other and so as to bring the best ideas to \nthe top. The sheer size of the new republic--and its subsequent \ngrowth--expanded the number of participants in public debate. As a \nresult, regional and other interest groups balance each other out to an \nextent. Political parties continue this process of moderation.\n  Parties moderate special interests because they must appeal to the \nentire nation. You will recall that the goal of parties is to win \nelections. They can only do this by laying out broad policy platforms \nthat will appeal to wide groups of people. They offer a broad and \nencompassing vision of gover- \nnance. Party leadership has to craft a message that will allow its \ncandidates to win election in all 50 states. Contrast the role of \nparties to special-interest groups, which only want to pursue their \nspecific goals. Their leadership is not seeking to win elections in \nstates throughout the union, but typically only the passage of a narrow \nset of legislation.\n\n  Allow me to add that I am not disparaging these special interest \ngroups. They play an extremely crucial role in our democracy as well. \nThey are not the problem, as they are essential to our democracy. They \nheighten the public's and Congress' awareness of key issues. They have \na role to play, but so do the political parties. I do not want to favor \none over the other, and that is what McCain-Feingold will do. No soft \nmoney for political parties, but unlimited amounts to special interest \ngroups.\n  However, political parties are not just about electing candidates, \nparticularly federal ones. Political parties constitute a vital way by \nwhich citizens come together around issues and values expressed in the \nplanks of their party platforms--at all levels of government. Parties \nadvocate these issues in the public forum in addition to lobbying for \nlegislation and engaging in efforts to elect candidates. Parties are \njust as focused on the promotion of issues as are ideological \ncorporations, such as the National Right to Life Committee or The \nChristian Coalition of America, and labor unions, such as the American \nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, although \nwith a broader spectrum of issues. McCain-Feingold ignores this reality \nand treats political parties as simply federal candidate election \nmachines.\n  Now, the big point the supporters of McCain-Feingold make in support \nof the soft money party ban is that large contributions to political \nparties create undue influence or an appearance of impropriety. This is \nnot even a gross exaggeration. It is simply wrong.\n  Philip Morris, the largest donor to the Republican National Committee \nduring the 1998 cycle, gave approximately $2 million in soft money, but \nthis represented less than 1 percent of the total that the Republican \nNational Committee raised. Similarly, the Communication Workers of \nAmerica, the Democrat's largest soft money donor, gave $1.5 million to \nthe Democratic National Committee, but this too represented less than 1 \npercent of its total.\n  It doesn't make sense to conclude that an entity that contributes \nless than 1 percent of a party's funding could have any significant \neffect on the party's policies. The parties must keep in mind the goals \nof the other interests to which they also have to appeal. A more likely \nexplanation for the largesse is that the donors to both parties support \nthe policies they already espouse.\n  I would also like to note that whatever influence a large donation \nmade to a political party gives the donor, and, yes, I am pragmatic \nenough to realize that it does grant the donor a certain amount of \naccess, the effect of donations is diluted among all of the party's \nelected officials, the 200 plus Senators and Representatives in either \nparty. Also, because soft money donors cannot direct to which candidate \nor race their money should flow, they sometimes support losers. I make \nthese points to demonstrate that soft money donations are greatly \ndiluted and do not pose the same ``appearance of corruption'' that \ndirect contributions to candidates do. Importantly, the Supreme Court \nhas clearly stated that First Amendment rights can only be regulated \nwhere there is corruption or an appearance of corruption.\n  As is apparent, McCain-Feingold will dramatically weaken political \nparties. In the last election cycle, the Democratic Party raised $243 \nmillion in soft money--fully 47 percent of its total. The Republican \nParty raised $244, 35 percent of its total. Under McCain-Feingold, the \nparties would lose this important source of funding, and this shortfall \ncould not be filled by simply wishing into existence more hard money. \nIt doesn't take a Fields Award winner in math to determine that this \nkind of reduction will dramatically hinder the parties' ability to \neffectively deliver their messages. Such a ban would accordingly weaken \nthe ability of parties to participate in the public debate, while \nsimultaneously enhancing the relative power of special interest to \ndominate that debate. I believe that McCain-Feingold will effectively \nend the system of two-party government that we now know. And this \nsystem has brought remarkable stability to the United States.\n  Political parties already complain that interest group spending \nthreatens to marginalize parties as interest groups increasingly \ncontrol the agenda, crowd out political party commentary, and confuse \nthe electorate. A ban on political party soft money would exacerbate \nthis situation. Voters would have a less clear idea of the party \nagenda, and parties would find it more difficult to translate election \nreturns into public mandate. Effective government would suffer.\n  Parties fill a vital role in our political system. In the Information \nAge, narrow, specialized interest groups have an easier time of forming \nand organizing themselves. In times like these, we need to maintain the \nparty system rather than weaken it, as McCain-Feingold will do.\n  Let me highlight why McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional as it \nrelates to political parties. Let me begin by asking a question, ``if \nindividuals and narrow interest groups enjoy the basic First Amendment \nfreedom to discuss issues and the position of candidates on those \nissues, how can political parties, which have wide bases of interests \nthat are necessarily tempered and diffused, be deprived of the right to \nengage in such issue advocacy?'' My answer is simply that they should \nnot be deprived of their rights.\n  I note at the outset of this analysis that political speech and \nassociation are at the heart of the First Amendment protections. As the \nUnited States Supreme Court declared in Buckley, ``the constitutional \nguarantee, of the First Amendment, has its fullest and most urgent \napplication precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office. \nThe Court has also stated that free expression in connection with \nelections is ``at the core of our electoral process and of the First \nAmendment freedoms. ``[Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968).] \nThus, as the Supreme Court noted, ``there is practically universal \nagreement that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect \nthe free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course \ninclud[ing] discussions of candidates.'' [Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. \n214, 218 (1966).]\n  Efforts by Congress, the FEC, and state election commissions to \nregulate issue advocacy have been repeatedly and consistently rebuffed \nby the Federal courts as violations of the First Amendment right to \nfree speech. No fewer the two dozen court decisions have made clear \nthat interest-group advertising or pamphleteering that does not \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate cannot,\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nconsistent with the First Amendment, be subject to contribution or \nexpenditure limits, or even reporting limits. Yet this is exactly what \nMcCain-Feingold seeks to do.\n\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that restrictions on \npolitical giving and spending interfere with political debate. Such \nrestrictions survive under the First Amendment only if justified by a \ncompelling government interest in preventing corruption or the \nappearance of corruption. Those restrictions must also be narrowly \ndrawn to achieve that interest. Soft money cannot, under current law, \nbe used by political parties to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of a candidate. Rather, it is used in large part for issue \nadvocacy, which the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts have helped \nmay not be regulated. Thus, McCain-Feingold inhibits the ability of \npolitical parties to engage in issue advocacy by restricting the \nresources available to them. Thus, it infringes on the political \nparties' right to free speech.\n  However, proponents of abolishing ``soft money'' argue that this is \nsimply a ``contribution limit.'' The fallacy of that argument, of \ncourse, is that the Supreme Court has justified contribution limits \nonly on the ground that large contributions directly to candidates \ncreate the reality or appearance of quid pro quo corruption. Soft money \ncontributions are not contributions to candidates:\n  Indeed, the proposed ban on soft money contributions cannot be \njustified on the theory that political parties corrupt federal \ncandidates, which the Supreme Court has already rejected. In Colorado \nRepublican v. FEC, Fed. Election Comm, the FEC took the position that \nindependent, uncoordinated expenditures by political parties ought to \nbe treated as contributions to the benefitted candidate. Such treatment \nwould have resulted in allowing individuals, candidates, and political \naction committees to spend unlimited amounts of money on independent \nexpenditures to advocate the election of a candidate, while limiting \nthe amount a political party could spend for the same purpose.\n  The Supreme Court disagreed with the FEC, noting that ``[w]e are not \naware of any special dangers of corruption associated with political \nparties'' and, after observing that individuals could contribute more \nmoney to political parties, $20,000, than to candidates, $1,000, and \nPACs $5,000, and that the ``FECA permits unregulated `soft money' \ncontributions to a party for certain activities,'' the Court concluded \nthat the ``opportunity for corruption posed by these greater \nopportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.'' The Court \ncontinued in this vein with respect to the FEC's proposed ban on \npolitical party independent expenditures, which has direct application \nto McCain-Feingold ban on soft money contributions.\n\n       [R]ather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive \n     influence of political parties, the legislative history [of \n     the Act] demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance \n     what was seen as an important and legitimate role for \n     political parties in American elections. . . .\n       We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law \n     controls the outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution \n     that grants to individuals, candidates, and ordinary \n     political committees the right to make unlimited \n     independent expenditures could deny the same right to \n     political parties.\n\nThe concurring justices also found little, if any, opportunity for \nparty corruption of candidates because of their very nature and \nstructure.\n  The Supreme Court found in the MCFL case that the prohibitions on \ncorporate contributions and expenditures could not be constitutionally \napplied to non-profit ideological corporations which do not serve as a \nconduit for business purposes. Fed. Election Comm. v. Mass. Citizens \nfor Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238 (1986) Similarly, political parties \nsimilarly pose no risk of corruption because people give money to \nparties precisely because they support what the political party stands \nfor.\n  A contribution to a political party is for the purpose of enhancing \nadvocacy of the issues the party represents. Any individual unhappy \nwith the use of the money may simply quit contributing and leave the \npolitical party. In sum, the threat of corruption cannot justify a \nlimit on issue advocacy and, even if it could, political parties pose \nno threat of corruption to their candidates.\n  In sum, in Colorado Republican Fed. Election Comm., the Supreme Court \nfound that, just as independent expenditures of interest groups pose no \ndanger of corrupting candidates, neither do those of political parties.\n  A second constitutional infirmity with McCain-Feingold results from \nthe proposed unequal treatment of political party speech in relation to \nspeech of other entities. Whereas non-party group may use funds that it \ncollects from its members to engage in issue advocacy, McCain-Feingold \nwould extensively regulate and burden political party issue advocacy.\n  The final constitutional defect of McCain-Feingold's soft money ban \non political parties is its insult to the federalist system. Under a \nprovision of the bill, state and local parties are directly affected by \nthe party soft money ban as a result of the bill's exceedingly broad \ndefinition of ``federal election activity'', which governs political \nparty expenditures if even a single federal candidate appears on the \ngeneral election ballot, no matter how many state and local candidates \nalso appear on the ballot.\n  In simpler terms, under McCain-Feingold, in those even numbered years \nin which typically federal congressional elections occur, state and \nlocal parties may only use federally regulated hard money for: Any \nvoter registration within 120 days of the election; All voter \nidentification, get-out-the-vote or ``generic campaign activity'' \nbefore the election. The bill defines ``generic campaign activity'' as \n``an activity that promotes a political party and does not promote a \ncandidate.'' Thus, it would even include yard signs that say ``vote \nDemocrat'' or ``support the GOP.'' Any TV, radio, newspaper, magazine, \nbillboard, mass mailing, telephone bank, leafleting or other ``public \ncommunication'' that mentions a candidate for federal office--whether \nor not it also mentions a candidate for state or local office. The \nentire salary of any state, district or local party employee who spends \n25% or more of the employer's compensated time in a single month on any \nof the above activities or any ``activities in connection with a \nFederal election'':\n\n  This constitutes an unprecedented federalization of the most basic \nparty-building functions engaged in by state and local party \ncommittees.\n  Forty-five states hold elections for state and local candidates only \nduring the even numbered years that federal elections occur. The only \nstates that do not are Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, and \nMississippi. Consequently, for these forty-five states, state and local \nparty mechanisms become entirely federalized and subject to federal \nregulatory authority. Imposition of federal contribution limits on \nnational parties would improperly arrogate authority over state \ncampaign financing decisions to the federal government.\n  Again, recognizing that a prohibition of soft money donations to \nnational party committees alone would be wholly ineffective, McCain-\nFeingold seeks to impose soft money restrictions on state parties as \nwell, even though state party activity is thoroughly regulated by state \ncampaign finance laws.\n  The money spent on elections has consistently increased over the \nyears, and no one believes that McCain-Feingold is going to reverse \nthis trend. Rather than stop soft money, the bill will simply divert it \ninto other channels, ones that are more opaque, less accountable, and \nrepresent narrower interests than do the national parties.\n  What do you suppose the result of this bill will be? In a recent New \nYork Times article, entitled, ``Big Donors Unfazed by Prospect of Soft \nMoney Limits,'' dated March 24, it was reported that if Congress banned \nparty soft money, most big donors would evade the ban by writing big \nchecks to advocacy groups allied with candidates and the national \nparties as a way to get their pet projects and issues before the \npublic.\n  The problem with such a result is that these non-party groups are \ncompletely unregulated, as they should be. We cannot constitutionally \ncompel them to disclose their activities, and so citizens will have no \nway of knowing who is actually behind the efforts. This is a perverse \nand unintended effect of McCain-Feingold. Money will be more hidden, \nand people will feel less responsible for their democracy, as they have\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nno control over these groups as they do over the parties. Despite the \nfact that it is unintended, it is nevertheless practically inevitable.\n\n  It is important to remember, that soft money donations to political \nparties do not go unregulated, as Bobby Birtchfield noted in the Senate \nRules Committee hearings on Campaign Finance last year. First, both \nreceipts and disbursements of soft money by political parties are \ncurrently reported to the FEC, and are available on the Internet. \nSecond, much of the activity financed by soft money is regulated by \nstate election law. Finally, political parties cannot use the soft \nmoney they raise--nor can candidates--to advocate the election or \ndefeat of a candidate for federal office.\n  Let me conclude with wholeheartedly agreeing with these observations \nof Alan Reynolds of the Manhattan Institute. I quote.\n\n       On the face of it, the McCain-Feingold obsession with \n     ``soft money'' looks fishy. Soft money accounts for less than \n     16 percent of federal campaign expenditures according to \n     Common Cause. And campaign expenditures do not even include \n     some of the most important ways of influencing policy, such \n     as lobbying and issue ads. Lobbying cost $2.7 billion in \n     1997-98, according to the Center for Respective Politics \n     (CRP), while Common Cause counted soft money collections of \n     merely $193 million during those years. Lobbyists would be \n     wise to lobby for a ban on soft money, because they would \n     then have even more clout and more money.\n       Everyone in Washington knows who the most politically \n     influential interest groups are, and most of them do not even \n     appear on lists of top soft money donors. Fortune asks \n     lawmakers and congressional staffers to name the most \n     politically powerful organizations. In 1999, the top 10 were \n     the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), the NRA \n     (National Rifle Association), the National Federation of \n     Independent Business, the American Israel Public Affairs \n     Committee, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the \n     Chamber of Commerce, the National Right to Life Committee, \n     the National Education Association and the National \n     Restaurant Association. What gives most of these groups \n     political clout is not contributions to political parties, \n     but old-fashioned lobbying, public policy advertising, and in \n     some cases (such as AARP, the NRA and the AFL-CIO) the \n     ability to influence a large number of members' votes.--Alan \n     Reynolds, ``The Economics of Campaign Finance Reform,'' The \n     Washington Times, March 22, 2001.\n\n  I believe, no, I know, that we are not a corrupt body. The United \nStates Senate is made up of fine and exemplary men and women, with whom \nI am proud to associate. I also know that Americans are able to discern \nthe truth of political matters, and that more speech, not less, will \nallow them to make the most informed decision. Finally, I know that the \nAmerican people should be able to give money in support of whatever \ncause they choose. Whether it's a group of 10,000 or a single person, \ntheir right to speak should be unfettered. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Mark Twain once noted that politicians' \nbiggest objection to ``tainted'' money is, ``tain't mine.''\n  My colleagues, today we stand on the verge of proving that saying \nwrong.\n  In the last two weeks, we've achieved some things in this Senate that \nfew people thought, going into this debate, were possible.\n  We have had a real debate. We have reached bipartisan agreements. We \nhave stood together, Republicans and Democrats, and rejected amendments \nthat would have made this bill unworkable.\n  And we have accepted amendments that improve the bill.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senator Wellstone, we broadened the Snowe-\nJeffords provision to bar sham issue ads so that all outside groups are \ntreated equally.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senators Torricelli, Corzine, Durbin and \nDorgan, we lowered the cost of campaigns by ensuring that the stations \nthat enjoy the benefit of federally licensed airwaves give candidates \nthe lowest unit cost for their political advertisements.\n  Thanks to the hard work of Senator Schumer, we put new teeth into the \nlimits on the vast sums of money national parties may spend on \ncoordinated expenditures for candidates.\n  Moreover, we turned back destructive amendments aimed at silencing \nthe voices of working people.\n  I will be honest, this bill is not perfect.\n  It now includes increases in the amount of hard money that may be \ncontributed to candidates and parties. I believe we must reduce the \namount of money in politcs--no matter the form. Still, I supported this \namendment reluctantly, and only because it allowed this bill to move \nforward, and to reach this important vote.\n  The bill also includes an unworkable scheme for financing opponents \nof wealthy candidates that, in my view, favors incumbents and unwisely \nmultiples the amount wealthy individuals can contribute to candidates.\n  These flaws are not insubstantial, but the benefits of this bill far \noutweigh them. And when it comes to an issue as central to our \ndemocracy as the trust people place in their elected officials, we \ncannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  And make no mistake this is a good bill.\n  We owe that to the stewardship and commitment of Senators McCain and \nFeingold.\n  Throughout these last two weeks, Senators McCain and Feingold have \nshown the same steadfast leadership that brought us to this point.\n  They have refused to compromise the essential components of their \nbill in face of incredible pressure from all sides.\n  And they have acted in the national interest rather than their \nrespective partisan interests.\n  I thank them for their service to our republic and to this Senate.\n  I also want to thank Senator Dodd for his management of this bill for \nour side.\n  Senator Dodd has managed to ensure that every viewpoint within our \ncaucus is heard and accommodated. We would not be on the verge of \npassing this bill without Senator Dodd's commitment to our caucus, to \nour nation, and to reform.\n  I also want to thank Senator McConnell, who has been honest in his \ndisagreement with this bill, and fair in his handling of it.\n  This is indeed the way the Senate should work. A Senate that brings \nup bill, gives members an opportunity to legislate, and entertains deep \nand meaningful debate--is a tribute to us all.\n  It is also a Senate that gets things done.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill does not address every flaw in our campaign \nsystem. But, as Senator Feingold has said so often: ``It does show the \npublic that we understand that the current system doesn't do our \ndemocracy justice.'' And it curbs some of the most egregious injustices \nin that system.\n  There are those who have argued, and will continue to argue, that in \nan attempt to make things better, we will only make things worse.\n  Since its founding, the goal of America has been to strive for that \n``more perfect union'' our founders envisioned. To say that we \nshouldn't attempt to make things better begs the question, ``Is what we \nhave now good enough?''\n  I believe that if you look at the rising tide of money in politics, \nthe influence that money buys, and the corrosive effect it has on \npeople's faith in government, the answer is clearly no.\n  Ours is a government ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' It is not a government of, by, and for some of the people.\n  This bill will help put the reins of government back into the hands \nof all of the people.\n  I hope that we pass it, I hope that our colleagues in the House will \nfollow suit, and I hope the President will sign it.\n  It has taken us a long time to get to this point.\n  The last time Congress tried to strengthen our political system by \nloosening the grip of special interest money was 1974, more than a \ngeneration ago.\n  Congress may not have another chance to pass real campaign reform for \nanother generation, long after most of us will have left here.\n  The decision we make today, whether to pass this bill or not, will \nlikely have a profound impact on each of us for the rest of our time \nhere.\n  More importantly, this decision will have a profound impact --for \nbetter or worse--on the kind of system, and the kind of America, we \nleave to our children.\n  As a wise man once said on another occasion: ``We cannot escape \nhistory.''\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n This is a critical moment in our nation's history.\n  What we do will be remembered for years to come.\n  Success is within our reach.\n  Let us remain united. Let us pass this final test. Let us take the \npower away from the special interests and give it back to the American \npeople, where it belongs.\n  We can do it. The time is now.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nS. 27, the so-called Campaign Finance Reform bill. My opposition is \nbased on three conclusions I have reached regarding this measure. \nFirst, the legislation is unconstitutional; second, the legislation \nwill hinder rather than encourage citizens from participating in the \npolitical process; and third the legislation will push more political \nmoney into the shadows of undisclosed special interest spending.\n  This bill, on its face is unconstitutional on at least three counts. \nThe measure restricts free speech, the right of association, and the \nright of persons to petition their government for redress of \ngrievances.\n  The underlying premise of their campaign finance reform legislation \nis the proponents claim that there is too much in political campaigns, \nand the increasing reliance on and influence of third-party interests \ngroups. While there is a legitimate concern regarding the fairness of \nelections and the need to eliminate the actual or perceived buying and \nselling of elections, this bill take the wrong approach.\n  To address concerns of the reality or appearance of improper \ninfluence stemming from candidates dependence on larger campaign \ncontributions, a number of campaign and election reforms were enacted \nduring the 1970s. These reforms imposed limits on contributions, \nrequired disclosure of campaign receipts and expenditures, and set up \nthe Federal Election Commission, FEC, as a central administrative and \nenforcement agency. This framework has been upheld by the Courts and \nworks well. Campaign contributions and expenditures are fully reported, \ngiving all voters the opportunity to know the basis of support of a \nparticular candidate.\n  I supported the amendment to raise the limit of campaign \ncontributions. The increase in the limit was appropriate, given the \nlimit was established in 1974, and inflation has lessened the value of \nthe 1974 dollar to about 35 cents. More importantly, regulated and \ndisclosed contributions of a reasonable amount assist candidates in \npublicizing their message. Democracy can only be improved by more \npolitical discussion and participation. Yet, supporters of this bill \napparently seek to reduce political funding and associated political \ndiscourse.\n  The bill's limitations on political expenditures are similar to prior \nexpenditure limits struck down by the Supreme Court's landmark Buckely \nv. Valeo ruling [424 U.S. 1 (1976)]. In that case, the Supreme Court \ninvalidated limitations on independent expenditures, on candidate \nexpenditures from personal funds, and on overall campaign expenditures. \nThese provisions, the Court ruled, placed direct and substantial \nrestrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations \nto engage in protected First Amendment rights.\n  The legislation that will likely be adopted by the Senate includes \nlimitations on independent groups who wish to publicize and advocate \ntheir positions on matters of public policy. Attempts to regulate \npolitical speech, even the requirement for limited disclosure, will \nhave a chilling effect on issue oriented speech.\n  The bill restricts the right of citizens to associate and coordinate \ntheir activities of the group as a political party. The limitations on \nparty funding and activities extend to voter registration drives, get-\nout-the-vote drives, and public communications, including advertising, \nmass mailings and phone banks.\n  The purpose of political parties is to identify and elect candidates \nwho support policy choices shared by members of the party. Members of \npolitical parties have a constitutional right to gather together and to \npetition their government for the redress of grievances. The \npending legislation restricts the ability to associate, to raise needed \nfunds for legitimate party activities, and to adequately publish the \nmessage of the party. Again, this impedes political participation and \nonly helps incumbents maintain their advantage in the electoral \nprocess.\n\n  The bill will have the consequence of pushing political spending from \nthe regulated and disclosed ``hard money'' side into the unregulated, \nundisclosed world of third-party independent expenditures. I do not \nbelieve this measure will reduce the amount of money spent on \ncampaigns. But I do fear it will result in candidates losing control of \ntheir own campaigns. As direct candidate and party support are limited, \nI believe there will be a move by independent groups to exercise their \nconstitutional right to speak on political matters. Candidates and \nparties will be left defenseless against the onslaught of such \nadvertising. This will likely result in less open political discourse, \nand an increase in the ``noise'' level of attack ads and \nunsubstantiated political claims.\n  My campaign days are over. I have no personal interest in the manner \nin which campaigns will be financed or run in the future. But I do have \nan interest in defending the liberty and constitutional rights of my \nconstituents. This legislation restricts those rights and will \ndiscourage their participation in the political process.\n  For these reasons I will not support final passage of S. 27. I \nexpress my appreciation to the Senate, for the manner in which the \ndebate has been conducted. In particular, I thank the Chairman of the \nRules Committee, Mr. McConnell, for his leadership in protecting the \nConstitution and defending the rights and liberties of all Americans.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield for the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have had a full two week debate on \nthe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001. It has been a good debate, \nand the bill has been improved and perfected in many respects. Thirty-\neight amendments were offered, and 17 were adopted. Our vote this \nevening will be the 27th roll call vote of the debate. All Senators \nhave had an opportunity to make a mark on the bill, and I think the \nSenate and the country have benefitted from this full and fair debate.\n  The sponsors and supporters of the bill have done everything we can \nto address legitimate concerns about its provisions. In some cases, \namendments were offered and adopted, in others, sections of the bill \nwere dropped. Still, this is a complex area of the law, and we know \nthat questions remain about how certain provisions are intended to \nwork. We want to try to answer as many of those questions as we can.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, two weeks is a long debate in the Senate. \nI want to thank all my colleagues for their participation and their \ncooperation. We hope that many of the questions that might arise about \nthe intent of our bill have been answered in this extraordinary \nexchange in which so many Senators have taken part. But other questions \nwill undoubtedly come up. To the extent we can anticipate those \nquestions, we want to make sure that our intent is clear.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent on behalf of myself, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Thompson, Senator Lieberman, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Levin, Senator Snowe, Senator Schumer, Senator Cochran, Senator \nCollins, Senator Cantwell, Senator Edwards, and Senator Durbin, that a \ndocument entitled Statement of Supporters of the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act of 2001 Concerning Intent of Certain Provisions be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Supporters of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 \n                Concerning Intent of Certain Provisions\n\n       As supporters of S. 27, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \n     of 2001, we want to make clear our intent with respect to \n     certain questions that have been raised concerning the effect \n     and operation of the bill. We intend this statement to be \n     guidance for our colleagues in the House, the Federal \n     Election Commission, and the courts should there be any \n     misunderstanding about these provisions in the bill.\n       New section 323(c)--We intend that this restriction on the \n     use of non-federal money for fundraising costs should not \n     apply to an authorized campaign committee of a candidate for \n     state or local office.\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\n       New section 323(d)--We intend that this restriction on the \n     raising of non-federal money by the parties, their officials, \n     or entities controlled by parties or their officials for tax \n     exempt organizations should only apply to 501(c) \n     organizations that have made or intend to make disbursements \n     in connection with a federal election, including Federal \n     election activities as defined by the bill. Thus, charitable \n     contributions to groups like the Red Cross are not restricted \n     as long as those groups do not use money donated by the party \n     for Federal election activities. Furthermore, the 527 \n     organizations referred to in new section 323(d)(2) are not \n     intended to include state or local party committees or \n     authorized campaign committees of state or local candidates. \n     Finally, nothing in this provision is intended to affect the \n     prohibition of national parties and federal candidates and \n     officeholders raising or spending non-federal money.\n       The definition of ``Federal election activity'' in section \n     101(b) was modified by the Specter amendment. That amendment \n     is intended to provide that if subclause (iii), which \n     describes a certain type of public communication, is held to \n     be unconstitutional, then an additional limitation on that \n     type of public communication is to be added, narrowing the \n     reach of the definition.\n       The reporting requirements in the new section 304(d) added \n     by section 103(a) of the bill are not intended to apply to \n     authorized campaign committees of state and local candidates \n     whose only expenditures on Federal election activities do not \n     refer to a Federal candidates.\n       Only the direct costs of producing and airing \n     electioneering communications is intended to be included in \n     determining whether a person reaches the $10,000 aggregate \n     amount of disbursements that triggers the reporting \n     requirements of Snowe-Jeffords.\n       The reference to a clearly identified candidate is intended \n     to mean a candidate who is up for election in that two-year \n     cycle. Therefore, if one Senator is up for election in a \n     cycle, an ad that appears within 60 days of an election and \n     mentions only the second Senator for that state is not an \n     electioneering communication, even though the second Senator \n     is also technically a candidate for election some years \n     hence.\n       With respect to the requirement that an advertisement be \n     targeted to the electorate of the candidate who is mentioned \n     in the ad for it to be an electioneering communication, if \n     the ad reaches only an incidental number of members of the \n     electorate for that race, the ad would not be an \n     electioneering communication. (This might theoretically \n     happen, for example, because the station on which a true \n     issue ad is broadcast happens to reach a small number of \n     households in another state, or because a few people from the \n     candidate's state happens to be traveling in the state where \n     a true issue ad is run.)\n       A communication that mentions candidates' names only in the \n     context of announcing or promoting a non-partisan candidate \n     debate or forum is not intended to be considered an \n     electioneering communication.\n       The Snowe-Jeffords provision is intended to have no effect \n     on the determination by the Internal Revenue Service of what \n     kinds of activities tax-exempt organizations are permitted to \n     engage in under the Internal Revenue Code.\n         John McCain; Russ Feingold; Thad Cochran; Carl Levin; \n           Fred Thompson; Joe Lieberman; Susan Collins; Chuck \n           Schumer; Olympia Snowe; John Edwards; Jim Jeffords; \n           Maria Cantwell; Dick Durbin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the road this \nlegislation has traveled, and thank the many Members of this body, past \nand present, who have helped to bring us to this moment.\n  It has been a long road to this moment, and we wouldn't even have \nbegun this journey without the tenacity, dedication and the courage of \nmy good friend from Arizona. He is a great legislator, a great leader, \nand, above all, a great friend. He and I have been in this fight for \nmany years, and my respect for him has grown with every challenge we \nhave faced together.\n  We have gotten to this moment because of his leadership first and \nforemost, but also because of the leadership of so many distinguished \ncolleagues who have given this bill their support along the way. I want \nto take a few moments to recognize some of the Members have contributed \nto this legislation.\n  I want to thank our earliest supporters, who gave their support to \nthe McCain-Feingold bill when it was first introduced in the 104th \nCongress, Senators such as John Glenn, Paul Simon, Nancy Kassebaum-\nBaker, and Alan Simpson, who gave us crucial bipartisan support when \nthis effort was just getting off the ground. This kind of bipartisan \nbill wasn't totally unprecedented but it was pretty unusual, and the \nsupport of those distinguished Senators lent important credibility to \nour effort in its early days.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman, who has been a steadfast supporter of \nreform, and who helped to build crucial momentum for this legislation \nwith his leadership on the 527 disclosure bill in the last Congress. \nThe success of that legislation was a great breakthrough after so many \nyears when any reform effort was stonewalled by our opponents. The day \nthat that bill passed the Senate, I remember thinking that enactment of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill was not going to be far behind.\n  And of course the great breakthrough at the beginning of this \nCongress was the day when Senator Thad Cochran joined us in introducing \nthis bill. I have great respect for Senator Cochran, and his support on \nthis issue has been invaluable. I cannot thank him enough for his \ncommitment to this legislation. Once he joined our effort, he was with \nus with every ounce of determination and grace that he brings to all of \nhis work here in the Senate.\n  One of our newest Members, Senator Maria Cantwell also gave us \nimportant momentum when she made campaign finance reform a central \nissue in her campaign, and gave this bill her strong support. After her \nvictory, the oft-repeated claim that no Senator has ever lost an \nelection over this issue could simply no longer be made.\n  Senator John Edwards and Senator Chuck Schumer have both been a \nterrific asset on this issue, especially right here on the Senate \nfloor. Both of them have devoted a great deal of their time, and their \nskill as debaters, to this bill, and I am very grateful for their \nefforts.\n  The efforts of Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator Jim Jeffords to \ncraft the phony issue ad provision have been essential to this \nlegislation. They worked tirelessly to put together a balanced \nprovision that gets at the root of the issue ad problem, and I thank \nthem for their tremendous contribution. The Snowe-Jeffords provision is \nan integral part of our bill, and their mastery of this topic was \ninvaluable to us.\n  I want to particularly thank Senator Carl Levin for his leadership \nand support, during the last 2 weeks, indeed during every debate we \nhave had on this bill since 1996. His insight on the substance of the \nissue, and on the workings of this body have been absolutely crucial to \nthe advancement of this legislation. Senator Levin is as tenacious and \ncommitted as any Member of this body. We truly would not be here today \nif he were not on this team.\n  I am deeply grateful to Senator Fred Thompson for this longstanding \nand steadfast support of this bill, and for his great skill and \nfairness in negotiating an agreement on hard money limits that the vast \nmajority of this body could support. Without that agreement, we would \nnot be poised to pass this bill. I also want to pay special tribute to \nSenator Thompson for the work he did investigating the 1996 campaign \nfinance scandals.\n  I also thank our distinguished colleague Senator Susan Collins for \nher invaluable contributions to this effort. She came on board our bill \nas a freshman Senator in 1997, in spite of tremendous pressure from her \ncaucus. Over the years, we have met together with many of our \ncolleagues. She has been a tireless advocate for reform, a terrific \nally in this fight, and I'm proud to call her a friend and a colleague.\n  I thank Senator Chris Dodd for his tremendous work as floor manager \non the Democratic side. He led us through these past 2 weeks with grace \nand humor and a fierce passion for reform that I deeply respect and for \nwhich I am deeply grateful.\n  And finally, I thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle, for \neverything he has done to bring about the success of this legislation. \nIn the fall of 1997, the entire Democratic Caucus united behind this \nlegislation, and that unity has been crucial to our success.\n  But when this debate began 2 weeks ago, a skeptical press corps \nwondered whether Democrats really wanted to pass reform. We are about \nto cast this vote on final passage because Tom Daschle was true to the \nprinciples of this party and led our caucus to follow through on the \ncommitment we made to reform 3\\1/2\\ years ago. I am proud of the \nbipartisan effort we have made, but I am also proud to be a Democrat, \nand I deeply appreciate the solid support of my caucus on many crucial \nvotes over the past two weeks.\n  That is a long list of thank you's, but they are all well deserved.\n  In closing, Mr. President, five and a half years after Senator McCain \nand I\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nfirst introduced this bill, we are about to have the first up-or-down \nvote on final passage of this legislation. I have been so proud to be \npart of a bipartisan coalition of Senators who have brought this bill \nto this moment and, of course, I am especially proud to be associated \nwith John McCain. I say to the Senator, this has been a heartening \nexperience.\n  With every test over the last 2 weeks, our coalition has grown \nstronger and more determined to end sham issue ads, improve disclosure, \nand, most of all, ban soft money which makes this Senate so vulnerable \nto the appearance of corruption. I urge each and every Member of this \nbody to support this bill. It isn't comprehensive reform. It is a \nmodest beginning, and I hope in the future we can do much more to \nimprove the way we finance campaigns.\n  But this bill, however modest, is also monumental. This is the best \nchance we have had in more than two decades to rebuild the election \nlaws that have been nearly washed away by the influx of soft money. The \nsystem that came from the Federal Election Campaign Act, and was \naltered by the Buckley decision, has never been perfect, and I am sure \nit never will be. But the system once served the Nation well, and it \ncan be reformed to serve the Nation well again if we pass the \nlegislation before us.\n  When we stand in this Chamber, we all know that what we say here, and \nhow we choose to cast our votes, becomes a part of the record. All of \nus have that privilege, to be a part of that history, to add our own \nwords to that indelible record of democracy. We have that privilege \nbecause the American people sent us here to be stewards of this system \nof government. The record is the testament to how well we fulfill that \nduty, and today I think the record will reflect that we served the \npeople.\n  In this moment, we can show the American people that we are the \nSenate they want us to be. We can pass this legislation and put our \nlasting mark on the record of democracy, for ourselves and, most of \nall, for the people we serve.\n  Mr. President, this is a rare moment. I hope this body will seize \nthis opportunity to enact real reform. My colleagues, I thank you for \nyour support and for your work, and I especially thank the people of \nWisconsin for supporting me throughout this effort. I thank my very \nable staff for their work.\n  My colleagues, I ask all of you now to vote in favor of this bill, S. \n27, on final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield for the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is now time for the Senate to step up to \nthe plate, as we open this baseball season, to do what needs to be \ndone--to bring an end to the soft money loophole that has destroyed the \nlaw that is supposed to place limits on campaign contributions.\n  Passage of McCain-Feingold will bring an end to solicitations and \ncontributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for \naccess to people in power--``lunch with the committee chairman of our \nchoice for $50,000,'' ``time with the President for $100,000,'' \n``participation in a foreign trade mission with Government officials \nfor $50,000.''\n  The moment of truth is now--with this vote--because this is the first \ntime we are voting with the real possibility that what we do here can \nbecome law.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about two concerns about the \nimpact of this legislation that I have heard from some of my \ncolleagues--that the parties will be weakened and that the soft money \nwill now flow to the outside groups. It is true, of course, that no one \ncan predict with certainty just what will happen once the soft money \nloophole is closed and provisions with respect to issue ads are in \nplace. There is some of the unknown to what we are doing here today. \nBut I'd like to remind those concerned about the parties and the \nincreased strength of outside groups that there are provisions in the \nbill to ameliorate those concerns.\n  First, with respect to the parties, while the bill eliminates soft \nmoney, it also increases the hard money limits to the parties and makes \nthose limits subject to indexing. The bill also contains an amendment I \nsponsored along with Senator Ensign, that will allow State parties to \nraise and spend non-Federal money subject to the State contribution \nlimits for voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities in a \nFederal election year. The bill as introduced prohibited any money not \nsubject to the federal limits from being used even by State parties for \nvoter registration or get-out-the-vote activities in a Federal election \nyear. Many of us thought that provision went too far, since these \nactivities are often the heart of what State parties do. The provision \nwe added by amendment has a number of limits. Federal candidates and \nNational Party Officials can't be involved in soliciting the State \nparty money, the State party can't refer to a Federal candidate in \nconducting these activities, and a State, district or local committee \ncan't raise more than $10,000 from any one person for these activities \nin a calendar year and the activities must be paid for with a formula \nof federal and non-federal money established by the Federal Election \nCommission. This provision will enable State parties to engage in \nimportant voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities.\n  With respect to the flow of money to outside groups, the bill \ncontains several brakes on that happening. First, Federal candidates \nare barred from soliciting non-federal money not only for the parties \nbut also for these outside groups. Many people who make large \ncontributions do so because we personally ask them to do so. Without \nthat personal involvement, most large contributors will not contribute, \nand the large sums of soft money that are now being given to the \nparties, will simply not be raised or spent anymore. The bill also \nprohibits unions and corporations from running issue ads in the last 30 \ndays of a primary election and the last 60 days of a general election. \nThat will significantly reduce the amount of sham issue ads run in the \ndays before an election. Finally, the national parties which in the \npast have contributed significant sums of money to these outside groups \nwill not be in a position to do that with the absence of soft money.\n  So, Mr. President, while I understand these concerns, and realize to \nsome extent we are all stepping into unknown territory with the \nenactment of this legislation, there are a number of moderating \ninfluences in the bill that should avoid the draconian effects \nsuggested by some of our colleagues.\n  I would also, Mr. President, like to address a statement made by my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, the other night. He said in his \nstatement opposing this legislation on the Senate floor, that this \nlegislation would prohibit him from selling his house and using all of \nthe money from that house to support a candidate of his choice. The \nSenator was passionate about how wrong such an outcome could be. But, \nMr. President, the legislation would not create such a prohibition. \nSenator Gramm and any other individual in the United States could sell \neverything he or she owns and use it to promote such a candidacy. This \nbill would not prevent that. The Supreme Court has said that is a right \nguaranteed to everyone under the Constitution. What this legislation \ndoes and what the Supreme Court says is permitted under the \nConstitution, is prohibit Senator Gramm from using the proceeds of the \nsale of his house to contribute to a candidate or a political party in \namounts that exceed the limits established by the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. An individual can spend an unlimited amount of money in \nsupport of a candidate, so long as those expenditures are not \ncoordinated with a candidate. But an individual cannot contribute an \nunlimited amount of money to a candidate, because, as Congress has \ndetermined and the Supreme Court has affirmed, unlimited or large \ncontributions can create the appearance of corruption which can damage \nthe institution of democracy.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say a few words about the so-called \nMillionaire's amendment we adopted that was sponsored by Senators \nDomenici, DeWine and Durbin. It is a complicated proposal and one with \nwhich we had insufficient time to work. It needed more consideration in \norder to achieve the fair result that I believe we intended. I am \nafraid that the amendment as drafted, although improved by the Durbin \nAmendment, is still too advantageous to incumbents and too\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\ncumbersome to administer. I hope this can be addressed at a later stage \nor even in subsequent legislation, and I hope the Federal Election \nCommission proceeds carefully and with extensive public comment when \nimplementing the statutory language. The intent of the Durbin amendment \nwas to reduce the incumbency advantage that the original amendment \ncreated when it allowed a well-funded incumbent to use the increased \ncontribution limits even though the incumbent's expenditures and cash \non hand far exceeded the millionaire challenger's. The Durbin amendment \ntried to reduce the effect of the original amendment by requiring the \nmillionaire to reach one-half of the amount of expenditures plus cash \non hand that the incumbent has before the higher limits are triggered. \nWhile this is an improvement, I think we need to work with the numbers \nto see if another approach would be preferable.\n  Mr. President, 25 years ago this Congress passed a pretty decent \ncampaign finance law.\n  Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate \nper election, or $5,000 to a political action committee, or more than \n$20,000 a year to a national party committee or $25,000 total in any \none year for all contributions combined.\n  Corporations and unions are prohibited from contributing anything to \na candidate except through carefully prescribed political action \ncommittees. The limit of a corporate or union PAC contribution is \n$5,000 per candidate.\n  Presidential campaigns are supposed to be financed just with public \nfunds.\n  That's the law on the books today.\n  The Supreme Court upheld those contribution limits in the case of \nBuckley v. Valeo and reasserted that position in the recent case of \nNixon v. Missouri Government Shrink PAC. In those cases the Supreme \nCourt held that limits on contributions in campaigns do not violate \nfree speech guarantees in the First Amendment.\n\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld contribution limits as \na reasonable and constitutional approach to deterring actual and \napparent corruption of federal elections in the Buckley case. Let me \nread what the Court said:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private \n     financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal \n     or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from \n     others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a \n     successful campaign. . . . To the extent that large \n     contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's \n     from current and potential office holders, the integrity of \n     our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . \n     Of almost equal concern is . . . the impact of the appearance \n     of corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions. . . . Congress could \n     legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of \n     improper influence ``is also critical . . . if confidence in \n     the system of representative government is not to be eroded \n     to a disastrous extent.''\n\n  The Court went on to say:\n\n       And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary \n     purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was \n     surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a \n     partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a \n     necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or \n     appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting \n     unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities \n     of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions \n     are fully disclosed.\n\n  The Buckley Court at several points in the opinion endorses the \nconcept that unlimited contributions are enough, by themselves, to \ncreate the appearance of corruption and to justify the imposition of \nlimits.\n  In Nixon v. Missouri Government Shrink PAC, decided in January of \nlast year, the Supreme Court was presented with a challenge to campaign \ncontribution limits established by the state of Missouri. In that case, \nJustice Souter, speaking for a majority of the Court clearly upheld the \nBuckley decision.\n  But the soft money loophole that has evolved over the past 15 years \nor so has effectively destroyed the contribution limits. The loophole \nis huge--since you can't give more than a limited amount to a \ncandidate, give all you want to his or her party--and of course the \nparty uses the money to elect that same candidate.\n  Soft money has blown the lid off the contribution limits of our \ncampaign finance system.\n  Look at the most recent data with respect to soft money \ncontributions. In the 1996 election--a Presidential election year--\nRepublicans raised $140 million in soft money contributions; Democrats \nraised $120 million. In 1998, even without a Presidential election--\nRepublicans raised $131 million in soft money contributions and \nDemocrats raised $91 million. The 1997-98 combined soft money total was \n115% more than the 1993-1994 total. And in the 1999-2000 campaign \ncycle, the Congressional Research Service reports that Republicans and \nDemocrats both raised about $240 million. That's money from \ncorporations and unions--who are not supposed to be giving any money at \nall. Approximately $280 million of the almost half billion in soft \nmoney to the parties came from corporations and unions and $175 million \nfrom individuals. And that's money from individual contributors in sums \noften in six figures--hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to \nthe Center for Responsive Politics, in the 1999-2000 campaign 365 \nindividuals gave the parties $120,000 or more for a total amount of \nover $98 million--when the limit on individual contributions is \nsupposed to be $1,000 per election. The soft money loophole has eaten \nthe law.\n  As many commentators, colleagues and constituents have said, \npractically speaking, there are no limits. And the truth is, Mr. \nPresident, the public is offended and disgusted by this spectacle of \nhuge contributions and well they should be. We should be, too. Because \nin order to get these large contributions, access to us is often openly \nand blatantly sold. We sell lunch or dinner with the Committee Chairman \nof your choice for $100,000 bucks. We sell pictures with the President, \naccess to insiders meetings and strategy sessions, participation in a \nCongressional advisory group or a trade mission. The open solicitation \nof campaign contributions in exchange for access to people with the \npower to affect the life or livelihood of the person being solicited \ncreates an appearance of impropriety and a misuse of power. People who \nare in power are asking for large sums of money for access to them.\n  This is done openly. Marlin Fitzwater, Press Secretary to former \nPresident Bush said it clearly in 1992 when he said, ``It's buying \naccess to the system, yes. That's what the political parties and the \npolitical operation is all about.'' Former Senator Paul Simon made a \nsimilar observation a number of years ago on the Senate floor. That's \nwhy over 25 persons--corporations and individuals gave over $100,000 \neach to both parties. They didn't contribute because of shared values, \nobviously. They contributed to cover their bets--to make sure they had \naccess to the winner. They had enough money to do that. That's how far \nthis system has fallen. The parties advertise access. It's blatant. \nBoth parties do it. Openly.\n\n  Invitation after invitation sells access for large contributions. \nFrom 1996: For a $50,000 contribution or for raising $100,000 a \ncontributor gets:\n  Two events with the President.\n  Two events with the Vice President.\n  Invitations to join ``Party leadership as they travel abroad to \nexamine current and developing political and economic issues in other \ncountries.\n  Monthly policy briefings with ``key administration officials and \nmembers of Congress.\n  An invitation to the 1997 RNC Annual Gala says a contributor who \nraises $250,000 will be entitled to have lunch with the Republican \nSenate and House Committee Chairman of the contributor's choice.\n  That's what we're openly offering for sale for large contributors and \nthat's what contributors are often buying. Both parties do it, and \nthere are dozens of examples.\n  One invitation in 1997 to a Senatorial Campaign Committee event \npromised that large contributors would be offered ``plenty of \nopportunities to share [their] personal ideas and vision with\" some of \nthe top leaders and senators. Failure to attend, the invitation said, \nmeans that ``you could lose a unique chance to be included in current \nlegislative policy debates--debates that will affect your family and \nyour business for many years to come.''\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\n  One letter from a Senatorial Campaign Committee invited the recipient \nto be a life member of the party's Inner Circle. It said that $10,000 \nwill ``bring you face-to-face with dozens of our Senators, including \nmany of the Senate's most powerful Committee Chairmen.''\n  Another solicitation offered, for a contribution of $10,000, the \nchoice of ``attending one of 60 small dinner parties, limited in \nattendance to 20 to 25 people, at the home of a Senator, Cabinet \nOfficer, or senior White House Staff member.''\n  One offer for membership in a Senatorial Trust said, ``Trust members \ncan expect a close working relationship with all [of the party's] \nSenators, top Administration officials and other national leaders. \nPersonal relationships are fostered at informal meetings throughout the \nyear in Washington, D.C. and abroad.''\n  Another solicitation offers lunch at the White House with the \nPresident and his wife. It also goes so far as to say that ``Attendance \nat all events is limited. Benefits based on receipts.'' That means you \ndon't get the benefit until the cash is in hand. Pledges of \ncontributions are not enough. That's how blatant these offers to \npurchase access have become.\n  The sale of access to small, private meetings is the product of the \nsoft money loophole. The amounts we see on these solicitations aren't \n$1,000 and $2,000 contributions. They're large--$50,000 or $100,000 \ncontributions in soft money. The soft money loophole has increased and \nintensified the sale of access. The soft money loophole is swallowing \nour political system whole.\n  Do these large money contributions create an appearance of personal \naccess and improper influence by big contributors? Yes. Look at the \nkinds of articles that are being written about the ups and downs of \npending legislation. Many of them draw links--in my mind unfairly--\nbetween large soft money contributions and legislative activity. Here's \none from the Wall Street Journal on the bankruptcy legislation. It even \nhas a chart of all the organizations in the Coalition for Responsible \nBankruptcy Laws and the amount each contributed to the Democrats and \nRepublicans. Here's a similar one from the New York Times. The opening \nparagraph reads: ``A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and \nbanks that gave millions of dollars in political donations to members \nof Congress and contributed generously to President Bush's 200 campaign \nis close to its long sought goal of overhauling the nation's bankruptcy \nsystem.''\n  Here's another recent article from the New York Times linking large \nsoft money contributions to ambassadorships. Here's another Wall Street \nJournal article from last year talking about the so-called ``wish \nlist'' of large contributors to the Bush campaign. And, of course, we \nare all well aware of the stories linking President Clinton's pardons \nto campaign contributions.\n  These articles are the evidence of the appearance of impropriety \ncreated with large soft money contributions.\n\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court also answered ``yes'' to the \nquestion whether large contributions create the appearance of \nimpropriety. It found an appearance of corruption created from the size \nof the contribution alone, without even looking at the sale of access.\n  It noted, ``Congress was justified in concluding that the interest in \nsafeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the \nopportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary \ncontributions be eliminated.''\n  Add to the equation the actual sale of access for large \ncontributions, and you have an even greater ``opportunity for abuse'' \nand the appearance of corruption.\n  These soft money contributions are not used just for get out the vote \nor voter registration activities, which is how the loophole got started \nin the first place. The truth is they are most often used for \ntelevision ads that appear in thousands of spots in support of and \nagainst individual candidates. The truth is, while the parties claim \nthese ads are issue ads, they clearly have one purpose--to help elect \nor defeat a particular candidate.\n  The Brennan Center analyzed all of the ads from the 1998 election ads \npaid for with hard money (candidate ads), and ads paid for with soft \nmoney (sham issue ads) and they found practically no difference. \nAlthough the Supreme Court in Buckley attempted to define a candidate \nad as one actually promoting the election or defeat of a candidate \nthrough the use of words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' the \nBrennan Center found that over 90% of the candidate ads, didn't do \nthat--they didn't say ``elect'' or ``defeat'' or ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst'' a particular candidate. They were, it appears, virtually \nindistinguishable from the sham issue ads directed at a particular \ncandidate and paid for with soft money.\n  In the 1996 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee \nran ads on welfare and crime and the budget which were basically \ndesigned to support President Clinton's reelection. At our hearings on \nthe campaign finance system, Harold Ickes was asked about these DNC ads \nand the extent to which the people looking at the ads would walk away \nwith the message to vote for President Clinton. ``I would certainly \nhope so,'' he said. ``If not, we ought to fire the ad agencies.''\n  Listen to this ad from the Republican National Committee on behalf of \nthen Presidential candidate Bob Dole.\n\n       Mr. Dole: We have a moral obligation to give our children \n     an America with the opportunity and values of the nation we \n     grew up in.\n       Voice Over: Bob Dole grew up in Russell, Kansas. From his \n     parents he learned the value of hard work, honetsy and \n     responsibility. So when his country called, he answered. He \n     was seriously wounded in combat. Paralyzed, he underwent nine \n     operations.\n       Mr. Dole: I went around looking for a miracle that would \n     make me whole again.\n       Voice Over: The doctors said he'd never walk again. But \n     after 39 months, he proved them wrong.\n       A Man Named Ed: He persevered, he never gave up. He fought \n     his way back from total paralysis.\n       Voice Over: Like many Americans, his life experience and \n     values serve as a strong moral compass. The principle of work \n     to replace welfare. The principle of accountability to \n     strengthen our criminal justice system. The principle of \n     discipline to end wasteful Washington spending.\n       Mr. Dole: It all comes down to values. What you believe in. \n     What you sacrifice for. And what you stand for.\n\n  That ad was paid for with soft money contributed to the Republican \nNational Committee. And that's argued as permissible under current law, \nbecause that ad doesn't explicitly ask the viewer to vote for Bob Dole. \nIt spends its whole time talking positively about him just before the \nelection. If it added 4 words at the end that say what the ad is all \nabout, ``Vote for Bob Dole,'' it would be treated as a candidate ad, \nnot an issue ad, and would be subject to the hard money limits. Well, \nany reasonable person who hears that ad knows it is an ad supporting \nthe candidacy of Bob Dole. It is not an ad about welfare or wasteful \ngovernment spending. And in my book, it should have to be paid for with \nregulated or hard money contributions. That isn't the case today.\n  So, Mr. President, the truth is that this kind of candidate \nadvertising, which should clearly be subject to contribution limits, \nescapes those limits through the soft money loophole. And it's that \nsoft money loophole that the bill before us would close. It would ban \nthe solicitation or receipt of soft money by the national parties; it \nwould ban the solicitation or receipt of soft money by the candidates \nor their representatives.\n  Mr. President, the large majority of the American people want \ncampaign finance reform. The large majority of the American people want \nus to clean up our act. We're the only ones who can do it.\n  As the Supreme Court said in Buckley, an appearance of corruption is \n``inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions.'' \nAnd permitting the appearance of corruption undermines the very \nfoundation of our democracy--the trust of the people in the system. We \nhave the right to protect our democratic institutions from being \nundermined by the open sale of access for large contributions which \npeople believe reasonably translates into influence. It's time to step \nup to the plate.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to \nthe two Senators who made this moment possible Senator John McCain and \nSenator Russ Feingold. They have been warriors in this fight for \ncampaign finance reform. They have pushed this when it wasn't popular \nto do so, and they have made what many thought impossible a reality. It \ntook guts and\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nsavvy, and I commend and congratulate them. I also commend our \nDemocratic Leader, Tom Daschle. Without his strength and vision, this \nlegislation would not have happened. Senator Daschle steered a course \nfor our side that kept us on the road to reform. I don't know if anyone \nelse could have done what he did--and, as always, he does it with grace \nand wit and charm. I commend Senator McConnell for his very strong and \nfair fight. He is as dedicated to his position as we are to ours. He is \nan intimidating opponent and has our respect for his dedication and \nperseverence. I know he is not happy with the outcome, but I believe \nhis dire predictions will be unrealized. I also want to congratulate \nSenator Dodd on his tireless and brilliant service as the Democratic \nfloor manager. His ability to capture the essence of an issue and \nrelated it to real life so we can all understand it is impressive. He \nserved the Senate well in this open-ended and somewhat unpredictable \ndebate.\n  I also want to thank the staff who worked so hard and so diligently \non this effort. Bob Schiff and Mark Busse did a terrific job serving at \nthe center of this great spinning wheel of legislation; they combined \nboth excellent legal and political skills to keep the bill on track. \nKennie Gill served everyone well as the staff floor manager. Laurie \nRubenstein provided excellent legal advice, and Andrea LaRue did a \ngreat job keeping the Democratic Leadership represented and informed. I \nalso want to thank Linda Gustitus and Ken Saccoccia of my staff for \ntheir endless time and truly extraordinary effort. It is certainly \nrewarding that this good work has paid off with the passage of this \nbill.\n\n\n                         loan payback provision\n\n  Two weeks ago the Senate passed an amendment to this bill that allows \nan increase in the individual contribution limits when a candidate is \nchallenging a ``so-called'' millionaire candidate. Included in that \namendment was a provision that prohibits candidates from repaying \npersonal loans over $250,000 with contributions from other persons. \nThis provision was enacted on a prospective basis; in other words, this \nprovision would not apply to any candidate loans incurred before the \nenactment of this legislation.\n  I want to ask my good friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, whether it \nis his understanding that the underlying intent in making this \nprovision prospective is because this is the only fair and reasonable \napproach in this situation. Does the Senator from Arizona agree that it \nwould be unreasonable and unfair to expect a candidate who conducted a \ncampaign according to one set of rules to have to retroactively attempt \nto apply new rules? Isn't applying this provision on a prospective \nbasis the only fair and reasonable approach?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator's understanding is correct on the \ninterpretation of the loan payback provision. It is intentionally \nprospective because it would be unfair to do otherwise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This vote counts. It is real, it is not a signal or a \nmessage.\n  I thank the Chair and commend our good friends, Senators McCain and \nFeingold.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, while many Senators have had a very \nactive and effective role in bringing us to this point on this \nlegislation, I think we should not forget that there are two Senators \nwho really deserve real credit--Senators McCain and Feingold. Because \nof their perseverance, determination, and effective leadership, they \nhave brought us to the point where we are nearing passage of this \nlegislative reform effort of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  While nobody can be really certain exactly what the implications of \nall of the provisions will be, I am convinced we are going to see this \neffort as a major step toward improving the Federal election campaign \nsystem and restoring the confidence of the American people in the \nintegrity of the political process. That is very important, and I am \nvery glad to have been a part of it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, at the beginning of this debate I pleaded \nwith my colleagues to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and \npraise God they have. We have. Is this bill perfect? No, far from it. \nIs it good? A heck of a lot better than the present system, you bet it \nis.\n  I thank our leader, Senator McCain, particularly for his courage, and \nSenator Feingold, particularly for his integrity and leadership, and \nSenator Daschle and Senator Dodd for keeping our party together.\n  I also thank all my colleagues in the Senate. Today and these past 2 \nweeks represent the Senate at its best. Every time a crippling \namendment came up, we rose to the occasion and defeated it. This is the \nSenate the Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  Mr. President, my guess is, if Jefferson or Madison or Washington \nwere looking down on this Chamber today, they would smile.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield for the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this is a good day for the Senate. It \ndemonstrates once again that this body can respond to its public's \nneeds. Even the casual observer must agree that our change from a \nsystem of the small contributor to the huge contributor is not good for \nthis country. To those who say we are launching off into uncharted \nwaters, that we are unsure how this might affect us as politicians or \nour political committees in Washington, I say that we as elected \nofficials can never be harmed if our country is benefited. We as \nelected officials can never be harmed if we are doing something that \nincreases the public trust. And if we are, Mr. President, so be it, \nbecause we must know that we are doing the right thing.\n  Mr. President, twenty-seven years ago Congress decided to fix a \ncampaign finance system that was clearly broken. The American public \nwas scandal-weary and increasingly cynical about the integrity of the \npolitical process. In 1974, the President signed into law the Federal \nElection Campaign Act. Unions and corporations had long been prohibited \nfrom contributing to campaigns, and that year Congress decided to limit \nthe amount of money an individual could give to candidates and parties \nto avoid corruption, and just as important, the appearance of \ncorruption, in our system. Those limits on contributions were upheld by \nthe Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo. The Court stated, ``[T]he Act's \nprimary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \nresulting from large individual financial contributions--[provides] a \nconstitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution \nlimitation.'' The Court also upheld the constitutionality of limits on \ncontributions to political parties. The Court found such limits serve \nto prevent evasion of the $1,000 limitation on contributions to \ncandidates by an individual ``who might otherwise contribute massive \namounts to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked \ncontributions to political committees likely to contribute to that \ncandidate or huge contributions to the candidate's political party.''\n  Just last year, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the position it took in \nBuckley. In Nixon v. Shrink Missouri PAC, the Court upheld an \nindividual contribution limit of $1,050 under Missouri law and found, \n``[T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions \nwill work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to \nquestion the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.''\n  In the years following the passage of FECA, amendments to the Act and \ncertain FEC regulations and rulings attempted to clarify the law, \nparticularly as it related to state parties. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the a statement by campaign finance expert and \nscholar Tony Corrado, a professor at Colby College, that explains \nthoroughly the origin and rise of soft money, be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in short, in the late 1970s, Congress \nand the FEC attempted to address concerns by state parties regarding \ntheir use of non-Federally regulated funds in elections involving both \nstate and federal candidates. The Commission determined that state \nparties could use non-\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nFederal money, also known as soft money, to fund a portion of \nactivities related to federal elections. The national parties soon \nargued that those rules applied to them as well since they also \nparticipated in state and local elections. By the mid-1980s, both \nparties were actively raising soft money in the millions of dollars, \nprimarily for voter registration drives and turnout programs conducted \nby state party committees. By 1992, the national party committees \nraised about $80 million in soft money and were spending the funds on \nactivities that were designed to influence both federal and non-federal \nelections such as generic television advertising that did not mention a \nspecific candidate. I ask unanimous consent that a November 5, 1984 \nletter from Fred Wertheimer to the FEC regarding soft money be printed \nin the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in 1995, the Clinton-Gore campaign began \nusing soft money to fund candidate specific issue ads. They argued that \nbecause these ads did not use ``magic words'' such as ``vote for'' or \n``vote against'' that they were not campaign ads and thus could be \nfunded with soft money. The Republican Party soon followed suit, and \nthe demand for soft money increased exponentially. Soft money receipts \nby the two major parties exceeded $260 million in 1996.\n  There was little doubt at that point that the soft money raised by \nthe parties was being used for campaign purposes. While addressing a \ngroup of DNC donors in 1996, President Clinton made clear that their \ncontributions were helping his campaign,\n\n       [W]e even gave up one or two of our fundraisers at the end \n     of the year to try to get more money to the Democratic Party \n     rather than my campaigns. My original strategy had been to \n     raise all the money for my campaign this year, so I could \n     spend all my money next year being president, running for \n     president, and raising money for the Senate and House \n     Committees and for the Democratic Party. And then we realized \n     we could run these ads through the Democratic Party, which \n     meant that we could raise money in twenty and fifty and \n     hundred thousand dollar lots, and we didn't have to do it all \n     in thousand dollars, and run down--you know what I can spend \n     which is limited by law. So that's what we've done. But I do \n     have to tell you I'm very grateful to you. The contributions \n     you have made in this have made a huge difference.\n\n  In addition, the President participated in strategy meetings, helping \nto develop ads that were funded both by his campaign and the DNC. The \nFinal Report of the Special Investigation of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee contains examples of some of the sham issue ads which were \nclearly intended to influence the presidential campaign.\n  The ability to use soft money to fund sham issue ads created a money \nchase that resulted in contributions of tens and hundreds of thousands \nof dollars being exchanged for access to the highest levels of \ngovernment. The Final Report of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's year-long Special Investigation documents numerous examples \nof actual and apparent corruption resulting from the solicitation and \ncontribution of soft money. I also refer my colleagues to a September \n21, 2000 memorandum written by Lawrence Noble, then-General Counsel for \nthe FEC Agenda Document No. 00-95, recommending new rules prohibiting \nthe receipt and use of soft money by national party committees and \nexplaining the reasons for such a proposal, including an explanation of \nthe real and apparent corruption resulting from soft money.\n  Revelation of the campaign finance scandals did nothing to stem the \ntide of soft money and its use for electioneering. In the 2000 election \ncycle, the parties raised nearly half a billion dollars in soft money. \nOne study by the Brennan Center for Justice revealed that only four per \ncent of hard money, candidate ads in 2000 used the ``magic words'' \noutlined in Buckley. So the sham issue ads purchased with party soft \nmoney became virtually indistinguishable from the campaign ads paid for \nby hard money. In fact, according to one study, soft money has become \nthe primary source of funding for party ads that promote the election \nor defeat of federal candidates. In addition, soft money was used for \nget-out-the-vote, voter registration, and virtually every aspect of the \nparties' campaign efforts in connection with federal campaigns.\n\n  In short, soft money is now such an integral part of federal \nelections that it has effectively subverted the hard money limits in \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act. Mr. President, I refer my colleagues \nto a study entitled ``The End of Limits on Money in Politics: Soft \nMoney Now Comprises the Largest Share of Party Spending on Television \nAds in Federal Elections'' by Craig Holman for the Brennan Center for \nJustice which further emphasizes this point.\n  As in 1974, Congress is about to fix a campaign system that is \nclearly broken. The McCain-Feingold bill will restore a campaign \nfinance system that has been completely thwarted by loopholes created \nin the late 1970s. Once again, Congress will prohibit union and \ncorporate money from being used to fund campaigns. Once again, Congress \nwill require individual contributions to be capped at reasonable levels \nand require disclosure. We as a Congress will once again ensure that \nunlimited corporate, union and individual funds will not compromise the \nintegrity of the political process. In short, we are about to restore \nthe campaign finance system to what was intended prior to the \nappearance and exploitation of the soft money loophole.\n  In order to fix this problem, this bill contains three essential \ncomponents in establishing an effective soft money ban. First, national \nparties are banned from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring \nor spending soft money. Second, state parties are prohibited from \nspending soft money on federal election activities, such as ``issue \nads'' that promote or attack a federal candidate and get-out-the-vote \nactivities on behalf of a federal candidate. Third, Federal \nofficeholders and candidates are prohibited from raising or spending \nsoft money, or directing soft money to a party or other entity.\n  These three provisions work together: each of them is an essential \npart of closing the soft money loophole and ensuing that national \nparties, federal officeholders and federal candidates use only funds \npermitted in federal elections to influence federal elections, and that \nstate parties stop serving as vehicles for channeling soft money into \nfederal races to help federal candidates.\n  In the last election, for example, Republican and Democratic Senate \ncandidates set up joint fundraising committees, joining with party \ncommittees, to raise unlimited soft money donations. The joint \ncommittees then transferred the soft money funds to their Senate party \ncommittees, which transferred the money to their state parties, which \nspent the soft money on ``issue ads,'' targeted get-out-the-vote and \nother activities promoting the federal candidates who had raised the \nmoney. As a result, soft money is currently raised by federal \nofficeholders and candidates for political parties and then used by \nthese parties on expenditures to help elect the candidates to federal \noffice.\n  In order to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, the \nbill breaks the nexus between soft money donors and federal \nofficeholders and candidates by banning these federal officeholders and \ncandidates, and their national party committees, from raising these \nfunds.\n  Under this bill, there are no restrictions on state parties raising \nfunds under state law and using them solely to effect state elections. \nThe only restrictions apply to circumstances where money is being used \nto affect federal elections and where absent those restrictions soft \nmoney would continue to pour into federal races through the state \nparties.\n  In addition, McCain-Feingold includes a provision colloquially known \nas Snowe-Jeffords which requires disclosure for some groups running ads \nwhich mention a candidate within a certain number of days of an \nelection. In addition, it prohibits such ads from being funded from the \ngeneral treasury funds of corporations and unions. As has been pointed \nout by Senators Snowe and Jeffords, these sham issue ads are clearly \nintended as election ads and just as clearly have that effect. I refer \nmy colleagues to the following studies which demonstrate that sham \nissue ads have the effect of express advocacy and should be regulated \nby Congress: ``Dictum Without Data: The\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nMyth of Issue Advocacy and Party Building'' by David Magleby of the \nCenter for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young \nUniversity; and ``A Narrow and Appropriate Response to Cloaked \nElectioneering: Measuring the Impact of the 60-Day Bright-Line Test on \nIssue Advocacy'' by Craig B. Holman for the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           The Origins and Growth of Party Soft Money Finance\n\n  (By Anthony Corrado, Associate Professor, Department of Government, \n            Colby College, Waterville, Maine, Mar. 30, 2001)\n\n       The financing of political parties has been a source of \n     controversy for the better part of the last two decades. As \n     major party revenues have grown from $60 million in 1976 to \n     more than $1.2 billion in 2000, advocates of reform have \n     issued increasingly sharp and well-grounded critiques of \n     party fundraising practices. Most of this criticism has been \n     directed toward party soft money finance, a specific form of \n     funding that was not anticipated by the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act, but emerged in the 1980s in response to a \n     series of regulatory decisions. In recent years, soft money \n     contributions have become a staple of national party \n     fundraising, reaching a total of more than $487 million in \n     2000, or ten times more than the amount received in 1988. \n     This type of fundraising occurs outside of the scope of \n     federal laws, so it provides national party organizations \n     with a means of soliciting unlimited contributions from \n     individuals, or gifts from sources such as corporations and \n     labor unions that have long been banned from giving money in \n     federal elections. In recent elections, federal elected \n     officials and national party leaders have aggressively \n     solicited large contributions of $100,000 or more from such \n     sources, including more than 100 gifts of more than $1 \n     million in 2000 alone. These large sums have fueled the \n     growth of soft money and its importance in national \n     elections. They have also encouraged party committees to find \n     new ways of spending soft money, including methods that \n     Congress has not sanctioned.\n       The flow of money in the 1996 and 2000 elections \n     demonstrates how dramatically the world of party fundraising \n     has changed since the amendment of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act (FECA) in 1974. Regulatory changes have created \n     a new legal environment in which parties once again have \n     access to the types of unlimited contributions that were \n     supposed to be eliminated after Watergate. Innovations in \n     party campaign strategies have created new approaches to \n     spending that have encouraged national party organizations to \n     spend unlimited amounts on election-related activities. Most \n     important, parties have moved beyond the kinds of ``party-\n     building'' activities specified in the FECA to place greater \n     reliance on television and radio advertising, especially \n     candidate-specific issue advocacy electioneering, that is \n     financed in large part with soft money that is channeled \n     through state party committees. Parties have thus adapted to \n     the act's regulatory approach in unanticipated ways. These \n     innovations and the success party committees have had in \n     avoiding financial restraint is best understood by reviewing \n     the evolution of the law and the ways national party \n     committees have reacted to the new regulatory regime.\n\n\n                         The Rise of Soft Money\n\n       FECA limits on party funding were first put into effect in \n     the 1976 elections, and questions about the legal status of \n     different types of party financing immediately arose. \n     Traditionally, party organizations had spent significant sums \n     on activities such as voter identification efforts, get-out-\n     the-vote programs, generic party advertising (messages like \n     ``Vote Democratic'' or ``Support Republican Candidates''), \n     and the production of bumper stickers, buttons, and slate \n     cards, that might indirectly benefit federal candidates but \n     did not constitute direct assistance to a particular \n     candidate. Were these expenditures governed by the new \n     spending ceilings?\n       Under the act's original guidelines, the costs of many of \n     these activities, especially grass-roots campaign materials \n     such as bumper stickers, lawn signs, and slate cards that \n     mentioned particular federal candidates, could be considered \n     in-kind campaign contributions subject to the law. This \n     became a particular concern in the 1976 presidential race, \n     because the public funding program established by the FECA \n     prevented the party nominees from accepting campaign \n     contributions in the general election period. As a result, \n     party leaders had to rely on presidential campaign funds for \n     election-related paraphernalia. Yet both presidential \n     campaigns chose to concentrate their limited resources on \n     media advertising rather than gross-roots political \n     activities. As a result, party leaders complained after the \n     election that the FECA had indirectly limited traditional \n     grass-roots and party-building activities, thus reducing the \n     role of party organizations in national elections.\n     The 1979 FECA amendments: Expanding hard money spending\n       Congress responded to these concerns by accepting a \n     recommendation made by the Federal Election Commission to \n     ease the restrictions placed on party contributions and \n     expenditures. The new rules, which were included in the 1979 \n     FECA amendments, changed the legal definition of \n     ``contributions'' and ``expenditure'' to exclude the amounts \n     spent on certain ``grass-roots'' political activities, \n     provided that the funds for those activities were raised in \n     compliance with FECA. This change was designed to allow state \n     and local party organizations to pay for certain specified \n     activities that might indirectly benefit a federal candidate \n     without having to count this spending as a contribution or \n     expenditure under the act. Its purpose was to encourage state \n     and local parties to engage in supplemental campaign activity \n     in hopes of promoting civic participation in the elections \n     process.\n       In changing the law in 1979, Congress sought to allow party \n     committees to spend unlimited amounts of hard money on \n     certain, limited types of election-related activity, which \n     were clearly specified in the law. It did not allow national \n     party organizations to receive unlimited contributions or to \n     accept corporate or labor funds. It did not allow ``soft \n     money.'' Any gifts received by a national party committee \n     were still subject to the limits established in 1974. The \n     1979 revision thus did not create ``soft money''; it simply \n     exempted any federal monies (``hard dollars'') a party \n     committee might spend on certain political activities from \n     being considered a contribution to a candidate under the law. \n     Furthermore, the activities that were to be considered exempt \n     under this provision were narrowly defined. Basically, the \n     1979 law specified three types of state and local party \n     activity that committees may undertake and noted certain \n     restrictions that govern the conduct of these activities. \n     These activities did not include the use of mass public \n     political advertising.\n       First, state and local party committees were allowed to pay \n     for grass-roots campaign materials, such as pins, bumper \n     stickers, brochures, posters, yard signs, and party \n     newspapers. These may be used only in connection with \n     volunteer activities and may not be distributed by direct \n     mail or through any other general public advertising. These \n     materials may not be purchased by national party committees \n     and delivered to the local committees or paid for by funds \n     donated by national committees for this purpose. Nor may a \n     donor designate funds for this purpose to be used to purchase \n     materials for a particular federal candidate.\n       Second, state and local party committees were allowed to \n     prepare and distribute slate cards, sample ballots, palm \n     cards or other printed listings of three or more candidates \n     for any public office for which an election is held in the \n     state.\n       Third, state and local party committees were allowed to \n     conduct voter registration and turnout drives on behalf of \n     their parties' presidential and vice-presidential nominees, \n     including the use of telephone banks operated by volunteers, \n     even if they are developed and trained by paid professionals. \n     However, if a party's House or Senate candidates are \n     mentioned in such drives in a more than incidental way, the \n     costs of the drives allocable to those candidates must be \n     counted as contributions to them.\n       Congress clearly noted that this exemption did not extend \n     to broadcast advertising. In permitting the production of \n     certain types of campaign materials and in sanctioning \n     expenditures on voter drives, the act specifically noted in \n     Section 431 that these activities could not involve the use \n     of any broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, direct \n     mail, or similar type of general public communication or \n     political advertising. In other words, the Congress \n     specifically did not allow the use of mass public political \n     advertising under the exemption established in 1979.\n       Congress thus gave party organizations broader leeway to \n     spend federal funds with respect to election-related \n     activities. In addition to direct contributions and \n     coordinated expenditures, party organizations could spend \n     unlimited amounts on voter registration and identification, \n     certain types of campaign material, and voter turnout \n     programs. Congress supported this revision because these \n     tasks were considered important ``party-building'' activities \n     that would help develop organizational support for party \n     candidates and promote citizen participation in electoral \n     politics.\n     FEC Regulatory decisions: Opening the door to soft money\n       So in 1979 Congress authorized a circumscribed realm of \n     unlimited party expenditures. But it did not sanction \n     unlimited spending on activities designed to assist a \n     particular candidate for federal office. Nor did it open the \n     door to unrestricted fund-raising or party committee receipt \n     of corporate or labor donations. Instead, it was the Federal \n     Election Commission, the agency empowered to enforce the law, \n     that changed the rules governing party fundraising and gave \n     birth to a new form of funding: soft money.\n       The provisions of the act had raised another major issue \n     with respect to party financing: how to accommodate the \n     federal and nonfederal roles of party organizations. The \n     act imposed limits on party financing for all activities \n     conducted in connection with federal elections. But party \n     organizations also play a significant role in nonfederal \n     elections--gubernatorial races, state contests, \n     legislative elections, and campaigns for major local \n     offices. Their financial efforts in these races are \n     governed by state campaign finance laws,which are \n     generally much more permissive than federal law. For \n     example, most states allow parties to accept\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n     corporate and labor union contributions, and, as of 1992, \n     sixteen states had placed no limit on individual gifts, \n     while nineteen had no limits for PAC giving. National \n     party organizations could thus receive contributions for \n     nonfederal purposes that are not allowed in federal \n     elections.\n       The issue of nonfederal party funding first arose in 1976. \n     The Illinois Republican State Central Committee asked the FEC \n     for guidance on how to allocate nonfederal and federally \n     regulated funds in paying some of their general overhead and \n     operating expenses, as well as the expenses of voter \n     registration and get-out-the-vote drives that would benefit \n     both federal and nonfederal candidates. The party sought the \n     FEC's opinion in part because Illinois allowed corporate and \n     labor contributions that were not permissible under federal \n     law.\n       In its Advisory Opinion 1976-72, the FEC clearly stated \n     that corporate or labor union money could not be used to \n     finance such federal election--related activities as a voter \n     registration drive: ``Even though the Illinois law apparently \n     permits corporate contributions for State elections, \n     corporate/union treasury funds may not be used to fund any \n     portion of a registration or get-out-the-vote drive conducted \n     by a political party.'' However, the Commission did approve \n     the use of nonfederal funds to finance a portion of the \n     party's overhead and administrative costs, since these \n     costs--for example, rent, utilities, office supplies, \n     salaries--supported the administration of activities related \n     to both federal and nonfederal politics. The agency approved \n     an allocation formula based on the proportion of federal to \n     state elections being held that year, with greater weight \n     given to federal races. To pay these costs, the Illinois \n     party had to establish separate federal and nonfederal \n     accounts; the federal account could be used only to accept \n     contributions permissible under the act, and the nonfederal \n     account solely for monies allowed under state laws. The \n     proportionate share of administrative costs would be paid \n     from the relevant account; that is, the federal election--\n     related share of the costs would be paid from the federal \n     account, and vice versa.\n       The FEC's attempt to hold the line on corporate \n     contributions was short-lived. Less than two years after \n     their 1976 advisory opinion, the Commission again faced the \n     issue of corporate and labor funding of party voter \n     mobilization efforts. This time the Republican State \n     Committee of Kansas sought the Commission's approval to use \n     corporate and union funds, which were legal under Kansas law, \n     in a voter drive that would benefit both federal and state \n     candidates. Specifically, the Kansans asked the Commission \n     how they should allocate funds between federal and nonfederal \n     funds for their voter registration and get-out-the-vote \n     efforts. In a surprising ruling, two Republican commissioners \n     switched their earliest positions and joined two Democrats in \n     approving Advisory Opinion 1978-10, which reversed the 1976 \n     decision. Instead of prohibiting the use of corporate and \n     union money, the agency declared that the Kansas party could \n     use these funds to finance a share of their voter drives, so \n     long as they allocated their costs to reflect the federal and \n     nonfederal shares of any costs incurred. The decision thus \n     opened the door to the use of nonfederal money on election-\n     related activity conducted in connection with a federal \n     election.\n       Commissioner Thomas E. Harris, a Democrat, believed so \n     strongly that the ruling violated both the letter of the law \n     and Congress's intent in framing the act that he took the \n     unusual step of filing a written dissent. In it, he noted \n     that there would normally be more state and local races than \n     federal races taking place in a state, so most of the costs \n     of voter drives could be financed from monies not permissible \n     under federal law. His point was not lost on party leaders, \n     who quickly began to adapt their financial strategies to take \n     advantage of the new opportunities inherent in the FEC's \n     decision.\n       The FEC's 1978 ruling was issued in response to a state \n     party request. The idea was to recognize the role of state \n     party committees in federal elections and the different \n     contribution rules that might apply to state parties under \n     state laws. But the national party committees argued that the \n     ruling should apply to their activities also, since, like \n     state party committees, they were involved in both federal \n     and nonfederal politics. National parties serve as umbrella \n     organizations that work with party leaders and elected \n     officials at all levels of government. They make \n     contributions and provide campaign assistance to federal, \n     state, and local candidates. They work with state and local \n     party organizations on a variety of party-building and \n     election-related activities. National party leaders therefore \n     argued that they too could allocate administrative costs and \n     other expenses between federal and nonfederal funds, so long \n     as they maintained federal and nonfederal accounts to handle \n     the different types of money. In this way, they could use \n     nonfederal funds for their nonfederal election activity.\n       So just at the time that Congress was allowing party \n     organizations to spend unlimited amounts of money raised \n     under federal rules on voter programs and other activities, \n     the FEC was allowing them to pay a share of such costs with \n     funds not subject to federal limits. These two streams of \n     regulatory change converged in the 1980 election, leading to \n     widespread use of nonfederal money at the federal level.\n\n\n                        the growth of soft money\n\n       During the 1980 election cycle, national party \n     organizations began to raise soft money from corporations, \n     labor unions, and individuals who had already given the \n     maximum amount allowed under federal law. A share of these \n     funds were used to defray a portion of the national party \n     committees' administrative costs, as well as the expenses \n     incurred in raising nonfederal monies. They were also used to \n     pay a proportionate share of the costs of voter targeting and \n     turnout programs designed to assist the presidential ticket \n     or federal candidates engaged in strategically important \n     state contests. In many instances, the national party \n     organizations raised the funds needed to pay for these \n     programs and transferred the amounts to state party \n     committees that actually conducted the voter drives, \n     sometimes with assistance from organizers recruited by the \n     national party committees.\n       This nonfederal funding quickly became known as ``soft \n     money,'' because it was not subject to the ``hard'' limits of \n     federal law. National committees could solicit unlimited \n     amounts from donors throughout the country, and then use the \n     money to pay their own costs or redistribute these funds to \n     those states where they were considered most necessary. As \n     long as the contributions were legal under state law, the \n     gifts were permissible. So a national party fundraiser could \n     solicit $1 million from a donor and use the monies for a \n     variety of purposes, or even transfer the entire amount to a \n     state that had no limits on political contributions. In \n     essence, the new rules gave party organizations a green light \n     to engage in unrestricted fundraising.\n       National party committees quickly took advantage of the \n     relaxed regulatory environment. The only question remaining \n     for party officials was how to allocate soft money with \n     respect to different activities. The FEC took the position \n     that party committees could allocate funds on any reasonable \n     basis. By 1982, when the DNC requested the FEC's guidance on \n     how to pay for a party midterm conference, the agency had \n     approved at least four methods of allocation and afforded \n     party committees notable leeway in selecting their approach. \n     Party committees could thus increase their use of soft money \n     by selecting the allocation method that permitted the \n     greatest nonfederal share.\n       As a result, soft money became a substantial component of \n     national party finance in the 1980s. How substantial a \n     component is difficult to determine, because these funds were \n     not subject to federal disclosure laws. National party \n     committees were only required to report their soft money \n     receipts and expenditures in the states where the money was \n     spent, where disclosure requirements were often either \n     nonexistent or wholly ineffective. It is therefore impossible \n     to determine the exact amounts raised and spent by the \n     national party organizations. The best available estimates \n     suggest that the two major parties spent $19.1 million in \n     soft money during the 1980 election cycle, with the \n     Republicans spending $15.1 million and the Democrats $4 \n     million. In 1984, they received an estimated $21.6 million, \n     with the Republicans once again outpacing the Democrats by a \n     margin of $15.6 million to $6 million. Most of this money was \n     spent on voter registration drives and turnout programs \n     conducted by state party committees. These efforts were \n     targeted to focus on key battlegrounds in the presidential \n     race.\n       By 1988, soft money had become a focal point of public \n     attention, as both parties escalated their soft money \n     fundraising. The two national parties raised a total of $45 \n     million in soft money, more than twice the amount raised in \n     1988. The Democrats raised $23 million and the Republicans \n     $22 million. This success was largely due to the emphasis \n     both parties placed on donors of $100,000 or more. In \n     voluntary disclosures made after the election, the \n     Republicans claimed to have received $100,000 gifts from 267 \n     donors, while the Democrats counted 130 donors who gave \n     $100,000 or more.\n       In 1992, both parties generally followed the approaches \n     established in 1988. They continued to raise soft money funds \n     aggressively and sought contributions of $200,000 or more \n     from their top donors. They also placed substantial emphasis \n     on the solicitation of corporate gifts, with the largest \n     corporate donors often giving money to both parties. As a \n     result, the amount of soft money continued to grow at a \n     dramatic rate. In all, the national party committees raised \n     about $80 million in soft money. This included substantial \n     amounts of soft money that were raised by the national senate \n     and congressional campaign committees. While the \n     Democratic Senate Campaign Committee continued to raise \n     soft money only for its building fund, the other \n     committees began to mount extensive soft money operations. \n     In all, these committees raised more than $20 million in \n     soft money, including $4.7 million by the Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee, $6.3 million by the \n     National Republican Congressional Committee, and $9 \n     million by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n       Both national committees adopted strongly centralized \n     approaches in administering these funds in an effort to \n     maintain control over the ways soft money was spent. Even in \n     the case of monies transferred to state and local party \n     organizations, the national committees allowed little \n     autonomy with respect to how the funds were to be spent. In \n     most instances, transferred funds were to be used on projects \n     approved by the national organization.\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n       Most of the soft money spent in 1992 was spent in ways \n     designed to support the election of federal candidates. The \n     major share of the soft money raised in both parties was \n     devoted to joint activity, that is, to activities that were \n     designed to influence federal and nonfederal elections. \n     Examples of such activities include the costs of fundraising \n     efforts designed to raise soft and hard money; the \n     administrative expenses associated with soft money \n     operations; the monies paid for generic campaign materials \n     and advertisements that say ``Vote Democratic'' or ``Vote \n     Republican''; and expenses for phone banks and other voter \n     identification and turnout projects that assist party \n     candidates at all levels.\n       The most prominent form of joint activity was generic \n     advertising, especially television advertising. While voter \n     turnout programs remained the most important component of the \n     party activities, both parties invested heavily in generic \n     television ads that were designed to bolster the prospects of \n     their candidates. These ads were financed with a combination \n     of hard and soft money. Overall, the Democrats spent about \n     $14.2 million on ads and the Republicans spent about $10 \n     million. The Republicans basically followed the strategy \n     employed in previous elections, since they had previously \n     spent substantial sums on generic advertising. For the \n     Democrats, however, this emphasis on party advertising \n     represented a new approach to general election campaigning. \n     While the party did broadcast some ads in 1988, the total \n     amount spent was only $1 million.\n       Many of the ads broadcast by the party committees were \n     designed to reinforce the message of the party's presidential \n     nominee. The Democrats, for example, used soft money to \n     finance ads that did not mention Bill Clinton directly (since \n     this was thought at the time to be a violation of federal \n     law) but did hammer home the message on the economy that was \n     the foundation of Clinton's campaign. These ads also helped \n     to free up resources that the Clinton campaign could use for \n     other purposes. During the last week of the campaign, for \n     instance, the Clinton campaign was running tight on money and \n     thus decided to use campaign resources to buy a half-hour of \n     national television time as opposed to additional broadcast \n     time in the highly competitive state of Texas. The campaign, \n     however, did not leave Texas unattended; instead, the \n     national committee broadcast generic ads in the state to \n     spread the party's message. The Bush campaign adopted a \n     similar strategy, relying on party ads to shore up support in \n     traditional Republican strongholds and in crucial \n     battleground states like Texas and Florida.\n       Parties also raised soft money as a vehicle for providing \n     direct financial assistance to state and local committees. In \n     1992, about a quarter of the funds raised nationally by the \n     two major parties were transferred to state and local party \n     committees. These funds provided state and local party \n     organizations with the resources needed to conduct activities \n     that they would otherwise not be able to afford. These funds \n     are often used to purchase, update, and computerize voter \n     lists; to develop targeting programs; to pay fundraising \n     expenses; and to hire party workers and poll watchers on \n     election day. While both parties spent money on these types \n     of activities in 1992, the bulk of the funds transferred to \n     state parties were used for generic phone bank programs \n     designed to identify party supporters and turn out the vote.\n       According to FEC disclosure reports, most of the state \n     party organizations received a share of the soft money funds \n     raised by their respective national party committees. The \n     Democrats transferred almost $9.5 million in nonfederal funds \n     to 47 states. Federal funds were sent to all 50 states. With \n     this hard money added, the total amount sent to state \n     committees was $14.3 million. The Republicans sent about $5.3 \n     million in nonfederal monies to 42 states and about $3.5 \n     million in federal funding to 43 states, for a total of about \n     $8.8 million.\n       Most of the soft money sent to state committees was focused \n     on a small group of targeted states that were considered \n     essential to a presidential victory. The Democrats disbursed \n     two-thirds of the nonfederal funds sent to states in ten key \n     electoral battlegrounds. These ten states, which contained \n     219 electoral college votes or 81 percent of the total needed \n     to win, included most of the large electoral states and three \n     crucial Southern states that the Democrats thought they could \n     win--Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The Republicans \n     also disbursed two-thirds of their transfer funds in ten \n     states. These states, which contained 190 electoral votes or \n     70 percent of the number needed to win, also included a \n     number of large states and three key Southern contests. The \n     Republican senate and congressional committees transferred \n     about $3.2 million to state party committees, as compared to \n     less than $34,000 transferred by the Democratic senate and \n     congressional committees, most of which was sent to states \n     with open Senate races.\n\n\n               the federalization of soft money financing\n\n       By the end of the 1992 election cycle, both national \n     parties had become adept at raising soft money and using \n     these funds to assist federal candidates. While some \n     comparatively minor sums of soft money were used to make \n     contributions to state and local candidates or assist state \n     parties in their efforts to mobilize voters for nonfederal \n     contests, the vast majority of these monies were being raised \n     and coordinated by the national party committees and spent in \n     ways that would influence the outcome of federal elections in \n     targeted states. The parties had learned to use soft money as \n     a central component of their federal campaign efforts. They \n     relied on these funds to supplement the public funding in \n     presidential races and the hard monies solicited by Senate \n     and House candidates. For all intents and purposes, soft \n     money primarily had become part of a system of federal \n     election financing that included a state and local \n     component, rather than a method of state and local \n     political finance that also influenced federal elections.\n       In 1996, the importance of soft money in the financing of \n     federal elections became even more important as parties \n     changed their strategies and began to place great emphasis on \n     the use of candidate-specific issue ads. This type of \n     advertising provided parties with a way of using soft money \n     to pay for broadcast advertisements that featured specific \n     federal candidates. The parties claimed that such ads are not \n     federal campaign expenditures and thus may be paid for with a \n     combination of hard and soft money funds. In 1996, the use of \n     such ads, which was spurred by the efforts of the Democratic \n     Party to bolster President Clinton's prospects for \n     reelection, was a bold innovation. It represented an \n     aggressive effort to push the limits of the FECA restrictions \n     and circumvent the contribution and spending limits \n     established by the law. In the intervening four years, this \n     innovation has become the standard practice, the new norm for \n     how party committees conduct their federal election \n     campaigns, and a major factor in the continued growth in soft \n     money fundraising.\n       While the national party organizations had engaged in issue \n     advocacy advertising before the 1996 election cycle (most \n     notably during the debate over Clinton's health care proposal \n     in 1993 and 1994), they had never before used such \n     advertising in a significant way to promote a presidential \n     candidate in an election year. But the Democrats quickly \n     recognized the potential benefits of this tactic. The ads \n     could be used to deliver the President's basic message, \n     policy proposals, and accomplishments, and criticize Dole's \n     views and record. As long as they avoided the ``magic words'' \n     that would trigger the definition of express advocacy, none \n     of the monies spent in this way would be considered \n     ``campaign spending'' under the law. It was a loophole in the \n     federal regulatory scheme that the Democrats aggressively \n     exploited.\n       For a year, July 1995 to June 1996, the Democratic National \n     Committee (DNC) and state Democratic party organizations \n     spent millions of dollars on ads designed to promote \n     Clinton's reelection. These spots were mostly aired in \n     smaller media markets where broadcast time is less expensive. \n     The party avoided states where Clinton had won by large \n     margins in 1992, and also stayed away from those states where \n     they felt Clinton had no chance--Texas, the Great Plains \n     states, and Southern Republican strongholds like South \n     Carolina and Virginia. In the fall of 1995, the Democrats ran \n     ads attacking the Republican budget that covered 30 percent \n     of the media markets in the country. By the end of December, \n     they had run ads presenting Clinton as a leader seeking tax \n     cuts, welfare reform, a balanced budget, and protection for \n     Medicare and education programs. In all, the Democrats had \n     aired pro-Clinton ads in 42 percent of the nation's media \n     markets by January 1, 1996, at a cost of $18 million, none of \n     which was drawn from Clinton's campaign committee accounts.\n       According to estimates by Common Cause, the Democrats spent \n     $34 million on pro-Clinton ads during this period. This \n     included $12 million in federally regulated ``hard money'' \n     and $22 million in soft money. The DNC managed to spend such \n     a large proportion of soft money by transferring funds to \n     state party committees and having these communities purchase \n     the ad time. In other words, they were able to pay for the \n     ads mostly with soft money because the FEC has different \n     payment regulations for national and state party \n     organizations. This perfectly legal act of subterfuge \n     allowed the party to conserve its hard money, which is \n     particularly valuable because it is more difficult to \n     raise than soft money.\n       The Democrats focused their ad campaign on twelve key \n     general election battleground states. The party spent over $1 \n     million in each of these states, including over $4 million in \n     California. Combined, these twelve states represented a total \n     of 221 electoral college votes. Clinton eventually won all of \n     them except for Colorado.\n       The DNC's spending and Clinton's financial advantage \n     entering the final months of the campaign encouraged the \n     Republican National Committee (RNC) to adopt a similar \n     strategy as soon as its presidential nominee was determined. \n     In May, one day after Dole decided to resign from the Senate \n     to devote himself to full-time campaigning, RNC Chair Haley \n     Barbour announced a $20 million issue advocacy advertising \n     campaign that would be conducted during the period leading up \n     to the Republican national convention in August. The purpose \n     of this campaign, said the chairman, would be ``to show the \n     differences between Dole and Clinton and between Republicans \n     and Democrats on the issues facing our country, so we can \n     engage full-time in one of the most consequential elections \n     in our history.'' In essence, the campaign was designed to \n     assist Dole, who had basically reached the public funding \n     spending limit, by providing the additional resources needed \n     to match Clinton's anticipated spending in\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n     the remaining months before the nominating conventions.\n       By the end of June, the RNC had already spent at least $14 \n     million on ads promoting Dole's candidacy, including an \n     estimated $9 million in soft money. Like the Democrats, the \n     Republicans focused their spending on key electoral college \n     battlegrounds. Indeed, the ``target'' list looked very \n     similar to that of the Democrats; eight of the top twelve \n     states were the same for both parties.\n       This innovative form of party spending essentially rendered \n     the contribution and spending limits of the FECA, at least as \n     far as the party nominees were concerned, meaningless. So \n     long as the party committees did not coordinate their efforts \n     with the candidate or his staff, and did not use any of the \n     ``magic words'' that would cause their spending to qualify as \n     candidate support, they were free to spend as much as they \n     wanted from monies received from unlimited sources on \n     activities essentially geared towards influencing the outcome \n     of the presidential race. Given the availability of polling \n     data and other sources of political information, it was \n     simple for the parties to develop ads that reflected their \n     respective candidates' major themes and positions or \n     presented the most effective attacks against the opponent.\n       Moreover, this use of soft money gave the party \n     organizations a strong incentive to solicit greater and \n     greater amounts of soft money. Instead of spending one dollar \n     in hard money for a dollar in advertising done as a \n     coordinated expenditure, a national party committee could \n     spend one dollar in hard money to trigger, on average, an \n     additional two dollars in soft money spending. So they were \n     able to get more advertising out of their hard money by \n     relying more heavily on soft money. The tactic thus placed a \n     premium on soft money fundraising. A party could into spend \n     as much soft money as it could raise because these funds \n     could be used for television advertising that featured the \n     candidate and essentially advocated his election.\n       In 1996, the national party committees raised over $260 \n     million in soft money, more than three times the sum amassed \n     in 1992. Yet this substantial sum paled in comparison to the \n     $487 million garnered in 2000. The parties raised such large \n     sums because the bold innovation undertaken in 1996 was \n     essentially sanctioned by the events following that election. \n     Although the FEC audit division and general counsel's office \n     found that the party issue advertising campaigns should be \n     considered campaign expenses and counted against the \n     presidential campaign's spending and contribution limits, the \n     FEC failed to accept their recommendations and did not take \n     action against the parties or the presidential candidates for \n     their acts of subterfuge. Consequently, the parties had even \n     greater incentive to engage in issue advertising efforts \n     financed with soft money. And they made the most of this \n     opportunity.\n       Exactly how much soft money was spent to assist federal \n     candidates through advertising or other means is difficult to \n     determine due to the inadequacy of the disclosure \n     requirements applicable to national party committee soft \n     money finances. But it is certainly true that the vast \n     majority of the soft monies raised in 2000 were used to \n     assist federal candidates and that the largest expenditures \n     took the form of issue advertisements that featured federal \n     candidates and were broadcast in close proximity to Election \n     Day.\n       The national party committees together spent $79.1 million \n     on television advertising in the presidential campaign in the \n     top 75 of the nation's 210 media markets, as compared to \n     $67.1 million spent by the candidate themselves. According to \n     an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice of these top 75 \n     media markets during the period from June 1 to November 7, \n     the Bush campaign devoted $39.2 million to television \n     advertising, while the Republican National Committee spent \n     $44.7 million. On the Democratic side, the Gore campaign \n     spent $27.9 million on television advertising, while the \n     Democratic National Committee expended $35.1 million. As in \n     1996, most of the funding came from soft money that the \n     national party transferred to state parties, since under FEC \n     guidelines, state parties were able to use a greater \n     percentage of soft money when buying television time if it \n     was purchased by state party committees. This was in accord \n     with FEC rules, which place different allocation requirements \n     on state party committees. These expenditures, therefore, \n     were not designed to strengthen state and local parties; they \n     were simply made through state or local party financial \n     accounts to take advantage of the opportunity to spend soft \n     money.\n       The Democrats were the first to resort to issue advocacy \n     spending, airing their first ad in early June, despite the \n     fact that Gore had earlier said the Democrats would not run \n     soft-money financed advertising unless the Republicans did so \n     first. In announcing the advertising strategy, the Democrats \n     cited what they estimated to be $2 million in anti-Gore \n     advertising by political groups that favored Bush, including \n     a group called Shape the Debate and a missile defense \n     organization called the Coalition to Protect America Now. The \n     ad, which touted Gore's commitment to fight for a \n     prescription drug benefit for seniors, ran in 15 states and \n     was financed with a combination of hard and soft money.\n       Once the Democrats had begun their assault, the Republicans \n     were quick to follow. Only a few days after the Democrats \n     launched their ads, the Republicans announced a campaign \n     of their own. On June 10, the Republican National \n     Committee unveiled a $2 million ad campaign targeted \n     mainly in the same presidential battlegrounds as the \n     Democratic television buy. The only difference was that \n     the Republicans also purchased time in Maine and Arkansas. \n     This first commercial presented Bush's proposal to allow \n     workers to invest part of their Social Security payroll \n     taxes in the stock market.\n       What was most notable in 2000, however, was the significant \n     rise in the use of soft money by the national senate and \n     congressional campaign committees. Almost half of the soft \n     money raised in this election, almost $214 million, was \n     raised by the congressional committees. This sum is ten times \n     greater than the $20 million in soft money raised by these \n     committees in 1992. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee raised $63 million in soft money, while the \n     Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised almost $57 \n     million. The National Republican Senatorial Committee \n     solicited $43 million in soft money and the National \n     Republican Congressional Committee, about $51 million.\n       About half of the soft money raised by the senatorial and \n     congressional committees, $108 million, was transferred to \n     state and local party committees to pay for issue advocacy \n     advertising and voter turnout programs conducted in \n     connection with targeted House and Senate races. According to \n     the Brennan Center analysis, in the top 75 media markets, the \n     parties spent nearly $40 million on advertising in House \n     races, with the Democrats spending $22.7 million and the \n     Republicans, $16.8 million. In connection with Senate races, \n     the parties spent an additional $39 million, including $21.4 \n     million by the Democrats and $17.7 million by the \n     Republicans. Tens of millions more was spent on voter \n     identification and turnout efforts. Most of the money spent \n     on these activities was in the form of soft money. So even \n     the national party committees formed for the purpose of \n     electing candidates to the House and Senate have become soft \n     money operations.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       By the election of 2000, national party soft money was \n     being used to finance every aspect of a party's campaign \n     efforts in connection with federal contests. It is being used \n     to produce candidate-specific ads and broadcast them on \n     television and radio. It is being used to produce campaign \n     materials such as posters and slate cards that feature \n     federal candidates. It is being used to register, identify, \n     and mobilize voters who support federal candidates. It is \n     therefore not surprising that the party committees have made \n     soft money fundraising a major component of their financial \n     efforts. In every election cycle since its advent, the \n     majority of soft money has been allocated to finance \n     activities that are primarily designed to influence the \n     outcome of federal elections.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1984.\n     Lee Ann Elliott,\n     Chair, Federal Election Commission,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Elliott: I am writing on behalf of Common \n     Cause to express our deep concern about the improper role \n     that ``soft money'' has been playing in federal campaigns and \n     about the Federal Election Commission's inattention to this \n     very serious problem.\n       It appears that ``soft money'' is being used in federal \n     elections in a manner that violates and severely undermines \n     the contribution limits and prohibitions contained in the \n     federal campaign finance laws. While these practices and \n     abuses have received considerable public attention, the \n     Federal Election Commission to our knowledge has failed to \n     take any formal action in this area.\n       In using the term ``soft money'' we are referring to funds \n     that are raised by Presidential campaigns and national and \n     congressional political party organizations purportedly for \n     use by state and local party organizations in nonfederal \n     elections, from sources who would be barred from making such \n     contributions in connection with a federal election, e.g. \n     from corporations and labor unions and from individuals who \n     have reached their federal contribution limits.\n       According to various press reports and public statements, \n     including statements by campaign and party officials, it \n     appears clear that ``soft money'' in fact is not being raised \n     or spent solely for nonfederal election purposes. Such funds \n     are being channeled to state parties with the clear goal of \n     influencing the outcome of federal elections. [The complaint \n     filed by the Center for Responsive Politics, for example, \n     sets forth a clear example of the use of ``soft money'' for \n     federal purposes in the 1983 special Senate election in the \n     State of Washington.]\n       Under the federal campaign finance laws ``soft money'' is \n     prohibited from being spent ``in connection with'' federal \n     elections. There is no question that ``soft money'' currently \n     is being spent ``in connection with'' federal elections, if \n     that term as used in the federal campaign laws is to be given \n     any realistic meaning. If the Commission leaves such ``soft \n     money'' practices unchecked it will be implicitly sanctioning \n     potentially widespread violation of the current federal \n     campaign finance laws.\n       Soft money practices are facilitating the reemergence in \n     national political fundraising of campaign contributions from \n     sources such as corporations and unions that\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n     have been prohibited for decades from providing such funds \n     for federal elections. They are similarly facilitating the \n     reemergence of large individual campaign contributions that \n     have been prohibited since 1975.\n       These contributions are highly visible to national campaign \n     and party officials notwithstanding their purported use by \n     state party organizations for nonfederal election purposes. \n     When national campaign and party officials who work with \n     federal candidates raise and coordinate or channel the \n     distribution of ``soft money'' to state organizations, the \n     potential for corruption is exactly the same as it was when \n     those national campaign and party officials directly received \n     that kind of money. If the Commission leaves soft money \n     practices unchecked, it will directly undermine a core \n     protection against corruption in the federal campaign finance \n     laws.\n       Soft money practices are also undermining the disclosure \n     provisions of federal campaign finance laws. Very substantial \n     sums of money are being channeled to and through state \n     parties in order to influence federal elections without these \n     sums being disclosed as contributions or expenditures under \n     the federal law. A primary purpose of the federal campaign \n     finance laws is to open the political financing process to \n     public scrutiny. If the Commission leaves soft money \n     practices unchecked, it will allow the national campaigns and \n     political parties to potentially hide millions of dollars in \n     federally related campaign funds from public view, thereby \n     creating widespread opportunities for actual and apparent \n     corruption.\n       Furthermore, in presidential campaigns, ``soft money'' \n     returns private funds to a potentially prominent role and \n     thereby subverts the purpose of the presidential public \n     financing system. In 1979, Congress amended the federal \n     campaign finance laws to permit state parties to spend money \n     in connection with presidential campaigns, but only for \n     certain limited purposes and only with funds subject to the \n     limitations and prohibitions of the federal law. Congress did \n     not intend to authorize centralized national fundraising of \n     private funds from proscribed sources to supplement the \n     presidential public financing system. If the Commission \n     leaves soft money practices unchecked, just that will \n     continue to occur.\n       Common Cause believes that it is essential for the \n     Commission to make the ``soft money'' problem a top priority \n     in carrying out its statutory responsibility to enforce the \n     federal campaign finance laws. The Commission's current \n     approach, which appears to be limited to sporadic policing of \n     political committee account allocation rules, is totally \n     inadequate.\n       We therefore strongly urge that the Commission promptly \n     take the following steps:\n       (1) initiate on a priority basis its own broad-ranging \n     factual investigation into soft money practices, with a view \n     toward prosecuting actual past violations;\n       (2) initiate a rulemaking proceeding to establish what \n     broader administrative tools, such as additional disclosure \n     requirements, are needed to facilitate the Commission's \n     effective enforcement of the current laws; and\n       (3) undertake a review of the current laws to determine \n     what additional statutory remedies may be required to assure \n     that soft money abuses are most effectively curtailed.\n       ``Soft money'' is a very serious problem. The Commission \n     must address it aggressively. It is not sufficient for the \n     Commission, in this or other key areas, to sit back and wait \n     for the private parties to bring these matters of enforcement \n     responsibility to its attention. The Commission must be out \n     in front of, not forced into, these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Fred Wertheimer,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senate today takes a historic step \ntoward fairer elections, and I rise to join many of my colleagues in \nurging a vote for final passage of the McCain-Feingold legislation. The \nbill that will be passed by the Senate is in some ways better, and in \nother ways weaker, than the legislation we started the debate on two \nweeks ago. In two instances I believe the Senate took a step backward. \nStill, on balance, this is a positive reform bill and I support it.\n  Debates about campaign finance reform should be debates about who is \nat the table. Looking back at the last two weeks from this perspective \nhighlights not only the importance of the bill that we will vote on \ntoday, but also it's severe limitations. I say importance, because if \nyou believe that reform of our federal elections is essential for the \nreasons I believe, restoring the centrality of one person, one vote, \nthen you need to get soft money out of the system because it allows too \nmuch political power to flow from too few. But I also say sever \nlimitations because even if we ban soft money, even if we ban sham \nissue ads, we will still have too much money in politics in America. \nThe investors, the heavy hitters, the players will still have an all \ntoo prominent role in our elections.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senate voted to raise the hard-money \ncontribution limits. Nearly 80 percent of the money in our elections is \nhard money, more and more of which is being raised in checks of $1000. \nDuring the last election, only 4 out of every 10,000 Americans made a \ncontribution greater than $200. Only 232,000 Americans gave \ncontributions of $1000 or more to federal candidates--one ninth of one \npercent of the voting age population. By raising the hard money limits, \nthe Senate voted to increase the amount of special interest money in \npolitics and entrench candidates' dependence on a narrow, political, \nelite made up of wealthy individuals. That is not reform.\n  The Senate also adopted an amendment to allow candidates facing self-\nfinancing opponents to raise even more big money. Again, this is a step \nbackward and is blatant incumbent protection.\n  I am pleased that the Senate twice voted to include, the second time \noverwhelmingly, a reform amendment I offered, which significantly \nstrengthens the McCain-Feingold bill. The amendment ensures that the \nsham issue ads run by nonprofit special interest groups fall under the \nsame rules and prohibitions that the legislation rightly imposed on \ncorporate and union soft money sham issue ads. Previous versions of \nMcCain-Feingold had covered such ads as did the Shays-Meehan bill \npassed by the House.\n  Limiting the ban only to corporate and union soft money practically \ninvited a shift in spending to private special interest groups in \nfuture elections, suggesting that in future years, even with enactment \nof this bill, Congress will be predestined to revisit sham issue ad \nregulation to close yet another loophole in federal election law.\n  These often virtually unaccountable groups engage regularly in \nelectioneering communications. Make no mistake, we are not talking \nabout ads that are legitimately trying to influence policy debates. \nThis amendment targets those ads that we all know are trying to skew \nelections but till now have been able to skirt the law.\n  At the same time, this amendment does not prohibit these groups from \nrunning electioneering ads. It merely requires that they comply with \nthe same rules that unions and corporations must comply with under the \nbill. Groups covered by my amendment can set up PACs, solicit \ncontributions and run electioneering ads. This amendment simply \nprevents them from using their regular treasury money to run such ads \nin a secret and unaccountable way. Spending on genuine issue ads is \ncompletely unaffected, as it should be.\n  The amendment directly addresses constitutional concerns. A February \n20, 1998 letter signed by 20 constitutional scholars, including a \nformer legislative director of the ACLU, which analyzed underlying \nbill's sham issue ad provision, argued that even though that provision \nwas written to exempt certain organizations from the ban on \nelectioneering communication, such omission was not constitutionally \nnecessary. In other words, the restrictions on corporations and unions \nneed not have been limited to corporations and unions. In any case, the \namendment is severable. If courts find it to be unconstitutional, it \nwill not jeopardize the rest of this bill.\n  This is what was at stake in the last two weeks: a government where \nthe people are the priority, not the powerful. The anti-reform crowd \nhas tried to cast this debate in terms of regulating political speech \nand limiting political freedom. I reject the argument that freedom, \nfreedom of speech, freedom to participate in the election of one's \ngovernment is served by the current system or that it is undermined by \nefforts to reform that system. On the contrary, freedom is on the side \nof reform, and indeed the more comprehensive the campaign finance \nreform we enact, the more we empower every American to capture control \nof his or her own destiny.\n  While I will vote in favor of McCain-Feingold, I do so with my eyes \nopen. Fundamentally, this legislation seeks to patch a badly broken \nsystem, one that is likely past saving through minor repair, and stops \nfar short of the complete overhaul of the financing of elections that \nare required. Ultimately, an approach that seeks to stop a leak here, \nand block a loophole there but does not meaningfully remove the demand \nfor private, special interest money form candidates and parties--either \nthrough reducing costs to campaigns, providing public sources of\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nfunds, or a combination of the two--will be doomed to failure.\n  It is for this reason that I am a supporter of comprehensive public \nfinancing of federal campaigns, what is known as the Clean Money, Clean \nElections approach. The McCain-Feingold bill includes important \nreforms. It would get some of the money out of politics. Not all of the \nmoney, but the under-the-table money, the largest contributions, the \ngrossest examples of favor currying and access buying. With my \namendment, it will ban most sham issue ads. Such unregulated funds have \nmade a mockery of the current campaign finance reform system. However, \nthere is no question that we should go much further, that most \nAmericans would like to see us go further and that it is not truly \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform. During debate on this bill, 36 \nsenators supported an amendment I offered which would have allowed \nstates to establish voluntary spending limits in exchange for full or \npartial public financing for federal candidates. I am hopeful that the \nnumbers here in the Senate in favor of public financing of federal \nelections will increase.\n  Now that the Senate will finally go on record in favor of the modest \nreform that McCain-Feingold represents, I believe the time is right to \nbegin the fight for fundamental reform: public financing of elections. \nThis week I will reintroduce, my Clean Money, Clean Elections \nlegislation. This legislation attacks the root cause of a system \nfounded on private special interest money, curing the disease rather \nthan treating the symptoms. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this new phase. Again, passage of this bill is not the \nend of the reform debate but merely the beginning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an editorial in last \nFriday's Boston Globe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A Step Toward Reform\n\n       By rejecting a malignant non severability amendment, the US \n     Senate has moved the nation significantly closer to real \n     political reform. ``This is where the Senate takes a stand,'' \n     Senator Russell Feingold said near the end of a dramatic two-\n     week debate. And the Senate stood for reform, 57-43.\n       If a solid version of the McCain-Feingold bill is agreed to \n     by the House and signed by President Bush, as now seems more \n     likely than ever, Americans will receive something as \n     valuable as any proposed tax rebate--the return of a portion \n     of the democracy that has been snatched away by the growing \n     influence of big money in the political system.\n       McCain-Feingold does not offer the sweeping reform that the \n     system desperately needs, but it is a large step forward and \n     a prerequisite to more basic changes. The bill's targets are \n     the major abuses that have grown since the Watergate reforms \n     of 1974. Largely unregulated ``soft money'' donations, \n     ostensibly for party-building but often used to advance \n     specific candidates, would be eliminated. And ``independent'' \n     expenditures, by groups supposedly not linked to campaigns, \n     would be restricted close to voting dates.\n       The key vote yesterday means that if a constitutional flaw \n     is found in one part of the law the remainder will survive. \n     Several opponents of reform last week helped pass an \n     amendment offered by liberal Senator Paul Wellstone of \n     Minnesota that would further curtail independent \n     expenditures, in the obvious hope that the provision would be \n     found unconstitutional and scuttle the whole effort.\n       We support the Wellstone amendment and believe it is \n     constitutional. If not, yesterday's vote will keep the rest \n     of the law intact.\n       The road for campaign reform has been long. The House has \n     approved similar measures, but must now take the bill up \n     again, this time playing with live ammunition--the increased \n     likelihood that it will become law. Bush added to the \n     momentum this week by indicating for the first time he might \n     sign it.\n       On this bill and other political reforms, Congress should \n     give primacy to the rights and needs of voters. Reform should \n     not have to wait for a tangled election like the one just \n     concluded--or a Watergate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't agree with my colleague from \nKentucky, though I have great respect for him. I think our parties will \nbe stronger not dependent on soft money, to get away from the obscene \nmoney chase, and we will be more connected to the people. I also think \nthe provisions on the sham issue ads across the board will make a huge \ndifference, with less poison politics and bringing people back.\n  I hated the increase in the hard money limits. I think it is a \nmistake. But this bill is a step forward. I am proud to vote for it. \nThis is all about representative democracy. This will be a great vote, \nand I hope it whets the appetite of people in the country for even \nmore. I thank Senators McCain, Feingold, Dodd, Daschle, and a lot of \nother Senators as well.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 minute to Senator Edwards of North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I will first thank my friends Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold for their extraordinary leadership. It has \nbeen a wonderful honor for me to participate in this very important \ndebate in our history. The American people deserve a democracy where \ntheir voice is heard above the megaphone of big money and powerful \ninterests. That is what this debate has confronted. It is not about \nMembers of Congress; it is not about Senators or Members of the House. \nIt is about the American people. It is not about Democrats or \nRepublicans and who is advantaged by this bill. It is about the \nAmerican people--once again, restoring their faith in the integrity of \ntheir Government, once again making the American people believe that \ntheir voice is what matters. When they go to the polls and vote, it is \ntheir vote that matters.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It \nis a huge step in the right direction.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, rarely in life--and even more rarely in \npolitics--can you say after fewer than 90 days in a new job that you \nare able to see one of your primary goals accomplished.\n  My hat is off to Senators McCain and Feingold for their many years of \nworking on this legislation.\n  I ran for the Senate because I wanted to see meaningful campaign \nfinance reform, to reduce the influence of special interests in our \npolitical process, and to amplify the voices of individual ordinary \ncitizens. Final passage of McCain-Feingold will be a dream come true \nfor me and a major first step. That is what is most significant about \nthis reform--the first reform we have really had in almost a quarter \ncentury. Watching my colleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, and also \nSenators Levin, Thompson, Snowe, Schumer, Dodd, and Wellstone, bring \nsuch force of will to ensuring that this bill passed. And that it not \nonly emerged from the amendment process, but that it was improved in \nthat process. Finally, we will be able to slow the virtual arms race \nthat campaign fundraising has become.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, each of us at one point in the well of \nthe Senate raised our right hand and swore to uphold the Constitution \nof the United States. On 21 occasions in the last 26 years, efforts to \nrestrict issue advocacy by outside groups have been struck down, \nincluding just last summer when the second circuit struck down the \nprecise language in Snowe-Jeffords.\n  This bill is fatally unconstitutional. I hope Senators will uphold \nthe oaths they have taken and oppose this unconstitutional bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the remaining minutes on the \nproponents' side to the principal author of this bill, the person who \ndeserves enormous credit, John McCain of Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will vote on \nfinal passage of the Campaign Finance Reform Act, and I respectfully \nask all Senators for their support. I want to speak very briefly, \nmainly to express my appreciation to my colleagues, on all sides of \nthis issue, for the quality of our debate.\n  I thank first two men who were as good as their word: The majority \nleader, for the commitment to an open debate and for keeping the \namendment process both fair and expeditious, and the Democratic leader \nfor so effectively safeguarding his party support for genuine campaign \nfinance reform.\n\n  I also show my respect for the skill, grit, and honesty of the \nformidable Senator from Kentucky and his able staff. There are few \nthings more daunting in politics than the determined opposition of \nSenator McConnell. I hope to avoid the experience more often in the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n  I thank Senator Dodd, the Democratic manager of the bill, and his \nstaff. His leadership was as critical to our success as his unfailing \ngood humor was to our morale.\n  The majority and minority whips, Senators Nickles and Reid, worked \nhard to ensure a fair and complete debate and to encourage both sides \nto reach for good-faith compromises whenever it was possible.\n  Words cannot express how grateful I am to the cosponsors of our \nlegislation. But for the willingness of Senators Thompson and Feinstein \nto find common ground on the issue of increasing hard money limits, I \nfear our efforts would have proved as futile as they have in the past.\n  I cannot exaggerate how big a boost Senator Thad Cochran's support \nwas to our cause and how important his wise and courteous guidance was \nto our success.\n  I appreciate the wise and experienced leadership of Senator Carl \nLevin.\n  Senators Snowe, Jeffords, Collins, Specter, Schumer, Edwards, Kerry, \nand all the sponsors worked tirelessly and effectively to reach this \nmoment and more than compensated for my own deficiencies as an \nadvocate.\n  I am also much indebted and inspired by the community of activists \nfor campaign finance reform. The faith, energy, and never-say-die \nspirit they have shown in a fight they have waged for so many years are \nthe best attributes of patriots. Although we have a few more miles to \ntravel, they have given good service to our country, and my admiration \nfor them is only surpassed by my gratitude.\n  I owe a special thanks to the many thousands of Americans who lent \ntheir voice to our cause this year, many who supported my campaign last \nyear and many who did not but who believe that reforming the way we \nfinance Federal election campaigns is a necessary first step to \nreforming the practices and institutions of our great democracy.\n  I also thank my staff for their extraordinary support, particularly \nMark Buse who has worked by my side on this issue for many years and \nwhose industry and creativity will never fail to impress me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. What is the request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. For 2 additional minutes. Is there \nobjection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord a list of the staffers of the Senators who were very helpful and \ncritical to our success.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Cochran--Brad Prewitt;\n       Senator Collins--Michael Bopp;\n       Senator Daschle--Andrea LaRue;\n       Senator Dodd--Kennie Gill, Veronica Gillespie;\n       Senator Feingold--Mary Murphy, Bob Schiff, Bill Dauster;\n       Senator Feinstein--Gray Maxwell, Mark Kadesh;\n       Senator Hagel--Lou Ann Linehan;\n       Senator Jeffords--Eric Buehlmann;\n       Senator Levin--Linda Gustitus, Ken Saccoccia;\n       Senator Lieberman--Laurie Rubenstein;\n       Senator Lott--Sharon Soderstrom;\n       Senator McCain--Mark Buse, Ann Choiniere, Lloyd Ator, Ken \n     LaSala;\n       Senator McConnell--Tamara Somerville, Hunter Bates, Andrew \n     Siff, Brian Lewis;\n       Senator Schumer--Martin Siegel;\n       Senator Snowe--Jane Calderwood, John Richter;\n       Senator Thompson--Bill Outhier, Hannah Sistare, Fred \n     Ansell.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, were I limited to thanking one individual, \nit would be Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, a man of great courage \nand conviction. His partnership in this effort is one of the greatest \nprivileges I have ever had in public life. He is in every respect the \nbetter half of McCain-Feingold. I want him to know, Mr. President, that \nI will never forget it. I might also add that he is well served by his \nstaff as I am by mine.\n  Lastly, I thank every one of my colleagues, those who supported our \nbill and those who did not, particularly my friend Senator Hagel, for \nthe good faith and fairmindedness that all have brought to this debate.\n  I believe the events of the last 2 weeks have been a great credit to \nthis body, and that is tribute to every Senator. Indeed, as we approach \nwhat I believe will be a successful outcome for the proponents of this \nlegislation, I can say I have never been prouder to be a Member of the \nSenate. Because of my failings, I might not always show it, but I \nconsider myself blessed to serve in the company of so many capable \nleaders of our fair country.\n  I asked at the start of this debate for my colleagues to take a risk \nfor America. In a few moments, I believe we will do just that. I will \ngo to my grave deeply grateful for the honor of being part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 64 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The bill (S. 27), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the effort by Senators McCain and \nFeingold to try to rein in some of the rampant spending that takes \nplace in political campaigns. Today I voted for S. 27, the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2001.\n  While I voted for final passage of S. 27, I do not feel that it goes \nfar enough. The only way that we will ever get control over the money \nin politics is if we put limits on campaign spending, and the only way \nto achieve that goal is to address the Constitutional hurdles raised by \nthe Supreme Court. Unfortunately, by equating free speech with campaign \nspending, the Supreme Court placed a substantial roadblock in the path \nto campaign finance reform. We will not have true campaign finance \nreform until Congress and the States approve a Constitutional Amendment \nwhich clearly articulates that Congress can regulate fundraising and \nexpenditures for campaigns. That is why I supported the constitutional \namendment offered by Senator Hollings.\n  I understand that the sponsors of this bill worked to craft \nlegislation that would maintain the support of a majority of Senators, \nand, at the same time, would also stand up to the certain Court \nchallenges it will face. I hope that this bill will make some progress \nin limiting the power and influence of money in our elections, but I \nbelieve that we still have a long way to go.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, occasionally, that massive soft money \nmachine, the New York Times, runs something accurate about campaign \nfinance. Such as the op-ed I authored\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nwhich appeared in the April 1 edition. The focus of the piece is the \ntremendous harm enactment of the McCain-Feingold bill would do to our \ndemocracy, by severely weakening the two great political parties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my op-ed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Time, Apr. 1, 2001]\n\n                        In Defense of Soft Money\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       Washington--It now appears that among the legacies of the \n     Bill Clinton presidency will be a ``reform'' of a campaign \n     financing that devastate the national political parties. The \n     1996 Clinton campaign's courting of illegal foreign \n     contributions for the Democratic National Committee and the \n     Clintons' use of the Lincoln Bedroom to entertain \n     contributors, followed by Mr. Clinton's pardons for criminals \n     championed by big donors to the Democrats, have cast a pall \n     over national party committees. And all of this propelled the \n     prohibition of soft money--donations made to political \n     parties and not subject to federal contributions limits--to \n     the top of the reform agenda.\n  Earlier, the centerpiece of reform efforts had been limits on \ncandidates' own spending. In 1997 Senators John McCain and Russ \nFeingold dropped these spending limits from their reform bill, along \nwith bans on political action committees and on ``bunding''--when \nindividuals and groups collect multiple contributions.\n  Hard money, in Washington parlance, is the funds and activities \ntargeted to electing specific candidates to federal office. These funds \nare already subject to severe contribution limits, set in 1974 and \nnever adjusted for inflation, and to requirements for disclosing the \nnames of donors and the amounts they gave. The national parties \nthemselves also raise money, which they need for issue advocacy, for \nhelping state and local candidates, for paying overhead expenses like \nthe costs of computers and lawyers (to comply with the array of \nelection laws), and for get-out-the-vote efforts that benefit all of a \nparty's nominees on Election Day. This ``nonfederal'' money is subject \nto regulations in the States. But because it has often been used in \nways that do help federal candidates, it has come to be called ``soft \nmoney.''\n  The Republican and Democratic National Committees, and the Republican \nand Democratic senatorial and congressional committees, are national in \nscope. Gubernational and state legislative elections are among the \nhighest priorities of the national parties, so they help candidates in \nthose races accordingly--with funds governed under the relevant state \nlaws and spent in consultation with state party committees. But federal \ncandidates are a focus of the national committees, too. And with \ncampaigns for federal offices starved for hard money by the antiquated \n1974 limits, the national parties have become increasingly resourceful \nin utilizing soft money to fill the void in federal elections.\n       In recent years, the parties have used soft money to run \n     ads defending their nominees from attacks by special interest \n     groups and to help challengers compete against well-financed \n     incumbents. Help from the parties often provides the only \n     chance nonincumbent and nonmillionaire candidates have to be \n     competitive in Congressional elections.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill now working its way through \n     Congress would prohibit the national committees from raising \n     or spending any soft money--that is, any money not covered by \n     federal contribution limits--at any time for any purpose. It \n     would also federalize campaign-related spending by state \n     parties in even-numbered years, thus forcing even the state \n     parties to rely on far more scarce hard money, with results \n     that are likely to be devastating.\n       Even if only one federal candidate were on the ballot in a \n     state where the chief voter interest was in the governor's \n     race, a mayoral contest or control of the state legislature, \n     all party voter registration and turnout activities in that \n     state within 120 days of the election would be subject to the \n     severe limits on contributions set by Congress--and therefore \n     underfunded and diminished. Special-interest group issue ads \n     would go unanswered by the parties. Challengers, historically \n     shunned by political action committees but boosted by \n     parties, would be on their own. Incumbents and selffunded \n     millionaire candidates would flourish.\n       Speculation rages over which party would get the greater \n     advantage from the ban on soft money. Many Republicans, \n     believing that liberal-leaning news outlets will favor \n     Democrats and noting that much of the political activity of \n     the biggest Democratic ally, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., is largely \n     unimpeded by McCain-Feingold's provisions, fear Democrats may \n     be the greatest beneficiary. Conversely, there is concern \n     among some Democrats that forcing the parties to rely solely \n     on the limited and relatively puny hard-money contributions \n     may benefit Republicans.\n       One result of McCain-Feingold is certain: America loses. \n     The parties are vital institutions in our democracy, \n     smoothing ideological edges and promoting citizen \n     participation. The two major parties are the big tents where \n     multitudes of individuals and groups with narrow agendas \n     converge to promote candidates and broad philosophies about \n     the role of government in our society.\n       If special interests cannot give to parties as they have, \n     they will use their money to influence elections in other \n     ways: placing unlimited, unregulated and undisclosed issue \n     advertisements; ;mounting their own get-out-the-vote efforts; \n     forming their own action groups. Unrestrained by the \n     balancing effect of parties, which bring multiple interests \n     together, America's politics are likely to fragment. \n     ``Virtual'' parties will be able to proliferate--shadowy \n     groups with innocuous-sounding names like the Group in Favor \n     of Republican Majorities or the Citizens for Democratics in \n     2012 that will hold potentially enormous sway in a post-\n     McCain-Feingold world where the parties are diminished for \n     lack of money.\n       Under McCain-Feingold, the power of special interests will \n     not be deterred or diminished. Their speech, political \n     activity and right to ``petition the government for a redress \n     of grievances'' (that is, to lobby) are protected by the \n     First Amendment. Political spending will not reduced; it just \n     will not flow through the parties.\n       Do we really want the two-party system, which has served us \n     so well, to be weakened in favor of greater power for wealthy \n     candidates and single-issue group? McCain-Feingold will not \n     take any money out of politics. It just takes the parties out \n     of politics.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it's a little late, but hopefully not \ntoo late, that the Washington Post runs a page one story exploring the \nMcCain-Feingold's destructive impact on vital democratic institutions: \nthe two great political parties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 1, 2001]\n\n           Campaign Bill Could Shift Power Away From Parties\n\n                  (By Ruth Marcus and Juliet Eilperin)\n\n       If the campaign finance bill nearing final passage by the \n     Senate becomes law, it could dramatically alter the practice \n     of modern politics, curtailing the influence of political \n     parties and potentially enhancing the power of outside groups \n     that would not be subject to strict contribution and \n     disclosure rules.\n       Campaign consultants and senior lawmakers said the biggest \n     immediate impact would be the slashing of the budgets of the \n     Democratic and Republican parties, which together raised \n     nearly half a billion dollars in the last election in ``soft \n     money,'' the unlimited contributions from corporations, \n     unions and wealthy individuals that would be banned under the \n     Senate bill.\n       That money, accounting for one-third of Republican Party \n     committees' funds and nearly half the budget of Democratic \n     Party committees, financed get-out-the-vote drives, \n     television ads praising or attacking specific candidates, and \n     basic administrative costs.\n       Although the parties would suffer under the new system, \n     political experts say, the beneficiaries could be independent \n     groups that have proliferated in recent years to press \n     their agendas on gun control, the environment, abortion \n     and other issues.\n       The bill, sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and \n     Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), puts significant new restrictions \n     on such groups. Corporations, labor and ideological groups on \n     the left and right would not be able to use their own soft \n     money to run issue advertisements that name candidates within \n     60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. The \n     use of such advertising, often indistinguishable from \n     ordinary campaign commercials, has skyrocketed in recent \n     elections.\n       However, unlike the political parties, outside groups could \n     still collect unlimited checks from any source. They could \n     also run whatever ads they wanted up to the deadline and \n     after that could engage in other forms of political activity, \n     such as telephone banks and mailings.\n       In addition, the legislation would not end all issue \n     advertising, even close to an election. For example, wealthy \n     individual donors--who cannot constitutionally be stopped \n     from spending their own money--are not covered. Moreover, the \n     restrictions on outside groups are the part of the \n     legislation most likely to be thrown out by a court.\n       ``The world under McCain-Feingold is a world where the \n     loudest voices in the process are third-party groups.'' \n     Republican election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg Said. ``My fear \n     is that the parties will just wither and essentially people \n     will be motivated to get out to vote by the groups which \n     champion the issues they care about.''\n       A top democratic operative offered a similar assessment. \n     ``The fear here is all you're doing is opening up a very \n     large, underground flow of money in national politics,'' said \n     David Plouffe, who headed the House\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\n     Democrats' campaign operation in the last election.\n       But Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, which is lobbying for \n     the bill, said there would be ``far less leakage'' of soft \n     money to outside groups than some anticipate, especially from \n     corporations. ``People are missing the fact that a large \n     number of soft-money donors are tired of being hit up and \n     tired of facing the equivalent of political extortion,'' he \n     said.\n       If the Senate approves it Monday, the McCain-Feingold bill \n     will still have numerous hurdles to surmount. It must pass \n     the House, which has voted for similar measures, but now--\n     with campaign overhaul far closer to reality--Republican \n     leaders are vowing opposition. It must also be signed by \n     President Bush, who disagrees with a number of provisions but \n     has indicated that he cannot be counted on to veto the bill. \n     And perhaps most important, it must survive the \n     constitutional challenge that will immediately be mounted in \n     the courts.\n       Nonetheless, the prospect of Senate approval brings the \n     bill a huge step closer to reality. As its most ardent foe, \n     Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said last week: ``There is \n     nobody to come to the rescue. This train is moving down the \n     track.''\n       That momentum has left elected officials, political \n     strategists and election lawyers of both parties trying to \n     predict what life would be like under the new regime--and \n     whether Republicans or Democrats would be better off. Both \n     sides insisted that the measure would benefit their opponents \n     but also acknowledged that the ultimate winners and losers \n     would not be clear for some time.\n       Experts disagreed about whether the measure would help \n     challengers or incumbents. Many said the bill would help \n     incumbents because parties would not have the same ability to \n     mount extensive advertising campaigns on behalf of \n     challengers and because it allows incumbents to raise \n     additional money against challenges by millionaire \n     candidates. But others said challengers would be helped by \n     the increase in the limits on direct contributions to \n     candidates and parties known as ``hard money.'' The limit on \n     how much an individual can give to a single candidate would \n     double to $2,000.\n       Some effects of the bill were not disputed. Because it \n     raises the overall amount of hard money that individuals can \n     contribute in an election cycle from $25,000 to $37,500, \n     Washington lobbyists are already wincing at the effect on \n     their bank accounts. Because many lobbyists give the maximum \n     allowed for a married couple, that would mean the total \n     amount they and a spouse could give would grow $25,000, to \n     $75,000 an election.\n       In addition, parties would have to dramatically change \n     their operations, which have become dependent on using a \n     combination of soft and hard dollars to do everything from \n     paying the light bill to running ads.\n       ``What we are doing is destroying the party system in \n     America,'' said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Martin Frost \n     (Tex.). ``The political parties would be neutered, and third-\n     party groups would run the show.''\n       ``We both lose,'' McConnell said. ``This is mutual assured \n     destruction of the political parties.''\n       Some campaign finance experts said such concerns were \n     overstated, nothing that the parties took in nearly $720 \n     million in hard money in the last election and would be able \n     to raise even more under McCain-Feingold, which slightly \n     increases the individual contribution limits to political \n     parties, from $20,000 to $25,000.\n       ``I do not think that a ban on soft money will cripple the \n     parties,'' said Colby College political scientist Anthony \n     Corrado. ``The parties now raise twice as much hard money as \n     they were raising 10 years ago, and the parties were very \n     active in the late `80 and early `90 in election campaigns \n     without really any reliance on soft money.''\n       Because Republicans have built up a larger base of small \n     donors and therefore vastly out raise Democrats in hard-money \n     contributions operatives on both sides agreed that, at least \n     in the short term, the Democrats would be at a significant \n     disadvantage. During the last campaign, Republicans and \n     Democrats raised equivalent amounts of soft money, but \n     Republicans took in $447 million in hard money to the \n     Democrats' $270 million.\n       ``The best example of why Republicans will do better than \n     Democrats is to look at the Bush campaign last year,'' \n     Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jerry Backus said, \n     citing the more than $100 million the Bush primary campaign \n     raised in hard money.\n       Democrats also voiced concern that they would be targeted \n     in the waning days of the campaign by well-funded independent \n     Republican groups.\n       ``We have established interest groups that have been very \n     effective on our behalf,'' a Democratic strategist said. \n     ``What we have never had are the instant groups that spring \n     up for the specific immediate purposes of influencing \n     elections and that are encouraged to form under this bill. . \n     . . Democrats are going to be shuffling around dramatically \n     more limited resources and not able to provide air cover for \n     their members against those attacks.''\n       Yet Republicans say democrats would be helped because they \n     would benefit from continued heavy union spending and because \n     wealthy Democrats would simply write checks to outside \n     groups.\n       Two academics who are sympathetic to McCain-Feingold said \n     the Democrats' shortfall in hard money would be offset by the \n     greater number of advocacy group ads supporting Democrats. \n     ``The experience of the last two elections suggest that \n     neither Democrats nor Republicans would be disproportionately \n     harmed,'' said Kenneth Goldstein and Jonathan Krasno. \n     ``Indeed, neither party stands to gain or lose much against \n     their counterparts.''\n       Michael S. Berman, a veteran Democratic political \n     strategist, said any predictions are foolhardy. ``Of one \n     thing I'm certain,'' Berman said. ``Whatever we think the \n     effect will be, whoever we think it will help, we will be \n     wrong, because we've always been wrong.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of \ntechnical amendments to S. 27, which are at the desk, be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. These technical \nchanges have been agreed to by the chairman and ranking member of the \nRules Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 171) was agreed to, as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I spent the past three days with a number \nof my colleagues on a fact-finding trip to the Artic National Wildlife \nRefuge. I took this trip to help prepare myself for one of the most \nimportant environmental and energy issues before us: whether or not to \npermit drilling for oil in the 1002 Area of ANWR. I wish to thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Murkowski, for arranging and hosting \nour tour.\n  This trip was reportedly scheduled several weeks ago in consultation \nwith the Majority Leader, who at that time did not expect the trip to \nconflict with votes in the Senate. Unfortunately, two votes did occur \nlast Friday on amendments to S. 27, the campaign finance bill, and I \nwas not present for them. Last Thursday evening, after reviewing the \nnature of these two amendments, I was advised by Democratic leaders to \nkeep my commitment to undertake the trip.\n  Had I not been necessarily absent last Friday, I would have cast my \nvote in support of the Reed Amendment Number 164, as modified, because \nit would improve the ability of the Federal Election Commission to \nenforce the law. I would also have voted in favor of the McCain \nAmendment Number 165, because it would make more workable the bill's \nrestrictions on the coordination of independent expenditures. Both of \nthese amendments would\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nhave strengthened the underlying bill, which I strongly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/02/senate-section/article/S3261-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3261-S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                      2001-2011--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to H. Con. Res. 83, \nthe House budget resolution, and my motion to proceed be limited to 10 \nminutes--5 minutes under the control of Senator Conrad and 5 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Domenici--and, following that debate, the \nSenate proceed to the adoption of the motion and that the motion to \nreconsider then be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, then, Mr. President, there will \nbe no further votes today. However, votes will occur throughout the day \nand into the evening tomorrow and probably Wednesday and Thursday also.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping work out this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, Senator Kent Conrad. What we have \nagreed to in the unanimous consent is that he and I will each speak for \n5 minutes, after which we will adopt the House-passed budget \nresolution, after which the Senator from New Mexico will send a \nsubstitute to the desk which will be the Bush-Domenici amendment. We \nwill get that much done tonight.\n  For Senators who might want to speak, we should be there rather \nquickly, do what I have just described, and we will be here if Senators \nwant to come down and speak. I understand there is at least one Senator \non our side who would like to make a speech tonight, and we have talked \nwith Senator Conrad, if there are any on his side who would like to \nspeak.\n  It looks as though the magic hour tonight is certainly somewhere \naround 9 o'clock because it seems like it would be very uncomfortable \nafter 9 o'clock for Senators to be around here, and we will not be \ndoing any voting until tomorrow. So that looks like a nice time to \nshoot for, as far as how much time we will use. I will certainly save \nfor tomorrow a more detailed analysis of why we are here.\n  I will say tonight that it is very important to most Republicans--I \nthink I speak for almost every Republican Senator; I am not overstating \nthe case, almost every Republican Senator--that this President, George \nW. Bush, deserves to have his budget and his tax plan considered by the \nSenate. That is what the arguments have been about thus far. Should he \nhave a chance? What I am saying tonight is, yes, he should and, yes, I \nam grateful now that, after a lot of back and forth, the other side of \nthe aisle has agreed that we can call up the budget that we heretofore \ntalked about, the Bush-Domenici budget.\n  Everyone should know that budget has a couple of things different \nthan the one I proposed maybe a week ago. Those things are that the \nreconciliation instruction on the taxes is not in the budget \nresolution. The reason for that is simple and does not require much \nfinger pointing or much time.\n  Essentially, it was determined, parliamentary-wise, that would not \nwork, putting the reconciliation instruction on a budget resolution at \nthis time. We intend to offer it at a later time in an up-or-down vote \non the floor of the Senate, and I am certain that while some might want \nto delay that--I haven't heard that from my friend, Senator Kent \nConrad--we will have that vote. We are hopeful by then we will have 51 \nvotes for that, and we will be back where we were originally. It will \nbe in our budget resolution as it goes on its way to the House for \nconference.\n  Having said that, in the few minutes I have, I will say that the \nPresident of the United States and a very brand new staff, who did not \nhave very much time, put together a rather good budget, which the \nSenator from New Mexico has looked at--at least the profile of it, the \nplan for it. I have looked at that, and I have modeled the budget after \nthat.\n  Let me tick off what our new President wanted us to do that we are \ngoing to try to do in the next few days: One, save Social Security; \ntwo, save Medicare; three, provide, in the opinion of the President, \nadequate defense until and unless he gets his top-down review; and to \nprovide new and increased spending for education. And he did that, and \nwe proposed that within the discretionary funding in this budget \nresolution.\n  In addition, the President of the United States proposed that we \nshould have a major tax bill. Frankly, in due course, the tax-writing \ncommittee will work their will. This is not a Senator putting something \noff; it is just stating the facts and the law. In a budget resolution, \nyou just use dollar numbers. So you tell the Finance Committee where \nthey have latitude to cut taxes. They will determine how, what kind, \nand we will be saying in this budget resolution you have permission to \ndo up to $1.6 trillion over a decade.\n  Before we are finished--since some of my friends have gone on \ntelevision and talked about how big this $1.6 trillion is--I want to \nuse a whole series of numbers as to what that looks like over 10 years \nto eventually convince people that it is not a very big number--whether \nyou consider the total gross domestic product, total tax take--whatever \nyou want to look at--it is a pretty modest number. The President would \nlike us to consider that. We want to give him the right to consider \nthat in this budget resolution.\n  My last comments have to do with what else is in this budget of a \nhigh priority and a big substance; that is, we reduce the national debt \nby $2 trillion over the decade. We think that is the right amount. We \nthink that is a fair amount. We also think, considering the size of the \nsurpluses, that probably is what we ought to do. We prescribe that in \nthis budget resolution.\n  I have given a summary tonight, as brief as it was. We will \nultimately talk about more detail. We have done this budget with this \nkind of spending in it. The President has a 4-percent increase, year \nupon year, over the last year's budget for discretionary spending. In \nmy opinion, that is a pretty good amount.\n  Mr. President, we won't adopt the House measure. We will make it \npending, after which we will offer a substitute. I note that the \nParliamentarian was nodding his head.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from New \nMexico. I thank all of my colleagues who have worked hard to bring us \nto this position today.\n  However, we don't believe we ought to be on the budget resolution \ntonight. We don't believe we ought to be on the budget resolution \nbecause we don't have a budget from the President. Not only do we not \nhave a budget from the President, because he has not even provided \nsufficient detail for the Joint Committee on Taxation or the \nCongressional Budget Office to give us an independent review of what \nhis tax proposal costs, but we believe we should have waited until that \nanalysis was available.\n  Third, there has been no markup in the Budget Committee. Always \nbefore, with one exception, we have had a markup in the Budget \nCommittee. And always we have at least tried in the Budget Committee to \nmark up a budget resolution for our colleagues on the floor. This year, \nthere was not even an attempt.\n  Fourth, there will be an attempt in the budget resolution to use \nreconciliation for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, which we believe threatens \nthe constitutional role of the Senate.\n  Now ``reconciliation'' is a word that I am certain many of our \nlisteners really have no idea of its meaning. I must confess I didn't \nfully understand reconciliation until a detailed review of that \nprocess. What it provides is that\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nthe typical operation of the Senate was to provide a ``cooling saucer'' \nin our constitutional construct, so that the House of Representatives \nreacted immediately and responded to the will of the people at the \nmoment. The Senate was designed to be the cooling saucer, where calmer \nand cooler reflection could permit a further analysis, unlimited \ndebate, with every Senator having the right to amend. Those are the \nfundamental constructs of this institution. All of that is short-\ncircuited under reconciliation. All of that is out the window, and the \nSenate becomes a second House of Representatives.\n  We believe the Bush budget puts this country in the hole because if \nyou start with the projected surplus of $5.6 trillion and subtract out \nthe trust funds of Medicare and Social Security, that leaves you with \nan available surplus of $2.5 trillion. When we look at the cost of the \nBush tax cut as partially reestimated, and the alternative minimum tax \nthat will have to be reformed because of the Bush tax cut, which costs \nanother $300 billion, and the associated interest costs of $500 \nbillion, and the spending proposals in this budget of $200 billion, you \nhave a total cost of the Bush plan at $2.7 trillion. That tells us this \nPresident's plan puts us right into the trust fund and puts us in the \nhole by $200 billion.\n  On our side, we will offer an alternative that does the following:\n  We will protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds in every \nyear. We will pay down the maximum amount of the publicly held debt. We \nwill provide for an immediate fiscal stimulus of $60 billion.\n  I might add, that is what we think we should be doing this week. We \nthink we should be passing on the floor of the Senate an immediate \nfiscal stimulus. That is what we think should be done.\n  Fourth, we will provide significant tax relief for all Americans, \nincluding rate reduction, marriage penalty relief, and estate tax \nreform.\n  Finally, we will reserve resources for the high priority domestic \nneeds, including improving education, a prescription drug benefit, \nstrengthening our national defense, and funding agriculture.\n\n  Finally, we will provide $750 billion to strengthen Social Security \nand address our long-term debt.\n  So this is a fundamental debate about the economic future of our \ncountry. We look forward to it on our side. We look forward to a \nhealthy and vigorous and polite debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 83) establishing the \n     congressional budget of the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2002, revising the congressional budget for the \n     United States Government for fiscal year 2001, and setting \n     forth appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years \n     2003 through 2011.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 170\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 170.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have an agreement and understanding \nthat there will be no amendments offered tonight. Incidentally, for \nthose who wonder what that amendment I sent to the desk is, that \namendment is the budget I submitted on Thursday of last week to the \nother side of the aisle. When my friend got it--maybe he got it the \nnext day. It was there for circulation. It is the same budget.\n  Senator Gramm from Texas asked if he could speak tonight. I want it \nto go out to his office and others that we would like for him to come \ndown. I do not intend to speak until 9 o'clock, considering however \nlong my friend wants to speak. That would be an awful long time for \neach of us to listen to ourselves, although we both probably have a lot \nto say. It probably would be fun to listen.\n  I yield myself, for purposes of making sure we keep ourselves under \ncontrol, 10 minutes and ask that I be reminded when I have used that \ntime.\n  I hope we do not spend an awful lot of time talking about whether or \nnot we have sufficient information from the President of the United \nStates to proceed on this budget. I do not want to spend a long time on \nit, but I remind everyone--those Senators in their offices who are \nlistening, or those who give Senators information about what is \nhappening on the floor.\n  I spoke earlier of trying to give a new President an opportunity to \nhave his budget considered and his tax proposal considered. I want \neveryone to know the other side of the aisle, when they had the \nmajority, when they had a brand new President named William Jefferson \nClinton--he did not have the luxury of being in office for very long to \nwrite up a budget--the other side of the aisle, in its majority status \nwith their President, proceeded to bring up a budget resolution, and \nthe President of the United States, Bill Clinton, had not sent a budget \nto the Congress.\n  In fact, the budget resolution was adopted by the Senate on a party-\nline vote. The other side of the aisle had the majority. It was \nadopted, and the President had not sent us a budget in its totality.\n  It went to conference with the House. They conferred upon it and \nbrought it back and passed a final version of a budget resolution \nwhich, incidentally, included not tax cuts but tax increases, tax \nincreases that if you looked at them in today's gross domestic product \nnumbers would be equivalent to almost a trillion dollars in tax \nincreases.\n  Various committees--10, I think--were instructed to make changes in \nmatters that they could make changes in to effect a budget--some of \nthem up, some of them down. The important point is all of that was done \nby the other side of the aisle when they had a new President without a \nfinal budget document. They had a 100-page document, more or less, \ncalled ``A Vision for America.''\n  Our new President, who was elected--and even though some want to \ncontest that election, I believe President Bush got a higher percentage \nof votes than did Bill Clinton because there were three people running. \nI do not think we ought to be hearkening back as to who had the moral \nauthority to give us a budget. We have a President. He sent us his \nvision document, and it was used by the Budget Committee, including \nthis Senator and the staff on this side. It was used to develop the \nbudget that I sent to the desk.\n  Frankly, I repeat, I hope we do not have an argument now from every \nSenator on the other side of the aisle that we should delay this \nbecause we do not have the President's detailed budget. Summarizing, \nneither did the other side of the aisle, the then-majority, have the \nbudget of the new Democratic President, Bill Clinton, when they \nproduced a budget resolution and the entire finality of a 5-year game \nplan for America's fiscal policy and tax policy.\n\n  If we get the budget next week and this budget resolution is still \naround, I remind everyone that the details in the President's budget \nmay enlighten some people, but it will not necessarily have an impact \non this budget resolution because we do not have the authority to \ndetermine small itemized programs. That all goes to the Appropriations \nCommittee, as the Chair now recognizes, and they make the final \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, have I used my 10 minutes yet?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has only used 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Gramm will return after we have \nused some time, and I welcome that.\n  I want to speak a little bit and then tomorrow will give more \ndetailed\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nstatements, or tonight, when we have more time.\n  This budget does not include the dollars in tax receipts that would \nbe forthcoming if we had ANWR in this budget, as prescribed by the \nPresident. That would be an expectation of $1.2 trillion in the third \nyear of this budget. We did not put that in. That does not preclude, \nnor does it enhance, the passage of ANWR. It just means that in a \nbudget resolution at this point in time, which is very close in votes, \nwe chose not to put it in, and it will be taken up at a later time.\n  Also, President Bush had a 10-year budget that covers 2002, and it is \nover a 10-year period. He proposed that a portion of the projected $5.6 \ntrillion budget surplus be returned to the American taxpayers in tax \nrelief. We still have that in this budget, but we also have prescribed \nsomething he did not have, which is that in this year, 2001, there be \nmade available up to $60 billion of this year's surplus--$60 billion. \nTomorrow we will talk in more detail from where that comes. \nEssentially, believe it or not, it is a surplus that exists right now \nin the budget of the United States, and we decided that we ought to \ngive some of it to the tax-writing committee to prescribe this year's \nstimulus of their prescription. We cannot write a tax bill, so the tax-\nwriting committee will determine how.\n  I was very thrilled when I presented this budget to the Republicans \nin a caucus and almost all were there. For the first time, they saw \nthis budget, and they also saw from me a proposal that we ought to use \n$60 billion to ``stimulate'' the economy now. They said, to a man and \nto a woman: Let's do it.\n  Nobody should misunderstand. We did not suggest that day, nor are we \nsuggesting today, that we should adopt a $60 billion stimulus without \nproviding permanent changes in the Tax Code that enhance growth and \nprosperity.\n  We have said what our President said. He agrees with us on the $60 \nbillion stimulus this year, almost the same day we talked about it, but \nhe said, as we said then and as we say today, it would be foolhardy to \nadopt a current 1-year stimulus package without reforming the Tax Code \nso as to provide for more prosperity over a longer period of time.\n  I understand there is a difference between our side and their side on \nwhat the tax changes should look like, but I hope even in their \nproposal on tax reduction, they would cause an improvement in the \neconomy over time by cutting marginal rates; that is, cutting the \ncurrent point at which you go to the next bracket and pay the next \nhighest amount of the Tax Code.\n  We propose that every bracket, every margin, be given a cut. When the \ntime comes to debate that more fully, we can talk about who is right \nabout what it ought to look like. For now, it does not matter too much \nwhat we think because the tax-writing committee is going to end up \ndetermining that.\n  I could get up here and tell the taxpayers: Here is a list of the \nthings we want out of the budget resolution, but I want everybody to \nknow, on the tax side, if we said that, all that is binding on the \ncommittees of the Congress is the total, $1.6 trillion and the $60 \nbillion surplus for stimulus. They can provide what kind of stimulus.\n  The other side of the aisle will talk about what they like. We will \ntalk about what we like. That is just debate because the Finance \nCommittee, under Senator Grassley's chairmanship in the Senate, will \ndecide what kind of stimulus. They will also decide what kind of tax \nchanges are going to accrue, what can the American taxpayers really get \nby way of a return of their money. Essentially, that is where we are.\n\n  I will spend a few minutes on a very interesting word. The word is \n``reconciliation.'' My friend, Senator Byrd, is not on the floor. He \npronounces it differently. It doesn't matter whether we pronounce it \nreconciliation as the Senator from New Mexico does or as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia does; it is the same animal.\n  So everybody will understand, we decided 25 years ago to change the \nprocedures of the Senate. What do I mean? When we adopted the Budget \nAct, with the help of a lot of experts, including the best \nParliamentarians they could muster to help write it, that Budget Act \nsaid if you are going to do a reconciliation instruction, by \ndefinition, here is what it means. It means if you do that, you have \nheld that the Senate no longer is bound by a filibuster rule on that \nbill that comes from reconciliation. You cannot filibuster it.\n  That is a dramatic change in the rules of the Senate. For those who \ncomplain about it, when we get a chance to vote on it, what we say to \nthem is, go back and amend the bill that created it. It is already 25 \nyears old. Anybody who wanted to amend it, to take out this authority \ncould have, but it is there. It is there to be used by Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  How efficient is it and does it work? Yes, indeed. The other side of \nthe aisle adopted the entire Clinton plan on taxes and budget changes \nin a reconciliation bill to the committees.\n  What else does it do about Senate rules? The Senate rules are very \nimportant to this Senator. I understand the institution. It is \ncherished that we can amend to our heart's content. There is no real \nlimit on amendments--except under the Budget Act. And 25 years ago, we \nagreed if you have a budget that orders reconciliation, and a bill that \ncomes forth from that, it is not amendable in the ordinary manner. As a \nmatter of fact, it is very narrowly amended. It has been used to \nincrease taxes, obviously. President Clinton increased taxes. It has \nbeen used to reduce taxes. In 1997, there was a tax decrease, tax cuts. \nWe used this now famous process of ``reconciliation.''\n  It is a very important change in the rules of the Senate. It says \nthose reconciliation bills no longer are treated as other bills in the \nSenate. Just remember, this isn't the first time. We have been using it \nfor 25 years. It changed forever until we repeal that act.\n  We think it is appropriate here. We will have at least an hour's \ndebate on whether it is or is not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has talked \nfurther about reconciliation. Let me make it clear this will be one of \nthe most consequential votes in the Senate in any of our memories. If \nthis precedent is adopted that says you can totally take away the \nsafeguards of the Senate, change the constitutional structure of this \nbody by using that methodology for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, then the \ndoor is wide open for every kind of abuse.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says reconciliation can be used by either \nside. That is true. It is also true it can be abused by either side.\n  I remember very well in 1993 and 1994 when we had massive health care \nlegislation being considered and a group of Senators were approached \nand asked if we would support the use of reconciliation that short-\ncircuits Senators' rights to debate and amend, to pass that \nlegislation. A group of Senators said, no; that would be an abuse of \nthe process to pass a $138 billion spending initiative based on limited \ndebate and limited amendment. That is not what the Senate was designed \nfor; that is not what the Founding Fathers intended for this body.\n  The Founding Fathers intended for this body to be, as I described \nbefore, the cooling saucer, where we could have extended debate and \nunlimited amendment to determine the outcome to protect the American \npeople, to protect the rights of a minority.\n  We are on the brink of sweeping all of that aside in the name of a \ntax cut, to take away those protections for a minority, to take away \nthose protections for an individual Senator to represent his or her \nconstituents, to take away those protections for this institution. It \nis wrong; it is dead wrong. It was wrong in 1993 and 1994 to use it for \na spending provision. It would be wrong, dead wrong, to use it now for \na tax cut. The whole purpose of reconciliation was for deficit \nreduction.\n  The Senator from New Mexico quite correctly says in 1993 \nreconciliation was used by our side--he is exactly right--for deficit \nreduction. That was a package that cut spending and raised taxes to \nreduce deficits.\n  This package is the opposite of that. This package is the opposite.\n  When the Senator talks about previous precedents, he cites 1997. Yes, \nreconciliation was used. But, again,\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nthat was part of an overall package of deficit reduction.\n  We have gone over the precedents with respect to budget \nreconciliation. We find only one case, back in 1976, where \nreconciliation was used for a tax cut, absent other deficit reduction \nprovisions. That was a $6 billion item. It was vetoed.\n  In 1993, reconciliation was used. It was used for deficit reduction. \nIn 1997, reconciliation was used. It was used for deficit reduction. \nThat is the reason we have those provisions.\n  I cite Senator Domenici himself in a letter I wrote to the \nParliamentarian. Senator Domenici said:\n\n       Frankly, as the chairman of the Budget Committee I am aware \n     of how beneficial reconciliation can be to deficit reduction. \n     But I'm also totally aware of what can happen when we choose \n     to use this kind of process to basically get around the rules \n     of the Senate as to limiting debate. Clearly, unlimited \n     debate is the prerogative of the Senate that is greatly \n     modified under this process.\n       I have grown to understand this institution. While it has a \n     lot of shortcomings, it has some qualities that are rather \n     exceptional. One of those is the fact that it is an extremely \n     free institution, that we are free to offer amendments, that \n     we are free to take as much time as this Senate will let us, \n     to debate and have those issues thoroughly understood both \n     here and across the country.\n  That was Senator Domenici, on October 24, 1985.\n  The Senator was right then. He is wrong now.\n  He said later, on October 13, 1989:\n\n       There are a few things about the U.S. Senate that people \n     understand to be very, very significant. One is that you have \n     the right, the rather broad right, the most significant right \n     among all parliamentary bodies in the world, to amend freely \n     on the floor. The other is the right to debate and to \n     filibuster. When the Budget Act was drafted, the \n     reconciliation procedure was crafted very carefully. It was \n     intended to be used rather carefully because, in essence, Mr. \n     President, it vitiated those two significant characteristics \n     of this place that many have grown to respect and admire. \n     Some think it is a marvelous institution of democracy. And if \n     you lose those two qualities you just about turn this U.S. \n     Senate into the U.S. House of Representatives or other \n     parliamentary body.\n\n  The Senator was right then. He is wrong now. It is an absolute abuse \nof reconciliation to use it for purposes other than deficit reduction. \nIf we allow it here, we are going to open the floodgates. Someday it \nmay be used or abused for spending, as was attempted back in 1993-1994, \nwhen a group of us on our side stood up and said: No, don't you dare. \nBecause we will not be any part of damaging this institution or \nundermining the constitutional role of the Senate.\n  It is as wrong to have used reconciliation for a $138 billion \nspending initiative as it is to propose it for a $1.6 trillion tax cut. \nBoth of them are dead wrong. Reconciliation was designed, not for \nspending, not for tax cuts, but for deficit reduction. Senators agreed \nto restrict their fundamental rights to amend and debate in the \ninterest of deficit reduction. Now we are talking about Senators giving \nup their fundamental rights to debate and to amend--for what? For the \nopposite of deficit reduction. That would be a profound mistake. As \nSenator Domenici himself observed in 1989, that could change for all \ntime this Chamber and its role in the United States and the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  I hope very much we do not go down that road. I hope very much that \nwiser and cooler and calmer heads will prevail. We can address the \nPresident's tax cut under the regular order. We can use the normal \nprocedures of the Senate just as was done in 1981 with the big Reagan \ntax cut. They didn't use reconciliation; they used the normal \nprocedures of the Senate that permitted debate and amendment and not a \nshort circuiting of the process or an abuse of the process.\n  Mr. President, How much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Chair notify me when I have used another 10 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to run through a number of \ncharts and use those for a broader discussion of the budget resolution \nas we embark on its consideration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator ask for an additional 10 minutes? Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just asked the Chair to notify me when I consumed \nanother 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think one of the most important things about this \ndebate is the question of whether or not we learn anything from \nhistory.\n  The chart I have put up behind me talks a little about history. It \ntalks a little about history in this country from 1960 through 1999 and \nthe increase in the gross Federal debt of the United States. You can \nsee after 1990, the gross Federal debt of our country absolutely \nexploded. It exploded because we adopted a fiscal policy that was \nfatally flawed. That fiscal policy included a massive tax cut, a \ndramatic increase in defense spending, and was based on a rosy scenario \neconomic forecast. All of those things conspired to put us in a deficit \nditch that exploded the debt of the United States, and it took us 15 \nyears to recover.\n\n  I believe we are in danger of repeating that series of mistakes in a \nway that will take us back into deficit, back into the bad old days of \nraiding trust funds, and put us on a course that is not fiscally \nsustainable. The debt of our Nation quadrupled because of those failed \neconomic policies.\n  Curiously enough, many of the very same voices who were the \narchitects of that failed plan are back today, advocating this one, the \nBush budget plan. Many of the same people who were there at the \nbirthing of the dramatic increase in the deficits and debt of this \ncountry are back again. You have to ask the question, Did we learn \nnothing in the 1980s?\n  Let's first deal with the economic forecast that underlies this \nproposed budget. I indicated in the 1980s, when we saw the explosion of \ndeficits and debt, one of the key reasons was a flawed forecast, an \noverly rosy set of economic assumptions. Once again I believe we face \nan uncertain forecast. This time it is a 10-year forecast. This time, \nthe forecasting agency itself warns us of its uncertainty. We are told \nthey have gone back and looked over their previous forecasts to see the \nvariance between what they predicted and what actually occurred. What \nthey have found is this chart that they have provided to us. I call it \nthe fan chart. It is from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  What it tells us is in the fifth year of this 10-year forecast we \ncould have anywhere from a $50 billion deficit to more than a $1 \ntrillion surplus based on the variances in their previous forecasts. \nThat is how uncertain this forecast is.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which did the projection, tells us \nthat this number of $5.6 trillion surplus that the Senator from New \nMexico discussed has a 10-percent chance of coming true--10 percent. \nThere is a 45-percent chance there will be more money, 45-percent \nchance there will be less money. This forecast was done 8 weeks ago.\n  What has happened in the economy? Do you think it makes it more \nlikely or less likely that the number will be greater or less than the \n$5.6 trillion the Congressional Budget Office tells us has a 10-percent \nchance of coming true?\n  It seems pretty clear to me that this is a river boat gamble. This is \nbetting the farm on a 10-year forecast that has very little chance of \never coming true.\n  We are offering an alternative that we think is more cautious, more \nconservative, and more balanced. We take the forecast surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion, and then we reserve every penny of the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds for the purposes intended. That leaves us with \n$2.7 trillion remaining.\n  We separate that amount into equal thirds: A third for a tax cut; a \nthird for the high-priority domestic needs of a prescription drug \nbenefit, strengthening our national defense, improving education, and \nfunding agriculture; and, with the final third, we set that money aside \nfor strengthening Social Security and dealing with our long-term debt \nbecause just as we have surpluses now in this 10-year period, we know \nthat when the baby boomers start to retire these surpluses turn to \nmassive deficits.\n  We think it is only prudent and wise that we begin to prepare for \nthat future--that we have a downpayment on this long-term liability \nthat is building.\n  As I indicated, we believe the top priority ought to be to \naggressively pay down our publicly held debt.\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\n  When we look at a comparison between the Republican plan and our \nplan, we see that they are leaving a greater share of the publicly held \ndebt than are we. They leave $818 billion of publicly held debt at the \nend of this 10-year period. We leave less than $500 billion because we \nare more aggressively paying down the publicly-held debt than their \nplan.\n  In addition, as I have indicated, we are reserving $750 billion to \nstrengthen Social Security for the long term; they provide nothing for \nthis purpose--a clear difference, and one that we think is a compelling \nargument for our alternative plan.\n  We agree that we can afford a significant tax reduction. But our tax \nreduction is about half as big as the President's proposal. That is \nbecause, as I have indicated, we reserve more resources for debt \nreduction and we reserve more resources to strengthen Social Security \nfor the long term. We still have a tax reduction of $750 billion over \nthe next 10 years in comparison to the President's $1.6 trillion.\n  We have other differences in priorities as well. As I have indicated, \nwe reserve more resources for the high-priority domestic needs of \nprescription drugs, national defense, and education, as well as others.\n  On prescription drugs, the President's proposal has $153 billion for \na prescription drug benefit; we have $311 billion. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's proposal will only provide benefits to about 25 percent of \nthose eligible. That is an inadequate prescription drug benefit.\n  We believe if we are going to have a prescription drug benefit, it \nought to be universally available, it ought to be voluntary, but it \nought to have enough money behind it to do the job, and not just be \nlimited to low-income people in this country.\n  The same is true in education. While the Republican budget dedicates \n$21 billion over the 10-year period over the baseline, we have provided \n$151 billion. We believe this is America's top priority. And it is our \ntop priority. We believe that ought to be reflected in the budget \nresolution. If we are going to meaningfully improve education for our \nkids, it is going to take resources. That is not the only thing it is \ngoing to take, but it is certainly going to take that. We provide those \nresources in this budget resolution.\n\n  We also have provided more resources for our national defense. We \nbelieve it is very clear that we are going to require more dollars for \ndefense. We provide them. The Republican budget resolution provides $68 \nbillion in additional funding for defense over the 10-year period. We \nprovide an additional $100 billion in our budget resolution.\n  Our budget also provides environmental protection. While the \nRepublican budget dramatically slashes those provisions of the law--the \nRepublican budget, $53 billion--our budget provides a $19 billion \nincrease over the 10-year period.\n  Our budget protects the Nation's veterans. At the same time that the \nRepublican budget slashes funding for veterans by $19 billion, we \nprovide a $15 billion increase over the 10-year period.\n  But it doesn't stop there. We have also provided additional resources \nfor the energy crisis that is hitting our country. We had testimony \nbefore the Budget Committee that indicated there will be an additional \nneed for Federal resources to deal with the energy shortfall sweeping \nthe country. We have provided an increase of nearly $10 billion while \nthe Republican budget has cut $1.4 billion over the same period.\n  Our budget responds to the farm crisis by providing $88 billion over \nthe 10-year period to level the playing field between our country and \nour major competitors, the Europeans. The Europeans currently are \nspending 10 times as much to support their producers as we spend \nsupporting ours. They are spending over $300 an acre in support for \ntheir producers while we spend $30.\n  On the question of export support, the Europeans are providing 84 \npercent of all the world's agricultural export assistance while we \nprovide one-thirtieth as much. No wonder we have a crisis in American \nagriculture. No wonder our producers are faced with financial ruin.\n  Our budget addresses the crisis in agriculture. The Republican budget \nabsolutely fails it.\n  These are the different priorities of the two budgets.\n  If I were to briefly recap, it would be simply this: While we support \na significant tax reduction for all amounts, we have a smaller tax cut \nthan they have provided, so that we can have more resources to pay down \nour publicly held debt; more resources to strengthen Social Security \nfor the long term; so that we can reserve additional resources to \nimprove education and strengthen national defense; and, yes, to provide \na prescription drug benefit.\n  Even within that context, our overall spending as a share of the \ngross domestic product has the Federal role shrinking. We have seen the \nFederal Government's role go from 22 percent of gross domestic product \nin 1993 to 18 percent today. Under our plan, the Federal role would \ncontinue to shrink to 16.4 percent of gross domestic product, the \nsmallest role for the Federal Government--the smallest role for the \nFederal Government--in 50 years. That is a conservative plan. It is a \nbalanced plan. It is one that is in line with the priorities of the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope very much that we can take the budget that has been laid down \nby my colleague from New Mexico and improve it; that we can add to the \ndebt reduction; that we can set aside funds to strengthen Social \nSecurity for the long term; that we can reserve additional resources to \nimprove education and strengthen our national defense and provide a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit.\n  That is what the American people want us to do, all within the \ncontext of continuing to shrink the role of the Federal Government, all \nwithin the context of paying off this publicly held debt, all within \nthe context of preparing for the baby boom generation, and \nstrengthening Social Security so that when those liabilities come due, \nthe American system of Government is prepared to respond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield shortly to Senator \nGramm. I thank him very much for waiting. But I want to first say to my \ngood friend, I really do appreciate his advocacy. Frankly, it has been \na rather exciting year because the Senator is a very good adversary. \nBut I wish we all could strike a word from our vocabulary--``right'' \nand ``wrong''--because I think we can do better.\n  I say to the Senator, I think you can do better than to say that what \nwe propose is wrong and what you propose is right. Frankly, I do not \nknow that we are talking in absolutes on any of this. We just think we \nhave a better idea than they do. As a matter of fact, I just want to \nmake two points and then I will yield to my friend.\n  This is budget language, but since my friend spoke of, What do you \nuse this Budget Act for? I want to hold it up. This is the act that \nchanged--until it is repealed--the rules of the Senate. This law did \nthat.\n  I defy anyone to read this law and find within it where it says what \nis major policy and what is minor policy, what size tax cut is OK and \nwhat size tax cut is not OK. I do not believe that is what this law \nsays in any page of it.\n  Somebody might interpret something differently than I would interpret \nit, but I do not believe there is anything in here that justifies \nsaying a policy that our President has suggested, of reducing our taxes \nby $1.6 trillion over a decade, when total revenues America will \nreceive during that period of time is $27 trillion; when the gross \ndomestic product is about $25 or $26 trillion--who would determine \nunder this law what is appropriate policy and what isn't?\n  We decide. We vote. And if we have the votes, we use reconciliation \nbecause this law permits it. We are not violating anything. If we do \nnot have the votes, we do not use it. But I do not choose to brag about \nthe Senate's great institutional prowess of total debate forever, \ndebate until you kill something, and amendments until you run out of \nbreath offering them. That is not what this law says is the prerogative \nof the Senators anymore; and it has not been for 25 years, as long as \nwe have had this act. It changed that, if you follow it right. And we \nwill decide in the next 3 or 4 days what is following it right and what \nisn't in terms of interpreting that statute by the votes of this \nSenate--each and every Member voting the way he or she chooses.\n  Now, finally, I was not able to do the arithmetic of this cursory \nsummary of\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\ntheir budget, but let me say to Americans, if you want to spend more \nmoney, that is the budget. From what I can figure, including interest, \nthis is a ``little'' budget; it only adds $500 billion in expenditures \nto the President's; and with interest it is $700 billion more than the \nPresident's.\n  For starters, so everybody will know, what did the President provide? \nHe provided a 4-percent increase each and every year--4 percent. I \nheard some of the people in the White House say: Who in America would \nnot be satisfied with a 4-percent increase? I was wondering about \nwhether we should do more. I brought a budget down that starts with a \n4-percent increase each time. What they are offering in terms of these \nquick summaries is over and above 4 percent.\n  Of course, we can say each and every neat thing about our Government \nshould double or triple or should be 30 percent more, or who knows \nwhat. But I just added up a few in theirs: Defense, 100 percent; \neducation, 80-some percent; agriculture, 80-some percent; Medicare, 160 \npercent more; energy, 10 percent, veterans, 15 percent. Remember, \nalmost all these programs were increased by the President. And this is \nmore than that. So what does it yield as a final product?\n  Fellow Americans, do you want us to spend the surplus or do you want \ntax relief where we send you back some of your money? And how much is \nthe right ratio of what we should spend anew on top of the President's \nbudget of 4 percent? How much is enough? And how much should we put \nthere for those who write taxes to say to the American people, we have \nthis surplus because of you? We didn't get it from the sky or manna. We \nthank the Lord for giving manna once under biblical terms. We didn't \nget it. We worked hard. That is what happened. That is where this money \ncame from, all this surplus: innovation, change, hard work.\n  So the question is very simple: What do you want to provide for the \nfuture out of that surplus? We will take each item one by one later, \nincluding the national debt. But for now I yield the floor to Senator \nGramm of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I thank him for his work not only on this budget but \non budgets for America going all the way back to 1981. If there is any \nperson here who has had a permanent impact on this process, it is \nSenator Domenici. I congratulate him.\n  Let me say to Senator Conrad, I congratulate him on being the new \nranking member. He does an excellent job in making his case. The fact \nthat the case will not hold water is not a reflection on him. He does \nas good a job with a bad hand as you can possibly do.\n  But the problem is, facts are stubborn things. Facts are very \nstubborn things. And our Democrat colleagues now have become \nconservatives. They are concerned about this big tax cut. They are \nconcerned about debt. They are concerned about deficits. They are \nconcerned about protecting Social Security.\n  But fortunately we do have some memory. I would like to say, and I am \nsure the same must strike Senator Domenici as well, it takes a sense of \nhumor in this business. It amazes me how people who killed our Social \nSecurity lockbox in 1999--we tried one, two, three, four, five times to \nset up a procedure to prevent Congress from spending the Social \nSecurity surplus: On April 22; on April 30; on June 15; on June 16; and \non July 16. In each case, we were successful in that we got a majority \nvote, but we could not get 60 votes we needed to pass the bill. And we \ndid not get 60 votes because the Democrats opposed the Social Security \nlockbox in 1999.\n  Today they are worried about tax cuts. They are worried about debt \nreduction. They are concerned that this massive tax cut is going to \ntake away Social Security money. But 2 years ago, on five different \noccasions, they used the necessity of our getting 60 votes to pass \nSenator Domenici's proposal to not let Congress spend Social Security \nand, on virtually a straight party-line vote, that effort was killed.\n  It never ceases to amaze me that people who voted against the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, who voted against a \nprohibition that would have stopped the spending of the Social Security \nsurplus, who voted against Gramm-Rudman, which, with all of its \nproblems and failings, was the only effort we have made to try to \ncontrol spending, now are very concerned about debt. But they are not \nconcerned when you are spending money.\n  This concern they have about deficits and debt is very narrowly \ndefined. They are concerned about deficits and debt only when you want \nto give money back to the taxpayer. They are not concerned when you are \nspending.\n  As all of my colleagues know, in January, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--this is the nonpartisan budgeting arm of the Congress--came out \nwith their estimate as to how much we had added to Government spending \nover 10 years during the last 6 months of the Clinton administration. \nHow much money did we commit to spend out of the surplus over the next \n10 years in the last 6 months of the Clinton administration? Many \npeople were stunned to find that in those 6 months, we added $561 \nbillion to Government spending. No 6-month period in American history \never added that much money to Government spending.\n  I ask my colleagues: Where was all this concern about debt and \ndeficits when we were spending $561 billion in the last 6 months of \nlast year? Where was this concern? It didn't exist. It was silence. All \nthe people who are now telling us that they are worried about this \ngiant tax cut are the same people who stood by while in 6 months $561 \nbillion was spent on new Government programs. At that rate, in 12 more \nmonths, they will have spent the entire Bush tax cut. I don't \nunderstand. Where was this concern about deficits and debt when they \nwere voting down the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? \nWhere was it when they weren't willing to protect Social Security from \nhaving its funds plundered and spent? Where was it when they were \nspending $561 billion? What produced this change of heart?\n  What produced the change of heart is, they weren't concerned when \nthey were spending money. They are only concerned when we give it back \nto the taxpayer. That is what this debate is about.\n  Our colleagues want to make the point this week that they have this \nidea to divide the surplus into a third, a third, and a third. There is \nonly one problem. They have already spent their third. Since we \nachieved a surplus, since the economy started running a budget surplus, \nwe have added some $800 billion to new spending on programs. So having \nalready spent their third over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, now they want to \nspend another third, which is why they can't afford to let the American \npeople have more of their money back in tax relief.\n  Let me make the points I want to make. First, what is a budget about? \nI am sure people think this is dull business, but actually of all the \nvotes we cast every year, it is the most important because it is the \none time we define our vision for the future of America. Each year our \ntwo great political parties on the floor of the Senate and in the House \ntry to define through their budget what kind of vision they have \nfor the future of America.\n\n  I believe if you listen very carefully, you ultimately reach the \nconclusion that there are two competing visions and that the two \nvisions really come down to the following: Do we want more Government, \nor do we want more opportunity? Do we want to tighten the belt on the \nfamily, or do we want to tighten the belt on the Government? Given that \nwe have this surplus because people have paid more in taxes than we \nneed to fund the Government, should we use this money to let the \nGovernment grow? Or should we give some of this money back to the \npeople who have earned it?\n  That is what this debate is about. Don't be confused. Despite all the \ntalk about debt and deficits, this debate is not about debt and it is \nnot about deficits. It is about spending versus tax cuts. We want to \ngive a substantial amount of money but a responsible amount of money, \nas I will show, back to the people who paid the taxes to begin with, \nand the Democrats want to spend it. That is a perfectly legitimate \nview. You can make a case for it. You will hear it over the next 50 \nhours.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  But it really boils down to a simple question--and Americans will ask \nit, hopefully, and answer it--that is: Do you believe the Government \ncan take this surplus of tax revenues and spend it better than you \ncould spend it if you got to keep it?\n  Under the President's tax cut, the average family in my State making \n$51,000 a year, two-wage earners with two children, will get about \n$1,600 in tax relief. At some point in the debate, I am sure our \ncolleagues will say: Look, that is not a whole lot of money.\n  In my State, $1,600 is a lot of money. It is the difference between \nowning your own home and living in somebody else's house. It is the \ndifference between your children going to college or going to work. It \nis the difference between having a retirement program and not having \none. The real question is, if Government kept the money and spent it, \ncould they spend it better than you could spend the $1,600 if you got \nto keep it?\n  That is the question about which I am willing to let the American \npeople make a decision. In fact, I would be willing to submit that to \nthe public. There will be all kinds of efforts to confuse the issue and \ntalk about debt and deficits instead of about spending, but anybody who \nis listening is going to understand.\n  Let me begin talking about the President's tax cut. Every time that \nanybody mentions the President's tax cut, they talk about how big it \nis, huge.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I interrupt?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I forgot when I yielded, I should have asked how much \ntime was needed. I should establish an amount of time. Does the Senator \nneed 10 more minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like 20 more minutes, if I may have it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator used 15 more than I. I yield him that. Then \nwe will yield back to the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Every time we hear the President's tax cut discussed, we \nhear the term ``huge'' or ``massive.'' Why not? It is $1.6 trillion. I \nhave a few constituents who know what $1 million is. I have two \nconstituents who know what a billion dollars is--Mr. Perot and Mr. \nDell. Mr. Dell used to know what a billion dollars is. I suspect he \nwill again, knowing Mr. Dell.\n  Nobody knows what a trillion dollars is, so obviously it is huge. \nWhat I would like to do is, using some figures from the National \nTaxpayers Union that are very relevant to the debate, let's convert it \ninto English. Out of every dollar we are going to send to Washington in \nthe next 10 years, how much would the Bush tax cut give you back, how \nmany pennies for every dollar we are going to send to Washington in the \nnext 10 years? The answer, 6.2 cents. So this tax cut, basically, will \ngive back 6.2 cents out of every dollar that taxpayers are going to \nsend to Washington in the next 10 years. Six point two cents out of \nevery dollar sounds like a fairly modest tax cut, and it is.\n  Compare it to the Kennedy tax cut--the proposal that John Kennedy, as \nPresident, sent to Congress--a tax cut, by the way, that cut rates \nacross the board. We now hear from our colleagues that when we cut the \nbottom rate twice as much as the top rate, then it is skewed to the \nrich. But John Kennedy, when he submitted his tax plan, had an across-\nthe-board rate cut. In fact, when the question was raised, he said, ``A \nrising tide lifts all boats.''\n  When you look at his tax cut and ask how many pennies out of every \ndollar in revenue were collected in the 10 years after it was adopted, \nyou find that it gave back 12.6 cents out of every dollar. It was over \ntwice as big as the Bush tax cut. The Reagan tax cut, in 1981, gave \nback 18.7 cents out of every dollar collected. It was three times as \nbig as the Bush tax cut. So the first point I want to make is, when you \nlook at the tax cut in terms of how much taxes people are paying, the \nBush tax cut is actually a quite modest and responsible tax cut. It is \nhalf as big as what President Kennedy proposed in 1961, and it is one-\nthird the size that Reagan proposed in 1981. And it is 2001 and it is \ntime for another tax cut.\n  Many of my colleagues are saying it is not big enough. My response to \nthat is, let's do it, and if the economy gets stronger, we can cut \ntaxes again next year. This doesn't have to be the last tax cut of the \nfirst Bush term. But this, by historic standards, is a modest tax cut. \nThat is the first point I want to be sure everybody understands.\n  The second point is, this is a tax cut that America not only needs, \nbut that we can afford. Let me remind everybody--it is a point Senator \nDomenici made, but it is a point worth making--last year, in the last 6 \nmonths, we increased spending by $561 billion over 10 years. This \nsurplus has literally been burning a hole in our pockets. Even the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, Alan Greenspan, who is very \nloathe to criticize Congress, in testimony before the Banking \nCommittee, raised the issue about what has happened to spending in the \nlast 2 years and expressed alarm and concern about it. If you listen to \nour Democrat colleagues, you would get the idea that President Bush is \njust slashing spending, and they have all these charts about how he is \nnot doing enough and they are going to do more and more--trillions, \nbillions of dollars more.\n  The plain truth is, the Bush budget takes every penny we have spent \nin the last 6 months in the biggest spending spree in American history \nand uses that as the beginning point and raises spending by 4 percent. \nHow, based on that, can anybody argue that the President is cutting \nspending? In fact, he adds $1 trillion of new spending in the next 10 \nyears over the current level.\n  Now, he adds a 4-percent increase that adds $1 trillion to Government \nspending over the next 10 years. But even after you spend that $1 \ntrillion, we are looking at a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 \nyears, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we take out the \namount of money that is committed to Social Security and Medicare, we \nhave $3.1 trillion left in what we call on-budget surplus, and then \nPresident Bush has proposed that roughly half of that money, that \nsurplus, go to his tax cut. This is a modest tax cut by historic \nstandards--half the size of the Kennedy proposal, a third of the size \nof the Reagan proposal, and it is also a tax cut that we can afford. \nNow, we cannot afford it if you are going to let the Democrats spend \nthis money. That is true. You can't spend it and give it back. You can \nspend $1 trillion on top of what we have already spent in the last 2 \nyears and you can afford this tax cut. But if you are not going to say \nno to any special interest group in America, if you are going to take \nthis opportunity to spend even more money, you can't do both.\n\n  We choose to give it back; they choose to spend it.\n  Now, let me talk a minute about debt reduction. Under our current \nsituation, we are literally able to pay down the debt quicker than the \nbonds become due. And everybody has said, since one-third of the \nFederal debt of this country is held by foreign governments, foreign \ncentral banks, that we don't want to pay a premium in order to buy this \ndebt back.\n  But this is the plain truth. Let me show you the following chart. We \ncurrently owe $3.4 trillion in debt that is held by the public. If we \ndidn't do the tax cut, we would have enough surplus to pay this off by \n2009. Doing the tax cut, we would have enough to pay it off in 2011. \nBut the plain truth is that we can't physically buy the debt back as \nquick as we are capable of doing it under either scenario. What we can \ndo, as this chart shows, is we can dramatically reduce the size of the \npublic debt, but we are going to reach a point out here in 2009 where \nwe would have to pay these foreign bondholders these big premiums in \norder to reduce the debt. And it doesn't make any sense to do that. We \nare going to get the interest on the debt down very low. So our \ncolleagues talk about interest costs to the tax cut. The plain truth is \nthat we are going to get interest costs down to as low as it can be \ngotten down, so there are hardly any interest costs to the tax cut once \nwe get past 2005 and 2006.\n  Here is the point. We are paying down debt as quickly as we can pay \nit down. If we control spending, if we are prudent about what we do, we \ncan increase Government spending by 4 percent, which is more than the \naverage family budget is going up this year, and we can have the Bush \ntax cut, and we can pay down debt as much as we\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nwill be capable of doing, given the bonds that are available.\n  So let me conclude by simply making the following points.\n  This is a choice in the end between letting people spend this tax \nsurplus or having the Government spend it. I am sure there are many \nAmericans, not a majority, but many Americans who are not paying taxes \nand would rather the Government spend it because they might get some of \nit. I think most Americans who work for a living and who pay taxes \nwould believe they can spend $1,600, which is the average tax cut in my \nState, better than the Government could spend it if the Government got \nto keep it.\n  That ultimately is what this debate comes down to. We have put \ntogether a very responsible budget. In fact, I have been involved, one \nway or another, in every budget debate since 1979. I have seen a lot of \nbudget proposals that were rosy scenarios or had magic asterisks and \nhad all kinds of gimmicks. I have never seen a budget that is more \nrealistic and more achievable than the Bush budget.\n  The Bush budget has no gimmicks in it. The reason it has no gimmicks \nin it is because it has a modest tax cut, it has an achievable proposal \nin debt reduction, and it has a modest increase in Government spending. \nBut if you believe Government spending should keep growing the way it \ndid in the last 6 months, and you believe we cannot afford a tax cut, \nthen you are right.\n  The question is, Should Government spending grow that fast? Should we \nliterally spend this surplus instead of giving part of it back? I do \nnot think we should.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this budget. I want to pay down the \nGovernment debt, and I am in favor of setting out a program to pay it \ndown as quickly as it is physically possible as the bonds become due. \nAny bond that comes due ought to be paid off, and we should not borrow \nmore money.\n  There is another kind of debt, private debt. Twenty million families \nare carrying debt on credit cards. There are a lot of families who \nwould like to engage in debt reduction. This tax cut will let families \nreduce their debt as our Government reduces its debt.\n  Finally, in terms of the tax cut itself--and we are going to have \nplenty of time to debate it, but ultimately it is going to be part of \nthis debate--we do three simple things in the tax cut: One, we cut \neverybody's rate. Everybody who pays income taxes will get a tax cut.\n  We will hear some say there are some people who do not get a tax cut. \nYes, but they do not pay income taxes. This is an income tax cut. You \ndo not get an income tax cut if you do not pay taxes.\n  Said another way, we will give you a 100-percent cut if you do not \npay taxes. Of course, you do not get anything because you do not pay \ntaxes. We have a surplus of taxes so we are giving taxes back to the \npeople who pay it. We cut the top rate half as much as the bottom rate.\n  The second part is repealing the marriage penalty and doubling the \nchild tax credit. We think families should keep more of what they earn \nto invest in the one institution we know works. Government does not \nalways work, but the family will work if it has the resources to work.\n  The third part is repealing the death tax, believing that when people \nbuild up a family business or family farm and they pay taxes on every \ndollar they earn, we ought not to force their children to sell off \ntheir business or sell off their farm to give another tax to the \nGovernment.\n  Ultimately, we are going to hear in this debate that Bill Gates will \nbe able to buy a Lexus. Bill Gates already has a Lexus. Can anybody who \nbelieves that a man who pays 1,000 times as much income tax as I do \ndoes not deserve a bigger tax cut than I get? The fact he could buy a \nLexus is irrelevant. He already has a Lexus.\n\n  We are going to hear other people say: Yes, but low-income people who \ndon't pay much in taxes will only get enough to buy a tailpipe system \nand muffler. Have you bought a tailpipe system and muffler lately? \nObviously, you have not, but if you had, you know it costs a lot of \nmoney, and if you need a tailpipe system and a muffler, having the \nmoney to pay for it makes a big difference.\n  This is going to be an important debate. Often we talk about things \nthat do not matter. We spend endless hours talking about issues that \nsomebody thinks is important and that often do not end up being \nimportant. This issue is important. What America will look like 10 \nyears from now and 100 years from now will be determined, in part, \nsignificantly by the outcome of this debate.\n  If we adopt the President's budget, if we enforce it, and if we cut \ntaxes, I believe America will be richer, freer, and happier 10 years \nfrom now and 100 years from now than it would be if we do not.\n  I believe Government will be bigger if we do not. I think Government \nwill be spending more money if we do not. I think the tax burden will \nbe heavier if we do not.\n  If you think you can make America greater by making Government \nbigger, then you would want to vote against this budget, but if you \nbelieve, as I do, that letting working families invest more money in \ntheir children, in their community, and in their family makes for a \nbetter America, then making it so people who work hard for a living get \nto keep more of what they earn and not end up working a third of the \nyear just to pay for Government, if you believe that makes for a better \nAmerica, you have to believe this debate is important.\n  Whatever happens, one thing is clear: We are not going to waste this \nweek. This week we are going to make very important decisions that will \naffect the well-being of everybody who will call themselves Americans \nfor a very long time. That is why this debate is so critically \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas began by saying I \nwas a good advocate but I was playing a weak hand. I say to him, he is \nan outstanding advocate. I do not agree with him. I think his \nprescription for America really is not the priorities of the American \npeople.\n  Most of all, I always enjoy listening to him, but I must say, the \nwords he speaks bears almost no relationship to the facts and certainly \nno relationship to the budget I have offered. What I find most \nenjoyable is that the Senator from Texas has been giving this same \nspeech for 20 years, and it does not matter if the facts have changed \ncompletely, he sticks with his speech. So I applaud him for his \nconsistency.\n  When he says this is a question of more and bigger Government or \nsmaller Government, that is not what this is about. No, no, no. That is \nthe old debate. That is the old, tired debate, but that is not what \nthis budget resolution is about.\n  The budget resolution I have offered today would shrink the role of \nGovernment and would dedicate more of the money to debt reduction. The \ntruth is, the fundamental difference between our budget proposals is we \nhave dedicated about 70 percent of this projected surplus to short-term \nand long-term debt reduction. The President's plan devotes about 35 \npercent to short-term and long-term debt reduction. That is the big \ndifference. They have a much bigger tax cut. We have much more money \nfor short-term and long-term debt reduction. That is the real \ndifference.\n  When the Senator from Texas says there has just been this explosion \nof Federal spending, come on. We know better than that. That is not \nwhat has been happening. There has not been any big explosion of \nFederal spending. Let us deal with the facts.\n  This is what has happened to Federal spending from 1962 to 2002. This \nis what has happened to Federal spending as a share of our gross \ndomestic product, which is the best way to compare so we are not just \nlooking at inflated dollars.\n  We see that the Federal spending is now at the lowest level since \n1966. We are down to 18 percent of gross domestic product being \nconsumed by the Federal Government. Of course, where does most of the \nmoney go?\n  Most of the money goes for Social Security, direct payments to the \nAmerican people; Medicare, direct payment of the health bills of the \nAmerican people; interest on the debt, the debt of the American people. \nAnother big expenditure this year is paying down the debt, the debt of \nthe American people.\n  The President has said very often, this is the people's money; we \nought to\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\ngive it back to the people. First of all, I agree with the first part \nof his formulation. This money is the people's money. Absolutely. We \nshould give some of it back to the American people. Absolutely.\n  But this debt is the debt of the American people. Social Security \ngoes to the American people. Medicare goes to the American people. \nNational defense is for the American people. A prescription drug \nbenefit goes to the American people. Improving education is the \neducation of the American people. All of these are the people's needs \nand the people's priorities. This is not a case where the money goes to \nthe Government, the Government sticks it in a sock somewhere. This is a \nquestion of how we best use our resources to provide a significant tax \ncut to protect Social Security and Medicare, to improve education and \ndefense, and the rest.\n  When the Senator from Texas says we have been on a spending binge, it \nis just not true. As I indicated, we have been seeing the Federal \nGovernment spending share come down each and every year since 1992. We \nwere at 22 percent of gross domestic product in 1992; we will be at 18 \npercent of gross domestic product this year. The Federal share of the \nnational income has been going down steadily.\n  Under the Democrat alternative that we have offered and are proposing \nto our colleagues, we continue to bring down the share of the Federal \nincome going to the Federal Government. We continue to shrink the size \nof the Federal Government from 18 percent of gross domestic product to \n16.4 percent at the end of this period, the smallest part of national \nincome going to the Federal Government since 1951.\n  This dog won't hunt. This tired old debate that it is tax cuts versus \nspending and those are the only options--those are not the only \noptions. Those are false choices for the American people. The truth is, \nthe choices are more complicated than that. It is not just a question \nof spending or tax cuts; it is a question of spending or tax cuts or \ndebt reduction, short term and long term.\n  On our side, we have said the highest priority is additional debt \nreduction. Why? Because we know where we are headed when the baby \nboomers start to retire and this long-term debt takes off like a \nscalded cat.\n  It is interesting; the Republicans claim that this is just a question \nof our spending versus their spending. Under their plan, they may well \nbe spending more money next year than our plan provides. Our plan \nprovides a 5-percent increase in overall spending next year. The \nRepublican plan may be as little as 4.9 percent, slightly less than \nours, but if they use their contingency fund they have set aside, they \ncould have as much as a 10-percent increase in Federal spending. Our \nRepublican friends are trying to have it both ways. They are claiming \nthey are against spending. Yet they have created a contingency.\n  By the way, you have to wonder where else it will be used because the \nPresident has said very clearly, his tax cut is $1.6 trillion and no \nbigger. He has said he will pay down $2 trillion of national debt and \nno more. Yet they have established a contingency fund. If it is not \ngoing to go for a tax cut, if it is not going to go for paying down \nmore debt, the only place it can go is more spending, in which case our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have more spending than we do.\n\n  What a surprise. This is the same old shell game they have engaged in \nfor years, to try to suggest this is a question of tax cuts versus \nspending. That is not the choice.\n  We are saying, devote most of these resources, 70 percent of this \nprojected surplus, to paying down short-term and long-term debt. We are \ndedicating nearly twice as much to that--$1.8 trillion more--to paying \ndown short-term and long-term debt. They are dedicating more to a tax \ncut.\n  That is the fundamental choice. It is not a choice of spending versus \ntax cut; it is a choice of tax cut versus paying down the debt. That is \nthe fundamental choice before the American people in the budget \nresolution we offer versus the budget resolution they offer.\n  There are other choices as well. We have provided $750 billion to \nstart to address our long-term debt that will be created by the \nretirement of the baby boom generation. We have put aside $750 billion \nto strengthen Social Security. They have a big goose egg for that \npurpose; they have nothing.\n  We talk about who is being fiscally responsible. I will vote for our \nside. I am happy to take our budget and defend it anywhere because we \nhave devoted twice as much money to short-term and long-term debt \nreduction as the other side.\n  Now my colleague from Texas says: The Democrats didn't support the \nSocial Security/Medicare lockbox we proposed last year or in 1999. No, \nwe didn't support their lockbox. Certainly, we did not. It was a leaky \nlockbox. It didn't lock up anything. In fact, the Treasury Secretary \nsaid it endangered our ability to pay the debt of the United States. \nThat was the lockbox they offered.\n  The lockbox we voted for, to protect Social Security and Medicare, \nwas a lockbox I offered on the floor of this Senate last year. It got \n60 votes, including, I think, 14 Republicans. When the Senator suggests \nDemocrats didn't support protection for Social Security and Medicare, \nit is just false. He knows it is false. He knows it is absolutely \nfalse. We supported protection for Social Security and Medicare, and it \nis the proposal that passed here with the highest number of votes in \nthe Senate, 60 votes.\n  The Senator from Texas says: They didn't vote for my constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. He is exactly right; we didn't vote \nfor his constitutional amendment to balance the budget because it \ndefined ``balancing the budget'' as one that looted the Social Security \ntrust fund to achieve balance. He is darn right we didn't vote for \nthat. We have been able to balance the budget subsequent to that \nwithout raiding the Social Security trust fund.\n  Who is right and who is wrong about that dispute? He came out here \nwith a constitutional amendment and said we had to pass it; it was the \nonly way to balance the budget, and he defined ``balancing the budget'' \nas raiding the Social Security trust fund to achieve balance. What a \nfraud. What an absolute fraud that would be for balancing the budget. \nNo, we didn't vote for it. We voted against it because we wanted to \nbalance the budget without counting Social Security. That was the right \nthing to do.\n  The Senator from Texas said we increased spending last year by $561 \nbillion. No, we didn't. There was no $560 billion increase in spending \nlast year.\n  Let's go back to the record. Here is what has happened with spending. \nAs a share of the economy, Federal spending has gone down each and \nevery year, including last year. Under the plan we are proposing, it \nwill continue to go down as a share of our national income, as a \npercentage of our gross domestic production. That is the way economists \nsay is the best way to measure changes in spending over time because \nthat is adjusting for inflation.\n\n  The Senator from Texas says this is a question of more Government or \nmore opportunity. Those are not the choices before us. That is a good \nspeech line, but it has almost no relevance to the choices before us in \nthis budget resolution. The fact is before us are a series of choices, \nnot just one or the other; it is a series of choices.\n  The first choice is do we reduce the size of the President's proposed \ntax cut in order to have more short-term and long-term debt reduction? \nWe say yes. We say we ought to reduce the size of his tax cut so we \nhave more short-term and long-term debt reduction. We also say we ought \nto reduce the size of his tax cut to set aside money to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term.\n  We also believe we ought to reduce the size of his tax cut to improve \neducation and to provide a prescription drug benefit and to strengthen \nnational defense because those are also priorities of the American \npeople.\n  But we only endorse those spending initiatives in the context of \nmaximum paydown of our publicly held debt, of putting aside money to \ndeal with our long-term liabilities, and also within the context of \ncontinuing to shrink the role of the Federal Government.\n  Let's go back to that chart that shows, under the plan we are \nproposing, we would continue to shrink the role of the Federal \nGovernment from 18 percent of gross domestic product today, down to \n16.4 percent at the end of this period, the lowest level since 1951. \nThat is the lowest level in 50 years.\n  The Senator from Texas also said we are paying down all the debt we \ncan\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\npay down. No we are not. That is not true. We had very clear testimony \nbefore the committee on how much debt can be paid down. I thought the \nmost compelling testimony was by the man who has managed the successful \ndebt paydown of the previous administration. The President is saying we \ncan only pay down $2 trillion of the publicly held debt over this \nperiod. That is not the case. We have $2.6 trillion of debt coming due \nduring this period. We can certainly pay down all of that. If we \nreserve all the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and those \nmoneys are used to pay down publicly held debt, we have no cash buildup \nproblem until the year 2010. That is what a detailed cashflow analysis \ndemonstrates.\n  It is a red herring to suggest we are going to have to pay these big \npremiums to foreign bondholders. That is all nonsense. We are not going \nto have to pay any big premiums to anybody. We are just going to retire \nthe debt of the United States as it comes due, not renew it, not issue \nnew debt. They want to issue new debt to pay for their tax cut. We do \nnot. We think we ought to dump this debt while we have the chance \nbecause we know what happens when you get past this 10-year period and \nthe debt of the United States takes off like a scalded cat.\n  This is a fundamental choice. The thing the Senator from Texas and I \ndo agree on is that this debate is important. It is going to shape the \neconomic future of our country. I say to those who are listening, the \nPresident's plan is fatally flawed. The President's plan is fatally \nflawed because he uses virtually all of the non-trust-fund money for \nhis tax cut.\n  In fact, here is the projected surplus: $5.6 trillion, as uncertain \nas it is. If you take out the Social Security trust fund, $2.6 \ntrillion. Then you take out the Medicare trust fund, $500 billion. That \nleaves you with an available surplus of $2.5 trillion.\n  Then the President proposes a tax cut of $1.7 trillion. His tax cut \nplan requires additional adjustments in what is called the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  Today there are 2 million people affected by the alternative minimum \ntax, but if we pass the President's plan, 30 million are going to get \ncaught up in the alternative minimum tax. It costs $300 billion to fix \nthat problem.\n  The interest costs associated with the first two are $500 billion, \nthe President's spending initiatives over the so-called baseline are \n$200 billion, for a total cost of his plan of $2.7 trillion--when there \nis only $2.5 trillion available, if you safeguard the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds.\n  The numbers do not add up. The President's plan is $200 billion in \nthe hole and that is before any defense initiative that he might \npropose, that is before any of the other things that may be suggested \nby this administration in terms of additional tax cuts, as we have seen \ncome over from the House--$300 billion over and above what the \nPresident has proposed; and before additional funds for education or a \nprescription drug benefit. That is before any adjustment in the \nforecast because of the economic downturn.\n  We have a President's budget that is eating into the trust funds \nalready and it is headed for much worse. Many of us believe it would be \na very serious mistake to make a decision that locks in for the next 10 \nyears a tax cut that is so big that it threatens the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds. Let's remember, when we get past this 10-year \nperiod we are faced with a totally different situation; The retirement \nof the baby boom generation, the explosion of demands on Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The truth is, the choices in this budget resolution are critically \nimportant to the country's economic future. The question is, Do we have \nmore of a tax cut or do we have more debt reduction? Do we reserve \nresources to improve education, national defense, and provide for a \nprescription drug benefit or do we go on the cheap on education? Do we \ngo on the cheap on the health care of the American people?\n  I hope very much, as this debate continues, we will have a chance to \nreally inform the American people of what the choices are. I believe \nthe choices we made on our side are the choices they would make in \ntheir own families. If they had a windfall I do not believe they would \ngo blow it all on a vacation or fancy car. I think they might take a \nvacation, but I think they would also pay down that mortgage. I think \nthey would also use those resources to invest for the future.\n  Those are the principles and the values that have formed the budget \nwe are offering on our side. It is a budget that protects every penny \nof the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, a budget that takes \nwhat is left and provides a third for a significant tax cut for all \nAmericans, including addressing the marriage penalty and reforming the \nestate tax; and with an additional third addressing those high-priority \ndomestic needs of improving education, strengthening national defense, \nand providing a prescription drug benefit; and with the final third, \ntaking that money to strengthen Social Security for the long term, to \naddress this long-term debt that is building.\n  We think that is a pretty good set of priorities, and we hope our \ncolleagues will endorse it before this week ends.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, again, I want to ask if there are any \nSenators who want to speak. I don't want anyone to think our schedule \nis going to be in any way influenced by the NCAA finals. But it does \nseem as though, if we got out of here by 9 o'clock, we could all \nparticipate in the game someplace. I think it is 15 minutes after that \nit starts. We are going to shoot for that anyway. If Senators come down \nlater than that, we will let them close down. We wouldn't want you, Mr. \nPresident, to occupy the chair that late. We have a volunteer, I think, \nwilling to do that.\n  First, I want to say to everybody listening that in an effort to try \nto see where we were with this big surplus, we invited a lot of people \nto testify. At the suggestion of the other side, we invited the \nComptroller General. He is a former CPA of some significant firm--one \nof the big firms. He loves to inject himself in the budget issues. And \nhe does that with a great deal of enthusiasm. Sometimes I wonder if \nthat is in his charter. Nonetheless, we hear from him.\n  I want everybody to listen carefully to what he said. He was talking \nabout the debt in the future. He was not talking about 10 years from \nnow. He wasn't talking about 20 years from now. He was talking about \nthe debt 25, 35, and 50 years from now; that is, we don't have all of \nthese programs paid for during that period of time.\n  So I asked him: We have been hearing words of caution about this \nsurplus. But, Mr. Comptroller, does the $1.6 trillion the President is \ntalking about in a tax cut have any negative impact on that debt? He \nanswered, Absolutely not.\n  So you see that you can come to the floor and do what my friend has \ndone, and talk about having all of this money in for future debt.\n  To tell you the truth, the President's number on a tax cut will have \nno negative impact on that. I conclude that it will have a positive \nimpact because I will tell you right now what will have the biggest \npositive effect on assuring every single senior that they will get \ntheir Social Security for as long as we have the ability to project \nthat, and, for everybody who is worried about Medicare and its \nsolvency, I tell you the best way to make sure that it works. It has \nnothing whatsoever to do with what we plug into this budget for \nMedicare. Do you know what it is? Will the $1.6 trillion tax cut \npromote longer prosperity at higher rates of growth than if we don't do \nit?\n  Americans, if you are wondering what is going to make Social Security \nmore and more solvent, it is, the sooner we get out of this dip in the \neconomy and the sooner we go for 8 or 9 more years with sustained \ngrowth at a modest rate as predicted in this budget, the better off \neveryone will be.\n  Frankly, I believe that I have been listening. I have gotten a great \neducation, I tell my New Mexicans all the time, by listening to the \ngreatest economists--those who have more to do with the future of the \nAmerican economy year by year--by listening to them. The one to whom I \nhave listened tentatively is Dr. Alan Greenspan.\n  Let me say about our new President, President George W. Bush, whether \nyou talk to him or not, he listens. You get some waves from him as to \nwhat you should do with a surplus. I can't quote\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nhim, but let me paraphrase him accurately.\n  He said: If you have a very large surplus--and he was amazed that it \nwas as big as $5.6 trillion, but he concurs that it is, under current \nprojections--which he also concurs is a modest projection and not some \nblue-sky projection. But he says: If you have a surplus and it is big, \npay the debt down. And then, when you have done as much of that as you \nconsider the next priority for government, you cut marginal rates.\n\n  Why was he saying that? Was he saying that because he just wants to \ncut marginal rates? And Alan Greenspan doesn't think that every rate \nshould get a cut, as our good friend from Texas explained. Of course \nnot. It is because that is the very best thing for the American \neconomy. That is the best thing for the future of our senior citizens \nand for Medicare. Yes. Even for that long-term debt that is out there, \nand even for some of that gross national debt, which our friend puts up \non a map on one of his charts as if we were busy paying off that gross \ndebt. It isn't even considered in the unified budget when the \neconomists look at America for the next 10, 15, 20 years.\n  The point is: The recommendation is that you pay debt as the first \npriority, and the second highest priority with the surplus is to cut \nmarginal rates. Guess what. The third and least priority is to spend \nthe surplus.\n  That is not Senator Pete Domenici. That is what I have learned from \nexperts, including the expert who tells us what is best for America. \nThat means Americans; that means families; that means everybody who is \nconcerned about paying their mortgage or adding on to their house--all \nof these things--plus businesspeople who are making money at their \nbusinesses. They are highly motivated by what they get to keep.\n  That is why all the experts say the second highest priority with the \nsurplus is to cut marginal rates.\n  I am not going to spend tonight talking about how much is the right \namount to pay on the debt. I will just tell you that for those who \nworry about what portion of our budget is interest on the national \ndebt, let me guess with you. I have it on the chart up there. But \ncurrently it is about 13.5 to 14 percent. So every budget has a big \nslice of it--13 to 14 percent to pay down the debt as a percentage of \nthe total budget.\n  It is as if we don't plan to do anything about it, if you listen to \nthe other side.\n  Do you know what it will be after 10 years of paying down the debt as \nwe contemplate it percentage-wise? Three. It will be 14 percent of the \nFederal budget down to 3 or 3\\1/2\\.\n  When people say we are not paying down the debt and you show them \nthat chart, is this paying down the debt fast enough? Everybody says, \nof course, that is paying it down fast enough.\n  If you want to be technical, bring in two experts and ask if we could \npay it down faster. You will find two who will say we can.\n  But to tell you the truth, I have almost become convinced that it is \nnot the right thing for me to say as a noneconomist--or maybe it is for \na noneconomist. I almost believe the surplus can get too big. I think \nit can be a drag on the growth in the economy. I believe to pay it down \nany faster than we propose is very risky. I really believe that is \nplenty of debt payment for this generation and this little timeframe to \nbe paying on a debt which has accumulated over 25 years or maybe 40 \nyears. It is just a lot to take out of the economy.\n  So everyone will know how much debt we should pay down, we had a \nwitness. He is a very excellent economist. He said none. He didn't say \nthey are right or you are right. He said you are both wrong. Don't pay \nany of it down. Because he is very worried about a slowing of the \neconomy and paying the debt down and what happens. I am not saying \nthat. I am just giving you parameters of what we heard.\n  We had another prominent witness from the Treasury Department of Bill \nClinton saying we should cut it down more. Guess what. He was in the \nTreasury Department. They produced a budget. President Clinton produced \na budget and didn't even ask him. They put in their budget precisely \nthe numbers that George W. Bush is using in his budget for debt \npayment.\n  All the talk we hear: Is it enough? Is it too small? Should it be \nbigger? We are talking about the end of this 10 years, and we are \ntalking about $300 billion to $400 billion at the tail end of this \nentire process.\n  I want to close by saying again to my fellow Republicans and to \nanyone on the other side who wants to treat George W. Bush fairly, to \ntreat him as the Democrats treated President Clinton, why don't you let \nthe President have a trial, have an opportunity, have a chance at \ntaking his budget to the next level? Let's work on tax cuts, and see \nwhere the American people are when we get down to the details of tax \ncuts. I believe he deserves that.\n\n  If this Senator were frightened about this budget bringing us back to \ndeficit spending, I would be here saying we just should not do it. I \nhave been fighting too long to get where we are. But I honestly believe \nthere is a higher chance that we will have a bigger surplus than is \nreported than we will have a lower amount. I think the highest \nprobability is that it will be about right.\n  When you see that funnel up there on that graph that my good friend \noffered--it came from the Congressional Budget Office, so I can speak \nto it also; it looked like a big wave of bees--if you look at it \ncarefully, right down the middle is where it is all dark, and that is \nwhere it is turning up most of the time, and that is this surplus of \n$5.6 trillion. On the edges it is showing a lot less and a lot more. I \nask, which one should you use? The huge amount less or the huge amount \nmore? No. I think you should use what the Congressional Budget Office \nrecommended, and you should apply the President's number to that, and I \nbelieve you will have something very significant happen when the \nAmerican people understand that over a decade we are giving them back \ntheir money. They will begin to ask, If we don't do that, what is going \nto happen to that surplus?\n  Do you know what I think is going to happen to it? I think it is \ngoing to get spent. I think it is going to get spent. I do not know how \nyet, but it will get spent. Every year we will have an excuse, just \nabout like the amendments that are going to be offered to the Bush \nbudget tomorrow and the next day, where there will be some new purpose \nthat we should add to it well beyond what he recommended. But in the \nend, fellow Senators and those listening, those are all using the \nsurplus to spend more money instead of giving the taxpayer a break. If \nwe want to spend money, spend what is left over. There is still a lot \nleft over.\n  I ask my friend, what is your desire regarding the rest of the \nevening?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would just like a few more minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been reading the book by David \nStockman, ``The Triumph of Politics.'' It is about what happened in the \n1980s, when, through a series of disastrous fiscal miscalculations, we \nplunged this country into deep, deep debt. I was not here at the time, \nbut in that book he outlines very clearly what happened when the \nPresident advocated a massive tax cut, combined with a big increase in \ndefense spending, all under a rosy economic forecast. The results were \na tripling and quadrupling of deficits, a quadrupling of debt. The same \nvoices who were advocating then to give the President a chance are \nadvocating to give this President a chance with the same kind of fiscal \nscheme.\n  It is amazing how much credence a 10-year forecast has been given in \nthis body, this notion that there is really going to be $5.6 trillion \nof surpluses over the next 10 years. It is almost mystical, the \nconfidence people have in that kind of forecast.\n  I used to be responsible for forecasting the revenue for my State. I \nhad to do it for 30 months--not a 10-year forecast, a 2\\1/2\\ year \nforecast. I can tell you, it is a crapshoot to forecast the revenue for \n2\\1/2\\ years, much less the revenue for the United States for 10 years.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, if one assumption were changed in that \nforecast, $2.5 trillion of the $5.6 trillion would be right out the \nwindow. If the productivity gains assumed for the next 10 years were \nthe same productivity increases we had in the United\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nStates between 1982 and 1995, that $5.6 trillion surplus would turn \ninto a $3.2 trillion surplus--one estimate, one part of the projection, \nand 40 percent of the surplus goes right out the window.\n  It is not wise to bet the farm on a 10-year forecast, a 10-year \nforecast made after 5 of the strongest economic years in the history of \nthe United States, at a time a downturn has started.\n  Sometimes one wonders if we have all gotten caught up in the \ngiddiness of markets. We saw the NASDAQ go from 1,500 to 5,000 and fall \nback to 1,800. Isn't there a warning there someplace? Do we really \nbelieve that things that just go up, up, up, just keep going up, up, \nup? Is there no caution here? I believe we can all hope that things \nkeep going up, up, up. I certainly do. That would be good for the \neconomy, good for the country, and make our jobs a lot easier. But I do \nnot think we ought to bet the farm on it.\n  This whole thing about it is the people's money and we ought to give \nit back to the people--if you examine our proposal, we are giving as \nmuch back as they are. We are just doing it in a different way. We have \na tax cut that is half as big as theirs. But we have another $800 \nbillion that we are proposing to use for strengthening Social Security \nfor the long term, to, for example, put in investment accounts for \npeople that they could then match or they could add to, so we would \nincrease the pool of savings and investments for our society so we \nwould have a stronger economy in the years ahead. That money is going \nright to the American people just as would a tax cut, only it is for \nsavings and investment.\n  The differences between us are important differences, but it is not a \nquestion of we want to take the money and just spend it on Government \nprograms and they want a tax cut. Those are not the choices. They are \njust not the choices.\n  The choices are, No. 1, that we would take $800 billion and use it to \nstrengthen Social Security for the long term by establishing something \nlike the thrift savings plan accounts that every Federal employee has. \nThat is not money that is going to be spent on Government programs. \nThat is money that is going to be available for savings and investment \nby the American people. On top of that, we advocate another $750 \nbillion of tax cuts.\n  So if you compare their tax cut to our proposal of tax cuts and money \nthat is available for individual accounts, to strengthen Social \nSecurity, and provide a pool of savings and investment for the \nstrengthening of the economic future of America, we both have about the \nsame amount of money going directly back to the American people. But in \naddition to that, we have reserved a lot more of this projected surplus \nfor paying down the people's debt. Yes, it is the people's money, \nabsolutely. It is also the people's debt. It is also the people's \neducation and the people's defense, and the people's Social Security.\n  This is not a question of spending versus tax cuts. I know the other \nside always loves to use that formulation. That is not our budget plan. \nOur budget plan is fundamentally a question of more debt reduction, \nboth short term and long term, versus more for tax cuts. That is a \nfundamental choice before us.\n  We believe, yes, there ought to be a significant tax cut, but we also \nbelieve we ought to use more of this projected surplus for paying down \nboth short-term and long-term debt. We devote about twice as much as \ntheir budget resolution for those purposes.\n  We think it is a better use of the people's money to dump the \npeople's debt while we have this opportunity because it is a fleeting \nopportunity. In 11 years, those baby boomers start to retire, and then \nthe obligations of the Federal Government are going to skyrocket. Those \nobligations are going to be the obligations of the American taxpayer. I \nhope very much that as we continue this debate, the choices will become \nclear.\n  I will end as I began, by saying our budget plan seeks to put aside \nevery penny of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, reserving it \nfor those purposes, and then to have a significant tax cut, a tax cut \nof $900 billion, including interest, $900 billion for high-priority \ndomestic needs such as improving education, a prescription drug \nbenefit, strengthening our national defense, and then that final $900 \nbillion, or roughly that, to strengthen Social Security for the long \nterm--resources reserved so we can strengthen the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Every single proposal that is serious about strengthening Social \nSecurity for the long term has a cost associated with it, has a need \nfor resources. We provide them. They don't. That is a very fundamental \ndifference between these plans.\n  Again, I look forward to continuing this debate tomorrow and thank my \ncolleagues and others who have been listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nBudget Committee staff named on the following list be permitted to \nremain on the floor during consideration of S. Con. Res. 101 and that \nthe list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               Staff List: Senate Committee on the Budget\n\n\n                             majority staff\n\n       Daniel P. Brandt III, Amy Call, Allen R. Cutler, Beth \n     Felder, Rachel Forward, Jennifer Hilton, Jim Hearn, W. Walter \n     Hearne, Bill Hoagland, Sabre Mayhugh, Carole Mcguire, Mieko \n     Nakabayashi, James O'Keeffe, Maureen O'Neill, David A. \n     Ortega, Cheri Reidy, Andrew Siracuse, Robert Stein, Bob \n     Stevenson, Margaret Bonynge Stewart, Kathleen M. Weldon, \n     Winslow Wheeler, Jennifer Winkler, Sandra Wiseman.\n\n\n                             minority staff\n\n       Rochelle Amdur, Stephen Bailey, Scott Carlson, Rock E. \n     Cheung, Jim Esquea, Bonnie Galvin, Timothy Galvin, James \n     Horney, Lisa Konwinski, Sarah Kuehl, Karin Kullman, Stuart \n     Nagurka, Mary Naylor, Sue Nelson, Steven Posner, Dakota \n     Rudesill, Charles Stone, Barry Strumpf.\n\n\n                          administrative staff\n\n       Michael Berkholtz, Jeffrey Eaby, Alex Green, Sahand \n     Sarshar, Lynne Seymour, George Woodall.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \nthe presence and use of small calculators, which we don't normally \npermit but which might be needed, during consideration of the fiscal \nyear 2001 concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when my friend gets up and puts up a \nchart that says the President is going to have to spend all these \nthings on taxes, even though he didn't ask for them--he put up a number \nand said: They are going to have to spend money on the alternative \nminimum tax. Frankly, he put a big dollar number there. I want \neverybody to know, that is a very wonderful thought on his part, but \nthe truth is, the budget resolution does not say that you do whatever \nyou want on taxes. It says $1.6 trillion. If he wants to surmise that \nthey are going to break this budget and have more tax cuts than that, \nthen he ought to clearly say that because if there is going to be an \nalternative minimum change, they are going to make it within this $1.6 \ntrillion because that is all that is allowed in this budget resolution.\n  Frankly, a very large chunk of that is estimated to be for one of the \nthree purposes; that is, either the marriage tax penalty or doubling \nthe child care credit or the death tax repeal.\n  Those could all be adjusted, any of the three could be adjusted, in \nterms of how much they are going to cost. We are using a number. \nActually, the Finance Committee can decide how to change those, and \nthere may be money left over when they have finished doing that. Just \nso the people understand, we are looking at 1.6, not 1.9, not 2.2 \ntrillion. We are looking at 1.6.\n  My last observation is, my good friend says there is going to be more \ninvestment under their plan, and then he says there is $700 billion \nthat is going to be used for investment purposes on individual accounts \nunder Social Security. I don't know what we are going to do with it \nbetween now and the time that such a plan evolves. I am not sure it is \nin the wings that we are going to change Social Security to do that. \nJust wait until we talk here about investing it in the stock market, \nwhich is probably the only way we are going to do it. Are we going to \ndo that in the next 6 months or the next 2 years? In the meantime, what \nis all that money going to be used for under their budget? I don't \nknow. I assume it is going to be sitting around. And then\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nwhat? We are going to buy up private securities with it? What are we \ngoing to do with it in the meantime?\n  Maybe my friend can answer that, and maybe it is truly invested. I \ndon't know how it gets invested.\n  My last observation, one more time, is that President Bush deserves \nan opportunity. To those watching tonight, he has proposed a very \nreasonable and responsible budget plan. We are only asking that it be \npermitted to take one step forward and see if the next committees will \nchoose to adopt it and whether the Senate will adopt those bills later. \nI believe he deserves that. He is the President. He has made a very \nimportant proposal. He is telling us precisely why he is doing it. He \nwants the American people to get a refund now in some way of $60 \nbillion, but he wants to fix the Tax Code where it is more advantageous \nto investment and growth and prosperity. He is entitled to just that \none break on this budget resolution. We will keep working for it, and \nwe will have a lot of Senators on our side.\n  I hope in the end, if they want to make amendments, they will end up \nvoting for the critical essence of this President's approach; that is, \nthe tax plan. If you want to do some other things in this budget, leave \nhis tax plan intact and let's see how it comes out in the end for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/02/senate-section/article/S3273-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, this week, from April 1-7, we are \ncelebrating the 43rd anniversary of ``National Library Week.'' As a \nstrong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and \nprotect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few \nmoments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of \nideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are \nthe only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended \nfor, and available to, every segment of our society.\n  It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable \nrole in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th \ncentury, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and \nwide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further \nsupplemented by traveling libraries serving outlying districts. \nLibraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and \nchildren and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to \nobtain reliable information on a vast array of topics.\n  Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid \ntechnological advancement where they are called upon to provide not \nonly books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. \nIn today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer \nservices, internet access terminals, facilities for community lectures \nand performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for \nexhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities \nlibraries provide services for older Americans, people with \ndisabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of \nmaterials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is \noften struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have \nnot had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the \ngreatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library \ncommunity and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities \ncontinue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library \nsystem and work to provide additional funding to help keep libraries \nopen.\n  My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy \nhas been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides \ninterlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries \nand school library media centers. The Network receives strong support \nfrom the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nthe Regional Library Resource Centers in Western, Southern, and Eastern \nShore counties, and a Statewide database of holdings totaling 178 \nlibraries.\n  The State Library Resource Center alone gives Marylanders free access \nto approximately 2 million books and bound magazines, over 1 million \nU.S. Government documents, 600,000 documents in microform, 11,000 \nperiodicals, 90,000 maps, 20,000 Maryland State documents, and over \n19,000 videos and films.\n  The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an \nextraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of \nMaryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service with \n54.7 percent of the State's population registered as library patrons. \nAdditionally, the total holdings of catalogued and uncatalogued book \nvolumes, video and audio recordings, periodicals, electronic formats, \nand serial volumes have increased by 1 million from 1998 to 2000 to \ntotal over 16.5 million in library resources.\n  I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association and others involved in the library community \nthroughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and \ncitizens throughout the nation in this week's celebration of ``National \nLibrary Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association with \nthose who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services \navailable to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/02/senate-section/article/S3273-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3273-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              MAGAZINE PRAISES RJR AS A BEST PLACE TO WORK\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a great many of us who live in \ntobacco-producing states, and particularly North Carolina, whose \ntobacco farmers for years have produced quality tobacco mainly flue-\ncured but some burley, are proud of our fine farmers many of whom \nharvest an enormous amount of excellent food and fiber products.\n  We are grateful for North Carolina's tobacco companies which paved \nthe way for our State's becoming national leaders in business, banking, \nand manufacturing of many kinds.\n  Charlotte is the second largest banking center in America. The Bank \nof America is headquartered there.\n  Some time ago Fortune Magazine announced that its annual survey had \nconfirmed that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company of Winston-Salem is one of \nthe 100 best companies in America to work for. The Chairman and CEO of \nRJR, Andrew J. Schindler, states that the key reason why Reynolds \nTobacco won the award is, ``It's our people. Without the hard work, \ncreative energy, pride and dedication of our employees, RJR could not \nbe successful.''\n  Then Mr. Schindler added: ``The real secret to Reynolds Tobacco's \nsuccess is that our employees stand together as a close corporate \nfamily, and that's what makes our company stand apart from the crowd. \nThis company is filled with extraordinary people, making Reynolds \nTobacco an extraordinarily good place to work,'' Schindler stressed.\n  There's a point in all of this that ought not to go unnoticed like a \nship passing in the night: Some of the trial lawyers, seeking to line \ntheir pockets with hundreds of thousands of dollars in court-awarded \ncash, have portrayed tobacco companies as villains and the corporate \nleaders of those companies as crooks. Contrived lawsuits have fluttered \nfrom the offices of intellectually dishonest trial lawyers portraying \nthe company leaders as dishonest men and women with evil intent. This \nis simply\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\nnot so, and those trial lawyers know it's not so.\n  Nobody in my family smokes, but one of them was indignant several \nmonths ago at some of the false declarations of some of the trial \nlawyers. She said: ``I'm sorry for anyone whose health has declined \nbecause of smoking or whatever cause, but I've never heard of an \ninstance where anybody started smoking because a gun was pointed at his \nhead.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/02/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions were discharged pursuant to \nPublic Law 93-344, and placed on the Calendar:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for the continued classification of certain aliens as children \nfor purposes of that Act in cases where the aliens ``age-out'' while \nawaiting immigration processing, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nChild Status Protection Act of 2001. This legislation would protect \nchildren who are in danger of losing their eligibility for an \nimmigration visa because of the inability of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service INS to process their petitions or applications \nin a timely fashion.\n  Children caught in the INS backlogs often face the problem of ``aging \nout'' of eligibility for family-based visas on their 21st birthday. One \ncase recently brought to my attention was that of a couple who were \nlawful permanent residents. In 1993, they filed family-based petitions \nfor their three children. Although the INS approved the petitions, as \nof March 2000, none of the children had become permanent residents. \nWhen they turned 21, the two oldest children were switched into another \nvisa category because they no longer qualify as ``minor children.'' \nNow, they are in another backlog in which they have to wait another \neight years to get a green card.\n  The legislation I have introduced today would provide a child, whose \ntimely filed application for a family-based, employment-based, or \ndiversity visa was submitted before the child reached his or her 21st \nbirthday, the opportunity to remain eligible for that visa until the \nvisa becomes available. The legislation also would protect the child of \nan asylum seeker whose application was submitted prior to the child's \n21st birthday.\n  In recent years, the INS has faced a dramatic increase in the number \nof immigration benefit petitions and applications filed. This combined \nwith the agency's slow service, and antiquated filing and computer data \nsystems, has caused millions of our constituents to endure long waits \nof three to five years before getting their cases adjudicated.\n  The INS backlogs have carried a heavy price: children who are the \nbeneficiaries of petitions and applications are ``aging out'' of \neligibility for their visas, even though they were fully eligible at \nthe time their applications were filed. This has occurred because some \nimmigration benefits are only available to the ``child'' of a United \nStates citizen or lawful permanent resident, and the Immigration and \nNationality Act defines a ``child'' as an unmarried person under the \nage of 21.\n  As a consequence, a family whose child's application for admission to \nthe United States has been pending for years may be forced to leave \nthat child behind either because the INS was unable to adjudicate the \napplication before the child's 21st birthday, or because growing \nimmigration backlogs in the immigration visa category caused the visa \nto be unavailable before the child reached his 21st birthday. As a \nresult, the child loses the right to admission to the United States. \nThis what is commonly known as ``aging out.''\n  Situations like these leave both the family and the child in a \ndifficult dilemma. Under current law, lawful permanent residents who \nare outside of the United States face a difficult choice when their \nchild ``ages-out'' of eligibility for a first preference visa. \nEmigrating parents must decide to either come to the United States and \nleave their child behind, or remain in their country of origin and lose \nout on their American dream in the United States. In the end, we as a \ncountry stand to lose when we are deprived of their cultural gifts, \ntalents and many contributions.\n\n  For lawful permanent residents who already live in the United States, \ntheir dilemma is different. They must make the difficult choice of \neither sending their child who has ``aged-out'' of visa eligibility \nback to their country of origin, or have the child stay in the United \nStates out-of-status, in violation of our immigration laws, and thus, \nvulnerable to deportation. No law should encourage this course of \naction.\n  One compelling example is that of 17-year-old Juan, a youngster born \nin Guatemala, who applied for adjustment\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nof status under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act in 1999. \nHe is a junior in high school with a 4.0 grade point average. His \nmother came to the United States in 1986, fleeing life-threatening \nconditions in Guatemala. Juan, who was six years old at the time, \njoined her four years later. Today, Juan has yet to have an interview \nwith the INS. Given the expected three- to five-year wait for the INS \nto adjudicate adjustment of status applications, this high achieving \nstudent may not only miss out on his dream of becoming an engineer, his \nhome state of California stands to lose out on the contributions he \nundoubtedly will make.\n  The aging out problem also extends to those who have fled persecution \nand are granted asylum in the U.S. Current law permits persons granted \nasylum to have their child join them in the United States. However, if \nthe child ages out while the parent's application for asylum is being \nadjudicated, the child is no longer automatically entitled to remain \nwith his parent.\n  As Members of Congress we, too, have been confronted with this issue. \nBecause the Attorney General does not have the discretion to protect \nthe status of these children, we often are called upon to introduce \nprivate bills to grant them the status they deserve. Unfortunately, \nthese bills are limited in number and not all deserving children are \nable get private bills introduced on their behalf.\n  The Child Status Protection Act of 2001 would correct these \ninequities and help protect a number of children who, through no fault \nof their own, face the consequence of being separated from their \nimmediate family. It is a modest but urgently needed reform of our \nimmigration laws, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the Child Status Protection \nAct of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish within the executive branch of the \nGovernment an interagency committee to review and coordinate United \nStates nonproliferation efforts in the independent states of the former \nSoviet Union; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to address \nthe coordination of spending, both public and private, on U.S. non-\nproliferation efforts in Russia. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by my colleagues Senators Biden and Lugar.\n  In 1991, the world faced the very real specter of nuclear chaos \nerupting from the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Largely through \nthe foresight and leadership of Senators Nunn and Lugar, Congress \nestablished a fledging program that year authorizing the use of Defense \nDepartment funds to assist with the safe and secure transportation, \nstorage, and dismantlement of nuclear, chemical and other weapons in \nthe former Soviet Union. The world is a much safer place because of \nthese efforts. I commend my friend and co-sponsor, Senator Lugar, for \nthe important contribution he has made to the national security of this \nnation.\n  In the past ten years the Nunn-Lugar initiative has grown into a \nmulti-pronged attack by the Departments of Defense, State and Energy to \nensure that weapons of mass destruction, weapons-usable material and \ntechnology, and weapons-related knowledge in Russia and the Newly \nIndependent States remain beyond the reach of terrorist and weapons-\nproliferating states. This investment has yielded an impressive return. \nOver the past decade, important gains have been made in securing \nweapons, technology and knowledge in the former Soviet Union. By \nassisting Russia we have enhanced our own national security. But this \nsuccess has come with problems of coordination.\n  U.S. public spending on non-proliferation programs in the Russian \nFederation suffers from a lack of coordination within and among United \nStates Government agencies and departments. As recently as last \nJanuary, a bipartisan task force led by former Senator Howard Baker and \nformer White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler released a report calling for \nimproved coordination within the U.S. government on non-proliferation \nassistance to Russia. The importance of these programs to the national \nsecurity of this nation demands that we address this issue. We must \ncoordinate U.S. government non-proliferation efforts in Russia to \nensure that our overall spending on these efforts is both efficient and \nmaximized to further the national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  Ensuring the efficiency of our public spending also requires that we \ntake into account the increased spending and investment by the United \nStates private sector on non-proliferation efforts in Russia. This \nprivate spending, still small but registering positive results, will \ncontinue to increase. We must ensure that public spending on\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nRussian non-proliferation programs is not in conflict with this \nimportant contribution from the U.S. private sector.\n  The Non-Proliferation Assistance Coordination Act of 2001 calls on \nthe President to create an interagency committee that will monitor and \ncoordinate the implementation of United States non-proliferation \nefforts in Russia. Under the direction of the President's National \nSecurity Assistant, representatives from the Departments of State, \nDefense, Energy and Commerce would provide guidance on coordinating, \nde-conflicting and maximizing the utility of United States public \nspending on our important non-proliferation efforts in Russia. I \nbelieve U.S. non-proliferation efforts in Russia, first initiated a \ndecade ago under the leadership of Senators Lugar and Nunn, have made \nlasting contributions to the national security of the United States. \nThis bill will ensure that future non-proliferation assistance to \nRussia is well spent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nonproliferation Assistance \n     Coordination Action of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved \n     important results in ensuring that weapons of mass \n     destruction, weapons-usable material and technology, and \n     weapons-related knowledge remain beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states;\n       (2) although these efforts are in the United States \n     national security interest, the effectiveness of these \n     efforts suffers from a lack of coordination within and among \n     United States Government agencies;\n       (3) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and \n     investment by the United States private sector in job \n     creation initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian \n     weapons scientists and technicians, is making an important \n     contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of \n     mass destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and \n     weapons-proliferating states; and\n       (4) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union requires the establishment \n     of a coordinating body to ensure that United States public \n     and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that \n     public spending on efforts by the independent states of the \n     former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and \n     further United States national security interests.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nnew tax incentives to make health insurance more affordable for small \nbusinesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in introducing bipartisan \nlegislation, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, that is designed \nto make health insurance more affordable both for individuals and for \nsmall businesses that provide health care coverage for their employees.\n  In the past few years, Congress has taken some major steps to expand \naccess to affordable health insurance for all Americans. One of the \nfirst bills I sponsored on coming to the Senate was legislation to \nestablish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which was \nenacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act. States have \nenthusiastically responded to this program, which now provides \naffordable health insurance coverage to over two million\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\nchildren nationwide, including nearly 10,000 in Maine's expanded \nMedicaid and CubCare programs.\n  Thanks to these efforts, coupled with an increase in employer \ncoverage fueled by our strong economy, we are making some progress. For \nthe first time in twelve years, the number of Americans without health \ninsurance actually dropped from about 44 million to 42.6 million. While \nthis is good news, it by no means minimizes the problem. There are \nstill far too many Americans without health insurance. Clearly, we must \nmake health insurance more available and affordable.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured \nAmericans are members of families with at least one full-time worker: \n85 percent of the Americans who do not have health insurance are in a \nfamily with a worker.\n  Uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses, the backbone of the economy in Maine. Some 60 percent of \nuninsured workers are employed by small firms. If we want to reduce the \nnumber of uninsured Americans, we need to consider how we can help more \nsmall businesses afford health insurance for their employees.\n  According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses \nsurvey, the cost of health insurance is the number one problem facing \nsmall businesses. And it has been since 1986. It is time for us to \nlisten and to lend a hand to these small businesses.\n  Small employers generally face higher costs for health insurance than \nlarger firms, which makes them less likely to offer coverage. Premiums \nare generally higher for small businesses because they do not have as \nmuch purchasing power as large companies, which limits their ability to \nbargain for lower rates. They also have higher administrative costs \nbecause they have fewer employees among whom to spread the fixed costs \nof a health benefits plan. Moreover, they are not as able to spread \nrisks of medical claims over as many employees as can large firms.\n\n  As a consequence, only 42 percent of small businesses with fewer than \n50 employees offer health insurance to their employees. By way of \ncontrast, more than 95 percent of businesses with 100 or more employees \noffer insurance.\n  Moreover, the smaller the business, the less likely it is to offer \nhealth insurance to its employees. Small businesses want to provide \nhealth insurance for their employees, but the cost is often just too \nhigh.\n  Simply put, the biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the \nUnited States today is cost. While American employers everywhere, from \ngiant multinational corporations to the small corner store, are facing \nhuge hikes in their health insurance costs, these rising costs are \nparticularly problematic for small businesses and their employees. Many \nsmall employers are facing premium increases of 15 to 30 percent or \nmore. This can cause them either to drop their health benefits or to \npass the additional costs on to their employees through increased \ndeductibles, higher copays or premium hikes. This, too, is troubling \nand will likely add to the ranks of the uninsured since it will cause \nsome employees, particularly lower-wage workers who are \ndisproportionately affected by increased costs, to drop or turn down \ncoverage when it is offered to them.\n  According to another survey of small businesses, two-thirds of small \nbusiness owners said that they would seriously consider offering health \nbenefits if they were provided with some assistance with premiums. \nAlmost one-half would consider doing so if their costs fell 10 percent.\n  To respond to these findings, we are introducing the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act, which will help small employers cope with \nthese rising costs. Our bill will provide new tax credits for small \nbusinesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will \nencourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health \ninsurance to do so and will help businesses that currently do offer \ninsurance to continue coverage even in the face of rising costs.\n  Under our proposal, employers with fewer than ten employees will \nreceive a tax credit of 50 percent of the employer contribution to the \ncost of employee health insurance. Employers with ten to 25 employees \nwill receive a 30 percent credit. Under the bill, the credit would be \nbased on an employer's yearly qualified health insurance expenses of up \nto $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing will also make health insurance \nmore affordable for individuals and families who must purchase health \ninsurance on their own. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will \nprovide an above-the-line tax deduction for individuals who pay at \nleast 50 percent of the cost of their own health and long-term care \ninsurance. Regardless of whether an individual takes the standard \ndeduction or itemizes, he or she will be provided relief by the new \nabove-the-line deduction.\n  The bill also will allow self-employed Americans to deduct the full \namount of their health care premiums. Some 25 million Americans are in \nfamilies headed by a self-employed individual, of these, five million \nare uninsured. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health \ninsurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large \nbusinesses is not just a matter of equity. It will also help to reduce \nthe number of uninsured, but working Americans. Our bill will make \nhealth insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are \nself-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our \nelectricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores \nthat dot communities throughout the state.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which has been endorsed by \nthe National Federation of Independent Business, will help small \nbusinesses afford health insurance for their employees, and it will \nalso make coverage more affordable for working Americans who must \npurchase it on their own. I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 675. A bill to ensure the orderly development of coal, coalbed \nmethane, natural gas, and oil in ``common areas'' of the Powder River \nBasin, Wyoming and Montana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Powder River \nBasin Resource Development Act of 2001.'' This legislation will provide \na procedure for the orderly and timely resolution of disputes between \ncoal producers and oil and gas operators in the Powder River Basin in \nnorth-central Wyoming and southern Montana. This legislation is \ncosponsored by my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas.\n  The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana is one of the \nrichest energy resource regions in the world. This area contains the \nlargest coal reserves in the United States, providing nearly thirty \npercent of America's total coal production. This region also contains \nrich reserves of oil and gas, including coalbed methane. Wyoming is the \nfifth largest producer of natural gas in the county and the sixth \nlargest producer of crude oil. The Powder River Basin plays an ever-\nincreasing role in the development of coalbed methane as Wyoming \ncontinues to help meet the growing needs for natural gas in the Rocky \nMountain region and the country as a whole. The Powder River Basin and \nthe State of Wyoming as a whole provide many of the resources that heat \nour homes, fuel our cars, generate electricity for our computers, \nmicrowaves, and televisions. In short, there is very little that any \none of us does in a day that is not affected by the resources of coal, \noil, and natural gas.\n  The production of these natural resources represents a vital part of \nthe economy of my home state of Wyoming. The coal and oil and gas \nindustries employ more than 21,000 people in Wyoming. We in Wyoming \neducate our students, build our roads, and provide our citizens with \nmany of their social services through property taxes, severance taxes, \nand mineral royalties collected from the development of these energy \nresources. Since Wyoming has no state income tax, our State relies very \nheavily on revenues from the minerals extraction industries for our tax \nbase.\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\n  Given the great importance both the coal and oil and gas industries \nhave to Wyoming's economy, the State of Wyoming and the federal \ngovernment have tried to encourage concurrent development in areas \nwhere it is feasible and safe to do so. Unfortunately, this is not \nalways possible. This legislation provides a procedure for the fair and \nexpeditious resolution of conflicts between oil and gas producers and \ncoal producers who have conflicting mineral interests on land in the \nPowder River Basin in Wyoming and southern Montana.\n  This legislation establishes a specific procedure to resolve \nconflicts between coal producers and oil and gas producers when their \nmineral development rights come into conflict because of overlapping \nleases. First, this proposal requires that once a potential conflict is \nidentified, the affected parties must attempt to negotiate an agreement \nbetween themselves to resolve this conflict. Second, if the parties are \nunable to come to an agreement between themselves, either of the \nparties may file a petition for relief in U.S. district court in the \ndistrict in which the conflict is located. Third, after receiving a \npetition, the court would determine whether an actual conflict exists. \nFourth, if the court determines that a conflict does in fact exist, the \ncourt would determine whether the public interest, as determined by the \ngreater economic benefit of each mineral, is best served by suspension \nof the federal coal lease or suspension or termination of all or part \nof the oil and gas lease. Fifth, a panel of three experts would be \nassembled to determine the value of the mineral of lesser economic \nvalue. Each of the parties in conflict would appoint one of the three \nexperts. The third expert would be chosen jointly from the two parties. \nFinally, after the panel issues its final valuation report, the court \nwould enter an order setting the compensation that is due the developer \nwho had to temporarily or permanently forgo his development rights. \nThis compensation would be paid by the owner of the mineral of greater \neconomic value. A credit against federal royalties would also be \navailable for this compensation price for limited number of situations \nwhere neither the existence of the conflict nor compensation to the \nconflicting mineral owner was foreseen in the original federal lease \nbid.\n\n  The ``Powder River Basin Resource Development Act of 2001'' has \nseveral benefits over the present system. First, it requires parties \nwhose mineral interests come into conflict to attempt to negotiate an \nagreement among themselves before either one of them avails himself of \nthe expedited resolution mechanism. No such requirement exists today. \nSecond, it directs the Secretary of the Interior to encourage expedited \ndevelopment of federal minerals that (1) are leased pursuant to the \nfederal Mineral Leasing Act; (2) exist in conflict areas; and (3) which \nmay otherwise be lost or bypassed. As such, this legislation encourages \nfull and expeditious development of federally leased resources in this \nnarrow conflict area where it is economically feasible and safe to do \nso. Third and finally, this bill provides a fair and expeditious \nprocedure to resolve conflicts which cannot be resolved between the two \nparties themselves and it does so by ensuring that any mineral owner \nwill be fully compensated for any suspension or loss of his mineral \nrights. In turn, this proposal will prevent the serious economic \nhardship to thousands of families and the State treasury that could \noccur if mineral development is stalled for an indefinite amount of \ntime due to protracted litigation under the current system.\n  This legislation is the result of over two years of work and \nrepresents the input of all the stakeholders: coalbed methane \nproducers, deep oil and gas developers, the coal industry, landowners, \nthe State of Wyoming, and the Department of the Interior. It is nearly \nidentical to legislation that was favorably reported out of the Senate \nEnergy Committee last summer by a voice vote. By providing a fair, \nexpeditious, cost-effective and certain method to resolve conflicts \nbetween mineral producers in one of the most bountiful energy regions \nin the world, the ``Powder River Basin Resource Development Act of \n2001'' represents an important chapter in the continuing effort to \ndevelop a comprehensive national energy policy for the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 676. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \npermanently the subpart F exemption for active financing income; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Baucus, Ensign, Torricelli, Schumer, Murkowski, and Breaux, to \nintroduce legislation to permanently extend the exclusion from Subpart \nF for active financing income earned on business operations overseas. \nThis legislation permits American financial services firms doing \nbusiness abroad to continue to defer U.S. tax on their earnings from \ntheir foreign financial services operations until such earnings are \nreturned to the U.S. parent company.\n  The permanent extension of this provision is particularly important \nin today's global marketplace. Over the last few years the financial \nservices industry has seen technological and global changes that have \naltered the very nature of the way these corporations do business, both \nhere and abroad. The U.S. financial industry is a worldwide leader and \nplays a pivotal role in maintaining confidence in the international \nmarketplace. It is essential that our tax laws adapt to the fast-paced \nand ever-changing business environment of today.\n  Let me outline exactly why this bill is needed. Regulated U.S. \nfinancial institutions with operations overseas need to retain earnings \nin foreign subsidiaries in order to meet ever-expanding capital \nrequirements. Unfortunately, if the tax provision this bill seeks to \npermanently extend is allowed to expire at the end of this year, as is \nscheduled under the current law, those earnings will be subject to \ncurrent U.S. taxation. Obviously, current taxation makes it more costly \nfor a growing overseas business to meet those capital requirements, an \nimpediment that is not in place for most foreign-based competitors.\n  Congress recognized this fact as long ago as the early 1960s, when \nthe Kennedy Administration proposed the imposition of current taxation \nfor all overseas income of U.S.-based corporations. Counsel for the \nJoint Committee on Taxation testified at that time that Congress could \nnot constitutionally tax shareholders on the unremitted earnings of \nforeign subsidiaries except in cases where such tax was necessary to \nprevent the evasion or avoidance of tax. In cutting back the scope of \nthe President's proposal, the House Ways and Means Committee stated, in \npart, ``to impose the U.S. tax currently on U.S. shareholders of \nAmerican-owned businesses operating abroad would put such firms at a \ndisadvantage with other firms located in the same areas not subject to \nU.S. tax.''\n  Forty years later, those words still ring true. The competition \nabroad for U.S. banks, for example, is no longer the Chases, Bankers \nTrusts, and Bank of Americas of the world. They are now Deutschebank, \nABN Amro, HSBC, and Societe Generale. These foreign-based financial \ninstitutions are big players in the worldwide arena operating, usually, \nunder home-country tax regimes that generally do not tax currently \ntheir active financial income earned outside their home countries.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide a consistent, \nequitable, and stable international tax regime for this important \ncomponent of our economy. A permanent extension of this provision would \nprovide American companies much-needed stability. Our current ``on-\nagain, off-again'' habit of annual extension limits the ability of \nU.S.-based firms to compete fully in the marketplace and interferes \nwith their decision making and long-term planning. The activities that \ngive rise to this income are long-range in nature, not easily or \ninexpensively stopped and started on a year-to-year basis. Permanency \nis the only thing that makes sense when it comes to this kind of tax \npolicy.\n  This legislation will give U.S.-based financial services companies \nconsistency and stability. The permanent extension of this exclusion \nfrom Subpart F provides tax rules that will ensure that the U.S. \nfinancial services industry is on an equal competitive footing with \ntheir foreign-based competitors\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\nand, just as importantly, provides tax treatment that is consistent \nwith the tax treatment accorded most other U.S. companies.\n  The world has changed rapidly over the past few years. Like it or \nnot, we live and compete in a global economy. In many respects, our Tax \nCode is outdated and represents the world as it was in the 1960s or \n1970s, or in some cases, even before. If we close our eyes to these \nfacts, we risk losing our worldwide leadership. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will not solve all of our tax problems, nor even all \nof the tax problems of U.S. companies trying to compete \ninternationally. It will, however, solve one very important problem. \nAnd this would be a start from which we can build.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and ask that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT SUBPART F EXEMPTION FOR ACTIVE FINANCING \n                   INCOME.\n\n       (a) Banking, Financing, or Similar Businesses.--Section \n     954(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     special rule for income derived in the active conduct of \n     banking, financing, or similar businesses) is amended by \n     striking paragraph (9).\n       (b) Insurance Businesses.--Section 953(e) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (defining exempt insurance income) is \n     amended by striking paragraph (10) and by redesignating \n     paragraph (11) as paragraph (10).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years of a foreign corporation \n     beginning after December 31, 2001, and to taxable years of \n     United States shareholders with or within which such taxable \n     years of such foreign corporation end.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Hatch in introducing legislation to permanently extend the \nexception from Subpart F for active financing income.\n  Current law contains a temporary provision, expiring at the end of \nthis year, that makes sure that the active financial services income \nthat a U.S. financial services company earns abroad is not subjected to \nU.S. tax until that income is distributed back to the U.S. parent \ncompany. Our legislation is intended to keep the U.S. financial \nservices industry on an equal footing with foreign-based competitors by \nmaking this provision permanent.\n  The growing interdependence of world financial markets has \nhighlighted the need to rationalize U.S. tax rules that undermine the \nability of American financial services industries to compete in the \ninternational arena. At the same time, it is important to ensure that \nthe U.S. tax treatment of worldwide income does not encourage avoidance \nof U.S. tax through the sheltering of income in foreign tax havens. \nHowever, I believe it is possible to adequately protect the federal \nfisc without jeopardizing the international expansion and \ncompetitiveness of U.S.-based financial services companies, including \nfinance and credit entities, commercial banks, securities firms, and \ninsurance companies.\n  The active financing provision is particularly important today. The \nU.S. financial services industry is second to none and plays a pivotal \nrole in maintaining confidence in the international marketplace. \nThrough our network of tax treaties, we have made tremendous progress \nin gaining access to new foreign markets for this industry in recent \nyears. Our tax laws should complement, rather than undermine, this \neffort.\n  As is the case with other tax provisions such as the research and \ndevelopment tax credit, the temporary nature of the U.S. active \nfinancing exception denies U.S. companies the certainty enjoyed by \ntheir foreign competitors. The economic growth of American's financial \nsector is impaired by the uncertainty under the current system created \nby continually extending the exception on a temporary basis. The \nactivities that are affected by this provision are long-range in nature \nand therefore those entering into these activities need to know the \nlong-range tax consequences of their actions. A permanent extension of \nthe active financing exception is needed to allow our financial \nservices industry to compete internationally.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and \nprovide a consistent, equitable, and stable international tax regime \nfor the U.S. financial services industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 677. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe required use of certain principal repayments on mortgage subsidy \nbond financing to redeem bonds, to modify the purchase price limitation \nunder mortgage subsidy bond rules based on median family income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Housing Bond \nand Credit Modernization and Fairness Act of 2001. I am joined in this \neffort by Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Allard, Lincoln, and Snowe. This \nlegislation will bring about important adjustments in two of the most \nimportant and popular federal affordable housing programs that have \nbeen enacted, Housing Bonds, or single family Mortgage Revenue Bonds, \nMRBs, as they are commonly known, and the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit. Identical legislation was recently introduced in the House by \nCongressmen Amo Houghton and Richard Neal.\n  These programs are popular because they are state-administered, \nfederal tax incentives to encourage private investment in first-time \nhomebuyer mortgages for low and moderate-income families and privately \ndeveloped and owned apartments for low-income renters. The changes \nproposed by this legislation were endorsed by the National Governors \nAssociation at its recent meeting. The Governors know how important the \nHousing Bond and Housing Tax Credit programs are in efforts to meet the \nhousing needs of low and moderate-income families. The bill is also \nsupported by the National Council of State Housing Agencies.\n  Last year more than 80 members of this Body cosponsored legislation \nthat was included in last year's Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of \n2000, which was signed into law by President Clinton. That legislation \nadjusted for past inflation in the operating levels of the Housing Tax \nCredit and MRB programs. Specifically, the Act increased the per capita \nlow-income housing tax credit cap as well as the State-volume limits on \ntax-exempt private activity bonds, under which the MRB program falls. \nHowever, even with these long overdue changes, many people who are \nqualified to receive housing assistance under these programs cannot get \nit. The reason is that a few obsolete provisions in the programs stand \nin the way. The legislation we are introducing today will modernize \nthese programs and remove these barriers. Specifically, the bill \nincludes three changes.\n  First, the bill would repeal the so-called Ten-Year Rule. This rule, \nwhich was enacted in 1988, prevents states from using mortgage payments \nreceived ten years after the original Mortgage Revenue Bond was issued \nto make new mortgage loans to additional qualified purchasers. A recent \nreport by Merrill Lynch states, ``The Ten-Year Rule, to a large extent, \noffsets gains from the volume cap increase.'' Between 1998 and 2002, \nthis rule will result in the loss of over $8.5 billion in mortgage \nauthority, denying over 100,000 qualified lower income homebuyers \naffordable MRB-financed mortgages. Each year, the Ten-Year Rule will \nkeep tens of thousands of additional qualified lower income homebuyers \nfrom getting an affordable MRB-financed mortgage, including many in my \nhome State of Utah.\n\n  Second, the bill would replace the current-law unworkable limit on \nthe price of the homes these MRB mortgages can finance with a simple \nlimit that works. Let me explain. Current law limits the price of homes \npurchased with MRB-financed mortgages to 90 percent of the average area \nhome price. States have the option of determining their own purchase \nprice limits or of relying on Treasury-published safe harbor limits. \nMost states rely on the Treasury limits because it is costly, \nburdensome, and often impossible to collect accurate and comprehensive \nsales price data.\n  The problem is that, like many states, the Treasury Department does \nnot have access to reliable and comprehensive sales price data. This \nhas\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nespecially been a problem for states, such as Utah, with many rural \nareas. In fact, Treasury last issued safe harbor limits in 1994, based \non 1993 data. Home prices have risen approximately 30 percent in the \npast eight years, and in some areas of the country by a much higher \npercentage. This means that the MRB program simply cannot work in many \nparts of many states because qualified buyers cannot find homes priced \nbelow the outdated limits. To have an outdated and unworkable \nrequirement that holds back the families that this program is designed \nto help is poor public policy that cries out for remedy.\n  The bill we are introducing today would allow States to determine \npurchase price limits without reliance on nonexisting sales price data. \nIt does this by limiting the purchase price to three and a half times \nthe MRB qualifying income limit. In the 106th Congress, I joined my \nfriend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, in introducing \nthis provision as a stand-alone bill.\n  Finally, the bill would make Housing Tax Credit apartment production \nmore viable in many very low income, and especially rural, areas by \nallowing the use of the greater of area or statewide median incomes for \ndetermining qualifying income and rent levels. This is how income and \nrent levels are determined under the very successful multifamily bond \nprogram. Current law requires States to use area median income to \ndetermine eligible incomes of Housing Tax Credit tenants. In many very \nlow income areas, median incomes are simply too low to generate \nsufficient rents to make these housing projects feasible. Data from HUD \nshow that current income limits inhibit Housing Tax Credit development \nin as many as 1,700 of the 2,364 non-metropolitan counties across the \ncountry.\n  The Housing Tax Credit and the MRB programs work and they are \nimportant to each State. The Congress recognized this last year by \nmaking the important adjustments in the operating levels of these \nprograms to compensate for past inflation. More than 80 senators joined \nus in this effort by cosponsoring the legislation. This was a vital \nfirst step in improving the ability of these programs to meet the \naffordable housing needs of millions of Americans. Now, we must finish \nthe job by correcting the problems in the programs that limit their \neffectiveness in delivering this affordable housing. For those of you \nthat cosponsored these bills last year, and those of our colleagues who \nare new to the Senate, I am asking you to join this bipartisan effort \nof Senators from both rural and urban States to see that these \nimportant provisions are enacted this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objeciton, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, maybe we can have an exchange here so that \nwe really understand the proposals on the two sides. The Senator asked \nthe question, When we reserve $750, $800 billion to strengthen Social \nSecurity, where is that money going to go? The situation we face as a \nNation is right here.\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\n  This is from the General Accounting Office. This is the long-term \nbudget outlook for the United States. It shows that while we are \nenjoying surpluses now, even if we save all the Social Security trust \nfund money, the deficits for the country are going to mushroom when the \nbaby boomers start to retire.\n  We have a very strange accounting system in the Federal Government. \nWe don't account for our long-term liabilities that are growing. In \nfact, there is a lot of talk about the publicly held debt, and the \nSenator said the President is paying down the publicly held debt. What \nhe hasn't talked about is the gross Federal debt. The gross Federal \ndebt, during this period, is actually going to grow from $5.6 trillion \ntoday to nearly $7 trillion at the end of this period.\n  What I am saying is, we should do two things: We should make a \nmaximum effort on paying down our publicly held debt, pay down more of \nit than the President proposes, but we also ought to reserve money to \ndeal with this long-term problem that is confronting us, which we all \nknow is there. There have been a series of proposals as to how to do \nthat. One is to establish individual accounts. Senators on the other \nside, by and large, support that approach. They support privatization, \nwhich I don't support, but they say that would be a way to go.\n  I just say to my colleague, if you are going to do that, you have to \nget the money from somewhere. If you are going to do other things to \nstrengthen Social Security and address this long-term debt problem, you \nhave to get the money from somewhere. Every proposal to reform Social \nSecurity that has been proposed--the Archer-Shaw proposal, former \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House; Senator Gramm's \nproposal; the Aaron-Reischauer proposal, Kolbe-Stenholm proposal, the \nleaders in the House of Representatives; the Gregg-Breaux proposal, one \nof the key alternatives in the Senate; and the Clinton-Gore proposal of \nthe last administration--every one of them requires money.\n  Our budget plan sets aside $750 billion for that purpose. Their plan \nsets aside nothing. That is a fundamental difference. That is not some \nplan that is out there in the ether. That is a plan that is necessary \nif we are going to begin to cope with our long-term debt bomb that is \nfacing this country as a result of the baby boom generation.\n  We can either say the problem doesn't exist and not do anything about \nit, which is what their budget plan proposes, or we can reserve \nresources now to begin to cope with our long-term imbalances that \neveryone knows is right beyond this 10-year period. I am saying let's \nreserve money now to deal with this long-term debt crisis; in addition \nto aggressively paying down our publicly held debt, doing it more \naggressively than they propose, I am also proposing dealing with our \nlong-term debt, something for which they have not reserved a dime.\n  That is the reason for that part of the plan, and we will be happy to \ndiscuss this more tomorrow and say we look forward to additional debate \nin the morning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have just been informed the pages \nwould like us to spend a few more minutes. Somebody is blushing, but \nthat is the truth. Something very nice happens to them in 5 minutes \nthat won't happen to them if we close up now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's not give up then.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to speak for 2\\1/2\\ minutes of it and the \nSenator from North Dakota can speak for 2\\1/2\\ minutes of it, or we can \nhave a quorum call. People have heard enough of us.\n  First, those listening, stay tuned tomorrow and we will tell you how \nPresident Clinton figured out that he could say he was saving Social \nSecurity but then had a long time to pay for it. Just think. You \nremember, he had a 15-year budget once. Tomorrow, we will tell you what \nhe was up to when he did that. It is most interesting. He can spend \nmore and still claim Social Security is being taken care of because he \ndid it in 15-year intervals instead of 10.\n  That is all I am going to say. Mr. President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/02/senate-section/article/S3287-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
