Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the House message on H.R. 3090. \nThe clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3090) to provide tax incentives for economic \n     recovery.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment \nand ask unanimous consent that the time until 9:30 this morning be for \ndebate with respect to the motion to concur, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders; that the Democratic \ntime be equally divided between the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment to the House bill without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I was on the conference committee on \nthe stimulus package prior to Christmas, which failed. That was \npredicated on unemployment insurance, health benefits, and money to \nhelp States with Medicaid. Two of the three are left out in this \nstimulus package. I urge my colleagues to vote against this stimulus \npackage, which I consider to be hurtful to the States but will no doubt \nget virtually everybody's vote for the wrong reasons.\n  I have been fighting for the stimulus package for a long time, \nobviously since September 11. I cannot, in any sense of conscience, \nsupport this bill. This has about $9 million to expand unemployment \ninsurance. That is good. That is fine. That is one of the three.\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nTwo of the three we had to have we did not do; one, we did do. It also \nhas $86 billion in corporate tax breaks and eliminates the tax cuts for \nthose lower income Americans who missed out on last summer's rebates. \nIn other words, the people who did not get a rebate will continue not \nto get a rebate.\n\n  It provides no help for States at this critical time and, in fact, \nhurts them. On every Senator's desk Members will find the 46 of 50 \nStates that are hurt. Members will see how much each State is hurt.\n  I am outraged this $100 billion-plus bill was pushed to a vote, \nfrankly, in the way that it was with, at best, totally inadequate \nnotice to Senators, with no debate and discussion about the need for \nstimulus on a day after Alan Greenspan said that everything is going \njust fine.\n  Why are we ignoring the clear consensus among economists and our \nFederal Reserve chief? I cannot answer that. Maybe I can. We all say we \nwant to defend the Nation, and we do. We want to fund a prescription \ndrug benefit, and we do. We want to support better education for our \nchildren, and we do. But now, we are in deficit. Our surplus is gone. \nCritical needs remain. Are we addressing them? No. Can we afford nearly \n$100 billion more in corporate tax breaks right now? No. Are we even \ngoing to discuss it? No, we are not.\n  This bill causes 46 States to lose $14 billion in tax revenues at a \ntime when they are already facing between $40 and $50 billion of debt. \nI spoke to my Governor last night. It will cost him $86 million. He \nwill have to cut Medicaid. He does not know where he will get the \nmoney. It is another nail in the coffin of the State which is not famed \nfor being rich.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I acknowledge this stimulus package is a \ndramatic improvement over what the other body sent previously. That \nmisses the larger point.\n  This morning's New York Times headline is interesting: ``The Federal \nReserve Chief Sees the Decline Over, House passes recovery bill.''\n  It is the irony of ironies that, once again, Congress, in trying to \nprovide fiscal stimulus, has acted too late. That is the history of \nCongress trying to use fiscal policy for stimulus. In fact, when the \nBudget Committee did an analysis, we found every single time we tried \nto act, we moved too late.\n  In the Washington Post this morning: ``Greenspan Declares An \nExpansion,'' it reports that economists are now largely agreed that in \nthis quarter the economy will be growing at 4 percent. Congress comes \nwith its recovery package too late.\n  I have supported a recovery package. I did when we attempted to do \none last year when it would have been timely. Unfortunately, that did \nnot occur. I would still support one if it were properly crafted. But I \ndon't believe this legislation meets the test. CBO has stated over the \nnext 10 years we are in deficit each and every year for the entire \ndecade, and by big amounts. They have just told us we can expect $2.3 \ntrillion of non-trust-fund deficits over the next decade. Every dime \nwill be coming out of the Social Security trust fund. That means every \ndime of this stimulus package is coming out of the Social Security \ntrust fund. We are headed for this future: The trust fund turns cash \nnegative in 2016. That changes everything.\n  When we examine the details of this package, its centerpiece is 3 \nyears of bonus depreciation. I strongly supported bonus depreciation \nfor a 1-year period because every economist said if we stretch it out, \nwe are encouraging companies to wait--not to act now, but to wait. In \nfact, that is exactly what one sees in the economics of this package--\n$39 billion of stimulus this year, but $82 billion in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address the House bill that we will be \npassing on economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers.\n  On a preliminary note, in normal circumstances, I would note that we \nshould not make a practice of passing House bills as is. These are not, \nhowever, normal times and this is not a normal process.\n  The House bill is really the latest bipartisan product on economic \nstimulus and aid to dislocated workers. It is a thinner version of last \nDecember's agreement between the White House and the Senate centrists. \nThe bottom line is this bill now enjoys Senate Democratic leadership \nsupport because it has been thinned down.\n  There is some good news and some bad news. Let's turn first to the \ngood news. This bill is a bipartisan, bicameral product, that the \nPresident will sign. That's the good news. Help is on the way for \nunemployed workers and recovering businesses.\n  Mr. President, the unemployed and struggling businesses have had to \nwait too long for the good news we deliver today. It has been over five \nmonths of long meetings, committee action, floor debates. Finally, we, \nthe United States Senate, will do our duty and act on economic \nstimulus.\n  Now, with the President's signature a certainty, several good things \nwill finally happen. First off, the unemployed will get extended \nbenefits. Businesses, large and small, will get a kick start with 30 \npercent bonus depreciation. That kick start will mean more jobs, so \nthose unemployed workers will be able to go back to work. Businesses \nthat have hit hard times will be able to carry back net operating \nlosses for an additional three years. New York City will receive much \nneeded tax relief for the purpose of rebuilding Lower Manhattan. In \naddition, tax provisions that expired this year will be extended for \ntwo years. Finally, our States will receive some relief in the form of \nan extension and reauthorization of portions of the TANF program. These \nmeasures are all good news for folks across America.\n  I said there is some bad news too. That news is derived from all of \nthe proposals dropped from the White House-centrist agreement. As I \nsaid above, this bipartisan agreement was before us in December, but we \nwere blocked from considering it by the Democratic leadership. Let's \ntake a lock at the things that were dropped.\n  First off, there was a proposal to accelerate tax relief from last \nyear's bipartisan tax cut legislation. I'm talking about dropping the \n27 percent tax rate to 25 percent.\n  I do not also discount the ideologically based opposition to \naccelerating the reduction in the 27 percent bracket. It is amazing to \nme that many on the other side see taxpayers in the 27 percent bracket \nas rich folks. A 2-percent rate cut for single folks earning between \n$27,051 and $65,550 is seen as a tax cut for the wealthy by the \nDemocratic leadership. Likewise, a married couple with incomes between \n$45,201 and $109,250 is considered rich. But I recognize that this tax \ncut proposal was difficult for the Democratic leadership to accept.\n  In this skinnier version, the other element of individual tax relief, \nthis one for payroll taxpayers, was dropped. I am talking about the \nrebate checks for payroll taxpayers. The rebate checks are gone. Some \non my side will view this omission positively.\n  So, in terms of tax relief for individuals, forget about it. We were \nnot able to strike the balance of the White House-centrist agreement.\n  There is little in the nature of corporate AMT relief in the thin \npackage. In some ways this is a good result. As I said at the time, the \noriginal House bill was too heavy on corporate AMT relief. On the other \nhand, there were noncontroversial reforms in the corporate AMT that we \ncould have included.\n  The most disappointing omission related to health care subsidies. We \nhad before us revolutionary social policy in the White House-centrist \nagreement. For the first time, the Congress had sign able legislation \nthat guaranteed health care benefits for laid off workers. The form of \nthe benefit, a refundable tax credit, ran into ideological opposition \nby some on the other side. Because two-thirds of the Senate Democratic \nCaucus did not agree with the form of the benefit, unemployed workers \nwill not receive the benefit. That's too bad. We had a chance to move \nthe ball forward on an important bipartisan objective, improving access \nand affordability of health care. Instead of moving the ball, because \nof ideology, we had to punt.\n  All of these were good provisions which enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport. They were the foundation of the White\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\nHouse-centrist agreement. Yet because of an ideological fixation, all \nof these good things went by the wayside. I believe today, as I did \nalmost 3 months ago, that, if we had been accorded a straight up or \ndown vote on the White House-centrist agreement, we would have \nprevailed. If we had prevailed, the people would be better served.\n  Mr. President unfortunately, it was not to be. So, here we are with a \nmixed bag. There is good news in terms of extended unemployment \nbenefits, bonus depreciation, and other measures. But there is bad news \nin terms of missed opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record be held open \nuntil 5 p.m. today for a statement by Senators, and that they be \nincluded at this point in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the economic stimulus \npackage in the interest of providing temporary assistance for \nunemployed Americans and their families. We cannot ignore the plight of \nmillions of Americans, who were laid off and want to get back to work. \nMy vote for this legislation should not be interpreted as a total \nendorsement of all of its provisions. Indeed, I have some serious \nreservations about extending tax benefits given to the oil and gas \nindustry and the industry in the business of converting poultry waste \ninto electricity. Again, my concern is that the special interests \ncontinue to benefit at the expense of hard-working Americans \neverywhere. However, overall, this bill will give unemployment relief \nfor those families who need it the most and will help stimulate our \neconomy to help America get moving again.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nbipartisan Job Creation and Workers Assistance Act of 2002, H.R. 3090. \nThis economic stimulus bill has been long in coming.\n  I am happy this day has finally arrived, but I know those unemployed \nworkers and their families, who became unemployed after the events of \nSeptember 11, and who will soon see their 26 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits expire, will be even more pleased that we have not forgotten \nthem. We will provide those whose benefits will soon expire an \nadditional 13 weeks of assistance, and I truly believe that within this \nadditional time period, they will return to full employment.\n  There are clear signs that the economy is recovering, but for those \nnearly 1.4 million long-term unemployed workers, there is no solace to \nbe found until they are working again and earning incomes in the \nprivate sector.\n  I believe the provisions of this bill that will also provide \nassistance to small and large businesses in the form of 30 percent \nspecial depreciation allowances, combined with conforming AMT \ndepreciation rules and a 5-year carryback of net operation loss \nprovisions will help to increase those employment opportunities for the \nunemployed so they do not have to depend on further extensions of \nunemployment insurance.\n  I am also pleased that this bill follows through--as the \nAdministration promised it would--to help fulfill the promise of \nproviding over $21 billion in assistance to New York City. The \nexpansion of Worker Opportunity Tax Credits to certain employees in New \nYork City, and special credits to property placed in the Liberty Zone \nalong with other provisions of this bill will continue to assist that \ncity on the road to recovery.\n  I am pleased that the bill also extends $12 billion in various tax \nprovisions that expired or will soon expire including the Worker \nOpportunity Tax Credits, Welfare to Work Credits, a 100 percent \nlimitation on percentage depletion for oil and gas from marginal wells, \nand a provision I have championed that would penalize in the form of a \ntax those groups health plans that fail to comply with mental health \nparity requirements.\n  There are other provisions in this bill that will allow teachers to \ndeduct classroom expenditures and exclusions for foster care payments \nto qualified placement agencies. The reauthorization of the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families supplemental grants and contingency funds \nfor states such as mine that have seen an increase in population is \nneeded help to some hard pressed state budgets.\n  This bill will become law. President Bush who has pressed for \ncongressional action will sign this needed legislation. It is not \neverything he wanted, and I remain convinced that the proposal I \nadvanced last winter to provide for a payroll tax holiday would have \nprovided additional needed stimulus. But nonetheless this bill will \nstill inject over $50 billion into the economy immediately and over $40 \nbillion next year.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the majority and minority leader in bringing this issue \nfinally to a conclusion. It is the right thing to do, it is the right \nthing for those displaced and out of work today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have worked closely with Senator Collins \nfor sometime now on legislation to provide much needed tax relief for \nour educators. Today, I am pleased to report that the Senate should \nsoon pass H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of \n2002, as previously passed by the House of Representatives. With \npassage of this legislation, Senator Collins and I will have finally \nachieved our shared goal of providing much needed tax relief for our \nNation's teachers.\n  The Collins-Warner provisions that are in this legislation, were \ncrafted by Senator Collins and myself after months of consultations \nwith Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Allen and House Ways and \nMeans Chairman Thomas. Congressman Scott from Virginia was also a very \ngood working partner on this legislation, having introduced similar \nlegislation on the House side.\n  The National Education Association played a key role and its many \nmembers should look with pride and satisfaction on their constructive \nadvice to the Congress. The president of the Virginia Education \nAssociation, Jean Bankos, also helped lead this superb effort.\n  Simply put, the Collins-Warner provisions provide a $250 above the \nline deduction for educators who incur out of pocket expenses for \nsupplies they bring into the classroom to better the education of their \nstudents. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this provision \nwill provide almost half a billion dollars worth of tax relief to \nteachers all across America over the next 2 years.\n  Our teachers in this country are overworked, underpaid, and all too \noften, under-appreciated.\n  In addition to these factors, our teachers expend significant money \nout of their own pocket to better the education of our children. Most \ntypically, our teachers are spending significant amounts of money out \nof their own pocket on classroom expenses, such as books, supplies, \npens, paper, and computer equipment.\n  These out of pocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our \nteachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving the profession. \nLittle wonder that our country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Estimates are that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed by 2009 \nbecause of teacher attrition, teacher retirement and increased student \nenrollment.\n  While the primary responsibility rests with the States, I believe the \nFederal Government can and should play a role in helping to alleviate \nthe Nation's teaching shortage.\n  On a Federal level, we can encourage individuals to enter the \nteaching profession and remain in the profession by providing tax \nrelief to teachers for the costs that they incur as part of the \nprofession.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. While many people spend their \nlives building careers, our teachers spend their careers building \nlives.\n  The Teacher Tax Relief provisions in this bill go a long way toward \nproviding our teachers with the recognition they deserve by providing \nteachers with important and much needed tax relief.\n  I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Collins, \nSenator Allen, and so many others to make this goal a reality.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Leader Daschle, I yield Senator \nBaucus 5 minutes of leader time, and following that, 2 minutes of \nleader time to Senator Conrad.\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this bill that has come over from the \nHouse has come over quite quickly and Senators have not had a lot of \ntime to examine it and to work through the provisions of the bill. \nPersonally, I think it is a bit rushed.\n  Having said that, I will support it at this point because--the phrase \nI often find myself using these days--we cannot let perfection be the \nenemy of good.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill. We did not have the \nopportunity to amend it. But the fact is, if we do try to amend it, we \nwill probably get wrapped around the axle, and nothing will be passed.\n  And there are several provisions that should definitely pass. One is \nthe extension of unemployment insurance. To my mind, the provisions in \nthe House bill relating to unemployment insurance do not do enough. \nGiven the state of the economy in the last year and the number of \npeople who are out of jobs and need help, it is unfortunate that we \ncannot do more. But a 13 week extension will help many people and \nprovide an economic stimulus.\n  In addition, the bill includes the extension of several important tax \nprovisions, some of which expired last year. It is an outrage, frankly, \nthat this Senate and the House of Representatives let those provisions \nlapse and we did not pass them at the end of last year.\n  I tell my colleagues right now that I regret I did not push strongly \nenough last year when we passed the tax bill to make sure the extenders \nwere included. I had an assurance that they would come up soon. But \nthat is no way to run a railroad. It is no way for the country to run \nits business, to say it is OK to have an on-again/off-again policy with \nrespect to tax law.\n  I tell my colleagues the next time this comes up, we are going to \npass extenders so that the provisions remain continuous. It will be a \nseamless web. There will never be another time when extenders are not \npassed, if I have anything to do with it.\n  Unfortunately, there are not any health provisions in this bill. \nThere should be. A lot of people lost their health insurance benefits \nas a consequence of lost jobs and as a consequence of the declining \neconomy.\n  As you well know, more and more people are without health insurance. \nIt is because companies are not providing health insurance, and people \nare laid off and can't keep their health insurance. It is a huge cost \nindividually to the people involved, and it is a huge cost to the \ncountry. It is regrettable that this provision we are passing today \ndoes not include health insurance benefits for those people who lost \ntheir health insurance on account of lost jobs. That is too bad. I wish \nit were in the bill, but it is not.\n  The bonus depreciation provision is good. It is going to help create \njobs, and it will help stimulate the economy a bit.\n  I note, as we all note, that Chairman Greenspan said we are turning \nthe corner. I think he is probably right. But the bonus depreciation \nprovision is going to help. It also is insurance, and that is going to \nhelp as well.\n  The long and short of it is we have a choice. It is either vote for \nthis, or try to amend it. If we try to amend it, we will be back where \nwe have been for the last 5 months; that is, doing a lot of talk and \nnot much action. I regret that.\n\n  But that is the situation with which we are faced. In light of this \nsituation, I urge my colleagues to pass this. It is going to help--\nparticularly the provisions that I mentioned--and we will get on with \nhealth insurance and get on with the other provisions that need to be \ntaken up later on this year.\n  When they come up, I urge my colleagues to work with us to be sure \nthat they are enacted because there are a lot of people hurting and who \nneed a lot of help.\n  I thank my good friend from Nevada.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Baucus is absolutely right. There \nare some good provisions in this bill. They are necessary provisions. \nThat is what makes this vote so difficult.\n  I have struggled with the question of how to vote. But, again, the \npress reports this morning said the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nsaid an economic expansion is now underway. It goes on to report that \nmany economists have concluded that the economy this quarter is growing \nat an annual rate of 4 percent. Now the House passes a recovery \npackage. They are too late.\n  This is the history of recovery packages. Every time in our history \nthat we have tried to use fiscal stimulus, we have been too late.\n  The centerpiece of this package is 3 years of bonus depreciation. \nLook, I am a strong supporter of bonus depreciation, but not for 3 \nyears.

But in March, on March 8, with GDP having grown 1.4 percent \nin the last quarter, and is probably going to grow by 4 percent this \nmonth, this plan makes a whole lot less sense.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by my distinguished colleagues, Senators McCain and \nHollings, to improve pipeline safety. This amendment would add to this \nlegislation the text of S. 235, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of \n2001, which previously was approved by the Senate.\n  As Congress debates the direction of our Nation's energy policy, we \nneed to consider the safety of the infrastructure that transmits much \nof that energy. S. 235 is important legislation that would help to \nsecure the safety and integrity of our Nation's 2.2 million mile-long \nhazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline system. And I want to thank \nSenators McCain, Hollings, and Murray for the hard work that culminated \nin this bill.\n  When S. 235 was considered on the Senate floor early last year, \nSenator Torricelli and I offered four amendments that we felt addressed \nimportant issues related to pipeline safety. We agreed with the \nsponsors of the bill that the most important of these amendments, \nrelated to the integrity of pipelines and their frequency of \ninspection, should be added to the bill. The bill then passed the \nSenate unanimously, 98-0. Unfortunately that bill remains stuck in the \nHouse, which so far has refused to act on the legislation.\n  The issue of pipeline integrity remains an important issue that must \nbe addressed. I have a special interest in this matter because my own \nState of New Jersey was the site of a major pipeline explosion. On \nMarch 24, 1994, a natural gas pipeline exploded in Edison, NJ, at 12 \nmidnight. Families living in the nearby Durham Woods apartment complex \nawoke to a deafening roar. They ran out of their homes to see a wall of \nflame hundreds of feet in the air. These flames were so high that they \nwere seen in both New York City and Pennsylvania.\n  Miraculously, only one person died that night. However scores of \npeople suffered injuries due either to burns or smoke inhalation. Many \nmore lost their homes and all their possessions. And the explosion \nitself left a crater that was 60-feet deep.\n  This explosion was caused by a natural gas pipeline that was buried \nin the earth. There were no reports of digging in the area, nor were \nthere reports of any other disturbances that could have set off this \nexplosion. It was simply the corrosion that occurred in the pipeline as \na result of natural conditions that allowed natural gas to leak, the \ngas to then ignite and an explosion to happen.\n  As harrowing as this tragedy was--it was not the only one. There have \nbeen natural gas pipeline explosions in other States, including New \nMexico, which have been severe enough to cause loss of life. In New \nMexico, 12 members of a family were incinerated when the natural gas \npipeline they were camped next to exploded in August of 2000.\n  From 1986 to 2000, there have been 366 fatalities due to pipeline \naccidents around our Nation. Three hundred and forty of these were due \nto natural gas pipeline accidents.\n  This concerns me because there is currently no requirement for the \nregular inspection of natural gas pipelines in this country. The Office \nof Pipeline Safety already requires hazardous liquid pipelines to be \ninspected on a regular basis. But it has not yet promulgated a rule \nregarding natural gas pipelines. And we have waited long enough.\n  That is why I sponsored language requiring a 5-year inspection period \nfor all pipelines, liquid and natural gas. It was this language which \nwas added to the version of S. 235 that is included in this amendment. \nAnd it is this language, along with the rest of S. 235, that I hope we \nwill include in the energy bill to move this matter forward and help \nensure that this legislation gets to the President's desk and becomes \nlaw.\n\n\n                           PRICE-ANDERSON ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I would like to make a brief statement \nabout the Price-Anderson Act and our vote yesterday. The Price-Anderson \nAct, which was first enacted in 1957, limits the nuclear industry's \nliability in the case of an accident. Under current law, that \nlimitation applies to all existing nuclear powerplants and would have \ncontinued to apply to all existing nuclear powerplants had the Senate \nnot acted. The amendment the Senate passed yesterday extended the \nPrice-Anderson Act's liability limitation to new nuclear powerplants. \nAs I have said before, I support Price-Anderson for our existing fleet \nof reactors, and I support extending the life of those plants. However, \nI do question whether or not we need to extend this liability to new \nplants. I know that we are making progress in developing new, more \neconomic and safer plants, such as the pebble bed reactors. \nNevertheless, the jury is out. We don't know if these plants will be \neconomical. We don't know whether they will need or should receive \nliability caps. We don't know what that liability cap should be. And we \nstill have not solved the fundamental question of what we will do with \nnuclear waste. I believe we should answer that question before we build \nnew plants and not simply leave that problem to future generations.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Idaho is here to offer an amendment on the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nWe thought previously it would be something we could do in about 5 \nminutes. I don't think we can do that, although we may be able to do it \nquickly on Monday or Tuesday.\n  I ask the Senator to be his usual gracious self and not offer the \namendment today until we have a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the Senator from Nevada chairs the \nappropriating subcommittee on this issue. It is an authorization. I \ncertainly want him to understand it. I will step back. I would like to \nmove it as quickly as possible. Monday or Tuesday of next week would be \nfine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1694-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I will not take more than 10 minutes. I \nsee my colleague from New Hampshire here as well. I voted against the \nso-called stimulus package a few moments ago. I didn't have a chance \nbefore the vote occurred to explain why I was going to cast that \nballot, voting no.\n  Obviously, there are provisions that I strongly endorse and support, \nincluding: The extension of unemployment benefits; teacher expenses \nwhich is an item we argued about a number of years ago that I thought \nwould be very worthwhile; and the New York recovery package--certainly \nI would like to see us do what we can to help New York City as a result \nof what happened September 11.\n  If those were the only issues, this would have been an easy vote. \nThey were not the only issues. In fact, they were minor issues by \ncomparison to what else was included in this package. Based on whatever \nestimates you want to rely on, at least over the next 10 years, there \nare $42 billion in revenue losses to the Federal Treasury.\n  Yesterday, the Presiding Officer, I, and others who sit on the Senate \nBanking Committee had the pleasure of listening to the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board say their analysis at the Federal Reserve was \nthat we are on our way out of this recession. The worrisome figures \nthat indicated this recession could be deeper or be a double-dip \nrecession apparently will not bear out. The country is getting \nstronger, the economy is getting much stronger.\n  While there may have been a strong case for this bill that just went \nthrough by 85-9--it is becoming the law of the land--and a strong case \ncould have been made for it 2 or 3 years ago or even a number of months \nago, but I do not think the case could be made for it today. Using the \nmost conservative number, the $42 billion, that is $42 billion more to \nthe deficits with which we are grappling, which according to the CBO, \nmay be $120 billion in this coming fiscal year. The administration had \ninitially said $80 billion. We are now told that over 10 years it is \n$1.8 trillion.\n  Well, $42 billion in a $1.8 trillion deficit may not sound like much, \nbut it is when we are trying to see if we can do more, for instance, \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, where we need maybe $100 \nmillion to $200 million to beef up enforcement and accounting divisions \nto deal with an Enron-type situation. It is a lot when we know, as a \nresult of increasing the workload of working mothers, we need \nadditional funding for child care, that we ought to do more on the \nchild abuse treatment and prevention programs--to mention a couple. In \ntransportation, we have an $8.6 billion shortfall. I don't know a \nsection of the country that will not be hurt by that budget decision.\n  Yet we just took $42 billion off the table this morning by a 85-9 \nvote. State budget shortfalls will total more than $42 billion for the \ncurrent fiscal year. A few months ago, we had a stimulus proposal on \nthe table that would have included State assistance. The previous House \nversion of this bill contained capped assistance for State Medicaid \nPrograms and also provided dollars back to the States as a result of \nthe revenue losses on the bonus depreciation. My State just lost $240 \nmillion this morning. New York lost more than $2 billion.\n  So on one hand we are giving money for relief and providing \nassistance on the September 11 tragedy, yet we will take $2 billion \naway from the State of New York. And again, in my state, this bill is \ntaking $240 million! The Governor and others are wrestling with how to \nprovide needed resources to our area.\n\n  I mentioned the $8.6 billion deficit reduction in the \nadministration's budget for transportation. That is a huge issue in my \nState, as I know it is in the State of the Presiding Officer and \nothers. Listen to what we have done and the analysis of this. The most \nexpensive component of this bill that we just passed is the 3-year \nbonus depreciation provision that will costs close to $97 billion \nduring the next three years, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, a nonpartisan budget \noffice, concluded that allowing depreciation bonus for 3 years rather \nthan 1 year--which is what we should have done--would sharply reduce \nthe effectiveness of this proposal as an economic stimulus. These are \ntheir words. With a 3-year provision, firms can delay investment until \nwell after the economy has recovered. This provision will worsen the \nfinancial situation in States which are facing cumulative budget \ndeficits of more than $42 billion.\n  Unlike the last two stimulus bills the House passed and the stimulus \nbill the Senate Finance Committee approved last fall, this bill we \nadopted includes no fiscal assistance whatsoever to States to offset \nthe State revenue offices that the depreciation provision would cost.\n  As I said, this bill might have been fine 5 months ago, but today it \nis a mistake. The provision calls for 3 years at 30 percent, but the 3-\nyear period begins on September 11. So all investments since September \n11 will qualify; new investments have to be made by September 10, 2004, \nlong after the recession is over. This is overreaching and it goes too \nfar. We have to learn to have a sense of balance about these things \nwhen we take these steps. In 2002, the bonus depreciation provision \nwill cost $35 billion. This is unfortunate when I know there are many \ngreat demands. How do you not have interest rates go up if the deficit \ncontinues to mount?\n  On the net operating loss, I am sympathetic to some of the issues, \nbut this provision allows a carryback to 1996--1996, as a stimulus \npackage? It is overreaching, way overreaching.\n  There is a lot we did not include: There are no health care tax \nprovisions. No rebates--the bill drops the $14 billion included \nearlier. No small business expensing. No general increase in small \nbusiness expensing. And no State assistance.\n  I know there are provisions that Members did not want to be seen \nvoting against, such as extension of unemployment benefits. I know we \nwanted to help out in the case of September 11 and what happened in New \nYork. But typically what happens is we list all of these things as if \nthey were of equal wait in the budget. They are not.\n\n  We just voted for a huge addition to the fiscal deficit of this \ncountry at a time when we are struggling to find payments for \ntransportation, health care, child care, and education. We have a 2-\npercent reduction in the elementary and secondary education accounts, \nand the President's budget. We may change it. We just passed a bill \nwith additional reforms for which we are going to have to pay.\n  This stimulus bill results in a tax increase for people at the local \nlevel. Local communities are going to raise taxes. States are going to \nhave to raise taxes. We just made, I think, a mistake by voting for \nthis so-called stimulus package.\n  Those are the reasons I cast a ``no'' vote this morning on that \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1694-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1694-S1695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the pending nomination of Judge Charles Pickering for the \ncircuit court of appeals, which was heard by the Judiciary Committee \nyesterday, with the vote postponed until next week.\n  I support Judge Pickering because I think Judge Pickering, in the \nyear\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\n2002, is an appropriate nominee for the circuit court. If Charles \nPickering were still a State Senator in the 1970s, I would vote against \nhim because his civil rights record at that time was not good. But \ntoday he is a different man. This is a different time.\n  The opposition raised against Judge Pickering, in large measure, is \nabout what he was as a Mississippi State Senator in the 1970s.\n  It is my hope that at a minimum we will send Judge Pickering's \nnomination to the floor of the Senate for a vote by the full Senate. \nThe Constitution provides for confirmation by the Senate--not by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. There are solid indicators that if Judge \nPickering reached the floor, there would be 51 or more votes for his \nconfirmation.\n  When you take into account an analysis of the comments within the \nbeltway by those who oppose Judge Pickering vociferously, and those in \nMississippi who know him best, they are for him. Those who talk about \nhim in Mississippi talk in specifics about how he took a courageous \nstand against a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, about how he sided with an \nAfrican American who was a defendant in a case where there was a white \nvictim, something which was frequently not the case in the South.\n  This may be a warmup for the next Supreme Court nomination. We have \nalready seen some indicators of that with some members of the Judiciary \nCommittee saying that a litmus test should be applied, and, if a \nnominee will not pledge to uphold Roe v. Wade, that nominee is not \nappropriate for confirmation.\n\n  This is an effort, in effect, to equate Brown v. Board of Education \non segregation, with Roe v. Wade. It is obvious that if someone did not \nsupport Brown v. Board of Education and desegregation, that person \nwould not be considered fit for the Federal bench today. But to apply a \nlitmus test more broadly is very troublesome, in my opinion.\n  It is my hope that if Judge Pickering receives a negative vote in \ncommittee along party lines, which seems almost certain, that at a \nminimum he would be sent to the floor for full floor consideration.\n  We ought to establish a truce--an armistice--on the partisan in-\nfighting which has been ongoing on nominations. When we had a Democrat \nin the White House and a Republican-controlled Senate, it was the \nmirror image of what we have today with Republican President Bush in \nthe White house and a Senate Judiciary Committee in the Senate \ncontrolled by the Democrats. I said the same thing when we had \nPresident Clinton in the White House and a Republican-controlled \nSenate. I crossed party lines to vote for Judge Paez and Judge Berzon, \nJudge Gregory and Bill Lann Lee for Assistant Attorney General for the \nCivil Rights Division.\n  It is my hope that we will establish a protocol.\n  I think Senator McConnell was right when he said yesterday in the \nJudiciary Committee hearing that we are facing an ``institutional \ncrisis.''\n  The American people do not like the partisan bickering--Democrats \nversus Republicans--especially when it comes to the selection of \nFederal judges and there is a judicial emergency in many circuits.\n  It is my hope that we will move ahead to try to end this \npartisanship.\n  There is solid precedent for submitting nominees to the full Senate \nwhen there is a negative or tied vote in committee. Judge Bork was \ndefeated 8 to 5 in committee. Yet his nomination was sent to the floor \nfor consideration as a Supreme Court nomination.\n  Justice Clarence Thomas had a tie vote in the committee of 7 to 7, \nbut by a vote of 13 to 1 his nomination was sent to the floor.\n  Six nominees for district court or circuit courts have been sent to \nthe full Senate when they did not receive an affirmative vote in \ncommittee--since 1951.\n  We still have time to revise the thinking on Judge Pickering. We \nstill have time for an analysis on an appropriate way to handle Judge \nPickering. But I submit that we ought to establish a principle from the \nJudiciary Committee that, if the vote is strictly along party lines, \nthe matter be put before the full Senate for consideration.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire for allowing me \nto precede him on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to speak briefly \non four issues this morning. Let me start, first, with the issue of \nMTBE, which is probably not a household word in many States. It is \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether. I will be calling it MTBE from now on in \nthese remarks.\n  Over the past few years, countless families and businesses in my \nState and throughout the Nation have learned firsthand the devastating \neffect of this gasoline additive known as MTBE. It is in our drinking \nwater. People can't shower because of the smell. They cannot drink the \nwater. Their homes have to have three or four huge tanks with filters \nin order to be able to drink and use their water. It depreciates the \nvalue of their home. This is a real problem nationally.\n  Fortunately, there is help on the way. I am very pleased that the \nenergy package we are now considering finally contains a solution.\n  I thank the majority leader for including my legislation in the \nFederal Reform Leaded Fuels Act in the energy package that we are \ndebating. This legislation was voted out of committee both last \nCongress and this Congress. I am pleased that it will finally get a \nvote, I hope, on the Senate floor.\n  I thank a lot of people who helped. This does not come easy. We all \nhave strong views. We have a number of different interests: Those who \nproduce the MTBE, those who produce ethanol, those who refine gasoline, \nthose regions of the country that can't use ethanol for various \nreasons, and those who are worried about the higher cost, if they do.\n  It took a lot of compromise and a lot of negotiations, which we have \nbeen working on now for many months--particularly Senator Reid of \nNevada, Senator Voinovich, Senator Jeffords, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison, Senator Hagel, and Senator Murkowski--there are \nothers, but in particular their hard work and cooperation with my \nstaff.\n  I also want to say that the refiners, the ethanol producers, the \nenvironmental groups--all of them--have worked with me over the last \nfew years to reach a consensus. It was not easy, that is for sure, with \nso many diverse issues and views.\n  I thank all of them for negotiating in good faith and keeping the \nwork product to ourselves as we went through this.\n  The result is good. It is a comprehensive legislative package that \nprotects our drinking water while preserving air quality and minimizing \nnegative impacts on gasoline prices and supply.\n  Understanding where we are, it is worth taking a step back to discuss \nhow and why we got to this point.\n  In 1990, the Clean Air Act was amended to include a reformulated \ngasoline program. This program requires clean burning gasoline in \nspecified areas with high levels of air pollution. Four counties in \nsouthern New Hampshire chose to participate. The program has been \nsuccessful in achieving the air quality benefits beyond our \nrequirements.\n  Unfortunately, one provision of the program mandates the use of an \noxygenate in areas that use reformulated gas, requiring States to use \nMTBE or ethanol. Because New Hampshire is far from ethanol production, \neconomics dictated that MTBE be chosen as the oxygenate. There was also \nconcern with the impact ethanol could have on the air quality of New \nHampshire, particularly the potential of increased smog.\n  So the State chose MTBE. Of course, at that time no one was aware of \nthe looming nightmare as a result of that choice. What we put in the \ngasoline to clean up the air has now contaminated our water.\n  How does that happen? Because the tanks underground that hold the \ngasoline leak, or after you fill up your tank with gasoline and you \ntake the nozzle out, a drop or two of the gasoline may hit the \npavement, and then it washes away into our ground water.\n  I remind all who are listening to me now, think about that when you \nput\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nthat nozzle back: Don't let any of that gasoline drip, not even a drop, \nbecause it goes so quickly into the water supply.\n  MTBE is a clean, cheap gasoline additive that boosts octane. It is a \nvery effective product. But it migrates through the ground and into the \nwater table and the aquifer very quickly and diffuses quickly. At even \nlow levels of contamination, MTBE renders water unusable because of its \nfoul odor and taste.\n  Particularly hard hit by the MTBE contamination are the communities \nin the southern tier of New Hampshire, such as Salem, Derry, and \nRaymond. I have come to the Senate Chamber on several occasions to \nspeak specifically about these families and small businesses that have \nbeen impacted by the MTBE contamination, continuing to reiterate the \ndesperate need that the Senate take action. Time after time, in \ncommittee, month after month, I have almost begged the Senate to take \naction on this matter because it isn't fair that people, in the \ninterests of making a profit, selling one product, should do it at the \nexpense of those whose health is being impacted by contaminated water.\n  I spoke to the Miller family--Christina and Greg, and their son \nNathan--who live in Derry, NH. This young family has been struggling \nfor over 3 years with MTBE contamination in their well--not being able \nto drink the water, not being able to shower. I have spent time at the \nFour Corners Store and surrounding homes in the town of Richmond. \nGasoline in those tanks spread from that location into the aquifers of \nthe surrounding homes. This plume has contaminated a number of private \nwells near that store. I visited some of those families who have those \nwells. We went down in the basements and saw these large tanks with \nfilters. When a prospective buyer comes to look at the house, what are \nthey going to think? The first question is: What is this?\n  The Goulas and Frampton families were kind enough to invite me into \ntheir homes and show me this massive treatment system that had been \ninstalled by the State. The answer is, yes, we are getting the filters, \nwe are getting the help, the remediation we need, but that does not \ntake care of the problem.\n  We do not want more homes contaminated. Once we remove the MTBE, then \nit is not going to get anymore into their wells. Once it is cleaned up, \nthey will be able to use their water again.\n  We take for granted, in this country, the fact we can turn that \nfaucet on and get a clean drink of water or take a shower and not have \nto smell the water. These are cumbersome systems that have to be set \nup, and costly to operate, not to mention the concerns and fears they \nface on a daily basis.\n\n  There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of stories similar to these New \nHampshire examples of nightmares that are the result of MTBE \ncontamination.\n  We made a mistake. The Government made a mistake. They put MTBE in \ngasoline to clean up the air, not knowing the harm they were doing. We \ndid not do enough research and science, and we made a terrible mistake. \nWe have to correct it. We have to do it now.\n  To help understand the magnitude of the problem in New Hampshire \nalone, it is worth noting just a couple of statistics.\n  The State Department of Environmental Services in New Hampshire \nestimates that up to 40,000 private wells in New Hampshire have some \nMTBE contamination.\n  In the year 2000, over 16 percent of the public water supplies had \ndetected levels of MTBE. Almost 20 percent of that public water with \nMTBE contamination is at levels above the State drinking water \nstandard.\n  The State has had to buy bottled water. I mentioned the installation \nof the expensive treatment equipment with contaminated wells.\n  Currently, New Hampshire has two dedicated State funds and a \nfederally funded program that are used to address MTBE problems.\n  During discussions with State officials, I learned that the money is \nrunning low and will soon run out if new sources of funding are not \nfound. This is a crisis. We have to deal with it.\n  New Hampshire is not alone. Many other States have had to address \nproblems from MTBE contamination. I know the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and I have talked about this a number of \ntimes.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. This is a \nnational problem. It has to be addressed at the national level because \nto not do so would force communities to say, we are going to ban MTBE, \nand they would be in violation of the Clean Air Act.\n  So this legislation I have written is an effective solution. I am \npleased that the energy package includes the text of that legislation. \nSpecifically, it bans MTBE, provides money for the cleanup of MTBE, \neliminates the oxygen mandate in the RFG program, and maintains the \ncurrent level of air quality protection. There is no backsliding.\n  In addition, the legislation requires the EPA to conduct an expedited \nreview of State petitions to suspend the oxygen mandate in the RFG \nprogram. If the EPA fails to complete the review of a State petition \nwithin 30 days, the petition will automatically be granted. This \nprovision could allow New Hampshire to begin to eliminate MTBE from the \nfuel system even before the oxygen mandate is lifted.\n  I have promised to help New Hampshire in any way possible to stop the \nuse of MTBE and I promise those families the same thing. We owe it to \nthem. The Senators who are not from New Hampshire owe it to them, as I \nwould help those in other States who have similar problems. And there \nare those in other States who have similar problems.\n  Finally, the language includes $2 million for the research of \ntechniques to clean up bedrock contamination and to establish a \nclearinghouse for sharing the information. This is a huge increase \nbeyond the pilot study currently funded.\n  The greatest difficulty, according to Dr. Nancy Kinner, a scientist \nfrom the University of New Hampshire, is tracking and cleaning up MTBE \nin fractured bedrock. This research will help to address that problem. \nIt has not been an easy deal to reach, but a lot of people \nparticipated. They came in with the right approach, understanding the \ndesperate need those families have.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader, and all of the Senators involved. \nI particularly thank Chris Hessler and Melinda Cross from my staff for \ntheir help, and Dave Conover, of course, for his assistance in helping \nme to work through this.\n  Madam President, I see there are no other Senators in the Chamber. I \nask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1696-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1696-S1697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JEFFREY HOWARD\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about the Pickering nomination and about the delay in \napproving judges. It seems to be a perennial issue. Senator Specter \njust spoke about it. But there are times when we need to put some of \nthese partisan feelings behind us and look at some of these \nnominations.\n  I rise to discuss the nomination of Jeffrey Howard to be a justice \nfor the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney Howard is like many \nother of President Bush's nominees who have yet to even receive a \nhearing. These men and women whom we nominate, their lives go on hold. \nThey have law practices. They have responsibilities. They have \nfamilies. What do you do?\n  Jeff Howard is a young man. He has a family. He was nominated on \nAugust 2, 2001. I was pleased to have been the prime mover and sponsor \nof that nomination because Jeff Howard is extremely well qualified for \nthis position. But his nomination, with all due respect to the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, has now been pending for 217 days.\n  The vacancy he was nominated to fill was formerly held by Judge \nNorman Stahl. This vacancy was created on April 16, 2001. You may want \nto keep this in mind. We are almost to the first-year anniversary of \nthe creation of the vacancy, and yet, how does he conduct his law \npractice? How does he take on new clients? What does he do?\n  His paperwork has been complete since September 20, 2001. Both \nSenator\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nGregg and I returned our blue ships--that means approval slips--on \nSeptember 20, 2001. There is no reason this nomination cannot have a \nhearing. There is no controversy here. He should have a hearing.\n  Jeff Howard has an impressive array of legal experience that well \nqualifies him to be a Federal appellate judge. He served as U.S. \nattorney for New Hampshire from 1989 to 1993. In that post, he \nlitigated numerous cases at both the trial and appellate levels and was \na member of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S. \nAttorneys. For his efforts, he received the Attorney General's Edmund \nRandolph Award as well as the U.S. Attorneys' Award.\n  He has Federal experience that includes a stint as principal \nassociate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice \nfrom 1991 to 1992. He performed this job at the request of former \nAttorney General Bill Barr. In addition to his work as U.S. attorney, \nhe served as attorney general of New Hampshire from 1993 to 1997 and \ndeputy attorney general in 1988 and 1989. In these State and Federal \ncapabilities, Jeff Howard has been involved in thousands of litigated \nmatters covering the full range of issues that are going to come before \nhim as a Federal judge.\n  In particular, he has been either on the brief or lead counsel in \nmore than 100 cases in the First Circuit, the court to which the \nPresident has nominated him. Over the last 10 years, he has performed \napproximately 2,500 hours of pro bono work for victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  He grew up on his grandfather's dairy farm in Cornish, NH, and later \ngraduated from Plymouth State College with a B.A. and later Georgetown \nLaw School, and he was editor of the American Criminal Law Review.\n  This is a well qualified judge. He should be on the court. He does \nnot deserve this kind of treatment. How are we going to get good people \nto come forth and take these jobs when their lives are put on hold for \nyears, sometimes, let alone months and days?\n  The circuit court nomination pace is incredible. During the first \nyear of the Clinton administration, only five court of appeals nominees \nwere nominated. Of those five, three were reported out that same year. \nThat is 60 percent of President Clinton's court of appeals nominees. In \ncontrast, President Bush has nominated 29, and the committee has only \nreported 6. That is 21 percent. There were only two circuit court \nnominees left pending in committee at the end of President Clinton's \nfirst year in office. In contrast, there were 23 of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees pending in committee at the end of last year.\n  It is unfair to compare the first years of the second Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration by looking only at the \nmere number of nominees confirmed. This approach fails to take into \naccount the fact that President Bush chose to nominate 24 more circuit \ncourt nominees than President Clinton did. We can get lost in the \nnumbers, and I don't want to go through it.\n  I just repeat that Jeff Howard is as highly qualified a judge for the \nFirst Circuit as any judge I have seen. Yet we still have the \nnomination pending without even a hearing. His life is on hold. His \nfamily's life is on hold. I appeal to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to give this good, decent, honorable judge a hearing so we \nhave the opportunity to bring his nomination forth and put him on the \nbench where he belongs and where I was proud to support him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1697-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF CHARLES PICKERING\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise to discuss the \nnomination of Charles Pickering. Senator Specter just spoke on it.\n  This is a tragedy, when we have to drag people through the mud when \nthey get finally to the hearing process, as Charles Pickering has. He \nis a man whose name is being dragged through the mud, even though \npeople in his hometown of all races and creeds are praising him and \nsaying: Whatever mistakes he made in the past, we understand. He has \nmoved beyond that. He is a good man. He ought to be on the bench. Yet \nhere we are, stuck with probably seeing a situation where Charles \nPickering will be defeated by one vote on a party-line vote and not be \nallowed to come to the floor.\n  Why not give the Senate a chance? It is done. Maybe it has not been \ndone that often on circuit court matters, but it has certainly been \ndone many times with Supreme Court Judges. I hate to say it because I \nwill not get into the partisan rhetoric here, but this is a classic \ncase of getting ``Borked'' again. We all know what Judge Bork went \nthrough, and Clarence Thomas. We know what John Ashcroft went through.\n  Is this the way to treat people? Just be fair about it. If we are \ngoing to hold people accountable for every single mistake they make in \nlife, then we will have to have perfect people. I don't know too many \nperfect people walking around this Chamber. If there is anybody in this \nChamber who has not made any mistakes, they probably should vote \nagainst Pickering.\n  This is ridiculous. He is a good man, a good judge. To have his name \ndragged through the mud is disgusting. I hate to see it. It reminds me \nof the Ashcroft hearing, of the terrible things said about Clarence \nThomas and, of course, Robert Bork. Bork was probably one of the most \nqualified people ever to even be nominated for the Supreme Court. \nWhether you liked him or disliked him on his views, he was still \nqualified. The last time I looked, a President had the right to pick \nsomebody of his choosing, of his philosophy.\n  I voted for I don't know how many Clinton nominations to the Supreme \nCourt, to the Federal court system. I didn't expect to get Reagan-type \njudges out of Bill Clinton, but he was the President. I supported most \nof them unless there was some particular thing that, in my view, made \nthem not qualified.\n  To echo what Senator Specter said, it is my hope we will move this \nnomination to the Senate floor and let the Senate make the decision. \nThat is not unreasonable. The committee is deadlocked on a partisan \nvote. Bring Judge Pickering out. If he loses, fine; if he wins, fine. \nBut let him have a vote. He deserves that. At worst, we can say maybe \nsome of the things are true. How do you know whether what he said and \ndid 30 or 40 years ago is over now? Can you be the judge of that? Let \nall 100 Senators make that judgment. I would like to have a chance to \nhave a vote on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1697-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1697-S1698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE NOMINATION OF JOE SCHMITZ\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, the final item I rise to \ndiscuss involves another nomination, but not for the judiciary. It is \nthe nomination of Joe Schmitz. I have already submitted a statement for \nthe Record, but I want to say this in the Chamber because I believe \nstrongly in it.\n  Joe Schmitz was nominated for the inspector general at the DOD. This \nis a position among the most important in the Department because the \ninspector general's office is responsible for ensuring accountability \nand efficiency, and therefore it is the heart of the integrity of the \nPentagon.\n  There have been numerous scandals in the IG's office in the recent \npast. Essentially, the inspector general's office has been rudderless \nwithout a confirmed nominee now for 3 years. With the IG's office in \ndisarray, there is the impression left that the Department is without \nproper and necessary oversight. It is more than impression; it is fact.\n  I am also told that the IG's office has been leaderless, headless, \nfor some 10 years--over the past couple decades, which is a disgrace \nwhen you stop to think about it. Without strong leadership, direction, \nand motivation, no office can function efficiently and effectively.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld needs an inspector general. If you stop to think \nabout the job Donald Rumsfeld has done as the Defense Secretary in this \ncountry, the way they have responded, the way they have conducted \nthemselves in countless briefings, and the way they have administered \nthe war and come back after the terrible events of 9/11, he deserves an \ninspector general. He deserves Joe Schmitz because that is his choice. \nWe are, after all, at war. Remember that.\n  It doesn't seem to bother those who are deliberately holding up the \nnomination of this good man. He was the Secretary of Defense's choice, \nthe\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\nchoice of President Bush in this important post.\n  This is not a lifetime appointment. This is not a judge. This is an \nappointment of who President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld want to be \ninspector general for the Defense Department at a great critical time. \nHe is an individual with a strong background for the job, with \nimpeccable personal and professional credentials. I hope we move \nforward expeditiously with this nomination. It has been cleared by the \nArmed Services Committee by voice vote and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, yet it is on the calendar with no action.\n  Individuals who undergo the nomination process put their names and \nreputations on the line. They open themselves up for intense scrutiny \nof their past employment, finances, conduct, associations, somebody's \nopening every door--everybody who wants to say something negative about \nyou, they find. They interview you.\n  He has been held up long enough. There are no ethical issues \nimpacting this nomination. He has received strong recommendation from \nthose who know him and have worked with him, regardless of party \naffiliation. You will find it on both sides. Joe Schmitz was a \nsuperlative choice by Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush, and he \nwill make an outstanding attorney general, and that is a fact.\n\n  The Senate needs to act. Again, I put this nomination in the same box \nwith Charles Pickering and Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork and John \nAshcroft and others. Why do we have to put people through this? Why do \nwe have to attack them publicly in nomination hearings? If you have a \nproblem, be man enough to sit down and talk with them. If I have a \nproblem, I bring them into my office and talk to them privately. If \nthere is still a problem, I might have to say something publicly; but \nfor the most part, if I know something and I need an answer, I am man \nenough to bring the person in, sit him or her down and say: Here is \nwhat I want to know.\n  It is not real bravery and courage to sit up on the dais in Senate \nhearings, with the nominee sitting down at the table, and you are \npounding away on him, criticizing him in front of everybody. You have \nthe gavel, you are the Senator, what is he going to say? He has to sit \nthere and take it in order to get this job. We do it and we character-\nassassinate people day in and day out. It is not right. We wonder why \nwe can't get good people to serve and why there is so much exasperation \nand condemnation about the people who serve in government. That is why. \nIt is not right.\n  Schmitz is a good man. I say to my colleagues who have the power to \nmake it happen: Get him on the floor of the Senate and let's vote and \ngive Don Rumsfeld his inspector general.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this morning, we had the \nopportunity to vote on the economic package that we have been working \non now for some period of time. Our deliberations on this subject began \nalmost 6 months ago.\n  In fact, I do not think that the timing of this action is a \ncoincidence. Monday will mark the 6-month anniversary of September 11. \nIt will also be the days that workers who lost their livelihoods on \nSeptember 11 will exhaust their unemployment benefits.\n  Those who have until now opposed a bipartisan economic recovery bill, \nand the unemployment insurance extension it includes, have wisely \ndecided to relent in their opposition before the anniversary of that \nawful day arrives.\n  Two months ago, I proposed a common-ground economic recovery bill \nthat contained only provisions supported by both parties. It included a \n13-week unemployment extension, tax rebates for persons left out of \nlast year's tax cut, business tax cuts to spur investment and create \njobs, and fiscal relief for the states.\n  In an attempt to break the logjam and bridge disagreements between \nthe parties, Democrats agreed to give up the economic priorities we had \npressed last year, but which were opposed by Republicans. In exchange, \nwe proposed that Republicans give up their priorities which were \nopposed by Democrats--namely, repealing the alternative minimum tax for \ncorporations, including Enron, and accelerating the rate cuts enacted \nlast year.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans blocked that measure, despite the \nfact that when votes were taken our consensus package received 56 \nvotes, while the Republican bill had just 48 votes.\n  The bill we have just approved is similar in its approach. Like the \ncommon-ground bill Democrats proposed in January, it leaves out the \nhighly controversial proposals Republicans insisted on previously. And \nit includes a top priority for Democrats--an extension of unemployment \ninsurance. For these reasons, I support this legislation--although I \nwould point out one serious omission.\n  As I said, our bill included one year of fiscal relief for the states \nthrough an increase in the match rate for Medicaid. Sixty-two Senators \nvoted for an amendment to provide this relief for 2 years. \nUnfortunately, the bill passed by the House does not include this \nimportant measure.\n  This fiscal relief provision is the top priority of the bipartisan \nNational Governors Association. It would assist States with the serious \nrevenue shortfalls they are experiencing as a result of the recession. \nGiven the adamant opposition of some Republicans and the difficult time \nconstraints under which the Senate is operating, it is not possible to \naddress this issue in the time available to us this morning.\n  I say to the opponents of State fiscal relief: Dropping this \nprovision is a serious mistake, and one I believe they will regret. In \nthe long run, I do not believe we can avoid dealing with this problem.\n  There are other measures in this bill some of us might have written \ndifferently. Many of us would prefer a shorter time period for the \nbonus depreciation provision, for example, but on balance, the bill is \na vast improvement over what Republicans and the administration \nadvocated originally, and I believe it deserves the support it received \nthis morning. I am grateful for its passage.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate at long last passed a \nthirteen-week extension of unemployment benefits.\n  This is a relief to over 3,000 workers in my State of West Virginia \nwho have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits since September \n11, 2001, and, it is help that could have--and should have--been \nprovided sooner, if it had not been delayed unnecessarily by those who \nhave sought to provide tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts for a \nso-called ``economic stimulus.''\n  Much has changed since an economic stimulus was first proposed in \nresponse to the September 11 attacks. The economy is growing again, \nbusiness investment is on the rise, and workers are returning to their \njobs. Both the stock markets and the economy have proved to be more \nresilient than economists had expected.\n  And so I find it difficult to accept the argument that $43 billion in \ntax cuts is necessary to ignite an economic expansion that appears to \nbe already underway.\n  What is more, I find it difficult to support legislation that would \nresult in a further erosion in the budgets of state governments. I \nserved in the West Virginia Legislature, and I understand and \nsympathize with their budgetary constraints. The depreciation provision \nthat was included in the bill that was passed today is projected to \ncost my state $86 million in revenue. My State cannot afford to lose \nthat revenue.\n  The Federal budget position is not much better, Mr. President. This \nyear's budget and appropriations process promises to be very difficult, \nand tough choices will have to be made. With projected deficits for the \ncurrent and upcoming fiscal years, the mounting costs of our military \nefforts abroad, the need to improve our homeland defenses, and the \nlong-term financing problems facing Social Security and Medicare, I \ncould not in good conscience vote to spend $51 billion to spur an \neconomic expansion that, as Federal\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee \nyesterday, is already well underway.\n  What is unfortunate, is that in opposing this package of tax cuts, I \nwas forced to oppose a number of tax provisions that would aid the City \nof New York. I have tried to be helpful to the people of New York State \nin the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Last year, I helped to \nsecure $11 billion through the Appropriations Committee--almost $2 \nbillion more than was proposed by the president--to help New Yorkers \nrebuild their city.\n  Nevertheless, I am glad a thirteen-week extension of unemployment \nbenefits has at last been approved, and am only sorry that it could not \nhave been provided sooner and without tens of billions of dollars in \nwhat is likely to be unnecessary stimulus.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, although I strongly support an extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits, because this bill--which is called a \nstimulus bill--would in reality have a detrimental impact on our \neconomy, I cannot support it.\n  First, while I agree that bonus depreciation for corporations should \nbe included in an economic stimulus package, this bill provides it for \nthree years. The package is intended to stimulate the economy now, in \n2002. Giving a company 30% bonus depreciation in 2003 and 2004 does not \nhelp stimulate the economy in 2002. The incentive to invest now, when \nwe need it, is not just missing. In fact, since companies know that \nthis bonus depreciation will be around for three years, they don't need \nto invest now when the economic picture is still uncertain. The \nincentive will be reversed--companies can choose to delay investments \nand still take advantage of the bonus depreciation in 2003 or 2004. A \nthree year bonus depreciation provision therefore could actually \nencourage businesses to wait to invest, and therefore be \ncounterproductive to the goal of jumpstarting the economy.\n  Not only is the bonus depreciation provision not stimulative, it is \nalso extremely expensive. This provision will cost us about $97 billion \nover the next three years at a time in when we are already projected to \ntap into our Social Security surpluses. That's almost 80% of the three-\nyear cost of this bill in this one provision alone. If we passed bonus \ndepreciation for two years or one year--time periods which may actually \nencourage immediate investment and stimulate the economy--we would save \nanywhere between approximately $30 billion to $60 billion in revenue. \nThat's money we could use to help protect Social Security, pay down the \ndebt, pay for a prescription drug benefit, or rebuild some of our \nnation's crumbling schools. Instead, under the guise of ``stimulus,'' \nthis tax break for corporations will have real impacts long after this \nrecession has ended. That's bad policy, and I cannot support it.\n  Also, this bonus depreciation provision will severely harm our states \nat a time when many are facing severe budget shortfalls. The bill is \nestimated to cost states some $14 billion over the next three years; \nMichigan will lose an estimated $144 million over the next three years \nfrom this bonus depreciation provision. That is money Governor Engler \nhas argued Michigan cannot afford to lose. Instead of stimulating \ngrowth in our states, we are making the economic picture worse.\n  I also have concerns about the five year extension to the Subpart F \nexceptions concerning foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations located \nin tax havens. While many Subpart F exceptions have a valid business \npurpose, there are loopholes in the law that are being exploited that \nallow some corporations to combine the exceptions with the use of tax \nhaven jurisdictions to avoid paying a fair share of taxes. Most \nextensions in this bill are for no more than two years, but the \nextension for Subpart F in this bill is for 5 years. That's not \nappropriate given concerns about loopholes in Subpart F. I had hoped we \nwould have provided the extension for no more than 2 years during which \ntime we would have hearings on this important issue to get to the \nabuses. Instead, this bill extends the exceptions, unchanged, for five \nyears time at a cost of $9 billion. This issue is something I will \ncontinue to pursue. Tightening up Subpart F to prevent it from being \nused for purposes for which it was not intended requires our prompt \nattention.\n  There are some important provisions in this bill. I strongly support \nthe extension of unemployment benefits for an additional thirteen \nweeks; I support the aid to New York City; and I support the extension \nof the Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity tax credits. Regarding the \nextension of unemployment benefits, I voted earlier this year for a \nbill to accomplish that. Congress should have taken this action months \nago. As I have said previously, we have an obligation in times like \nthese to assist Americans who have lost their jobs. Many are suffering \nright now and need our help. But their needs go beyond just a simple \nextension of UI benefits. While I am pleased that this bill contains \nthe additional 13 weeks of benefits, it does not go nearly far enough \nin providing the help that is needed--it does not provide any health \ncare assistance to our unemployed, increase weekly benefits, or expand \nunemployment insurance eligibility.\n  Because of this bill's short-term costs, the harm it causes to our \nstates, its lengthy extension of a provision that may be being abused \nfor tax avoidance, and the fact that over 50% of its 10 year costs go \nto provisions that are not really stimulative to our economy, I cannot \nsupport it.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to vote in favor of \nlegislation that will extend unemployment benefits for workers across \nAmerica who have lost their jobs since this recession began last March. \nCongress ought to have acted much sooner. Thousands of people have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits and have had to resort to \nextraordinary measures to take care of their families while they look \nfor another job. They should not have had to wait this long for \nassistance. I am relieved that they will not have to wait any longer.\n  This bill also provides tax relief to businesses in order to boost \nthe economy and ensure a robust recovery. I have long supported \nprovisions to provide bonus depreciation and net operating loss carry \nback to businesses. I believe that these steps will help our economic \nengine create more jobs. This legislation also includes tax provisions \nthat have recently expired or are about to expire. It extends the \nWelfare to Work tax credit which is so vital to our hopes for renewed \neconomic growth. And it provides tax deductions to construct the \ninfrastructure necessary for the widespread use of renewable fuels such \nas ethanol.\n  In addition, I strongly support the measures included in this bill \nthat will contribute to the recovery of New York City. The devastation \nsuffered in lower Manhattan last September will be difficult to \novercome. It will take a long time. But all Americans want to see the \ncity reclaim its standing as a proud center of commercial activity. The \nmeasures included in this legislation are an important step in that \nrecovery process.\n  Let me state for the record, I have some reservations about this \nbill. I do not believe that this is the best stimulus package the \nSenate has considered this year. I strongly supported the consensus \npackage offered by Senator Daschle in January. That bill would have \nprovided tax rebates to those low-income Americans who did not receive \nthem last year. It would have limited the business tax incentives to a \nshorter timeframe, thereby really promoting investment in the near \nfuture. I have also been very supportive of efforts to help unemployed \nworkers secure health insurance for themselves and their families. I am \nvery disappointed that this legislation make no progress on that front.\n  And most important, Senator Daschle's bill included financial \nassistance to our states that are facing such dire fiscal crises. I \nsupported increasing the Federal matching money for the Medicaid \nprogram to help states meet the additional demands for social services \nthat are being placed on them as they respond to the economic downturn. \nMost states do not have the option of engaging in deficit spending, no \nmatter what the circumstances. Yet the legislation we have before us \ntoday will make their job more difficult. Rather than lending a helping \nhand to states, we have just reduced their tax revenues. I believe this \nis the largest failing of this bill. And I will continue to work with \nmy colleagues to find ways that we can help states cope with the \npressure on their budgets.\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\n  In spite of its flaws, I support this compromise legislation. It is \nnot the bill I would have crafted myself, but I believe that every \nSenator here could make the same statement. this is a compromise. And \non balance this legislation will be good for our economy, and is vital \nfor those workers who are still struggling to find new jobs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act \nof 2002 contains a package of technical corrections to EGTRRA, the tax \ncut bill we enacted last year. Among these technical corrections is a \nprovision that corrects an unintended drafting error that prevented \nincreased contributions to Simplified Employer Pension plans--also \nknown as SEPs. Congress raised the percentage of compensation limit on \nall defined contribution plans, but the drafters failed to make the \nconforming change that would also have raised the percentage of \ncompensation limit on SEP plans by an equal amount. Clearly, we \nintended to include SEP plans when we raised the compensation limit for \ndefined contribution plans. As a result, this technical correction is \nentirely appropriate.\n  There is no doubt this Congress intended for employers who sponsor \nSEPs for their workers to be able to contribute the maximum annual \namount that we authorized under the law. However, we also intend that \nSEP plans comply with the law just as all other pension plans must.\n  The Treasury Department has authority under existing law--Internal \nRevenue Code Section 408(l)(1)--to impose reporting requirements on \nSEPs. However, such requirements have not yet been implemented through \nany regulation.\n  The Internal Revenue Service has indicated many SEP plan sponsors may \nnot be in compliance with rules that require SEP plan contributions be \nprovided to rank-and-file employees along with owners and key \nemployees. Much of this noncompliance may well be the result of the \nabsence of reporting requirements.\n  The tax subsidy for SEP plans is a substantial one, and under the \nprovisions of EGTRRA and this technical correction, that subsidy will \ngrow significantly.\n  Had this tax package gone through the usual legislative procedure--\nincluding a conference from which a conference report containing \nlegislative history would have emerged--it would have included \ncommittee report language urging the Treasury Department to exercise \ntheir existing statutory authority under IRC Section 408(l)(1) to \nimpose reporting requirements on SEPs.\n  In the absence of such a committee report, I urge the Treasury \nDepartment to act expeditiously to issue clear, simple SEP reporting \nrequirements so that Congress can be confident that those working for \nSEP plan sponsors are getting all the pension benefits to which they \nare entitled.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to impress on my colleagues \njust how important this legislation is to the workers in the Nation who \nhave borne the weight of this recession that was so exacerbated by the \nSeptember 11 incidents.\n  My colleagues have heard me say this again and again, but the Pacific \nNorthwest has suffered extraordinarily in the past year. My State of \nWashington now has the dubious honor of having the second highest \nunemployment rate in the Nation, behind our neighboring State Oregon.\n  We had a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 7.5 percent in \nJanuary--and the insured unemployment rate is above 5 percent.\n  I have analysts in my State who foresee a wave of layoff notices in \nthe pipeline and estimate that the State is going to hit 8 percent \nunemployment when the February numbers come out later this month.\n  Why is this the case? Well, we have a number of factors at work. I \nwould like to give my colleagues a better understanding of the economic \ncircumstances affecting my State.\n  Even prior to the tragic events of September 11 and even prior to the \nrecession that may have begun in the early months of last year, \nWashington's economy was facing hurdles.\n  We have seen significant layoffs in aluminum, agriculture, and high \ntechnology--due to persistent droughts, the high cost of energy, \nmassive reductions in timber harvests, and declining export markets.\n  My State is the most trade dependent State in the Nation on a per-\ncapita basis, and September 11 had a devastating impact on the aviation \nindustry. In October, the Boeing Company announced that it will lay off \nan estimated 30,000 commercial division workers. Approximately 80 \npercent of those workers are located in the State of Washington.\n  The first layoff of Boeing workers--nearly 4,000--occurred on \nDecember 14, and the company set a schedule of layoff notices for the \nfollowing months that predicted twelve-to-fourteen hundred job cuts per \nmonth through June of this year.\n  But it does not stop there. We have seen from previous recessions \nthat when a Boeing worker is laid off, approximately two more jobs are \nlost further down the supply line.\n  So where does that leave us? When all is said and done, we will \nprobably have at least 40,000 layoffs in our State that will be \nattributable to the events surrounding September 11. Some projections \nsuggest that the number may go as high as 65,000.\n  I mentioned previously our statewide unemployment rate of 7.5 \npercent, but even more unsettling is the fact that 14 of Washington's \n39 counties have unemployment rates above 10 percent. In Ferry County, \nwe are facing 15.1 percent unemployment. That same figure is \n13.3 percent in Franklin County, 16.8 percent in Adams, 12.1 in Chelan, \n11.5 percent in Grays Harbor, and the topper is 17.1 percent in \nKlickitat.\n\n  If this is not an emergency, I do not know what is.\n  That is why we have insisted, for months now that the Senate pass a \nsimple unemployment insurance extension of at least 13 weeks.\n  It is extremely disconcerting for me to know that so many workers \ndisplaced after September 11 have already reached or are nearing the \nend of their benefits eligibility. Since September 11, about 1.3 \nmillion workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits throughout \nthis Nation. In Washington State alone, more than 42,000 workers \nexhausted UI claims from September 11 through the beginning of March.\n  And at the same time, heavily affected States and workforce areas \nthroughout this Nation are running out of training dollars.\n  That is why I and my colleagues have fought for emergency training \ndollars; that is why we have fought against cuts in WIA funding that \nwere proposed in budget; and why we have fought for this temporary \nextension in UI benefits.\n  This is about giving workers a chance to get back on their feet. It \nshould also be our priority to invest in training those workers, so \nthat we'll be ready with the highest-skilled workforce when we get the \neconomy jump-started again.\n  My State has taken an aggressive approach to retraining our \nworkforce, and has invested State dollars to provide the necessary \nsupport for displaced workers to put food on the table while they get \nskills training.\n  This is the direction that our Nation should be heading--and it is \none that we should be encouraging as we finally take this step to get \nthe federal aid to the States. With the help of the majority leader in \nFebruary, we were able to pass a clean 13-week unemployment benefit \nextension that took into account the unique situation of States that \nhave aggressively worked to provide more substantial benefits for \ndisplaced workers. The majority leader and his staff have been \ntremendously helpful in recognizing these concerns and ensuring that we \nwere providing the maximum assistance to all States.\n  I want to be clear, I am extremely pleased that the House has finally \ncome to the conclusion that workers are desperate for this 13-week \nfederal support, and has finally set politics aside to do the right \nthing for our workers, and our Nation as a whole.\n  I have worked to ensure that the language of this legislation is \nconsistent with the extended benefits offered by our State--so that one \nof the most heavily impacted States in the Nation is able to fully \nbenefit from what we are doing today.\n  I understand that the Department of Labor has promised to provide a \nletter of interpretation of the House-passed legislation that is \nexpected to clarify\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nthese issues, and specifically, the technical order of benefits that \nworkers will be expected to receive. I urge the Secretary to get this \nassurance to us immediately, so that our State can plan to meet the \nneeds of workers who have exhausted or will soon exhaust their \nbenefits.\n  It was my intent, and I understand it was the expressed intent of the \ndrafters in the House, to provide the 13-week temporary federal UI \nbenefit immediately after the expiration of regular State unemployment \ninsurance benefits--which is typically 26 weeks.\n  While I am disappointed that the House language is not explicitly \nclear on this matter, as was the Senate bill, I am pleased to hear that \nthe Department understands our intent and will reportedly carry out \nthese provisions in keeping with that intent.\n  I will be watching to ensure that the Secretary follows through on \nthis commitment and puts the Department's priority where it should be--\non providing as much assistance as possible to the areas of this Nation \nthat desperately need it--and to provide it in a timeframe that truly \nreflects the urgency of the situation.\n  Again, I appreciate the phenomenal work of the majority leader and \nthe entire Senate in doing its work on this bill months ago; and now \nthat the House has finally come to the table, I urge that we move \nquickly to get it enacted and get extended benefits out to workers who \nneed it most.\n  Finally, I will add that I am pleased with the targeted business tax \nincentives contained in this stimulus package. By providing both bonus \ndepreciation for capital investments, and increased write-offs for \nbusiness losses, we encourage economic expansion and development. By \ngiving workers the resources to invest in themselves through training, \neducation and health care, we provide the means for this expansion.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this package contains the so-called \ntax extenders that promote research and development across so many \nindustries in our country.\n  The country is at an economic crossroads and the choices we make \ntoday will affect us for years. We must maintain our fiscal discipline \nand invest in the nation's future business, education and worker needs.\n  The package we are approving today invests in the next generation of \nour economy as businesses recover from the weakened economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1701-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1701-S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ECONOMIC STIMULUS IN THE NORTHWEST\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from the \nState of Washington to impress on this body just how important elements \nof this legislation are to the workers in the Pacific Northwest and the \nNation.\n  As my colleagues know, Washington and Oregon have the highest \nunemployment rates in the Nation right now.\n  The economy of the Northwest has been struggling for some time and \nSeptember 11 only made things worse.\n  Last year, Boeing, Washington's largest employer, announced they \nwould be cutting 30,000 jobs within a year. Most of those jobs would be \nout of Washington State. To date, 10,000 dedicated Boeing workers have \nbeen handed their pink slips. That number doesn't include the thousands \nof jobs that are being lost by those dependent on Boeing.\n  Washington State is also a high-tech dependent State. The downturn in \nthat sector has left many in the Northwest without a job.\n  These massive lay-offs, uncertainty in the economy, and fear of \nanother terrorist attack have crippled the economies of the Northwest.\n  We are expecting that the layoffs may reach 40 to 65,000 by the end \nof this year.\n  So the importance of the legislation is paramount--but the devil's in \nthe details--and so we have worked to make sure that the language \npassed by the House will provide the maximum stimulus possible to \nworkers throughout this Nation.\n  My colleague, Senator Cantwell, has been diligent in monitoring this \nlegislation and we have worked in tandem to ensure that States in such \ngreat need do not have their support decreased because those States \nhave proactively made efforts to provide extended benefits to workers \nin advance of the passage of this legislation.\n  I understand that the majority leader has agreed to engage in a \ncolloquy on this matter with myself and Senator Cantwell so that we may \nclarify that the legislation will, in fact, have it's intended \nstimulative impact on our State.\n  At this time, I yield back to the majority leader and look forward to \nhis response.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If the majority leader yield for a question, I thank \nthe majority leader and my colleague Senator Murray.\n  I am pleased to join her in support of this legislation.\n  My colleague shares my concern over the serious situation in our \nState and throughout the Northwest. In Washington State alone 42,070 \nworkers exhausted UI claims from September 11 through the beginning of \nMarch; and 14 of Washington's 39 counties have unemployment rates above \nten percent.\n  If this is not an emergency, I do not know what is.\n  That's why we have insisted for months now that the Senate pass a \nsimple unemployment insurance extension of at least 13 weeks.\n  But, we do want to make explicitly clear how the bill will conform \nwith state laws providing extended benefits, so that we preserve the \nintended purpose of this legislation.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how pleased this Senator is to have this \nlegislation is finally approaching enactment. I am extremely pleased \nthat the House has finally come to the conclusion that need this 13-\nweek Federal support, and has finally decided to do the right thing for \nour workers, and our nation as a whole.\n  But we have meticulously worked to ensure that the language of this \nlegislation would conform with the extended benefits offered by our \nState, so that one of the most heavily impacted States in the nation is \nable to fully benefit from what we're doing today.\n  The distinguished majority leader worked very hard with us last year \nand earlier this year to craft language that would achieve this \npurpose. The language passed by this body in February made very clear \nthat the temporary federal benefits would begin immediately after the \n26th week, across the board. The UI provision is crafted in a less \nclear manner in the House bill, but I am aware that the House Ways and \nMeans chairman yesterday expressed his intent in drafting that language \nthat the federal benefit would begin before wholly State-financed \nbenefits.\n  We understand that the Department of Labor has promised to provide a \nletter of interpretation of the House-passed legislation that is \nexpected to clarify these issues, and specifically, the technical order \nof benefits that workers will be expected to receive. This Senator \nurges the Secretary to get this assurance to us immediately, so that \nStates can adequately plan to meet the needs of workers who have \nexhausted or will soon exhaust their benefits.\n  While I am disappointed that the House language is not explicitly \nclear on this matter, as was the Senate bill, I am pleased to hear that \nthe Department understands this intent and will interpret the language \naccordingly.\n  We will closely be watching to ensure that the Secretary follows \nthrough on this commitment and puts the Department's priority where it \nshould be--on providing as much assistance as possible to the areas of \nthis Nation that desperately need it--and to providing it in a time \nframe that truly reflects the urgency of the situation.\n\n  Again, I appreciate the phenomenal work of the majority leader and \nthe entire Senate in doing its work on this bill months ago; and now \nthat the House has finally come to the table, I urge that we move \nquickly to get it enacted and get extended benefits out to workers who \nneed it most.\n  At this time I ask the distinguished majority leader if it is his \nunderstanding that the intent of this legislation was to provide a \nFederal benefit immediately after regular state UI benefits, and I will \nyield back for his response.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is exactly right, that is the intent of the \nlegislation.\n  As I understand it, the House chairman did clarify yesterday that his \nintent in drafting the legislation conformed to the Senator's view that \nthe\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nfederal benefit start before any state-financed extended benefit.\n  As the Senators from Washington know, the Senate put forward a bill \nin February that provided a simple 13-week extension to all States, \nwhich would begin immediately after the exhaustion of regular UI \nbenefits.\n  There are a number of States that did act in providing State-financed \nextended benefits before the House finally agreed to send us this \ncompromise legislation, and those States deserve the maximum federal \nbenefit.\n  This is about giving workers a chance to get back on their feet.\n  We have worked hard to recognize the technical concerns of the \nSenators from Washington and ensure that we were providing the maximum \nassistance to all States.\n  So I will say clearly that it was the Congress' intent to provide the \nfederal benefit immediately after regular UI and I will work with the \nSenators to ensure that the Department conforms with that intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1702-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INCOME FORECAST METHOD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, regarding a tax \nissue that I had hoped to clarify as part of this legislation, which \nwill have serious economic ramifications for several important \nindustries.\n  Recently, some uncertainty has arisen regarding the proper tax \ntreatment of residuals and participations under the income forecast \nmethod of depreciation. I would ask the distinguished chairman and \nranking member if they could clarify this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit held in Transamerica Corporation v U.S. that, for purposes of \nthe income forecast depreciation method, the anticipated cost of \nparticipations and residuals should be included in a property's cost \nbasis at the beginning of the property's depreciable life.\n  As the Ninth Circuit determined in Transamerica, inclusion of \nparticipations and residuals in a property's initial cost basis is \nnecessary to properly match the income and expenses associated with the \nproperty and to clearly reflect income. Yet, it is my understanding \nthat the IRS is not currently permitting such treatment. To eliminate \nthe current uncertainty, Senator Grassley and I have encouraged \nTreasury to consider regulations clarifying that participations and \nresiduals may be included in a property's initial cost basis for \npurposes of the income forecast method of depreciation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with Senator Baucus. Excluding participations \nand residuals from a property's initial depreciable cost basis under \nthe income forecast method results in a mismatching of income from the \nproperty and the expenses incurred in producing the property. The Ninth \nCircuit reached this conclusion in Transamerica. Moreover, I would note \nthat including participations and residuals in the initial depreciable \ncost basis is consistent with industry standards in computing income \nfor financial accounting purposes. We should remove this uncertainty to \navoid needless disputes and to ensure the accurate reflection of \ntaxpayers' income.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to thank both of my distinguished colleagues for \nthis important clarification. I understand that Treasury is considering \nthis issue currently as part of its 2001 Priority Guidance Plan. For \nthe record, I would note that Senators Baucus and Grassley previously \nsent a letter to Treasury Secretary O'Neill asking him to consider \nregulations that eliminate the current uncertainty by clarifying that \nparticipations and residuals may be included in a property's initial \ncost basis for purposes of the income forecast method of depreciation. \nI agree with my colleagues and urge Treasury to issue such regulations.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I completely agree with the previous \ncolloquy of my distinguished colleagues on the income forecast method \nof depreciation. The motion picture industry presently is facing a \nlegal cloud that has serious economic implications for the industry. \nThe cloud concerns the tax treatment of residual and participation \npayments under the income forecast method of accounting, the \npredominant method of accounting for the industry.\n  In 1993, the Ninth Circuit held in Transamerica Corporation v U.S. \nthat participations and residuals are included in the initial cost \nbasis of a property for purposes of the income forecast method. Yet, \ndespite this clear result, I understand that the Internal Revenue \nService is beginning to challenge that treatment. Simply put, this is \nwrong--as a matter of law, as a matter of policy, and as a matter of \nfairness.\n  The Transamerica decision continues to remain the proper result under \npresent law.

Mr. President, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act \nof 2002, being considered by the Senate today, contains an important \nprovision to extend the general net operating loss (``NOL'') carryback \nprovision to 5 years (from 2 years) for NOLs arising in taxable years \nending in 2001 and 2002. The Joint Committee on Taxation's Technical \nExplanation of the Act contains a footnote indicating that the NOL \nprovision ``does not affect the terms and conditions that the Internal \nRevenue Service may impose on a taxpayer seeking approval for a change \nin its annual accounting period.''\n  I want to clarify with the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, that this footnote was not intended to limit \nthe Internal Revenue Service's authority to alter or modify the terms \nand conditions that may have been imposed on taxpayers that had already \nreceived permission to change accounting periods, particularly under \ncircumstances where the events of September 11, 2001, have resulted in \nunanticipated and severe hardships, and the waiver or modification \nwould not result in the planning activity that the NOL Condition was \nintended to prevent.\n  Specifically, I want to clarify that the IRS has authority to permit \nan NOL incurred in a short taxable year to be carried back \nnotwithstanding that the taxpayer may have agreed as a condition to \nsecuring the change to carry over the NOL only to future years.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would agree that the relevant footnote merely restates \nthe Internal Revenue Service's present authority, and is not intended \nto limit that authority in cases where modification of an approval is \nsought, and such a modification would be consistent with the \ngovernment's overall response to September 11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1702-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                AIRCRAFT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, if you were to walk past the driveway \nat 222 West Micheltorena Street in Santa Barbara, California today you \nwould see a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles. On a tree \nnearby, you\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nwould also see a note that reads, ``United We Stand. Never be \nforgotten. Always to be loved. A symbol of silence that needs to be \nbroken.''\n  That memorial has been erected outside the home of Clinton Scott \nRisetter, 37, the victim of a hate crime.\n  On February 24, 2002, Clint Risetter awoke in his apartment engulfed \nin flames and then tried to escape as he was burning. When firefighters \narrived, they found him dead on his patio. Two days later, Martin \nThomas Hartmann walked into the Santa Barbara Police Department and \nadmitted to entering Clint's apartment, pouring gasoline on him as he \nslept, and then setting him on fire.\n  Martin Hartmann had known Clint for several months but had learned \njust recently that Clint was gay. He told police about his hatred \ntoward gays and how he ``. . . decided to put [Clint] out of his \nmisery,'' because he was gay. He believed that he was doing the right \nthing and that Clint deserved to die.\n  The note on the tree outside Clint Risetter's apartment expresses not \nonly the views of its author, but also the views of the more than 500 \npeople that joined together Monday night in Santa Barbara to light \ncandles in a vigil for Clint. One of the vigil's attendees, Russ \nChaffin, said, ``I can't be silent. This is my community. I cannot \nstand it that something like this could happen in my community.''\n  I simply cannot stand silent when such a violent act is committed \nagainst an innocent person. I was deeply saddened and disturbed to hear \nthe horrific details of Clint's death. It's hard for me to imagine a \nmore heinous act of hatred than to set another human being on fire. \nUnfortunately, Clint's death is characteristic of many hate crimes in \nAmerica; where an attacker repeatedly beats, stabs or severely burns \nhis victim as if he is removing whatever it is he hates out of the \nperson. And the attacker feels justified in doing so, as if he is doing \na great service to humanity by killing the person.\n  In California, I have seen, first-hand, the devastating impact hate \ncrimes have on victims, their families and their communities. A hate \ncrime divides neighborhoods and breeds a sense of mistrust and fear \nwithin a community, just like it has in Santa Barbara. This is why I \nhave long supported legislation aimed at protecting citizens from \ncrimes based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, or \nsexual orientation.\n  According to the FBI's latest statistics, hate crimes based on sexual \norientation rose every year between 1994 and 2000. Yet, current Federal \nhate crimes law does not include crimes against others because of \nsexual orientation. It only covers crimes motivated by bias on the \nbasis of race, color, religion or national origin. The current law also \nlimits Federal hate crime prosecutions to instances in which the victim \nwas targeted because he or she was exercising one of six narrowly \ndefined federally-protected activities, such as serving on a jury, \nvoting, attending a public school, eating at a restaurant or lodging at \na hotel.\n  The limitations of current law prevent it from reaching many cases \nwhere individuals are killed or injured by just walking down the \nstreet, or, as we have now seen, even sleeping in their own homes. It \ndoes not extend basic civil rights protections to every American, only \nto a few and under certain circumstances. Updating the current law \nwould not provide special rights, it would ensure equal protection.\n  ``The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001,'' legislation of which I am \nan original cosponsor, would expand current Federal protections against \nhate crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin; amend \nthe criminal code to cover hate crimes based on gender, disability, and \nsexual orientation; authorize grants for State and local programs \ndesigned to combat and prevent hate crimes; and enable the federal \ngovernment to assist State and local law enforcement in investigating \nand prosecuting hate crimes.\n  Final passage of ``The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001,'' is long \noverdue. It is necessary for the safety and well being of millions of \nAmericans. No American should have to live in fear because of his or \nher disability. No American should be afraid to walk down the street \nfor fear of a gender-motivated attack. And certainly, no American \nshould be afraid to sleep in their own home because of his or her \nsexual orientation.\n  We have had strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the \npast, and it continues to receive bipartisan support. We just have not \nbeen able to get it to the President's desk for his consideration. \nToday, I ask all of my colleagues to work to ensure that this \nlegislation is not simply supported, but actually gets passed and \nsigned into law. Let's send a signal to Clint Risetter's family, and to \nall Americans, that our nation will no longer turn a blind eye to hate \ncrimes in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1703-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF SHERIFF STEPHEN FITZGERALD TO BE U.S. MARSHAL FOR THE \n                     WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize five \nathletes who recently represented our Nation at the 19th Winter Olympic \nGames in Salt Lake City.\n  While the accomplishments of these competitors are exceptional by any \nmeasure, this group deserves special recognition; that's because \nGarrett Hines, Derek Parra, Jennifer Rodriguez, Brian Shimer and Chris \nThorpe are Floridians. For the record, Florida sees snow a little more \noften than once every ice age, and the State's highest mountain is but \na bunny hill compared to the terrain these athletes saw in Utah.\n  Nevertheless, these five Floridians won seven medals in the luge, the \nbobsled and on the speed skating oval.\n  Garrett Hines, along with teammate Randy Jones, became the first \nblack American males to win a medal in the Winter Olympics, as the \nUnited States took silver in the four-man bobsled. Garrett is the pride \nof Sanford, FL, and I'd like to wish him luck in his future endeavors.\n  Similarly, Derek Parra achieved a barrier-breaking milestone, \nbecoming the first Hispanic American to medal in the Winter Olympics as \nhe won both a gold and silver in speed skating.\n  These two pioneers have left a lasting mark on their sports, and I am \nproud to call them Floridians.\n  Also, Jennifer Rodriguez, known as ``Miami Ice,'' showed the world \nthat South Florida has a place on the Winter Olympic map. After \nbecoming the first Hispanic American to compete for the United States \nWinter Olympic Team during the 1998 Games in Japan, Rodriguez not only \ncompeted in Salt Lake City, she won two speed skating bronze medals.\n  Brian Shimer continued the South Florida success, as the Naples \nnative took home a bronze in the four-man bobsled. This five-time \nOlympian had never before won a medal, but as the driver in this year's \nbronze medal winning sled, he has realized a career-long goal.\n  Finally, Daytona Beach resident Chris Thorpe, added a bronze medal in \ndoubles luge to the silver he won four years ago in the Nagano Games. \nChris has said this will be his last Olympics, and I'd like to wish him \nluck as he finishes his undergraduate degree at the University of \nFlorida, Gainesville.\n  I applaud the commitment these athletes have shown in reaching the \npinnacle of their respective sports, and I hope their willingness to \nsacrifice and their determination to succeed motivates all Americans to \nexceed expectations and achieve the extraordinary.\n  I would ask to have printed in the Record the names and hometowns of\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nthese five athletes, along with the events they competed in and the \nmedals they won.

I \nhad the good fortune to serve with Senator Cannon for most of his four \nterms, and what set him above in my eyes was that he came from the \nschool that the Senate is an institution where people get things done. \nHad it not been for this courageous vote to end a filibuster in 1964, \nthe landmark civil rights legislation that has so dramatically changed \nthis country would never have gotten to the Senate floor.\n  It is almost 20 years since he left the Commerce Committee, and I \nfind his shoes are still difficult to fill. We called him Mr. Aviation \nbecause he ended 40 years of federal control over the airlines. Had it \nnot been for his interest in water projects and basic infrastructure, \nLas Vegas would not have had the phenomenal growth it has seen.\n  No question, it is hard to find a Senator in the last half century \nwhose loyalty to his convictions has made more lasting contributions to \nour nation and to his state. We will miss him.\n  My wife Peatsy, and I want to express our deepest sympathy to his \ncharming wife, Dorothy, and to their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1704-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

A gay man, Alexander Paul Nicholai, 45, was stabbed \nto death in his apartment. The attacker, Kenneth J. Washington, 21, who \nclaimed he was defending himself against unwanted sexual advances, was \ncharged with first-degree murder in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1704-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE IMPORTANCE OF ENFORCING GUN LAWS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, sadly another gun tragedy occurred \nin my State this past Tuesday in Mount Pleasant, MI when three people \nwere shot and killed allegedly by the ex-husband of one of them. \nAccording to a Detroit Free Press article, the man had a recent \ndomestic violence conviction. This case illustrates the importance of \nclosing the loopholes in our gun laws and preventing domestic violence \noffenders from owning firearms.\n  According to a Violence Policy Center analysis, a woman is 14 times \nmore likely to be murdered by a spouse, intimate acquaintance or close \nrelative if there was a history of domestic violence. Having one or \nmore guns in the home makes a woman more than seven times more likely \nto be the victim of homicide.\n  Current law prohibits the possession of firearms by any person \nconvicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and prohibits the \nsale of any firearm or ammunition to a person convicted of domestic \nviolence. But we have to do more to prevent women from being victims of \ngun violence.\n  First, we must continue to fund the National Criminal History \nImprovement Program, which assists States in compiling criminal records \nand establishing identification systems for Brady gun background \nchecks. In addition, we need to act now to close the gun show loophole \nand keep domestic abusers and other criminals from buying weapons at \ngun shows. These critical steps will help make America safer by \nensuring that the criminal background information is accurate and \naccessible and make it tougher for those with a domestic violence \nconviction to obtain a firearm by easily bypassing a background \ncheck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1704-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1704-S1705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN HONOR OF HADASSAH'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CORZINE. I rise today to pay tribute to Hadassah, the \nWomen's Zionist Organization of America, on the occasion of their 90th \nanniversary. Founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold and a small study \ncircle of American women, Hadassah was committed to bringing modern \nhealth care to the Holy Land. It has since grown to become the largest \nJewish and largest women's membership organization in the nation.\n  In 1913, this fledgling organization sent two public health nurses to \nJerusalem to set up a maternity clinic and treatment center for women \nand children. A short 27 years later, Hadassah established the Hadassah \nHospital on Mt. Scopus. Since that auspicious milestone, Hadassah has \nbecome a leading force in providing for Israel's medical needs, opening \nvarious clinics across the country and a new center of medical \nexcellence, the world-renowned Ein Karem Hospital. I had the chance to \npersonally visit the Hadassah facilities when I was in Israel last \nAugust, and to see first hand the care and compassion that are provided \non a daily basis to anyone in need regardless of race, color, creed, or \nnational origin. Hadassah hospitals, in addition to serving as a model \nof peaceful coexistence in the Middle East, provide state-of-the-art \nhealth services ranging from emergency attention to long-term care to \nmore than 600,000 patients a year.\n  As its first national domestic effort, Hadassah women sold $200 \nmillion in World War II bonds--a remarkable accomplishment by any \nstandard. After Pearl Harbor, Hadassah mobilized its members to aid the \nwar effort by beginning a blood bank and donating supplies. Their work \ncontinues in the United States through voter registration drives, \ngrassroots advocacy on United States-Israel relations, volunteering in \ndomestic violence shelters, and numerous other humanitarian efforts.\n  Another key component of Hadassah's mission is education. Through the \nCollege of Technology, the Career Counseling Institute, and Youth \nVillages, and in the United States through Young Judaca and the \nHadassah Leadership Academy, they accomplish their goal to provide the \npeople of Israel with quality educational programs and learning \nopportunities.\n  Ninety years later, the Hadassah Foundation remains true to its \noriginal mission and is dedicated to--improving the status, health and \nwell being of women and girls; bringing their contributions, issues and \nneeds from the margins to the center of Jewish concern; and encouraging \nand facilitating active participation in decisionmaking and in \nleadership in all spheres of life. Their strength comes from action. \nAnd their actions bring to their sisters, to their homeland, and to our \nNation the precious gifts of health, education, and the power of hope. \nAs Hadassah looks toward the next century, they see continued \npioneering, continued progress, and continued innovation in health care \nin Israel, while continuing to share their knowledge and experience for \nthe benefit of mankind.\n  For the services they have provided to Israel and across the globe, \nand for their dedication to the well-being of their community, I offer \nmy sincere congratulations to Hadassah for 90 years of providing the \nadage that together we can make a difference and\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\ntogether we can change people's lives.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I come \nto the floor today to speak about the courageous and heroic acts of a \ndear friend and constituent, Defense Protective Service Officer Isaac \nHo'opi'i. I have always said that Hawaii is a unique place not because \nof its beauty, but because of its people. The people of Hawaii share a \nspecial attitude, which has been referred to as the ``Aloha spirit.'' \nAloha in Hawaiian has a number of meanings, including love. The Aloha \nspirit can best be explained as the love of others and is illustrated \nthrough acts of kindness. Isaac Ho'opi'i exemplifies and lives the \nAloha spirit.\n  I rise today to honor the actions of Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i, who was \nawarded the Office of Secretary Medal of Valor for his efforts in \nresponding to the tragedy at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. There \nhave been a number of news articles and television segments recounting \nIsaac's heroic actions in the wake of tragic events at the Pentagon on \nSeptember 11.\n  Isaac is most well-known as ``the voice'' in the dark smoke, moments \nafter Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, calling for anyone who was \nin the blackened, smoke-filled corridors to come toward his voice. \nSeven people responded to his calls to head toward his voice and were \nguided safely out of the burning Pentagon on September 11. Isaac also \nphysically carried at least eight individuals out of the burning \nbuilding on that fateful day. He and his K-9 partner, Vito, worked 36 \nhours straight immediately after the plane crashed into the Pentagon--\nthey have continued on 12-hour shifts since.\n  I was honored to attend the Medal of Valor ceremonies on Tuesday \nafternoon at the Pentagon. I witnessed Isaac receiving the Medal of \nValor, the highest award in the Department of Defense for a civilian. \n38 other individuals also received the award on Tuesday, and I salute \ntheir brave acts as well.\n  Isaac, born and raised in Hawaii, has lived in Washington, D.C., for \nthe past twelve years and has spent the last five years as a member of \nthe Defense Protective Service. I have known Isaac for over 12 years. I \nfirst met him when I was a member of the House of Representatives. My \nfamily and I have spent time with Isaac and his family, his wife Gigi, \nand their children, Emily, Bess, and Jeff, on many occasions.\n  When I spoke to him after September 11, and discussed his split-\nsecond decision to respond to the burning Pentagon with little concern \nfor his personal safety, I asked him how he felt. He modestly \ndiscounted his heroic actions. I was told by others that Isaac felt \nbadly after September 11, because he felt that he should have been able \nto help more people. I am sure that those 15 people who he personally \nhelped out of the Pentagon, and their families, are very thankful for \nhis quick thinking and willingness to risk his life. His own wife and \nfamily had no idea about his safety on September 11, because of his \nimmediate response to the site.\n  Isaac is a man who is always willing to help others. During the \nawards ceremony, Mr. Paul Haselbush, Director of the Real Estate and \nFacilities Directorate, mentioned a letter he received from a woman who \nhad been stranded on the road with a flat tire for three hours in the \ncold. She wrote to the Department of Defense to thank the Defense \nProtective Service for the actions of Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i, who saw \nher stranded on the road, stopped to help her, and fixed her flat tire. \nWhen she saw his name, she recognized Isaac as ``the voice'' that she \nhad read about in the newspaper who had saved some of the people in the \nPentagon on September 11th.\n  In November of last year, Isaac went home to Hawaii for a family \nvacation. Isaac took one week of his vacation to talk to students in \nschools, not about his heroic acts, but about the events of September \n11th and to answer their questions about why terrorists would attack \nthe United States. I asked Isaac why he spoke with the students. He \ntold me that he wanted to inspire them to reach out for their goals and \ndreams--that if he, a Native Hawaiian boy raised in Waianae could move \nto Washington, D.C., become successful by helping others and sharing \nthe Aloha Spirit, they could all do the same. He told me if he just \nreached one student his time would have been spent well. Isaac reached \nmore than one student.

A bill to ensure that victims of domestic violence get the \nhelp they need in a single phone call, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today along with Senators Collins, \nKennedy, DeWine and Bayh, I am proud to introduce the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline Enhancement Act. Modeled after the Day One project in \nMinnesota, the Act would create a web site that would allow National \nDomestic Violence Hotline operators, shelter based advocates and \nrelevant State and local domestic violence service providers around the \ncountry to more quickly and easily find the most appropriate shelter \nfor families seeking safety from abuse. The highly secure and \nconfidential web site would keep a continuously updated, nationwide \nlist of available shelter for victims of domestic violence and their \nfamilies. It would also make available to the Hotline and to advocates \ninformation about services and facilities offered by these shelters, \nsuch as language, disability, transportation and children's services.\n  In doing so, the new site would ensure that whenever a woman calls \nthe Hotline or a shelter seeking help, the operator can immediately \ncheck the web site, get an up-to-the-minute listing of available \nshelters and services around the country, then, place the caller in the \nmost appropriate shelter to meet her family's needs for safety, \nlocation, language and other services without the caller ever having to \nhang up the phone. The web site will ensure that during one of the most \nstressful and dangerous times of their lives, victims of domestic \nviolence and their families can get the help they need in a single, \neasy phone call.\n  Minnesota's Day One Program, which is the model for this bill, has \nrun a highly successful, confidential web site that links every shelter \nin Minnesota. Day One has shown what profound benefits this new \ntechnology can bring to the lives of battered women and their children. \nIt has broken down barriers families face in their first attempts to \nfind safety, resulting in faster, more appropriate placements. In fact, \nDay One reports that 90 percent of women and children who call are \nassured services and shelter in a single call. In other words, when and \nwhere they need them most. This is critical since needing to make and \nreceive multiple followup calls to find the most appropriate shelter \nhas been a major barrier for women trying to escape an unsafe \nsituation.\n  The website helps ensure that women and children are placed in \nshelters that are best for them, whether that means shelters that are \nnear transportation or a school, shelters that provide language or \ndisability services, or shelters that have special programs for \nchildren. Finding shelter in a place where families can get the unique \nsupports that they need also overcomes more of the traditional \nobstacles to safety.\n  Having an online network of shelters also allows survivors and their \nchildren to relocate to a broader number of areas in the state so that \nthey can be as safe as possible from their batterer, if that is \nnecessary.\n  The Network also benefits families because it benefits the service \nproviders who help families. The new technology has saved staff time by \nreducing the number of calls staff has to make to find the best \nplacement for clients. The web site has also opened lines of \ncommunication between shelters in Minnesota and has allowed a better \nsharing of needs and ideas which has led to better relationships and \ncooperation between shelters. Further, it has led to expanded \ndocumentation of occupancy rates and services needed and provided in \nMinnesota. In a survey of Minnesota shelters, 95 percent of respondents \nsaid that their experience with Day One is ``excellent.'' All of this \nmeans better service for battered women and their families.\n  We have used the most advanced technology to improve education, \nscience, medicine and almost every aspect of our lives. None of us can \nhave failed to recognize the powerful change the Internet has brought \nto our society. None of us can deny that we must embrace this change \nand use it to our greatest advantage. The National Domestic Violence \nHotline Enhancement Act now will apply America's newest and best \ntechnology to help solve one of our nation's oldest, most confounding \nand brutal problems, domestic violence. This move is long overdue. The \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence estimates that only 43 \npercent of shelters in the United States have Internet access, leaving \nwell over half of all shelters without services the rest of us have \ncome to think of as routine. In linking the shelters on an electronic \nnetwork, this bill would help every shelter in the country have \nInternet access. It gives us the opportunity to use one of the \ncentury's greatest advances to save the lives of women and children.\n  Last year at least 32 women and 10 children were murdered as a result \nof domestic violence in Minnesota. Across the Nation, a woman is \nbattered every 15 seconds. Three to 10 million children nationally are \nestimated to witness domestic violence each year, 70 percent of whom \nare abused themselves. Domestic Violence is in all of our communities. \nDespite its pervasiveness, there is still nowhere where violence is \nmore isolated from view, more difficult to combat and more far reaching \nin its impact than violence in the home. It is a problem we cannot \nafford to ignore. People who will try to keep family violence quiet and \nhidden behind the walls of the home ignore its tragic echoes in our \nschools, in the workplace and on the streets.\n  I do not want to hear one more story about a woman being murdered by \nher husband or by her boyfriend. I do not want to hear one more story \nabout a woman being beaten, or her child fighting in school because he \nsaw fighting in his home.\n  If we are going to put an end to this horrible pattern, we must put \nan end to the pattern where women seek shelter, but give up in \nfrustration when they find none. We must put an end to the pattern that \none quarter of homeless people on any given night are victims of \ndomestic violence and their children. This bill is one step in that \ndirection.\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n  Over the past six years, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has \nreceived over 500,000 calls from women and children in danger from \nabuse. If we ensure that a web site similar to the one in Minnesota \nwere made available to all of these families seeking help, so that \nwomen can get shelter and services when and where they need it, we \ncould take a strong step to ensuring the safety and well being of \nhundreds of thousands of families fleeing domestic violence around the \ncountry. Technology gives us the tools to help undo one of the greatest \nwrongs we confront as a society. We cannot turn our backs on this \nopportunity. I urge my colleagues' support of this important \nlegislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I join Senators Wellstone, Kennedy, \nDeWine, and Bayh in introducing the National Domestic Violence Hotline \nEnhancement Act. This legislation would authorize the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to oversee the creation of a secure web site \nthat would link every domestic violence shelter and service provider in \nthe United States and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n  The objective is to enable victims of domestic violence and their \nfamilies who are seeking safety from abuse to more quickly and easily \nfind the shelter and other services they so desperately need. The \nsecure and confidential web site would keep a continuously updated, \nnationwide list of available shelter and services, such as \ntransportation and children's services, for victims of domestic \nviolence and their families.\n  Once the web site is operational, whenever a woman calls the Hotline, \na shelter or other domestic violence project, the operator can \nimmediately check the site and get an up-to-date listing of available \nshelters and services around the country. With a single phone call, a \nvictim of domestic violence and her family can be placed in the most \nappropriate shelter to meet their needs or more quickly obtain the \nother services that will enable them to escape a dangerous situation.\n  Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women in the \nUnited States. In this country, a woman is battered every 15 seconds. \nIt is estimated that one in five women admitted to emergency rooms is \nthere due to battering. Almost one-third of the American women murdered \neach year are killed by their current or former partners, usually a \nhusband. In the State of Maine, the overall crime rate dropped by 12 \npercent in 2000, but domestic violence reports increased by 12.5 \npercent. It is the leading cause of murder in Maine, resulting in over \nhalf the state's homicides.\n  Even when children aren't the target of family violence, those who \nwitness abuse in their homes do not escape unscathed. Tragically, they \ntoo are victims, with effects that can include physical, psychological \nand behavioral problems. Moreover, many of the millions of children who \nsuffer or witness abuse in their homes grow up to perpetuate the legacy \nof family violence. A report by the American Psychological Association \nfound that a ``child's exposure to the father abusing the mother is the \nstrongest risk for transmitting violent behavior from one generation to \nthe next.''\n  According to one estimate by the American Medical Association, \ndomestic violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in \nmedical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, \nsick leave, absenteeism, and nonproductivity. Add the untold costs in \nsuffering and destroyed lives caused by domestic abuse, and the need to \nmore effectively intervene and break the cycle of violence becomes even \nmore compelling.\n  Information technology has improved many aspects of our lives in \nrecent years, and it is time we used advances in technology to help \nvictims and break the cycle of domestic violence. The National Domestic \nViolence Hotline Enhancement Act will do just that by more effectively \nhelping women and children escape unsafe and violent situations.\n  To achieve the goal of linking the National Domestic Violence Hotline \nand every domestic violence shelter and service provider on an \nelectronic network, the legislation authorizes the use of funds to \nprovide Internet access and training to shelters that currently do not \nhave the necessary technology. This is a critical element of the bill \nbecause only 43 percent of shelters in the United States have Internet \naccess, leaving over half of all shelters without services that many of \nus now take for granted.\n  The National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act would create a \nnational domestic violence website and secure network, and it will give \nservice providers the tools to both contribute to and benefit from that \nnetwork. By doing so, the bill would help ensure that hundreds of \nthousands of women and children in need of help to escape violence will \nfind the safety and well-being they deserve. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. McCain, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2003. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \napplicability of the prohibition on assignment of veterans benefits to \nagreements regarding future receipt of compensation, pension, or \ndependency and indemnity compensation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, on \nbehalf of Senators John McCain, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Breaux, and Mr. Johnson, to protect our veterans from financial \npredators who offer ``instant cash'' in exchange for future pensions or \ndisability pay.\n  Current law prohibits the direct sale of a veteran's pension or \ndisability benefits. These payments are a tax-free, monthly check from \nthe government, meant to provide important financial support to \nveterans who were disabled or wounded in service to our country. In the \nState of Florida alone, 245,000 veterans or their survivors received \nsuch compensation last year; and the Department of Veterans Affairs \npaid out nearly $21.3 billion nationwide.\n  To get this pot of money, some companies have used a loophole that \nenables them to enter into contract with veterans and offer them \n``instant cash'' in exchange for future benefits.\n  These contracts require veterans to sign away their disability \nbenefits or pensions for a certain period, often 8 years. In exchange, \ncompanies give them a lump-sum cash payment, typically valued at only \n30 cents per dollar and in certain cases, companies require veterans to \nput up collateral, such as taking out a life insurance policy, \npotentially leaving a veteran's family out in the cold.\n  The VA has called this practice a ``financial scam.'' The VA \nInspector General says: ``These schemes seem to target the most \nfinancially desperate veterans who are the most vulnerable. For many \nunsuspecting veterans, these benefit buyouts could be financially \ndevastating.'' In one case, a veteran received a lump total of $73,000 \nin return for his monthly benefit checks of $2,700 over 10 years. An \nannual interest rate of 28.5 percent.\n  I find this practice reprehensible. The intent of the law that \nprohibits the assignment of a veteran's benefits is being skirted. My \nbill expands the definition of assignment of benefits and makes a \nviolation punishable by a stiff fine, and up to 1 year in jail.\n  The second part of my bill creates a 5-year education and outreach \ncampaign, through the VA, to provide information to veterans about what \nlegitimate financial services are available to them.\n  The Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nVietnam Veterans of America, and AMVETS have endorsed this bill. I look \nforward to having the support of this body as we move to better protect \nour veterans from ``instant cash'' and other financial schemes.\n  I would like to conclude with a comment from one of our country's \nveterans. ``. . . My pension isn't a lottery winning. It's an award \nfrom the American people for serving my country, and it's appalling to \nthink there are those out there that would rob you of this honor and \nsteal your future.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nwill commemorate the life of Crazy Horse. I submit this legislation \nalong with Senators Dorgan, Ben Nelson, Conrad, Bingaman, Baucus, \nDaschle, Campbell, and Feingold. Crazy Horse was a great leader of his \npeople, and the designation of September 6 will be the ultimate \ncommendation for his bravery and contribution to Native Americans.\n  Crazy Horse was born on Rapid Creek in 1843. He was killed when he \nwas only 34 years of age, September 6, 1877. He was stabbed in the back \nby a soldier at Fort Robinson, NE, while he was under U.S. Army \nprotection. During his life he was a great leader of his people. Crazy \nHorse was a warrior and a military genius. His battle strategies are \nstudied to this day at West Point.\n  Crazy Horse was bestowed with the honor of becoming a Shirt Wearer. \nThis honor is comparable to duties like that of the Secretary of State.\n  Crazy Horse defended his people and their way of life in the only \nmanner he knew, but only after he saw the treaty of 1868 broken. He \ntook to the warpath only after he saw his friend Conquering Bear \nkilled; only after he saw the failure of the government agents to bring \nrequired treaty guarantees such as food, clothing, shelter and \nnecessities for existence. In battle the Sioux war leader would rally \nhis warriors with the cry, ``It is a good day to fight--it is a good \nday to die.''\n  Throughout recent history, a memorial commemorating the life of this \ngreat warrior is under construction in my State of South Dakota. I \nwould like to take these efforts one step further and designate \nSeptember 6, 2002, the 125th anniversary of Crazy Horse's death, as \n``National Crazy Horse Day.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the commemoration of this great \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1709-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2992.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 223, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Biden, Boxer, Dodd, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 223), designating March 8, 2002, as \n     ``International Women's Day''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduced a Senate resolution \ndesignating March 8 as International Women's Day. A similar resolution \nwill be introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative \nSchakowsky with the support of the Women's Caucus. International \nWomen's Day was first observed in 1909, and since then it has provided \nan opportunity for us to take a moment to remember, celebrate and honor \nthe remarkable steps women have made in their fight for equality all \nover the globe. This year, Afghan women are the symbol of International \nWomen's Day. Afghan women are triumphant examples of women empowered \nand able to transform their lives.\n  We have much to admire in the courage and endurance of Aghan women. \nAfghan women withstood for more than 5 years systemic oppression by the \nTaliban. For more than 5 years, women in Afghanistan--solely because \nthey were women--were silenced, forbidden to enter public life, \nforbidden to be seen unaccompanied on city streets, forbidden to teach \nor attend schools, forbidden to seek health care and forbidden to work. \nIf women disobeyed, they were beaten. The threat of violence kept women \nquiet and compliant.\n  Since the downfall of the Taliban, the veil has lifted for women in \nAfghanistan. Today we see news clips of women walking the streets of \nKabul without burkas and girls learning to read in a city school. Women \nare resuming their jobs as teachers, government workers and doctors. \nThe Health Minister in the new interim government is a Tajik woman \nsurgeon from Kabul. There is a new Ministry of Women's Affairs led by \nDr. Sima Samar who is steadily pushing and pulling to restore women's \nrights. These are enormous strides to regain women's rights in \nAfghanistan and a testament to the strength of Afghan women.\n  The collaboration, persistence and support of international women's \ngroups to expose the Taliban's oppression should also be recognized. \nWhile the plight of Afghan women surfaced on the cover of American \nmagazines only this year, many women's groups have been working on the \nsituation for years--writing letters, pressing for action, and \nsupporting refugees. Indeed, in December, an incredible array of \ninternational women's groups gathered in Brussels from all over the \nworld to discuss and strategize ways to change Afghanistan. The \ninternational women's community understands that this is a long and \ncomplicated process for change, and they remain strongly beside Afghan \nwomen. International Women's Day gives us an opportunity to acknowledge \ntheir tireless efforts and achievements.\n  As we have seen in Afghanistan, an essential component to achieving \ngender equality is ending violence against women--an issue about which \nI care deeply. Women cannot fully participate in a society when they \nlive in fear of violence. Supporting International Women's Day means \nsupporting an end to violence against women.\n  Without a doubt, we must start in our living rooms. Unfortunately, \nthere is still much to be done in the United States. But steadily we \nare making significant improvements. According to United States Justice \nDepartment data, the overall rate of intimate partner violence against \nall females decreased a dramatic 41 percent between 1993 and 1999. I am \nproud to say that some of the improvements come directly from my bill, \nthe Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and its reauthorization in \n2000. We have transformed a ``private'' family matter into a serious, \npublic crime.\n  Now we are setting our sights on cultural changes and creating a \nsociety that has zero tolerance for violence against women. Men who hit \nor assault women must become the pariahs of our society. We need to \nteach our young men and boys that violence against girls is completely \nand utterly unacceptable. And then spread the word around the globe.\n  International Women's Day reminds us that as we are fighting to end \nviolence against women in America, we need to extend our reach, and \nfight violence against all women. The range of gender-related violence \nis staggering. It occurs in every segment of society, without regard \nfor class, color, ethnicity, or country. The violence includes honor \nkillings, sexual trafficking in women, dowry-related violence, female \ninfanticide, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Studies indicate \nthat 1 out of every 3 women in the world has been battered by an \nintimate partner. Data on rape indicates that as many as 1 in 5 women \nworldwide are victims of rape, with young women as the most frequent \ntargets. Women everywhere cannot fully participate in society until the \nviolence ends.\n  We will get there. Despite the threat of violence, women have made \nincredible strides. Worldwide, there is a closing gender gap in primary \nand secondary school education. In 1998, 8 percent of the world's \ncabinet ministers were women, compared to 4 percent in 1994. All over \nthe world women are actively engaged in the economy as workers, \nproducers, traders, managers, and owners. On International Women's Day \nlet us imagine what women can accomplish when they no longer fear \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that all of my colleagues join me to \nsupport this resolution to designate March 8 as International Women's \nDay, to celebrate the enormous progress of women and to reaffirm our \ncommitment to end violence and discrimination against women.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate \nInternational Women's Day. For nearly a century, women's groups \nworldwide have paused on this day to celebrate the achievements and \ncontributions of women around the globe. It is a special occasion to \nremember the progress women have made and to reflect upon the \ninjustices and hardships women still face in the struggle for total \nequality.\n  International Women's Day is recognized in many countries around the\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nworld, and in some cases, is celebrated as a national holiday. This \npast week, the Senate has marked this holiday with a Senate resolution \nurging the President to designate March 8 as International Women's Day \nin the United States. Also, in honor of this day, there have been \nseries of briefings and discussions about violence and discrimination \nagainst women for Members of Congress and their staff. I hope my \ncolleagues have had an opportunity to participate in these discussions \nand view the exhibits.\n  Women have made tremendous strides in the last century. In the United \nStates, more and more women are attending college and earning post-\ngraduate degrees. Consequently, more women are entering the workforce, \nand starting their own companies. Women all over the world are \nincreasingly becoming more active in the political process, having \nearned the right to vote, being elected to office, and appointed to \npositions of power. In the year 2000, 11 countries were lead by women.\n  In our own country, while much progress has been made in the struggle \nfor equality, there are many cases where women are still at a \ndisadvantage. Women continue to earn less than men. Equal pay for equal \nwork is the law of the land, but that promise remains unfulfilled for \nmany. Although some progress has been made in narrowing the gender \nwage-gap since Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act in 1963, unfair wage \ndisparities continue to be a problem. Wage discrimination is costing \nfamilies thousands of dollars each year. I am proud to support \nlegislative efforts to correct his discrepancy.\n  We cannot forget women and children when the Senate considers \nreauthorization of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families later this \nyear. Too often, women and children fall through the cracks of the \nsystem. While many women are going to work, many have to sacrifice time \nspent with their children in order to afford child care, education, and \nhealth care for their kids.\n  Unfortunately, violence against women is still all too prevalent in \nour country. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury among \nwomen of child-bearing age. One out of every six American women have \nbeen victims of a rape or an attempted rape. Many rapes go unreported, \nand more than half of the women attacked knew their assailant. Only \nrecently have states begun to recognize crimes such as stalking or \nmarital rape.\n  Today, we must also consider the challenges facing women abroad. \nWomen in the developing world are more likely to live in poverty, \nsuffer from malnutrition and lack access to education. Despite the \nexpansion of women's health care research and practices in the last two \ndecades, women still have unequal access to these services.\n  The HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa is particularly alarming. As chairman \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I have had the opportunity to travel to numerous countries in \nAfrica and see firsthand the devastating toll that HIV/AIDS and other \ninfectious diseases are taking on the people of this continent. \nAccording to United Nations reports, over 25 million adults and \nchildren in Africa are infected with the HIV virus, the majority of \nthem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in \nwhich women are infected with the virus at a higher rate than men. \nUNAIDS, the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, reports that women make \nup an estimated 55 percent of the HIV-positive adult population in this \nregion, as compared to 47 percent worldwide. Young women are especially \nat risk. The United Nations reports that in the region girls age 15-19 \nare infected with HIV at a rate of 15 percent to 23 percent, whereas \ninfection rates among boys of the same age group are 3 percent to 4 \npercent.\n  Women in other countries suffer tragic human rights abuses as well. \nThey are victims of domestic violence and illegal trafficking of \npersons for slavery and prostitution. In some countries, women fall \nvictim to ``honor killings,'' a deplorable practice whereby women are \nmurdered by male relatives for actions that are perceived to bring \ndishonor to the family.\n  Rape and sexual assault have often been used as weapons of war. The \ninternational tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are \nsetting legal precedents in convicting men for rape, torture, and \nenslavement of women during times of war or regional conflict. These \nconvictions set an international legal precedent for rape to be \nconsidered a crime against humanity.\n  In the last few months, the whole world has come to understand the \ntreatment and status of Afghan women under the reign of the Taliban. \nNow, as the Afghan people begin to rebuild and reconstruct their \ncountry, it is imperative that women play an integral role in that \neffort. International aid should be given to help women regain their \nrights to an education, access to quality health care, and involvement \nin the political process. Women should be included in all levels of \ngovernment for the future of Afghanistan. Restoring human rights, and, \nin particular, women's human rights, is key to Afghanistan's successful \nreconstruction and the transition to democracy.\n  The protection of women's rights is vital to the success of promoting \nfundamental human rights. The United States Senate can work towards \nprotecting women's rights and improve the status of women domestically \nand internationally by acting upon the United Nations Convention on the \nElimination of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW. CEDAW is the \nmost comprehensive treaty on women's human rights addressing almost all \nforms of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, \nmarriage and family, health care, politics and law. It has been over \ntwo decades since the United States signed this treaty, and it still \nawaits consideration before the United States Senate. Once again, I \nurge the Committee on Foreign Relations to take up this treaty and \nfinally allow the Senate the opportunity to offer its advice and \nconsent on this important convention.\n  In conclusion, today, as we honor women everywhere and celebrate \ntheir accomplishments and contributions to history, we must recognize \nthat there is still more to be done in the struggle for gender equity. \nDiscrimination and violence against women still exist here at home and \nabroad. The United States and the rest of the international community \nmust reaffirm their commitment to promote gender equality and human \nrights around the world.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

You have been a friend in \n     our mutual concerns about routing out terror around the \n     world,'' and, ``I look forward to the Olympics.

Res. 222) commending and supporting the \n     troops.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in more than 20 weeks of operations in \nAfghanistan, our troops have liberated Afghanistan, decimated the \nTaliban, disrupted al Qaeda operations and captured hundreds of al \nQaeda terrorists.\n  Their success lulled much of the world into thinking that our work in \nAfghanistan was done. The somber news of earlier this week--that eight \nof America's finest soldiers had been killed in action--reminds us that \nthere is much to be done in Afghanistan.\n  Right now, our troops are doing that work. They are engaged in the \nlargest ground offensive of the war, confronting the hardest of the \nhard core of al Qaeda.\n  The resolution that we are about to pass reminds our troops that we \nare thinking of them and are praying for them. The 6-month anniversary \nof September 11 is next week.\n  It expresses our condolences to the families of those who have lost \nloved ones in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  And it makes absolutely clear on the 6-month juncture, to the al \nQaeda terrorists, and to all who of those who wish to take notes, that \nwe will not stop until they have been defeated.\n  But this resolution is also important for another reason. On \nSeptember 14, we voted unanimously to send our troops into action \nagainst the perpetrators of the cowardly and heinous attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon. That was our constitutional duty, \nand it is one that none of us takes lightly.\n  The soldiers who were killed this week--and in the last twenty-one \nweeks of Operation Enduring Freedom--died doing the work that we sent \nthem out to do. It is only fitting, then, that we take a moment here in \nthe Senate to thank them and their families and to reaffirm the \ncommitment that we made on September 14--that we will not rest until \nthe perpetrators of the September 11 attacks are brought to justice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

It is my sincere hope that a number of amendments can be \noffered, considered, and completed in debate on Monday afternoon.\n  The next rollcall vote will occur on the morning of Tuesday, March \n12.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/08/senate-section/article/S1713-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 3 P.M.
