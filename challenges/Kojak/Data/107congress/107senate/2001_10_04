Give \nhim wisdom and understanding. Let him have the endurance of a lion as \nhe bears the ultimate weight of providing for our national security; \ngrace him with the tenderness of a lamb as he nurtures our Nation from \nthe wounds inflicted by the barbaric. We also pray for the commanders \nand the soldiers who may be sent into harm's way.\n  We also pray, Father, for the families of those who lost their lives \nas a result of the horrific acts which took place on September 11. \nLord, we further our prayer for those who were wounded on that day and \nfor the souls of those who exited this life. We pray Your grace on the \nrescue workers who have not ceased their efforts to bring normalcy back \nto our Nation. It is our prayer, Lord, that as we, the United States, \nseek Your face, You will truly hear from heaven and that You will \ncomfort us in Your miraculous way; that You will wipe the tears from \nthis Nation's eyes and that You surely will heal our land. We offer \nthis prayer up to You, understanding we are hard-pressed on every side \nbut not crushed, perplexed but not in despair; persecuted but not \nabandoned; struck down but not destroyed.\n  In Jesus' name.

Madam President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed on the aviation security bill. \nThere is every hope that sometime today we can begin consideration of \nthat bill.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, there has been significant progress made on \na number of different issues, not the least of which is the tremendous \nwork done by the Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch, working under the \nchairmanship of Senator Leahy until about 3 this morning, I understand, \ncompleted their overall work in reaching an agreement on the \nantiterrorism legislation. It is very important that has been \naccomplished. It has taken tremendous time of that committee. They have \nworked literally night and day.\n  My former press secretary's husband works on that committee. I had \nthe good fortune of being able to go to a long-scheduled dinner with \nhim last Saturday. He had to change clothes in the car. He had been \nworking all night Friday and Saturday. The staffs work very hard.\n  In spite of that and all the work they have done, the Judiciary \nCommittee today is going to meet and report out an appeals judge from \nthe State of New York, a district court judge from Mississippi, up to \n15 U.S. attorneys, one Assistant Attorney General, and the Director of \nthe U.S. Marshal's Service. They are going to have a hearing today \ndealing with a circuit court judge from Louisiana, two judges from \nOklahoma, a district court judge from Kentucky, a district court judge \nfrom Nebraska. I am very happy to say that a professor from the \nUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas Law School is going to be, I hope, \nreported out of that committee soon. There will be a hearing on him \ntoday, Jay Bybee, to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \nLegal Counsel.\n\n  Next week they have already scheduled a long awaited hearing on John\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nWalters to be the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy \nControl. They are going to have a hearing on October 16 on Tom \nSansometti, and then on October 18 they are going to have a hearing on \nanother circuit judge and 5 district court judges.\n  I say this because the Judiciary Committee is overwhelmed with work, \nand in spite of that we are moving at a very rapid pace. When Senator \nLeahy became chairman of the Judiciary Committee, there had not been \nany judges reported out. That had been 6 months this year. We have done \nthis much work already this year, which I think is significant.\n  During the first year of President Clinton's Presidency, it is my \nrecollection--I do not have that before me--we had three circuit court \njudges during that entire year. We are going to surpass that this year \nquite easily.\n  This morning at 8, Senator Byrd called a meeting. Of course with him \nwas the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. He met with the \n13 subcommittee chairs and the ranking members to talk about how we \nwould move forward on appropriations bills. We now have the numbers, \nand we are going to move forward as rapidly as possible.\n  We still have five bills that have not received Senate action. Seven \nof them have received Senate action and we are waiting to complete a \nconference with the House. Under Senate rules, the only way we can move \nto other matters is by unanimous consent.\n  I have been in consultation with the majority leader, and as a result \nof the work done by the Judiciary Committee in arriving at final \nnumbers, it is now appropriate we do things today other than be in \nmorning business. We have work in the Senate that needs to be done and \nthat can be done, in spite of the fact there is a motion to proceed on \nthis aviation security bill, which is so important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10258-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2506\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nCalendar No. 147, H.R. 2506, the foreign operations appropriations \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nadmonish the body that we are ready to go forward and, as the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader points out, we ought to be \nusing the time available to conduct other business, if we cannot go \nforward with the airline security bill. I have been talking with \nSenator McCain to coordinate this effort. While the managers' amendment \nis yet to be finalized, we have other amendments. It seems to me we \ncould get some kind of agreement with respect to relevant amendments \nand consider these measures. It would not be time wasted.\n  This procedure of moving to another bill puts airport security in \nlimbo. We are not having votes tomorrow or Monday, and certainly not on \nthe weekend.\n  Reagan National is up and running again, and we have shuttles going \nto New York and Boston and otherwise, but the holdup in ensuring the \nsecurity of our airports is now on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, who has \nworked so hard on this issue and is our leader on this issue, the \nSenator is right. Once we get agreement to be able to proceed to this \nbill, which we wanted to do yesterday, of course, we could do that. In \nthe meantime, whether it is an hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours, whatever \nSenator Leahy could do would be time well spent.\n\n  Once there is any agreement that has been reached by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina with the minority, we would be happy to immediately move \noff of that.\n  The point we are making, I say to my friend from South Carolina, \nthere is no need we be in morning business all day. We have things to \ndo. The Senator can be assured that once there is any agreement on this \nvital legislation, airport security, we will get off of this. I have \nspoken with Senator Leahy. He agrees. The Senator does not have to \nworry; We want to keep full focus on this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am very disappointed. We need to move \nforward on this legislation. We had an objection yesterday on airport \nsecurity. Now we have one on this appropriations bill. We have worked \nso well these past 3 weeks together. We need to continue. That is the \nreason I went through the list of work we are doing on the judges. We \nare working as hard as we can. We have been consulting with the \nmajority leader and assistant minority leader on how to move forward. \nWe are doing our level best to do that.\n  I am very disappointed there has been an objection by the minority to \nmoving forward on an unfinished appropriations bill. It is too bad. I \nwould, of course, ask we go to the Agriculture appropriations bill, but \nthere would be the same objection, so that is a waste of the Senate's \ntime. That is too bad.\n  The President has reached out to the majority in the Senate. We have \ndone our best to work with the President. I am very disappointed. I am \nconfident the President would like us to move forward on these \nappropriations bills. I think the President himself knows how hard we \nare working on these nominations. As I said, if you compare what we \nhave done to the early years of the Clinton administration, we are \ndoing just fine.\n  Madam President, this is not payback time for the fact that we didn't \nget many of our judges approved. This is not payback time. We are \nworking through the process as quickly as we can. These judges have \nbeen nominated in an appropriate fashion. A lot of them were late \ngetting here, but we are moving through them as quickly as we can. I \nthink it is unfortunate we cannot move forward on these appropriations \nbills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10258-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I say to my friend from Nevada, all \nMembers are anxious to move forward with this airport security bill. \nUnfortunately, the impediment basically has been the threat to bring up \namendments that are unrelated. This ought to be held to moving that. \nThere will be a conference going on designed to come to an agreement \nwith regard to this bill. Hopefully, we will be back on the floor with \nit today.\n  I am pleased to hear the Judiciary Committee is finally moving on the \njudges. We have a total of 6 that have been confirmed. There are 107 \nvacancies; that is a 12\\1/2\\-percent vacancy. The total of nominees not \nyet dealt\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nwith is almost 50, 49. We certainly have an obligation to move forward \non that issue.\n  I hope as we are working through all the items that are of such \npriority that we can set some priorities and take those that obviously \nare most important, those that deal with terrorism, those that deal \nwith security. They have to be the highest priority. Those that deal \nwith the economy have to be priorities. And of course we have to do our \nnormal duties. I have been talking about this for several weeks. We \nhave not moved very quickly.\n  Hopefully we will be able to come back to this bill very soon today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as one of the original authors and \ncosponsors of the Aviation Security Act, I take a moment to underscore \nwhere the Senate finds itself at this moment, which I find distressing \nand deeply frustrating and less than an adequate response to the \ncompelling requests made by the President of the United States a few \ndays ago in a joint session of Congress. Only a few days ago, the \nSenate came together with the House to listen to the President describe \na war, to describe the most compelling circumstances this Nation has \nfaced certainly since Pearl Harbor, and perhaps in its history in the \ncontext of the nature of the attack on New York City and the Pentagon.\n  There is a danger in raising the level of rhetoric and not meeting it \nwith the actions that the American public understand are required of a \nnation facing urgent circumstances. It is extraordinary to me that the \nSenate is in gridlock. That is where we are, essentially, stopped cold \nin our capacity, not just to do the Airport Security Act and let the \nSenate vote its will, whatever that may be--I don't know what the \noutcome will be--but let the democratic process of the Senate \nwork, Rather than trying to hold it up completely, to subject it to \nsome kind of prenegotiation that appears to be impossible when we even \nhave meetings canceled and there is no negotiating going on.\n\n  We tried to go forward on the foreign ops bill. I cannot think of a \nbill, second to the Department of Defense authorization we just passed \na few days ago, that is more important in the context of the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves. But we are not even permitted \nto proceed forward with that because, essentially, once again politics \nand ideology are rearing their heads with a stubbornness that suggests \nthat a few Members of the Senate are unwilling to allow the entire \nSenate to work its will. What an incredible display at a time when the \nworld is watching the greatest deliberative body, and the greatest \nnation on the face of this planet with its democracy, try to work \neffectively to respond to these needs. What is even more incredible to \nme is that common sense tells us what the realities are with respect to \nairport security and, I might add, rail security in this country.\n  We woke up this morning to the news that an airliner apparently has \nexploded and gone down over the Black Sea, a Russian airliner. We do \nnot know yet to a certainty that it is terrorism, but we do know the \nearly indicators of an eye witness report from the pilot in another \naircraft is that he saw it explode and saw it disintegrate and go down \ninto the sea. And Russian President Putin has said it appears as if \nthere is some act of terrorism.\n  Leaving that aside, we have promised the American people we are going \nto provide them, not with a level of security, not with some sort of \nhalf-breed sense that we have arrived at a notion of what is \nacceptable, but we are going to provide the best security, the fullest \nlevel of security we are capable of imagining, that is well within the \nreach of this country and well within our capacity to afford.\n  I might add, what we are suggesting we want to provide to Americans, \nin terms of security, they have already suggested they are willing to \npay for several times over. This is not a question of cost. It is not a \nquestion of our inability to afford this. It is a question of politics, \nideology.\n  We have some in the Senate who do not like the idea that there might \nbe more Federal employees, that there might be more people who might \njoin a union even, that there might be more people who somehow might \nnot have their political point of view but who nevertheless might \nperform an important function for our country. When I was in the \nmilitary, what I learned about, sort of a hierarchy and about authority \nand about training and management, is that there is a brilliant \neffectiveness to the chain of command and to the manner in which a \nFederal entity is organized or a law enforcement entity is organized.\n  I do not think anybody in this body would suggest we ought to be \ncontracting out the responsibilities of the Border Patrol, or \ncontracting out the responsibilities of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, or contracting out the security of the Capitol, \nthe security of the White House, or the security of a number of other \nefforts. But they are prepared to contract out to the lowest bidder, \nwith unskilled workers, the security of Americans flying, \nnotwithstanding everything we have learned. That is just unacceptable. \nIt is unacceptable.\n  I hear all kinds of excuses being made: There are transition \nproblems; you might have contractors quit in the meantime. First of \nall, at a time of high unemployment and rising unemployment, I think \ncommon sense would tell us most of those contractors would leap at the \nopportunity to have a better-paid job and to get more training and they \nwill stick on the job because they will be part of an important \nsecurity corps of the United States of America and they would want to \nbe part of that. And, incidentally, they would want to be part of it \nbecause they would then have the possibility of having benefits they do \nnot get today, which is one of the reasons we have employees, \nnotwithstanding all of their best efforts and all of their best \nintentions, who are, many of them, simply not fully enough trained or \nprepared to do the job they are being asked to do. It is not their \nfault, but it is the nature of the pay scale.\n\n  If you were to compare the difference between the civilian nuclear \nindustry and the military nuclear industry--i.e., the U.S. Navy on \nships--we have not had major incidents on ships of the U.S. Navy. We \nhave had Navy ships running nuclear reactors, and highly successfully, \nfor years now: Submarines, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and others. But \nthe military has an unlimited human personnel capacity for redundancy, \nfor certitude in the human checks, and therefore is capable of \nproviding a kind of safety net that you cannot provide in the private \nsector because the private sector is always thinking about the \nshareholders, the return on investment, the cashflow, and the capacity \nto do it. So you do not get that kind of redundancy often unless it is \nrequired.\n  The same thing is true of the checking of the security process of \npeople boarding aircraft. Moreover, we have now learned that this is \nsomething more than just a job, significantly more than just a job. It \nis part of the national security framework of our country. It is the \nway in which we will prevent a plane from being used as a bomb or a \nplane from simply being blown up, or passengers from being terrorized \nin some form or another. Passengers deserve the greatest sense of \nsafety in traveling.\n  For those who are concerned about the economy, there is not one of us \nwho has not been visited in the last weeks by members of the auto \nrental industry, restaurant industry, travel industry, hotels, and \ncountless mayors\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nwho are concerned about the flow of tourist traffic to their cities. We \nneed to get Americans to believe in the level of safety that their \nGovernment is providing for them.\n  It is extraordinary to me. We have been through this period of time \nwhere government has been so denigrated. We have had a long debate in \nthis Senate with people arguing so forcefully the adage: It is not the \nGovernment's money, it is your money and you deserve a refund. But at \nthe same time, you know, they are incapable of doing without the very \npeople who have put on displays of courage that have been absolutely \nextraordinary over these last week. That was government people, paid by \ngovernment money, who ran into those buildings to save lives in New \nYork. It has been government people paid by government money who have \nsaved so many people in the course of these weeks. It has been \ngovernment people paid by government money who organized and managed \npeople who have been homeless, people who searched for their loved \nones, people who needed some kind of comfort. It has been a government \ndisplay, if you will, of the effectiveness of money well spent when we \ninvest it properly.\n  The same thing is true of airport security. I want to just highlight \nthe differences between what is being proposed by those of us who think \nwe need to have a Federal structure versus what the administration has \ncurrently offered. With respect to turnover, we raise the wages. We \nraise the wages to a level that would put the employees on a Federal \ncivil pay scale. That means you will attract more qualified people and \nyou will have a right to be able to raise the standards and raise the \ndemands of performance, which is precisely what the American people \nwant.\n  Under the administration's current proposal, they will only increase \nthe wages and benefits if the legislation specifically mandates a \nliving wage and health benefits for the employees. So there is no \ndemand that the wages be raised. They want to leave it to the lowest \nbid process unless somehow there is a specific statement to the \ncontrary.\n  With respect to training, we create a stepped scale based on \nmanagement responsibilities and seniority so there is an incentive \nwithin the structure for people to assume management responsibilities, \nto become supervisors and to actually supervise with something more \nthan 3 months on the job. Currently the turnover rate at Atlanta \nairport, Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, is 400 percent. The turnover in \nNew York, Boston, and Los Angeles ranges between 100 percent and 200 \npercent, 300 percent --extraordinary turnover rates.\n  You can't expect somebody to be on the job at low pay and be able to \nprovide the kind of skill necessary to read the x-ray machine properly, \nto profile a person, to see suspect activity, or even to make the kind \nof personal searches necessary when that is needed.\n  Under the administration's current offer, the wage scale and the \nmanagement decisions are left to the low bid contractor. Secretary \nMineta was in front of our committee just the other day. I asked him \nspecifically: Mr. Secretary, isn't it true that all of these companies \nare basically in a position where they take on the lowest bid, and it \nis a bid process that encourages low bids so that they can survive? He \nsaid yes. Jane Garvey said yes. That is precisely what the current \nproposal will continue.\n  It is simply impossible to build more rail, or gain the kind of \nefficiency, or gain the kind of accountability and manage this process \neffectively if we are not prepared to have a Federal civil service \nstructure for these employees.\n  I might add that while the Europeans have a slightly amalgamated \nsystem, they have wage laws and they have labor laws that we do not \nhave that guarantee the kind of pay structures and accountability \nstructures which we are seeking in our approach.\n  While there is a distinction, it is really a distinction without a \ndifference because in the end they have achieved the kind of Federal \nvision and the kind of employee quality which they have been able to \nattract as a consequence of the ingredients they put together.\n  For instance, Belgium has an hourly pay of $14 to $15, they have \nhealth benefits, and they have a turnover rate of less than 4 percent. \nThe Netherlands: $7.50 an hour; England $8 an hour; in France, they \nreceive an extra month's pay for each 12 months of work, and less than \na 50-percent turnover rate plus health benefits.\n  We are looking at an extraordinary difference between what European \ncountries are able to do as they face these kinds of terrorism, and \nthey have much stricter standards than we have for a longer period of \ntime.\n  It is imperative that we in the Senate get about the business of \nresponding properly to the demands we face with respect to the security \nof our airports.\n  It seems to me that the transitional issues are easy to work out. It \nis certainly, first of all, normal to assume that those people who are \nunder contract now will still be under contract. If they breach it, I \nthink the full wrath of the Government and the American people would be \nready to come down on them, not to mention the lawsuits for breach of \ncontract, and not to mention the loss of jobs for all the employees.\n  Those transitional problems that are being conjured up simply don't \nhold up to scrutiny. The American public knows that if we had a Federal \ncivil service corps which we could put under homeland defense, or where \nwe could put it under the Defense Department, if the Department of \nTransportation is uncomfortable with it, what better an area for the \nsecurity of our airports?\n  There is no distinction between providing security for our borders \nwith the Border Patrol on the ground and providing security for our air \ntraffic and for those people who fly through the air across those \nborders. It is the same concept. I think most people in the country \nunderstand that.\n  I hope the Senate is going to quickly get enough business of paying \nattention to this issue and resolving it today. It has been 3 weeks \nnow. One would have thought this would have been one of the first \nthings we would have done almost by edict and that it would have \ninitially been on the table.\n\n  We have seen the extraordinary process of sort of back and forth \ngoing on now as to whether or not we ought to do it. I don't think this \nenters into the realm of politics. I don't think security has a label \nof Democrat or Republican on it. It has a common sense label.\n  What is the best way to guarantee that you are going to have security \nin an airport? If you have a whole bunch of different companies, each \nof which bid, even if you have the Federal standards, even if you have \nFederal supervision, they are hired by private sector entities. They \nbelong in one airport to one group and in another airport to another \ngroup. You don't get the esprit de corps. You don't get the horizontal \nand vertical accountability and management that you get by having the \ncivil service standard. That is why we have an INS. That is why we have \na Border Patrol. That is why we have an ATF. That is why we have all of \nthese other entities that are either State or Federal law enforcement \nentities, because they guarantee the capacity of the chain of command, \nthey guarantee accountability, they guarantee the training, and they \nguarantee ultimately that we will give the American people the security \nthey need.\n  I want to add one other thing. It is not on this bill. I think we \nhave to pass this bill rapidly. There is a whole different group within \nthe Senate who, because of their opposition to trains, Amtrak, ports \nand so forth, somehow have a cloudy view of what we may need to do to \nprovide security for our rails. But there is absolutely no distinction \nwhatsoever between those who get on an airplane and travel and those \nwho get on a train and travel. In point of fact, there are more people \nin a tunnel at one time on two trains passing in that tunnel than there \nare on several 747s in the sky at the same moment--thousands of people. \nWe have already seen what a fire in a tunnel can do in Baltimore. We \nhave tunnels up and down the east coast. We have bridges. All of these, \nif we are indeed facing the kind of long-term threat that people have \ntalked about--and we believe we are--need to have adequate security.\n  I was recently abroad, and I got on a train. I went through the exact \nsame security procedures to get on that train as I do in an airport \nunder the strictest examination--interview, examination of ID, and \nthorough inspection and screening of your bags. You\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\ncan walk down to Union Station, go to any train station in America, and \npile on with a bag. You can get off at any station and leave your bag \non the train. Nobody will know the difference.\n  We have an absolute responsibility in the Senate to be rapid in \nresolving this question of train security just as we are trying to \nresolve this question of airline security.\n  A lot of these ideas have been around for a long time. We have always \nhad the ugly head of bureaucracy raising its objections for one reason \nor another against common sense. We are not even looking for the amount \nof money that almost every poll in the country has said the American \npeople are prepared to spend. Ask anybody. Ask any of the families in \nNew York, or in Washington, or any part of this country who suffered a \nloss on September 11, what they would be willing to pay on any ticket \nto guarantee that they knew their loved ones were safe. We are talking \nabout a few dollars per ticket to be able to guarantee that we have the \nstrongest capacity and never again have an incident in the air, \ncertainly because we weren't prepared to do what was necessary.\n  There is no more urgent business before the Senate today. I hope the \nSenate will quickly restore itself as it was in the last few weeks to \nbe able to discard ideology, discard politics, and discard sort of the \nbaggage of past years to be able to find the unity and the common sense \nthat have guided us these days and which have made the Nation proud. We \nneed to do what provides the greatest level of security in our country, \nand that means a Federal system of screeners, and most of those people \nresponsible for access to our aircraft and other forms of travel.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10261-S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MILLIKEN JOINS HALL OF FAME FOR TEXTILES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, on September 10, Roger Milliken, a \ndistinguished American, was inducted as a charter member of the Textile \nHall of Fame in Lowell, MA.\n  Roger Milliken has long been a leader in the textile industry and his \ninduction as a charter member of the Textile Hall of Fame was well-\ndeserved. But Roger Milliken is far more than an outstanding American \nindustry leader. He is a true patriot, and his love of country \nconstantly manifests itself in countless ways.\n  Roger Milliken's genuine commitment to the health of the American \neconomy is unfailing and unyielding. It is typical of his nature and \nhis fidelity to his country that he used the occasion of his induction \ninto the Textile Hall of Fame to sound a warning about the continuing \nerosion of the U.S. manufacturing base--and the hollowing-out of the \nU.S. economy--by the displacement of solid manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica to low-wage paying countries all over the world.\n  You see, Roger Milliken has steadfastly supported keeping American \nmanufacturing strong but too often, his wise counsel has gone unheeded \nby the so-called ``trade experts.''\n  But make no mistake, in the name of globalization, our trade policy \nis, in fact, encouraging overproduction, as subsidized foreign \nindustries flood the global market and bring prices in this country \nbelow the cost of domestic production.\n  The economic threat has been eating away at our manufacturing base \nslowly but surely. In this year alone, the malignancy will result in \nthe loss of 1 million American manufacturing jobs. In the U.S. textile \nindustry, more than 600,000 jobs have been lost since NAFTA and the \nUruguay Round's Agreement on Textiles and Clothing became effective in \n1995.\n  Sadly, precious little attention is being paid to the real victims of \nthis trade policy: the small towns and medium-sized cities throughout \nAmerica devastated by plant closings and job losses. The textile and \napparel industry in the South is only one part of the tragedy. The same \ncan be said of the auto industry, the steel industry, and even the \nhigh-tech semiconductor industry in California.\n  Roger Milliken's eloquent statement on behalf of American \nmanufacturing rings clear, and it merits the attention of the Senate. I \ntherefore ask that excerpts from the Milliken statement--entitled ``The \nWealth of Nations: U.S. Manufacturing in Serious Trouble'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Wealth of Nations: U.S. Manufacturing in Serious Trouble\n\n                          (By Roger Milliken)\n\n       Today almost all of the manufacturing industries in the \n     United States are in serious trouble. I would like to take \n     this time and this place to light a fire of debate on the \n     serious consequences of that statement on the future of our \n     country. . . .\n       Thanks to Thomas Edison's invention of the electric light, \n     our industry learned in World War I that textile machinery \n     could run at night as well as during 12-hour daytime-only \n     shifts.\n       At the end of that war, we found ourselves with 18 million \n     spindles in place north of the Mason-Dixon line and 18 \n     million spindles south of the Mason-Dixon line, all of which \n     could be run around the clock. Our production capacity had \n     been doubled.\n       Seventy years later, 1990, after a long period of fair \n     competition, we found ourselves with 18 million modernized, \n     surviving spindles in the South and 800,000 in the North, \n     producing more products and higher quality than the 36 \n     million spindles after World War I.\n       Today we are told that during that period the U.S. went \n     from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy and that we \n     are now similarly transitioning to an information-based \n     economy.\n       As I see it, the main thing wrong with that comparison is \n     that in the first transition our country did not lose either \n     the farms or the products of those farms. In fact, \n     agricultural production increased as new technologies were \n     introduced. Today, our country continues to produce a surplus \n     of agricultural goods.\n       During the current transition, the U.S. is losing both its \n     manufacturing plants and the products manufactured in them, \n     as well as the jobs they provide--thus putting at risk our \n     leadership position as the strongest manufacturing economy in \n     the world.\n\n\n                      globalization's fatal flaws\n\n       Our founding fathers, specifically Alexander Hamilton, \n     understood the importance of manufacturing. The second act of \n     the First Congress imposed tariffs on manufactured goods from \n     abroad. This encouraged our new nation, and its people, to \n     develop our own manufacturing base rather than merely \n     exporting low-value raw materials to our former colonial \n     masters and importing back from them the high value-added \n     finished goods. . . .\n       Now as our country stands alone as the world's last \n     remaining superpower, we in textiles and almost all of U.S. \n     manufacturing find ourselves at risk of losing what our \n     forefathers fought so hard to create. This is neither \n     necessary nor wise.\n       . . . At the current rate, we may end this decade with as \n     few as seven economically viable manufacturing industries \n     remaining in America.\n       A recent survey of manufacturing revealed that 36 of our 44 \n     existing manufacturing industries had an adverse balance of \n     trade and had cut substantial numbers of jobs this year. The \n     hemorrhage continues.\n       All U.S. manufacturing employment is shrinking at a pace \n     which will eliminate 1 million high-paying, middle-class jobs \n     this year alone. This is four times what we lost in the year \n     2000. Actual employment levels in our vitally important \n     manufacturing sector have already fallen to levels last seen \n     in 1963.\n       We are in an era of so-called globalization, and everyone \n     talks about the new economy. We have been lured into thinking \n     that the negative aspects of these trends are both \n     unstoppable and inexorable.\n       Isn't it our leaders' responsibility to ensure that this \n     country and its people survive this period strong and \n     prosperous?\n       A fatal flaw of the current idea of globalization is the \n     lack of recognition that subsidized global production creates \n     a strong incentive to create overproduction that outstrips \n     global demand.\n       A further flaw is the lack of recognition that in emerging \n     economies the people and manufacturing production workers are \n     not paid enough to buy what they make. Instead, the fruits of \n     their labor are subsidized and shipped to the United States, \n     which serves as the market of first and last resort.\n       In the process, our standard of living is undermined, and \n     both political and economic instability is increased. . . .\n       Mounting consumer debt helped fuel the boom of the 1990s. \n     Despite strong productivity growth, the 80 percent of our \n     country's wage earners and their families who work for others \n     have not seen an increase in their real income over the past \n     20 years.\n       As increase in purchasing power stagnated because of the \n     massive shifts of good, well-paying jobs to low-cost emerging \n     economies, we continued our growth of consumer spending, but \n     we did it on credit. Consequently, the American consumers \n     have been spending more than their earnings at the expense of \n     savings. The result is that we are consuming a billion \n     dollars more in manufactured goods each day than we produce. \n     These facts are a prescription for social, political and \n     economic unrest.\n       Our manufacturing base is being eroded as dollars are \n     diverted from wealth creation to wealth consumption. If \n     economic history has\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\n     any lesson for us, it is that a nation's well-being is \n     determined by what it produces, not by how much it consumes.\n\n\n                   altar of free and unfettered trade\n\n       While technologies always present new opportunities and \n     challenges, globalism is not a new idea. It was born around \n     the time of Columbus, and most of world politics has been \n     about how to control it ever since. Past and present \n     administrations in Washington seem to think globalization is \n     something new for which the lessons of history are \n     irrelevant.\n       George Santayana is quoted as saying, ``Those who can't \n     remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''\n       A Spanish leader in 1675 bragged about Spain's trade \n     deficit, asserting ``all the world's manufacturing serves her \n     and she serves nobody.'' However, when its gold and silver \n     ran out, Spain found that its industrial development had \n     withered; it had only debts to show for its orgy of \n     manufactured imports and consumption. That Spanish empire \n     collapsed, and those countries who had expanded their \n     manufacturing capabilities by selling to Spain were the new \n     world powers.\n       Thus it also was with the later demise of the Dutch empire \n     and subsequently the great British Empire, ``upon which the \n     sun never set.''\n       Beguiled by the siren songs of banking, insurance, shipping \n     and services, they ultimately surrendered their world pre-\n     eminence as nations. The Spanish, Dutch and British had all \n     neglected their nations' manufacturing bases.\n       Could this happen to the U.S.A.? Or more to the point, is \n     it happening?\n       I believe the process is already under way, and if we \n     continue sacrificing our manufacturing base on the altar of \n     free and unfettered trade, we will go the way of others.\n       I believe it is happening because our leaders in Washington \n     remain unconcerned about our near three trillion dollars of \n     accumulated debt flowing from the dramatic growth of our \n     adverse balance of trade. In the span of the last dozen \n     years, we have gone from being the world's largest creditor \n     nation to being its largest debtor nation. And no end and no \n     limits are in sight. . . .\n       Lester Thurow, of MIT fame, in his book ``The Future of \n     Capitalism'' (1996) said: ``If there is one rule of \n     international economics, it is that no country can run a \n     large trade deficit forever. Trade deficits need to be \n     financed, and it is simply impossible to borrow enough to \n     keep up with the compound interest. Yet all the world trade, \n     especially that on the Pacific Rim, depends upon most of this \n     world being able to run trade surpluses with the United \n     States that will allow them to pay for their trade deficits \n     with Japan. When the lending to America stops, and it will \n     stop, what happens to current world trade flows?''\n\n\n                     bankrupting race to the bottom\n\n       I believe that in a world where the American standard of \n     living, as well as power, is being daily challenged, our \n     political leaders in Washington must defend the economic base \n     upon which Americans depend for their security and their \n     livelihoods.\n       Our leaders cannot expect to keep the public trust if they \n     abdicate their responsibilities to the electorate by making \n     decisions to placate bankers and Wall Street-pressured \n     corporate managers who exhibit diminishing national concerns.\n       Everyone forgets that when Adam Smith called his seminal \n     work on economics ``The Wealth of Nations,'' he was arguing \n     against the notion that trade was the source of national \n     wealth when, to the contrary, he was arguing that domestic \n     manufacturing was the true source of national wealth.\n       In his hierarchy of economic activity, agriculture came \n     first because of the need to feed the people; a strong \n     domestic manufacturing base was second as the core of \n     national growth; trade was rated third in importance, and was \n     to be used only to acquire resources or luxuries not \n     available at home.\n       Smith understood that those nations who focus on trade to \n     the neglect of domestic manufacturing industry may be \n     enriching themselves but may also be doing the country great \n     harm.\n       ``The beginning of wisdom on trade, and indeed all economic \n     policy, is to understand that the purposes of a national \n     economy are to enrich all its people, to strengthen its \n     families, its communities and thereby stabilize society. The \n     economy should serve us, not the other way around.''\n       My friend the late Sir James Goldsmith understood this \n     imperative. He also understood that the U.S. economy--and the \n     world economy itself--cannot be returned to a sustainable \n     course unless we redress the recent massive global imbalances \n     between consumption and growing overproduction. He recognized \n     that only one basic approach to globalization could \n     accomplish this goal.\n       He proposed that the United States make clear to its \n     trading partners, and its own multinational companies, that \n     if their products are to be sold in the United States, they \n     must be made substantially in the United States.\n       As Sir James argued: ``America should use its matchless \n     market power to ensure that foreign and American corporations \n     become good corporate citizens of the United States. They \n     should bring us their capital and their technologies and \n     invest in the U.S.A. This would require them to hire workers \n     in the U.S., pay American wages, pay U.S. taxes, preserve the \n     environment, ensure human rights, and compete on the level \n     playing field that does exist among the 50 states. . . .''\n       They should be reminded that since the American market is \n     by far the most important in the world, entry is not a right, \n     but a privilege. In other words, there should be a price and \n     a reward for doing business in the United States--making \n     meaningful, long-term contributions to America's continued \n     security and prosperity, and preserving the global \n     environment.\n       Only then can we make sure we are engaging our people in a \n     race to the top, in living standards; economic stability; \n     quality of life; and personal security--not in a bankrupting \n     race to the bottom. . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, since September 11 there has been such a \nflood of emotions in America over the events of that day. I think all \nof us have been transformed by the experience and transformed by some \nof our fellow Americans and what they have said and what they have \ndone.\n  Some of the things that have been written are extraordinary. In just \none moment, I am going to submit for the Record one that I think is \nexceptional, a piece from the BusinessWeek magazine of October 1, 2001, \nby a writer named Bruce Nussbaum entitled, ``Real Masters Of The \nUniverse.'' I will not read the entire article, but I will submit it \nfor the Record. I would like to quote a few sentences from it. He said \nsome things with which I agree and I think help to put our experience \ninto some perspective:\n\n       A subtle shift in the American zeitgeist took place on \n     Sept. 11. It's hard to define, and it may not last. But on \n     the day of the World Trade Center cataclysm, the country \n     changed. Big, beefy working-class guys became heroes once \n     again, replacing the telegenic financial analysts and techno-\n     billionaires who once had held the Nation in thrall. Uniforms \n     and public service became ``in.'' Real sacrifice and real \n     courage were on graphic display.\n       Maybe it was the class reversals that were so revealing. \n     Men and women making 40 grand a year working for the city \n     responding--risking their own lives--to save investment \n     bankers and traders making 10 times that amount. And dying by \n     the hundreds for their effort. The image of self-sacrifice by \n     civil servants in uniform was simply breathtaking.\n       For Americans conditioned in the '90s to think of oneself \n     first, to be rich above all else, to accumulate all the good \n     material things, to take safety and security for granted, \n     this was a new reality. So was the contrast of genuine \n     bravery to the faux values of reality TV shows such as \n     Survivor.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       Tragedy has the power to transform us. But rarely is the \n     transformation permanent. People and societies revert back to \n     the norm. But what is the ``norm'' for America? Where are \n     this nation's true values? Have we stripped too much away in \n     recent years in order to make us lean and mean for the race \n     to riches? It is hard to look at the images of the World \n     Trade Center rescue again and again. At least once, however, \n     we should look at what the rescuers are teaching us, about \n     what matters--and who.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Oct. 1, 2001]\n\n                      Real Masters of the Universe\n\n                          (By Bruce Nussbaum)\n\n       A subtle shift in the American zeitgeist took place on \n     Sept. 11. It's hard to define, and it may not last. But on \n     the day of the World Trade Center cataclysm, the country \n     changed. Big, beefy working-class guys became heroes once \n     again, replacing the telegenic financial analysts and techno-\n     billionaires who once had held the nation in thrall. Uniforms \n     and public service became ``in.'' Real sacrifice and real \n     courage were on graphic display.\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\n       Maybe it was the class reversals that were so revealing. \n     Men and women making 40 grand a year working for the city \n     responding--risking their own lives--to save investment \n     bankers and traders making 10 times that amount. And dying by \n     the hundreds for the effort. The image of self-sacrifice by \n     civil servants in uniform was simply breathtaking.\n       For Americans conditioned in the '90s to think of oneself \n     first, to be rich above all else, to accumulate all the good \n     material things, to take safety and security for granted, \n     this was a new reality. So was the contrast of genuine \n     bravery to the faux values of reality TV shows such as \n     Survivor.\n\n\n                              Sea of Flags\n\n       Noteworthy, too, was America's quick return to family, \n     community, church, and patriotism in the aftermath of the \n     tragedy. People became polite and generous to one another \n     without prodding. On that day and the days that followed, \n     they told their wives and husbands and children and parents \n     and significant others they loved them. And the flags, the \n     sea of flags that appeared out of nowhere and spread \n     everywhere, worn by business-suited managers and eyebrow-\n     pierced, tattooed teenagers. As if by magic, city taxicabs, \n     building canopies, and nearly every truck in sight were \n     flying flags.\n       The offerings of food, money, and blood were overwhelming. \n     The generosity was unsurpassed in our memories. But the \n     manner in which perfect strangers went out of their way to \n     help one another in all kinds of situations was most amazing. \n     To the surprise of its residents, New York became a small-\n     town community. The day-to-day antagonisms among the \n     citizenry melted away.\n       The rush to church, synagogue, and, yes, mosque was equally \n     unusual. People returned to their religious ceremonies and \n     congregations in huge numbers for support and guidance. The \n     overflow at the doors demonstrated that many who had not \n     visited in years showed up to participate in the familiar and \n     comforting liturgies of their childhoods. They joined with \n     their neighbors in mourning.\n\n\n                             Lessons Taught\n\n       It was, for a moment, an old America peeking out from \n     behind the new, me-now America. We saw a glimpse of a country \n     of shared values, not competing interest groups; of common \n     cause, not hateful opposition. There were a few exceptions: \n     Jerry Falwell declaring we brought the death and destruction \n     down on ourselves because of homosexuality, abortion, and the \n     American Civil Liberties Union. A silly, stupid comment to be \n     dismissed in light of the comity of the day--but an extremist \n     remark nonetheless made in the name of God. How sad.\n       Tragedy has the power to transform us. But rarely is the \n     transformation permanent. People and societies revert back to \n     the norm. But what is the ``norm'' for America? Where are \n     this nation's true values? Have we stripped too much away in \n     recent years in order to make us lean and mean for the race \n     to riches? It is hard to look at the images of the World \n     Trade Center rescue again and again. At least once, however, \n     we should look at what the rescuers are teaching us, about \n     what matters--and who.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I recall a few days after this tragedy making a telephone \ncall to a friend of mine, a very successful business executive in \nChicago, just to ask him how things were going. He said to me on the \nphone what this article said. He said: The roaring nineties are over. \nWe are going into a new era.\n  As this article says, he believes it is an era that focuses on a lot \nof other things, whether it is family, community, and church, values \nthat all of us hold dear, and certainly a new respect for this great \nNation, which has been symbolized by the sea of flags that you see in \nevery community across Illinois and across the Nation.\n  It is a time of testing for this country, and we will rise to that \nchallenge, I am certain. We will count our friends.\n  Madam President, I would like to also make a part of the Record--I \nwill ask for consent in a moment--one of the most amazing speeches that \nI have read. It is a speech by someone who is not an American but who \ncommented on our experience and then pledged his alliance, his \nfriendship, and his solidarity to help us in our effort. I refer to \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair, who gave an exceptional speech on \nsolidarity with the United States in our war on terrorism. But it was \nmuch more than that. It was a call to united international action to \nwork for democracy, prosperity, and freedom.\n  Out of this tragedy, Prime Minister Blair sees an opportunity to \nremake our world and to reflect the values we hold dear. His inspiring \ncall is for a progressive vision of the future where the world \ncommunity, as a community, works for economic growth and social \njustice, and to end regional conflicts. We, in the United States, have \nbeen too caught up in dealing with our immediate crisis, from time to \ntime, to see that this is, as Prime Minister Blair says, ``a moment to \nseize.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Prime Minister Blair's \nentire speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Speech by British Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\n       In retrospect, the Millennium marked only a moment in time. \n     It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point \n     in history, where we confront the dangers of the future and \n     assess the choices facing humankind.\n       It was a tragedy. An act of evil. From this nation, goes \n     our deepest sympathy and prayers for the victims and our \n     profound solidarity with the American people.\n       We were with you at the first. We will stay with you to the \n     last.\n       Just two weeks ago, in New York, after the church service I \n     met some of the families of the British victims.\n       It was in many ways a very British occasion. Tea and \n     biscuits. It was raining outside. Around the edge of the \n     room, strangers making small talk, trying to be normal people \n     in an abnormal situation.\n       And as you crossed the room, you felt the longing and \n     sadness; hands clutching photos of sons and daughters, wives \n     and husbands; imploring you to believe them when they said \n     there was still an outside chance of their loved ones being \n     found alive, when you knew in truth that all hope was gone.\n       And then a middle-aged mother looks you in the eyes and \n     tells you her only son has died, and asks you: why?\n       I tell you: you do not feel like the most powerful person \n     in the country at times like that.\n       Because there is no answer. There is no justification for \n     their pain. Their son did nothing wrong. The woman, seven \n     months pregnant, whose child will never know its father, did \n     nothing wrong.\n       They don't want revenge. They want something better in \n     memory of their loved ones.\n       I believe their memorial can and should be greater than \n     simply the punishment of the guilty. It is that out of the \n     shadow of this evil, should emerge lasting good: destruction \n     of the machinery of terrorism wherever it is found; hope \n     amongst all nations of a new beginning where we seek to \n     resolve differences in a calm and ordered way; greater \n     understanding between nations and between faiths; and above \n     all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed, so \n     that people everywhere can see the chance of a better future \n     through the hard work and creative power of the free citizen, \n     not the violence and savagery of the fanatic.\n       I know that here in Britain people are anxious, even a \n     little frightened. I understand that. People know we must act \n     but they worry what might follow.\n       They worry about the economy and talk of recession.\n       And, of course there are dangers; it is a new situation. \n     But the fundamentals of the US, British and European \n     economies are strong.\n       Every reasonable measure of internal security is being \n     undertaken.\n       Our way of life is a great deal stronger and will last a \n     great deal longer than the actions of fanatics, small in \n     number and now facing a unified world against them.\n       People should have confidence.\n       This is a battle with only one outcome: our victory not \n     theirs.\n       What happened on 11 September was without parallel in the \n     bloody history of terrorism.\n       Within a few hours, up to 7000 people were annihilated, the \n     commercial centre of New York was reduced to rubble and in \n     Washington and Pennsylvania further death and horror on an \n     unimaginable scale. Let no one say this was a blow for Islam \n     when the blood of innocent Muslims was shed along with those \n     of the Christian, Jewish and other faiths around the world.\n       We know those responsible. In Afghanistan are scores of \n     training camps for the export of terror. Chief amongst the \n     sponsors and organisers is Usama Bin Laden.\n       He is supported, shielded and given succour by the Taliban \n     regime.\n       Two days before the 11 September attacks, Masood, the \n     leader of the opposition Northern Alliance, was assassinated \n     by two suicide bombers. Both were linked to Bin Laden. Some \n     may call that coincidence. I call it payment--payment in the \n     currency these people deal in: blood.\n       Be in no doubt: Bin Laden and his people organised this \n     atrocity. The Taliban aid and abet him. He will not desist \n     from further acts of terror. They will not stop helping him.\n       Whatever the dangers of the action we take, the dangers of \n     inaction are far, far greater.\n       Look for a moment at the Taliban regime. It is \n     undemocratic. That goes without saying.\n       There is no sport allowed, or television or photography. No \n     art or culture is permitted. All other faiths, all other \n     interpretations of Islam are ruthlessly suppressed. Those who \n     practice their faith are imprisoned. Women are treated in a \n     way almost too revolting to be credible. First driven out of \n     university; girls not allowed to go to school; no legal \n     rights; unable to go out of doors without a man. Those that \n     disobey are stoned.\n       There is now no contact permitted with western agencies, \n     even those delivering food. The people live in abject \n     poverty. It is a regime founded on fear and funded on the\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\n     drugs trade. The biggest drugs hoard in the world is in \n     Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban. Ninety per cent of \n     the heroin on British streets originates in Afghanistan.\n       The arms the Taliban are buying today are paid for with the \n     lives of young British people buying their drugs on British \n     streets.\n       That is another part of their regime that we should seek to \n     destroy.\n       So what do we do?\n       Don't overreact some say. We aren't.\n       We haven't lashed out. No missiles on the first night just \n     for effect.\n       Don't kill innocent people. We are not the ones who waged \n     war on the innocent. We seek the guilty.\n       Look for a diplomatic solution. There is no diplomacy with \n     Bin Laden or the Taliban regime.\n       State an ultimatum and get their response. We stated the \n     ultimatum; they haven't responded.\n       Understand the causes of terror. Yes, we should try, but \n     let there be no moral ambiguity about this: nothing could \n     ever justify the events of 11 September, and it is to turn \n     justice on its head to pretend it could.\n       The action we take will be proportionate; targeted; we will \n     do all we humanly can to avoid civilian casualties. But \n     understand what we are dealing with. Listen to the calls of \n     those passengers on the planes. Think of the children on \n     them, told they were going to die.\n       Think of the cruelty beyond our comprehension as amongst \n     the screams and the anguish of the innocent, those hijackers \n     drove at full throttle planes laden with fuel into buildings \n     where tens of thousands worked.\n       They have no moral inhibition on the slaughter of the \n     innocent. If they could have murdered not 7,000 but 70,000 \n     does anyone doubt they would have done so and rejoiced in it?\n       There is no compromise possible with such people, no \n     meeting of minds, no point of understanding with such terror.\n       Just a choice: defeat it or be defeated by it. And defeat \n     it we must.\n       Any action taken will be against the terrorist network of \n     Bin Laden.\n       As for the Taliban, they can surrender the terrorists; or \n     face the consequences and again in any action the aim will be \n     to eliminate their military hardware, cut off their finances, \n     disrupt their supplies, target their troops, not civilians. \n     We will put a trap around the regime.\n       I say to the Taliban: surrender the terrorists; or \n     surrender power. It's your choice.\n       We will take action at every level, national and \n     international, in the UN, in G8, in the EU, in NATO, in every \n     regional grouping in the world, to strike at international \n     terrorism wherever it exists.\n       For the first time, the UN security council has imposed \n     mandatory obligations on all UN members to cut off terrorist \n     financing and end safe havens for terrorists.\n       Those that finance terror, those who launder their money, \n     those that cover their tracks are every bit as guilty as the \n     fanatic who commits the final act.\n       Here in this country and in other nations round the world, \n     laws will be changed, not to deny basic liberties but to \n     prevent their abuse and protect the most basic liberty of \n     all: freedom from terror. New extradition laws will be \n     introduced; new rules to ensure asylum is not a front for \n     terrorist entry. This country is proud of its tradition in \n     giving asylum to those fleeing tyranny. We will always do so. \n     But we have a duty to protect the system from abuse.\n       It must be overhauled radically so that from now on, those \n     who abide by the rules get help and those that don't, can no \n     longer play the system to gain unfair advantage over others.\n       Round the world, 11 September is bringing Governments and \n     people to reflect, consider and change. And in this process, \n     amidst all the talk of war and action, there is another \n     dimension appearing.\n       There is a coming together. The power of community is \n     asserting itself. We are realising how fragile are our \n     frontiers in the face of the world's new challenges.\n       Today conflicts rarely stay within national boundaries.\n       Today a tremor in one financial market is repeated in the \n     markets of the world.\n       Today confidence is global; either its presence or its \n     absence.\n       Today the threat is chaos; because for people with work to \n     do, family life to balance, mortgages to pay, careers to \n     further, pensions to provide, the yearning is for order and \n     stability and if it doesn't exist elsewhere, it is unlikely \n     to exist here.\n       I have long believed this interdependence defines the new \n     world we live in.\n       People say: we are only acting because it's the USA that \n     was attacked. Double standards, they say. But when Milosevic \n     embarked on the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Kosovo, we \n     acted.\n       The sceptics said it was pointless, we'd make matters \n     worse, we'd make Milosevic stronger and look what happened, \n     we won, the refugees went home, the policies of ethnic \n     cleansing were reversed and one of the great dictators of the \n     last century, will see justice in this century.\n       And I tell you if Rwanda happened again today as it did in \n     1993, when a million people were slaughtered in cold blood, \n     we would have a moral duty to act there also. We were there \n     in Sierra Leone when a murderous group of gangsters \n     threatened its democratically elected Government and people.\n       And we as a country should, and I as Prime Minister do, \n     give thanks for the brilliance, dedication and sheer \n     professionalism of the British Armed Forces.\n       We can't do it all. Neither can the Americans.\n       But the power of the international community could, \n     together, if it chose to.\n       It could, with our help, sort out the blight that is the \n     continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \n     where three million people have died through war or famine in \n     the last decade.\n       A Partnership for Africa, between the developed and \n     developing world based around the New African Initiative, is \n     there to be done if we find the will.\n       On our side: provide more aid, untied to trade; write off \n     debt; help with good governance and infrastructure; training \n     to the soldiers, with UN blessing, in conflict resolution; \n     encouraging investment; and access to our markets so that we \n     practise the free trade we are so fond of preaching.\n       But it's a deal: on the African side: true democracy, no \n     more excuses for dictatorship, abuses of human rights; no \n     tolerance of bad governance, from the endemic corruption of \n     some states, to the activities of Mr Mugabe's henchmen in \n     Zimbabwe. Proper commercial, legal and financial systems.\n       The will, with our help, to broker agreements for peace and \n     provide troops to police them.\n       The state of Africa is a scar on the conscience of the \n     world. But if the world as a community focused on it, we \n     could heal it. And if we don't, it will become deeper and \n     angrier.\n       We could defeat climate change if we chose to. Kyoto is \n     right. We will implement it and call upon all other nations \n     to do so.\n       But it's only a start. With imagination, we could use or \n     find the technologies that create energy without destroying \n     our planet; we could provide work and trade without \n     deforestation.\n       If humankind was able, finally, to make industrial progress \n     without the factory conditions of the 19th Century; surely we \n     have the wit and will to develop economically without \n     despoiling the very environment we depend upon. And if we \n     wanted to, we could breathe new life into the Middle East \n     Peace Process and we must.\n       The state of Israel must be given recognition by all; freed \n     from terror; know that it is accepted as part of the future \n     of the Middle East not its very existence under threat. The \n     Palestinians must have justice, the chance to prosper and in \n     their own land, as equal partners with Israel in that future.\n       We know that. It is the only way, just as we know in our \n     own peace process, in Northern Ireland, there will be no \n     unification of Ireland except by consent--and there will be \n     no return to the days of unionist or Protestant supremacy \n     because those days have no place in the modern world. So the \n     unionists must accept justice and equality for nationalists.\n       The Republicans must show they have given up violence--not \n     just a ceasefire but weapons put beyond use. And not only the \n     Republicans, but those people who call themselves Loyalists, \n     but who by acts of terrorism, sully the name of the United \n     Kingdom.\n       We know this also. The values we believe in should shine \n     through what we do in Afghanistan.\n       To the Afghan people we make this commitment. The conflict \n     will not be the end. We will not walk away, as the outside \n     world has done so many times before.\n       If the Taliban regime changes, we will work with you to \n     make sure its successor is one that is broad-based, that \n     unites all ethnic groups, and that offers some way out of the \n     miserable poverty that is your present existence.\n       And, more than ever now, with every bit as much thought and \n     planning, we will assemble a humanitarian coalition alongside \n     the military coalition so that inside and outside \n     Afghanistan, the refugees, millions on the move even before \n     September 11, are given shelter, food and help during the \n     winter months.\n       The world community must show as much its capacity for \n     compassion as for force.\n       The critics will say: but how can the world be a community? \n     Nations act in their own self-interest. Of course they do. \n     But what is the lesson of the financial markets, climate \n     change, international terrorism, nuclear proliferation or \n     world trade? It is that our self-interest and our mutual \n     interests are today inextricably woven together.\n       This is the politics of globalisation.\n       I realise why people protest against globalisation.\n       We watch aspects of it with trepidation. We feel powerless, \n     as if we were now pushed to and fro by forces far beyond our \n     control.\n       But there's a risk that political leaders, faced with \n     street demonstrations, pander to the argument rather than \n     answer it. The demonstrators are right to say there's \n     injustice, poverty, environmental degradation.\n       But globalisation is a fact and, by and large, it is driven \n     by people.\n       Not just in finance, but in communication, in technology, \n     increasingly in culture, in recreation. In the world of the \n     internet, information technology and TV, there will be \n     globalisation. And in trade, the problem is not there's too \n     much of it; on the contrary there's too little of it.\n       The issue is not how to stop globalisation.\n       The issue is how we use the power of community to combine \n     it with justice. If\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n     globalisation works only for the benefit of the few, then it \n     will fail and will deserve to fail.\n       But if we follow the principles that have served us so well \n     at home--that power, wealth and opportunity must be in the \n     hands of the many, not the few--if we make that our guiding \n     light for the global economy, then it will be a force for \n     good and an international movement that we should take pride \n     in leading.\n       Because the alternative to globalisation is isolation.\n       Confronted by this reality, round the world, nations are \n     instinctively drawing together. In Quebec, all the countries \n     of North and South America deciding to make one huge free \n     trade area, rivalling Europe.\n       In Asia. In Europe, the most integrated grouping of all, we \n     are now 15 nations. Another 12 countries negotiating to join, \n     and more beyond that.\n       A new relationship between Russia and Europe is beginning.\n       And will not India and China, each with three times as many \n     citizens as the whole of the EU put together, once their \n     economies have developed sufficiently as they will do, not \n     reconfigure entirely the geopolitics of the world and in our \n     lifetime?\n       That is why, with 60 per cent of our trade dependent on \n     Europe, three million jobs tied up with Europe, much of our \n     political weight engaged in Europe, it would be a fundamental \n     denial of our true national interest to turn our backs on \n     Europe.\n       We will never let that happen.\n       For 50 years, Britain has, uncharacteristically, followed \n     not led in Europe. At each and every step.\n       There are debates central to our future coming up: how we \n     reform European economic policy; how we take forward European \n     defence; how we fight organised crime and terrorism.\n       Britain needs its voice strong in Europe and bluntly Europe \n     needs a strong Britain, rock solid in our alliance with the \n     USA, yet determined to play its full part in shaping Europe's \n     destiny.\n       We should only be part of the single currency if the \n     economic conditions are met. They are not window-dressing for \n     a political decision. They are fundamental. But if they are \n     met, we should join, and if met in this parliament, we should \n     have the courage of our argument, to ask the British people \n     for their consent in this Parliament.\n       Europe is not a threat to Britain. Europe is an \n     opportunity.\n       It is in taking the best of the Anglo-Saxon and European \n     models of development that Britain's hope of a prosperous \n     future lies. The American spirit of enterprise; the European \n     spirit of solidarity. We have, here also, an opportunity. Not \n     just to build bridges politically, but economically.\n       What is the answer to the current crisis? Not isolationism \n     but the world coming together with America as a community.\n       What is the answer to Britain's relations with Europe? Not \n     opting out, but being leading members of a community in \n     which, in alliance with others, we gain strength.\n       What is the answer to Britain's future? Not each person for \n     themselves, but working together as a community to ensure \n     that everyone, not just the privileged few get the chance to \n     succeed.\n       This is an extraordinary moment for progressive politics.\n       Our values are the right ones for this age: the power of \n     community, solidarity, the collective ability to further the \n     individual's interests.\n       People ask me if I think ideology is dead. My answer is:\n       In the sense of rigid forms of economic and social theory, \n     yes.\n       The 20th century killed those ideologies and their passing \n     causes little regret. But, in the sense of a governing idea \n     in politics, based on values, no. The governing idea of \n     modern social democracy is community. Founded on the \n     principles of social justice. That people should rise \n     according to merit not birth; that the test of any decent \n     society is not the contentment of the wealthy and strong, but \n     the commitment to the poor and weak.\n       But values aren't enough. The mantle of leadership comes at \n     a price: the courage to learn and change; to show how values \n     that stand for all ages, can be applied in a way relevant to \n     each age.\n       Our politics only succeed when the realism is as clear as \n     the idealism.\n       This party's strength today comes from the journey of \n     change and learning we have made.\n       We learnt that however much we strive for peace, we need \n     strong defence capability where a peaceful approach fails.\n       We learnt that equality is about equal worth, not equal \n     outcomes.\n       Today our idea of society is shaped around mutual \n     responsibility; a deal, an agreement between citizens not a \n     one-way gift, from the well-off to the dependent.\n       Our economic and social policy today owes as much to the \n     liberal social democratic tradition of Lloyd George, Keynes \n     and Beveridge as to the socialist principles of the 1945 \n     Government.\n       Just over a decade ago, people asked if Labour could ever \n     win again. Today they ask the same question of the \n     Opposition. Painful though that journey of change has been, \n     it has been worth it, every stage of the way.\n       On this journey, the values have never changed. The aims \n     haven't. Our aims would be instantly recognisable to every \n     Labour leader from Keir Hardie onwards. But the means do \n     change.\n       The journey hasn't ended. It never ends. The next stage for \n     New Labour is not backwards; it is renewing ourselves again. \n     Just after the election, an old colleague of mine said: \n     ``Come on Tony, now we've won again, can't we drop all this \n     New Labour and do what we believe in?''\n       I said: ``It's worse than you think. I really do believe in \n     it.''\n       We didn't revolutionise British economic policy--Bank of \n     England independence, tough spending rules--for some \n     managerial reason or as a clever wheeze to steal Tory \n     clothes.\n       We did it because the victims of economic incompetence--15 \n     per cent interest rates, 3m unemployed--are hard-working \n     families. They are the ones--and even more so, now--with \n     tough times ahead--that the economy should be run for, not \n     speculators, or currency dealers or senior executives whose \n     pay packets don't seem to bear any resemblance to the \n     performance of their companies.\n       Economic competence is the pre-condition of social justice.\n       We have legislated for fairness at work, like the minimum \n     wage which people struggled a century for. But we won't give \n     up the essential flexibility of our economy or our commitment \n     to enterprise.\n       Why? Because in a world leaving behind mass production, \n     where technology revolutionises not just companies but whole \n     industries, almost overnight, enterprise creates the jobs \n     people depend on.\n       We have boosted pensions, child benefit, family incomes. We \n     will do more. But our number one priority for spending is and \n     will remain education.\n       Why? Because in the new markets countries like Britain can \n     only create wealth by brain power not low wages and sweatshop \n     labour.\n       We have cut youth unemployment by 75 per cent.\n       By more than any government before us. But we refuse to pay \n     benefit to those who refuse to work. Why? Because the welfare \n     that works is welfare that helps people to help themselves.\n       The graffiti, the vandalism, the burnt out cars, the street \n     corner drug dealers, the teenage mugger just graduating from \n     the minor school of crime: we're not old fashioned or right-\n     wing to take action against this social menace.\n       We're standing up for the people we represent, who play by \n     the rules and have a right to expect others to do the same.\n       And especially at this time let us say: we celebrate the \n     diversity in our country, get strength from the cultures and \n     races that go to make up Britain today; and racist abuse and \n     racist attacks have no place in the Britain we believe in.\n       All these policies are linked by a common thread of \n     principle.\n       Now with this second term, our duty is not to sit back and \n     bask in it. It is across the board, in competition policy, \n     enterprise, pensions, criminal justice, the civil service and \n     of course public services, to go still further in the journey \n     of change. All for the same reason: to allow us to deliver \n     social justice in the modern world.\n       Public services are the power of community in action.\n       They are social justice made real. The child with a good \n     education flourishes. The child given a poor education lives \n     with it for the rest of their life. How much talent and \n     ability and potential do we waste? How many children never \n     know not just the earning power of a good education but the \n     joy of art and culture and the stretching of imagination and \n     horizons which true education brings? Poor education is a \n     personal tragedy and national scandal.\n       Yet even now, with all the progress of recent years, a \n     quarter of 11-year-olds fail their basic tests and almost a \n     half of 16 year olds don't get five decent GCSEs.\n       The NHS meant that for succeeding generations, anxiety was \n     lifted from their shoulders. For millions who get superb \n     treatment still, the NHS remains the ultimate symbol of \n     social justice.\n       But for every patient waiting in pain, that can't get \n     treatment for cancer or a heart condition or in desperation \n     ends up paying for their operation, that patient's suffering \n     is the ultimate social injustice.\n       And the demands on the system are ever greater. Children \n     need to be better and better educated.\n       People live longer. There is a vast array of new treatment \n     available.\n       And expectations are higher. This is a consumer age. People \n     don't take what they're given. They demand more.\n       We're not alone in this. All round the world governments \n     are struggling with the same problems.\n       So what is the solution? Yes, public services need more \n     money. We are putting in the largest ever increases in NHS, \n     education and transport spending in the next few years; and \n     on the police too. We will keep to those spending plans. And \n     I say in all honesty to the country: if we want that to \n     continue and the choice is between investment and tax cuts, \n     then investment must come first.\n       There is a simple truth we all know. For decades there has \n     been chronic under-investment in British public services. Our \n     historic mission is to put that right; and the historic shift \n     represented by the election of June 7 was that investment to \n     provide quality public services for all comprehensively \n     defeated short-term tax cuts for the few.\n       We need better pay and conditions for the staff; better \n     incentives for recruitment; and\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n     for retention. We're getting them and recruitment is rising.\n       This year, for the first time in nearly a decade, public \n     sector pay will rise faster than private sector pay.\n       And we are the only major government in Europe this year to \n     be increasing public spending on health and education as a \n     percentage of our national income.\n       This Party believes in public services; believes in the \n     ethos of public service; and believes in the dedication the \n     vast majority of public servants show; and the proof of it is \n     that we're spending more, hiring more and paying more than \n     ever before.\n       Public servants don't do it for money or glory. They do it \n     because they find fulfilment in a child well taught or a \n     patient well cared-for; or a community made safer and we \n     salute them for it.\n       All that is true. But this is also true.\n       That often they work in systems and structures that are \n     hopelessly old fashioned or even worse, work against the very \n     goals they aim for.\n       There are schools, with exactly the same social intake. One \n     does well; the other badly.\n       There are hospitals with exactly the same patient mix. One \n     performs well; the other badly.\n       Without reform, more money and pay won't succeed.\n       First, we need a national framework of accountability, \n     inspection; and minimum standards of delivery.\n       Second, within that framework, we need to free up local \n     leaders to be able to innovate, develop and be creative.\n       Third, there should be far greater flexibility in the terms \n     and conditions of employment of public servants.\n       Fourth, there has to be choice for the user of public \n     services and the ability, where provision of the service \n     fails, to have an alternative provider.\n       If schools want to develop or specialise in a particular \n     area; or hire classroom assistants or computer professionals \n     as well as teachers, let them. If in a Primary Care Trust, \n     doctors can provide minor surgery or physiotherapists see \n     patients otherwise referred to a consultant, let them.\n       There are too many old demarcations, especially between \n     nurses, doctors and consultants; too little use of the \n     potential of new technology; too much bureaucracy, too many \n     outdated practices, too great an adherence to the way we've \n     always done it rather than the way public servants would like \n     to do it if they got the time to think and the freedom to \n     act.\n       It's not reform that is the enemy of public services. It's \n     the status quo.\n       Part of that reform programme is partnership with the \n     private or voluntary sector.\n       Let's get one thing clear. Nobody is talking about \n     privatising the NHS or schools.\n       Nobody believes the private sector is a panacea.\n       There are great examples of public service and poor \n     examples. There are excellent private sector companies and \n     poor ones. There are areas where the private sector has \n     worked well; and areas where, as with parts of the railways, \n     it's been a disaster.\n       Where the private sector is used, it should not make a \n     profit simply by cutting the wages and conditions of its \n     staff.\n       But where the private sector can help lever in vital \n     capital investment, where it helps raise standards, where it \n     improves the public service as a public service, then to set \n     up some dogmatic barrier to using it, is to let down the very \n     people who most need our public services to improve.\n       This programme of reform is huge: in the NHS, education, \n     including student finance,--we have to find a better way to \n     combine state funding and student contributions criminal \n     justice; and transport.\n       I regard it as being as important for the country as Clause \n     IV's reform was for the Party, and obviously far more \n     important for the lives of the people we serve.\n       And it is a vital test for the modern Labour Party\n       If people lose faith in public services, be under no \n     illusion as to what will happen.\n       There is a different approach waiting in the wings. Cut \n     public spending drastically; let those that can afford to, \n     buy their own services; and those that can't, will depend on \n     a demoralised, sink public service. That would be a denial of \n     social justice on a massive scale.\n       It would be contrary to the very basis of community.\n       So this is a battle of values. Let's have that battle but \n     not amongst ourselves. The real fight is between those who \n     believe in strong public services and those who don't.\n       That's the fight worth having.\n       In all of this, at home and abroad, the same beliefs \n     throughout: that we are a community of people, whose self-\n     interest and mutual interest at crucial points merge, and \n     that it is through a sense of justice that community is born \n     and nurtured.\n       And what does this concept of justice consist of?\n       Fairness, people all of equal worth, of course. But also \n     reason and tolerance. Justice has no favourites; not amongst \n     nations, peoples or faiths.\n       When we act to bring to account those that committed the \n     atrocity of September 11, we do so, not out of bloodlust.\n       We do so because it is just. We do not act against Islam. \n     The true followers of Islam are our brothers and sisters in \n     this struggle. Bin Laden is no more obedient to the proper \n     teaching of the Koran than those Crusaders of the 12th \n     century who pillaged and murdered, represented the \n     teaching of the Gospel.\n       It is time the west confronted its ignorance of Islam. \n     Jews, Muslims and Christians are all children of Abraham.\n       This is the moment to bring the faiths closer together in \n     understanding of our common values and heritage, a source of \n     unity and strength.\n       It is time also for parts of Islam to confront prejudice \n     against America and not only Islam but parts of western \n     societies too.\n       America has its faults as a society, as we have ours.\n       But I think of the Union of America born out of the defeat \n     of slavery.\n       I think of its Constitution, with its inalienable rights \n     granted to every citizen still a model for the world.\n       I think of a black man, born in poverty, who became chief \n     of their armed forces and is now secretary of state Colin \n     Powell and I wonder frankly whether such a thing could have \n     happened here.\n       I think of the Statue of Liberty and how many refugees, \n     migrants and the impoverished passed its light and felt that \n     if not for them, for their children, a new world could indeed \n     be theirs.\n       I think of a country where people who do well, don't have \n     questions asked about their accent, their class, their \n     beginnings but have admiration for what they have done and \n     the success they've achieved.\n       I think of those New Yorkers I met, still in shock, but \n     resolute; the fire fighters and police, mourning their \n     comrades but still head held high.\n       I think of all this and I reflect: yes, America has its \n     faults, but it is a free country, a democracy, it is our ally \n     and some of the reaction to September 11 betrays a hatred of \n     America that shames those that feel it.\n       So I believe this is a fight for freedom. And I want to \n     make it a fight for justice too. Justice not only to punish \n     the guilty. But justice to bring those same values of \n     democracy and freedom to people round the world.\n       And I mean: freedom, not only in the narrow sense of \n     personal liberty but in the broader sense of each individual \n     having the economic and social freedom to develop their \n     potential to the full. That is what community means, founded \n     on the equal worth of all.\n       The starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, \n     those living in want and squalor from the deserts of Northern \n     Africa to the slums of Gaza, to the mountain ranges of \n     Afghanistan: they too are our cause.\n       This is a moment to seize. The Kaleidoscope has been \n     shaken. The pieces are in flux. Soon they will settle again. \n     Before they do, let us re-order this world around us.\n       Today, humankind has the science and technology to destroy \n     itself or to provide prosperity to all. Yet science can't \n     make that choice for us. Only the moral power of a world \n     acting as a community, can.\n       ``By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more \n     together than we can alone''.\n       For those people who lost their lives on September 11 and \n     those that mourn them; now is the time for the strength to \n     build that community. Let that be their memorial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10266-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10266-S10267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACTIVATING GUARD AND RESERVE UNITS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, one of the other things I did just a few \ndays ago--and I hope my colleagues will consider doing the same--was to \nvisit some of the Guard and Reserve units that are being activated.\n  When I asked for the opportunity to go to Scott Air Force Base in \nBelleville, just to spend a few moments with the men and women of the \n126th Air Guard Refueling Wing, I wasn't certain whether they would \nconsider this a colossal waste of time to have to have some political \nfigure come and drop by. Exactly the opposite happened.\n  It was an important experience for me, and I also think for many of \nthem, just to come by, have a few kind words, and to really thank them \nfor the sacrifice they have shown for this country.\n  This is an Air Guard unit that has been activated many times. It was \noriginally based at O'Hare and now is at Scott Air Force Base. They \nrefuel planes and are very important to any military effort of the \nUnited States. There were about 340 members of this unit, men and \nwomen, who have joined the military, understanding their lives would be \non the line. To go through the crowd there and meet each one of them, \nto talk for a few moments about their hometowns and their families, \nbaseball, and so many other things that are just part of American life, \nwas so refreshing and encouraging and, in a way, inspiring--spending \nthat time with them and General Kessler, who is their commanding \nofficer at Scott Air Force Base.\n  Theirs is a unit that has been activated, in part. And I am sure \nothers will be as well. The 182nd Airlift Wing\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nin Peoria is also a unit that is likely to be mobilized--the 183rd Air \nNational Guard Fighter Wing in Springfield, the 954th Air Reserve \nSupport Unit out of Scott Air Force Base, the 182nd Air National Guard \nSecurity Forces, the 126th Air National Guard Security Forces, and the \n183 National Guard Security Forces out of Springfield.\n  The one thing they raised to me--and I think at least bears some \ncomment in this Chamber--was their concern about their families once \nthey left. That is a natural feeling. It is one we ought to remind \nourselves of, that we have passed laws to protect these men and women \nin uniform who are activated so that they can return to their jobs \nwithout any loss of status, and also to help them in some financial \ncircumstances.\n  But beyond the laws, and beyond the Federal commitment, beyond the \npolitical speeches, I hope that every community across the United \nStates will offer a helping hand to the families of those in the Guard \nand Reserve who are now called on to serve our country, as well as the \nactive-duty men and women who are in harm's way at this moment in \nservice to our Nation.\n  Many times, as I went around Illinois, people would say: Senator, \nwhat can I do? I have given blood. I have sent my check in. The \nPresident has said to embrace my family. I did it; I do it every day. \nIs there anything more I can do? Think about the families of the men \nand women in uniform in your community who just may need a helping hand \nor a word of encouragement of perhaps a little more. That is something \nevery one of us should do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10267-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10267-S10268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to address this issue of aviation security, \nwhich has been addressed on the floor by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry. I note that Senator Torricelli is also in \nthe Chamber. We were in a meeting yesterday to discuss security \ntransportation security, not just aviation security. There are many of \nus served by Amtrak who believe that George Warrington, the CEO of \nAmtrak, has given us fair notice that he needs additional resources to \nmake certain that Amtrak continues to be one of the safest ways to \ntravel in America.\n  I believe there are over 600 Amtrak stations across this country. \nThey are putting in place the kind of security we want, to make certain \nthat no terrorist will see a target of opportunity in the metroliners \nor Amtrak trains that crisscross America.\n  I am happy, as I have noted at the beginning of my statement, to be a \ncosponsor of S. 1447 on aviation security. There are many provisions \nthat I think are excellent. I am happy to join Senator Hollings and so \nmany others, on a bipartisan basis, to support the bill. But we would \nbe remiss to believe that passing a bill on aviation security takes \ncare of our obligation, our responsibility. Beyond that, we have to \nlook to the traveling public and other vulnerabilities.\n  I agree with my colleagues who also have Amtrak service that we need \nto give to Amtrak the resources and the authority to make certain they \ncan upgrade their security and take a look at a lot of their vulnerable \ninfrastructure.\n  In this Chamber yesterday, Senator Torricelli talked about some of \nthe tunnels. George Warrington of Amtrak has brought this to my \nattention. Many of these tunnels date back to the Civil War in their \nconstruction.\n  They do not have adequate safety in the tunnels so that if anything \noccurred, the people on the train would be in a very perilous \nsituation. As these trains pass in the tunnels, literally hundreds if \nnot thousands of passengers are trusting that we are doing everything \nwe should do for the security of their transportation. I don't think we \nare doing enough. In fact, I believe we should include in this aviation \nsecurity bill the authorization for Amtrak to receive additional funds \nfor security.\n  I am troubled--I have to say this with some regret--that a lot of my \ncolleagues in the Senate who have had a very negative view of Amtrak as \na governmental function are translating that into a reluctance to \naddress these security and safety measures. I am not one of them. If we \ntake a look at the annual expenditure for transportation at the Federal \nlevel, we spend roughly $33 billion a year on highways, $12 billion a \nyear on airports--before the crisis--and about $500 million a year on \nAmtrak. Anyone in the State of Illinois and in many States across the \nNation knows that if we are going to have a balanced transportation \nsystem, we need all three. We need aviation, good highway \ntransportation and mass transit, and a national rail passenger \ncorporation such as Amtrak.\n  It is no surprise to me, as I have been on the trains more often \nsince September 11 than before, that more and more Americans are \nturning there.\n  We have an obligation to protect them, not to wait until there is an \naccident or something worse. I hope my colleagues will reconsider their \nopposition to Amtrak security authorization and appropriations. We \nshould do it, and we should do it now without question.\n  Our commitment should be to every American to make their \ntransportation as safe as humanly possible.\n  Let me address the aviation security issue for a minute. Yesterday, \nin my office I had representatives of the three major international \ncorporations involved in aviation airport screening and security. They \ntold me an interesting story. For those who may not be aware, until \nthis moment in time, we have given to the airlines the responsibility \nto contract out the security and screening stations at the airports. We \nhave found, as we have looked into it, that going to the lowest bidder \nin some circumstances meant that you didn't have an employee who was \nadequately compensated or trained.\n  I will quickly add that in my hometown of Springfield, IL, and many \nairports I have visited, the people working the screening equipment are \ndoing an extraordinarily good job. Any one of us who has been through \nan airport at any time in the past few years knows that too often you \nhave found at those security stations employees who were not taking it \nseriously.\n  Examine the analysis from the GAO, and it turns out that the turnover \nin some of the airports is 100 percent a year, 200 percent a year and, \nin the worst case, over 400 percent a year. The employees come and go \nif they are given an opportunity to take a job at Cinnabon or anywhere \nelse in the airport. They are quickly gone from the screening stations. \nWe have not taken this responsibility seriously, nor have the airlines.\n  Now we face a new day. The private contractors who came to me \nyesterday said that it is a different world altogether overseas. In \nfact, one of them noted the fact that in Israel it is a private company \nthat handles the security at the airport with certification by the \nGovernment and supervision by the Government, as is the case in many \nEuropean capitals. I don't know if we can safely move in our own minds \nfrom what we see today with these same companies to a model using those \ncompanies in a different context.\n\n  When I asked Secretary Mineta last week to describe for me how this \nmight work, the details were still forthcoming. That left me a little \nbit cold. Many of my colleagues share the belief that the safest way to \naddress this, as we do in the bill, is to say that we will federalize \nthe security and safety at airports. This bill goes beyond the \nscreening station and talks about the responsibility under this bill. \nLet me quote from it on the security operations:\n\n       The administrator shall establish and enforce rules to \n     improve the fiscal security of air traffic control \n     facilities, parked aircraft, aircraft servicing equipment, \n     aircraft supplies, automobile parking facilities, access and \n     transition areas at airports served by other means of ground \n     or water transportation.\n\n  The important thing is that this bill goes far beyond the screening \nstations at the airports. I believe if we are going to maintain safety \nat airports and on our airplanes, it has to be a secure environment. \nThat means we are not only conscious and sensitive to what passengers \nbring onto airplanes but every single person who has contact with an \nairplane. A caterer, a clean-up crew, refueling personnel, someone who \nis a mechanic coming on board, or baggage handlers, all of them have to \nbe supervised to make certain that those airplanes are secure. This \nbill does it. It does it through federalization.\n  I think we should view the safety of our airports and airplanes as \nmatters\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nof national security. After September 11, we can do no less.\n  I hope we enact this legislation and do it very quickly so that we \ncan have in place a system that will help to restore confidence in the \nflying public.\n  I am happy to report in my own personal experience more and more \npeople are returning to airports. I am glad that is the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10268-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FIGHTING TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. As a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, \nwe have had a number of requests from the administration for new \nauthority to collect information to fight terrorism. You will find that \nthe vast majority of requests by the administration will be honored in \nthe bill we will consider this week or next.\n  We will say to FBI and the CIA, other law enforcement agencies: Here \nare new tools for you to fight terrorism.\n  We should give to it them because we need to provide them what is \nnecessary to protect our Nation. Certainly we need to keep our laws up \nto pace with the changes in technology so that when communications are \nmoving by e-mail or through the use of cell telephones, we give to law \nenforcement the authority and the opportunity to make certain they have \naccess to them.\n  I am concerned, as are many on the Judiciary Committee, that it isn't \njust a question of the new authority to collect information but a more \nfundamental question: Do these agencies of law enforcement have the \ninfrastructure and the capacity to collect, process, evaluate, and \ndistribute this information?\n  It was only a few weeks ago that the Senate Judiciary Committee had \nits first oversight hearing in 20 years on the FBI.\n  The information that came to us suggests that FBI computer \ncapabilities are archaic, that no successful business in America could \noperate with the computers we have given to the premier law enforcement \nagency in America. Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that computer \ncapability is as important, if not more important, than additional \nauthorization in the law to collect information?\n  Things are being done. A man by the name of Bob Dies left the IBM \nCorporation and came to the Department of Justice to modernize their \ncomputer systems. I trust him. I believe he has a good mind. He can \nhelp us out of this terrible situation into modern computer technology.\n  When I sat down with Mr. Dies yesterday and asked him the problems he \nran into, he gave me an example. We know there is software available \nthat would allow us to see the coordinates of any location in America, \ncross streets in the city of Boston or the city of Chicago, and then \nwith this software, with concentric circles, see all of the important \nsurrounding structures, the buildings, the hospitals, whether there is \nany type of nuclear facilities or electric substations, all within that \nregion. Think of how valuable that is when we are fighting terrorism.\n  If they receive a notice at the FBI that there has been an explosion \nat a certain location, by using this software they can immediately see \nbefore them all of the potential targets and all of the worrisome areas \naround that explosion. That seems to be an obvious tool. Wouldn't you \nassume the FBI already had it? They don't. They don't have access to it \nbecause when Mr. Dies said he wanted to buy this software for the FBI--\nand they were excited about receiving it--he was told: First you have \nto draw up, under Federal procurement laws, a request with specific \nelements in it as to what you want in this software, and then we have \nto have it put out for bid. We think in about a year we can get it for \nyou.\n  The average American can go right now and buy the software off the \nshelf. It is absolutely unforgivable that that basic tool and so many \nothers are being denied to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies \nbecause of the bureaucratic mess we have in procurement in this Nation.\n  I am working at this moment on legislation that will allow an \nexception to our procurement laws in areas of national need and \nnational emergency. We should have a certification process that will \nallow us to step back from this morass of bureaucracy and get to the \npoint of bringing modern computers into the FBI so that all the names \nand all the tips and all the information collected can be processed, \nformulated, evaluated, and distributed so that the names of suspects \ncan be given to the Federal Aviation Administration and, in turn, given \nto all of the airlines so that they can do their job when people apply \nfor a ticket.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska).

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ncomments. He could not be more correct about the problems with the FBI. \nIn fact, the FBI had a lot of information regarding the potential of \nthe events on September 11 4 and 5 years ago, I have learned, in \ncertain compartments. Regrettably, just because of the \ncompartmentalization and the process, that information was never \nadequately followed up on, as I think we will learn over the course of \nthe next few months. We regret that.\n  There needs to be an enormous amount of work done in the coordination \nof the processing of information between the CIA and the FBI. The FBI, \nobviously, has been much more focused on prosecuting crimes after they \nhappen and not necessarily on taking information and evaluating it in \nthe context of a crime that may happen. The CIA has been much more \ninvolved in the processing of information. Their human intelligence \ncomponent in the CIA has been so devastated in the last 10, 15 years, \nthat we are light years behind where we ought to be.\n  I will correct my colleague. We had the security chief from El Al in \nyesterday with Senator Hollings. He said that every facet of airline \nsecurity is in fact Government managed at this point--in fact, the \nemployees. I don't know if that was an older process or what. \nYesterday, El Al gave us a clear description of how they are doing it \nnow. It is entirely managed by the Government, which is precisely what \nwe are suggesting ought to happen here.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry pertaining to the introduction of S. 1499 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, when this Chamber was new and Members \nof the Senate were gathering in their first years, they were confronted \nwith the reality of a civil war which had consumed over 860,000 lives \nand the rebuilding of our Republic. Even with those daunting tasks, \nthere was a recognition that somehow the institutions of our Government \nhad failed to deal with the crisis, to avert the struggle.\n  Even in that atmosphere, those who preceded us created a board of \ninquiry as to the reasons of the war and how it was executed and what \nmight lie ahead for the country.\n  That civil war debate created a foundation which through two \ncenturies has created a consistent pattern for this Congress. In times \nof national trouble or trauma, part of dealing with\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nthe realities of our problems and preparing for the future required a \ndispassionate analysis of the problem.\n  While survivors were still being taken out of the North Atlantic from \nthe sinking of the Titanic, a board of inquiry met to determine the \nfailures of maritime safety.\n  Three weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, a board of \ninquiry began to examine why our Nation was not prepared and how the \ninstitutions of our country had failed to respond to the looming threat \nand the reality of the attack.\n  In the ensuing years, we returned again and again to this trusted \nform of analysis that allowed our people to trust a result and the \nCongress to prepare to avoid the same circumstances in the future: a \ncommission that was formed after the assassination of President Kennedy \nand the board that convened after the Challenger accident.\n  In each of these instances, I have no doubt a Senator rose and said \nit is difficult to deal with examining the reasons for the war of 1861 \nbecause our time is consumed with the reality of the situation. How can \none deal with the reality of the situation if we do not know the \nreasons for the problem?\n  How can we simply give more resources to the same institutions, more \npower to those institutions if we doubted they had the ability or used \nthose powers or resources properly in the first instance? Indeed, one \ncan only imagine when President Roosevelt required a board of inquiry \non preparedness and the response to Pearl Harbor how admirals and \ngenerals, scrambling to defend the Nation and execute the war, must \nhave felt about diverting resources to deal with the inquiry.\n  It was recognized by those who sat in these chairs before us, as we \nshould recognize now, that the credibility of the institutions \ninvolved, the confidence in their leadership, a dispassionate, removed \nanalysis of their powers is a foundation before implementing a new \npolicy to avert the same problems.\n  A number of my colleagues are joining with me in the coming days in \nintroducing legislation to create a board of inquiry regarding the \nterrorist attacks of September 11. It is my intention to offer it as an \namendment to legislation that is currently working its way through the \nSenate dealing with this tragedy.\n  As the Senate properly responds to the administration's request for \nmore power in Federal institutions, the people need to know how those \ninstitutions use the power they possess and to restore confidence in \nthose institutions as they execute these powers.\n  The Senate properly allocates billions of dollars more for national \nsecurity and law enforcement and the protection of our people. People \nof our country justifiably will want to know, as antiterrorist \nactivities in the last 5 years increased by 300 percent, why that money \nwas not sufficient or why it failed to protect our country.\n  It speaks well of this Congress that we are willing to do so much to \nprotect our country, to avert a future terrorist attack, but I have \n3,000 families in New Jersey who have a husband or a mother or a wife \nor a child who will never come home. Of the 6,500 potentially dead \nvictims of the New York attack alone, and the hundreds of families in \nVirginia, the families of New Jersey are going to want to know not \nsimply what are we doing in the future, but what happened in the past.\n  How did an intelligence community that is larger financially than the \nmilitary establishments of our largest rivals fail to uncover the \nintentions of these terrorists? How did all of our technology prove \nunable to intercept their communications? How, with all of the \ninterceptions that have taken place, were we unable to analyze the \ninformation and predict the attack? How, indeed, in law enforcement, \ngiven the presence of these same terrorist organizations in previous \nattacks from the same locations on the same target, were we unable to \ninfiltrate these organizations?\n  It may well be that there is a good explanation for each of these \nfailures. Indeed, it may prove that everything that was humanly \npossible was done to the fullest extent conceivable. It may be there \nare institutional failures and conflicts, so that all the money \nconceivable will not prevent a future attack if powers are not properly \ndistributed or the proper people do not have authority or there are \nbreakdowns in command or communication.\n  I cannot predict any of these answers, but what is important is \nneither can anyone else in this Congress or the administration because \nwithout some analysis, as we have done throughout our country's \nhistory, we will never know. Indeed, if we fail to have a board of \ninquiry in the midst of this crisis about these circumstances, I \nbelieve history will instruct us it will be the first time in the \nhistory of the Republic that the Government did not hold itself \naccountable and subject to analysis when our American people have faced \na crisis of this magnitude.\n  The people deserve an answer. The Government should hold itself \naccountable, and only a board of inquiry, independent of the Congress \nand the Executive, has the credibility to do it.\n  Dealing with the issue of accountability for the past, I want to, for \na moment, deal with prevention in the future. This Senate is rightfully \nresponding to the problem of the hijackings by comprehensive \nlegislation dealing with airline security. It is only right and proper \nwe should do so. Our Nation is dependent on the airlines. The economic \ncontagion from this tragedy has affected every State in our Union. \nCynics will decry that we are simply closing the barn door, but indeed \nthere is no choice but to do so lest terrorists travel through that \nbarn door again.\n  What is significant is it is not adequate to respond to these \nterrorist attacks, enhancing the security of our people, by responding \nin one dimension. It is unlikely these terrorists or others who would \nconspire with them, or act in concert with their actions, will respond \nagain in the same manner by the same mode as the last terrorist \nattacks. If indeed the bin Laden organization is responsible, the \nhistory of their actions suggests each time they strike they strike in \na different mode, in a different method, sometimes in a different \nplace.\n  Obviously, I support this airline security legislation but it is not \nenough. From our reservoirs to our powerplants to other modes of \ntransportation, we need to secure the Nation. It needs to be more \ncomprehensive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time in morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Many of my colleagues have joined me in insisting the \nAirline Security Act also include rail security. We do so for the \nfollowing reason: In my State alone, nearly a quarter of a million \npeople ride railroads every day, many of them through old tunnels. The \ntunnels under the Hudson River were built between 1911 and 1920. As \nthis photograph illustrates, they are largely without ventilation. This \nis a single fan to exhaust smoke from a fire in a two and a half mile \ntunnel.\n  Every Amtrak Metroliner, if fully loaded, under the Hudson River or \nthe Baltimore tunnels, or even the approaches to Washington, DC, \ncarries 2,000 passengers, more than three times the number of people on \na 747. The tunnels do not have ventilation and they do not have \nescapes.\n  As this second photograph illustrates, under the East River of New \nYork and under the Hudson River, a single spiral staircase serves to \nexit 500 to 2,000 passengers. The same spiral staircase would be used \nfor firefighters getting to the train. It is obviously not adequate.\n  Last August, before these attacks occurred, the New York State \nCommission said it was a disaster waiting to happen. Those are not the \nonly problems. We need police officers on Amtrak trains. We need to \nscreen luggage. We need to ensure that switching mechanisms are \nsafeguarded and secure. This Congress will do a good deed for the \nAmerican people if indeed we secure our airlines, but it is unlikely we \nwould be so fortunate that terrorists will choose this same method and \nmode for the next attack.\n  Securing Amtrak and commuter trains is essential. The legislation we \nwill offer, $3.2 billion, will secure the tunnels, hire police \nofficers, assure screening, and bring our train transportation network \nto the same new high standards as our aircraft.\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\n  It is essential. It is timely, and I hope my colleagues around the \ncountry understand those of us in the Northeast and the great \nmetropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Boston cannot \nyield on this point, not with hundreds of thousands of commuters having \ntheir lives depending upon it every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the day of September 11 has been \neloquently described by the preceding speaker, Senator Torricelli. Its \nconsequences are unknown. In fact, one of the great questions none of \nus can answer at this point is: What are the unintended consequences of \nwhat will follow this attack over a period of weeks and months?\n  However, this is not our purpose. Our purpose is to get an aviation \nsecurity bill done. That is why this Senator from West Virginia chooses \nto speak.\n  I wish to make a couple of very clear points. We have not yet passed \nan aviation security bill. There were those who said, no, you cannot \nwork on the aviation industry's financial condition until you have done \nan aviation security bill. That was an understandable argument, as well \nas those who talk about people who have lost their jobs. There really \nwas not much point in doing an aviation security bill if there weren't \nany airplanes flying. That had to be done as a first order of business.\n  They are flying. They have picked up a modest amount of business. It \nhas increased about 7 percent in the last week, but they are still in a \nvery bad position, even with the money we gave them after forcing them \nto ground all of their airplanes for a period of time.\n  In any event, that and the loan guarantees part is done and so now we \nmove on to aviation security, which we ought to do. One could say, \nwell, that is a fairly easy subject. We could go ahead and do that \npromptly and without much fuss.\n  That is not quite the case. There is a lot involved, which is \nserious, which is complex, a lot of back and forth about which is the \nbest agency to do this or that and how do people feel about it, what \nare the costs involved.\n  That being said, the Department of Transportation, under President \nBush's leadership, immediately after September 11, took some very \nstrong steps with respect to our airports and our airlines. Within \ndays, Congress sent, as I have indicated, its strong support with an \nemergency financial package that, in fact, included $3 billion, still \nunknown to most people, for airport security. That was included to be \nused at the discretion of the President, which was fine. Most of that \nhas been used for sky marshals and other items. Urgent aviation \nsecurity efforts are already in place. The money is there. Now we are \ntalking about a bill for a broader aviation security purpose.\n  In the few weeks that have passed since September 11, a large group \nhas been working around the clock through a lot of very contentious \nissues, not easy issues, to try to resolve what should be in an \naviation security bill that would best serve the Nation, not just in \nthe next months but in the coming years. One can say, therefore, that \nthe Aviation Security Act is a result of these efforts. It is not \nfinally worked out. There was to be a meeting this morning with the \nSecretary of Transportation. He was called to the White House. There \nare still details pending. That is not the point. We are on it and \nmoving at the point, for those who come down to speak on it, because we \nwant this done if at all possible this week, with the American people \nknowing that aviation security is at the top of our legislative agenda.\n\n  I am very proud to have joined Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, \nSenator Hutchinson as original cosponsors, and I rise in strong support \nof the managers' amendment because we have been working closely with \nSenator Lott and Senator Daschle. I can report there is broad \nbipartisan support within this body on both sides of the aisle as to \nwhat we ought to do. That has come through in meetings and compromises. \nThat is a very important fact and bodes well for the bill.\n  The truth is, the horrific attacks of September 11 do reflect broad \nintelligence and other failures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10270-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10270-S10274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the morning hour be extended for 1 hour, until 12:30, with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The fault of these attacks clearly lies with those \nwho perpetrated them, but the failures are all our shared \nresponsibilities. There is no way to get away from that.\n  On the other hand, they are also a shared opportunity. I have long \nargued and made many speeches that we have a habit in the Congress, and \nto some extent in our country, of taking aviation for granted, knowing \nvery little about its details, complaining when we are delayed but not \nmaking the effort to understand what aviation entails, what happens \nwhen passenger traffic doubles--as everybody knew would happen before \nSeptember 11, and which I believe will come to be true again. This is \nan opportunity, this horrible tragedy, to set a number of accounts \nstraight in terms of the way we secure our airports.\n  We have to develop, we have to fund, we have to implement a better \nand changed way of providing security--particularly true after \nSeptember 11. Had it never happened, we still should have been doing \nit. Instead, we were concentrating on air traffic control, runways, \nmatters of this sort that are tremendously important, but we were not \nfocused on security. That has to change. The Aviation Security Act \ngives us the chance to do exactly that.\n  First and foremost, the bill restores the basic responsibility for \nsecurity to its rightful place. That is with Federal law enforcement \nrather than with the airlines and the airports, which can neither \nafford it nor do it properly. This is not a question of private \nsecurity companies. There is absolutely no other segment of American \nlife in which we need national security contracted out to the private \nsector. Until last month, the airports' private security companies had \nin fact managed to ensure that ours was the safest system in the world. \nLet that be said. It always has been, always will be. But there is \npublic concern that if there is an accident, it will be of a very large \nnature; if there is terrorism in our future, it will be of a very large \nnature. We have to begin to think about all things more seriously. We \nwant the safest system in the world. We have the safest system in the \nworld, but it has to be a lot better.\n\n  Law enforcement has to be fulfilled by the Federal Government. \nEverybody agrees on that, both sides of the aisle. The Bush \nadministration is working on that, leaning towards that. We owe it to \nthe American people to take profitability out of aviation safety \naltogether.\n  This bill, still subject to some details that have to be worked out--\nbut that is good, that is not bad; we are moving--creates a new Deputy \nSecretary for Transportation Security, with ultimate responsibility for \ninteragency aviation security, and expands the air marshal program to \nprovide armed, expert marshals on both domestic and international \nflights, and increases Federal law enforcement for airport perimeter \nand for air traffic control facilities--not just getting in and out of \nairports but the complete perimeter of the airport. Screening will also \nbe monitored as it has never been monitored before by armed Federal law \nenforcement. It will be conducted in virtually all cases by a Federal \nscreening workforce.\n  When you walk into a small airport, you will see uniforms, pistols, \nscreeners who, like everybody else in this country, are going to have \nto be trained more or less from ground zero because the training is \ninsufficient, the turnover is horrendous. It is a national \nembarrassment. The whole level of training will have to be raised very \ndramatically in urban and in rural airports. In rural airports there is \na possibility, where there are five or six flights a day, you don't \nneed full-time\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nsecurity. There we would have deputized local police officers who are \nfederally trained at the highest levels and who are federally funded. \nSo there is no net difference, no first and second class airport. It is \na question of making sure the rural airports have the security they \nneed. We will be sure of that.\n  On board the aircraft, the bill requires strengthening cockpit doors. \nWe had a fascinating discussion at length with El Al. They have a \ndouble set of doors with space in between so if even a hijacker were \nable to get through one, he or she probably could not possibly get \nthrough the second. That, obviously, would take reconfiguration, would \ntake some time, and it would take some costs. We have to do what is \nnecessary. Does a pilot come out of a cockpit, for example, to use the \nlavatory? I am not for that. I think lavatories ought to be inside the \ncockpit. A cockpit should be absolutely inviolate--nobody gets in. If \nnobody gets in, there will be no more hijackings. El Al has not had \nany, and I don't expect them to. Even flight attendants will not have \nkeys to be able to get into the cockpit. No one will be able to access \nthe plane's controls other than the pilot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It will take some time. People should understand \nthat. We cannot take a workforce without sufficient training and \nupgrade it in a day, in a month. You don't quickly reconfigure \nairplanes in the way we will have to with sky marshals, through cockpit \narrangements. It will take time. People need to understand that. If \nthey want airport security totally now, we can give them a lot of that, \nbut we cannot give it all to them immediately; it will take time. The \nfederalization will give people confidence this will be done at the \nhighest level.\n  We have anti-hijack training for pilots and flight attendants. We \npropose to pay for this with passenger security fees, authorizing DOT \nto reimburse airports for the costs incurred by them since September \n11. Most have no idea that is coming, but it is. We will help them pay \ntheir costs. We will give airports temporary flexibility to pay for \ntheir security responsibilities under the AIP program. They can't do \nthat now. We will give them that flexibility. They can pay for security \nequipment and infrastructure, but they cannot pay for any direct \nexpenditures such as salaries and the rest.\n  It will be a very good bill.\n  We are looking at security with biometric and hand-retina recognition \ndevices. As the bill comes before us and as we debate it, there can be \nno higher order of magnitude for our Senate concentration than this \nbill as it emerges.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just over 2 weeks ago I came to this floor \nand talked about the 20-year history of aviation security. I did so for \na simple reason. There has been a very clear pattern on this issue over \nthe last 20 years. Again and again there has been a tragedy in the sky. \nAgain and again there has been widespread public outrage. Again and \nagain there has been widespread agreement on what needs to be done to \nimprove aviation security. Again and again the real reforms weren't \nimplemented because of political infighting.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to say that this time it \nreally has to be different. This time the Senate needs to come together \non a bipartisan basis and make sure these changes are actually \nimplemented. I wanted to make this appeal for bipartisanship because \nthat is what Chairman Hollings--I see my friend Senator McCain on the \nfloor as well--and Senator McCain are trying to do in the Senate \nCommerce Committee with the legislation that we would like to have \ntaken up.\n  I happen to believe that, as a result of the determination and the \npersistence of Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain, we are now talking \nabout legislation that will bring new accountability on this aviation \nsecurity issue. The bill is not about political ideology. The Hollings-\nMcCain legislation is about accountability--about ensuring that the \nFederal Government on a national security issue is accountable. Nobody \nin the Senate would ever think about subcontracting out our national \nsecurity. But that is regrettably what has happened in the aviation \nsector for so many years.\n  I went back through some of the history almost 2 weeks ago on the \nfloor of the Senate. It started really after the Pan Am Flight 103 \nbombing over Lockerbie in 1988. We saw it again after the TWA Flight \n800 crashed near Long Island. In each case Presidential commissions \nwere established, and there was unanimity about what needed to be done, \nwith the General Accounting Office and the Department of Transportation \ninspector general outlining the vulnerabilities and then political \ninfighting started.\n  I am very hopeful the Senate will support the bipartisan effort being \nled by Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain. I have felt for way too \nlong that there isn't enough bipartisanship on important issues of \ntoday. Senator Smith and I are trying to do it in our home State of \nOregon. I think Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain are trying to do \nit in this Chamber with this legislation.\n  If we don't get this done, I fear we will be back on the floor of \nthis body in 6 months or a year with Senator after Senator taking their \nturn once again in a procession of floor speeches about how sorry and \nupset the Senate is that another tragedy has occurred--that another \ntragedy occurred because the Senate failed to act promptly to put in \nplace the safeguards that I have documented on the floor of this Senate \nand that have been called for now repeatedly in the last 20 years.\n  I am hopeful that in the hours ahead--I appreciate what Chairman \nHollings and Senator McCain are trying to do--we can deal with the \nadditional issues that are outstanding and get this legislation \nreported.\n  Let me touch on two other matters. The second issue I would like to \nmention is this: The rule and the procedures that are going to be set \nout will define what the aviation industry is all about for years and \nyears to come. I am talking now about the rule that is going to be set \nin place with respect to loans and loan guarantees that are going to go \na long way in determining whether there is real competition in the \nairline sector, affordable prices, and whether places in rural Nebraska \nand rural Oregon are serviced. I have outlined what I think are six or \nseven key principles that ought to govern how those loans and loan \nguarantees are made.\n\n  What concerns me is that those decisions are being made behind closed \ndoors. They are being made outside the public debate. There is \nconsiderable discussion about whether the large airlines may, in fact, \nhave an agenda that will crush the small airlines. I am very hopeful \nthat Members of this body will weigh in between now and Saturday with \nthe Office of Management and Budget as they make the rules that are \ngoing to govern these loans and loan guarantees.\n  One last point: Something that I and Senator Smith are together on is \nthe pride in our State and our citizens. A number of Oregonians, \nstrong-willed people in our State, are mounting an operation that they \ncall Flight for Freedom, answering the national call for all of us to \nget on with our lives and come to the aid of those hurt in the attacks \nof September 11. In a show of solidarity with their fellow Americans, \nmore than 700 Oregonians are making the statement this weekend by \nheading to the hotels and Broadway shows and restaurants in New York \nCity that are fighting for economic survival in the aftermath of the \nattack. With Oregonians' Flight for Freedom, the people of my State are \nstanding shoulder to shoulder with the citizens of New York in an \neffort to make clear that no terrorist can break the American spirit.\n  I congratulate Sho Dozono and the other organizers and participants \nin Oregon's Flight for Freedom for their generous efforts. I urge all \nAmericans to follow their example. Oregonians are showing this weekend \nthat we are going to stand against terrorism by\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\nreaching out to fellow citizens and enjoying what American life has to \noffer in our centers of commerce across this great Nation. Because of \nthese kinds of efforts, we can send a message that terrorists can't \nextinguish the American spirit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nkind words about the work we have done together on the Commerce \nCommittee on other issues. It has been a distinct honor for me to have \nthe benefit of the relationship we developed over the years. I am very \ngrateful for his involvement in issues such as Internet tax, aviation, \nand many others. I believe he is correct in that we have been able to \ndisplay from time to time the degree of cooperation working together on \ncommon goals about which I think the American people are very pleased.\n  If you believe the latest polls, Americans have never been more \npleased at the way we have been performing in a bipartisan fashion. I \nthank the Senator from Oregon for his kind words.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes to talk about where we are and \nwhere we need to go on airport security and airline security. I am sure \nall of us by now know that a Russian airliner was shot down a few hours \nago. They are not exactly sure why. But I think that may, at least in \nthe minds of some of us, emphasize the need for us to proceed with \nwhatever measures we can take to ensure safety but also as importantly \nto restore confidence in the American people in their ability to \nutilize air transportation in America in as safe a manner as possible.\n  There is no doubt that there are millions of Americans who are still \neither concerned about or afraid of flying on commercial airlines. We \nneed to move forward with this legislation.\n  What is hanging it up? One is there is a disagreement between \nsponsors of the bill, Senator Hollings, myself, Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Rockefeller, and the administration on the issue of \nfederalization of employees. There are different approaches. But I \nthink we can at least have serious negotiations and come to some \nagreement. I believe that is not only possible but probable.\n  The second point is the concern about the addition of nongermane \namendments to the legislation--whether it be Amtrak, whether it be on \nthe so-called Carnahan amendment which extends unemployment benefits \nand other benefits to people whose lives were affected by the shutdown \nof the airlines.\n  I think all of us are in sympathy with those individuals, all of \nthem, particularly those at National Airport, who had a more extended \nperiod of unemployment as a direct result of an order of the Federal \nGovernment. I am not sure how a conservative or liberal could argue the \npoint that since it was a Government action it would be hard for us to \nnot justify some assistance to those people whose lives were directly \naffected.\n  As we all know, hundreds of thousands or so of airline employees' \nlives are affected by layoffs that the major airlines have already \nannounced. So there is a significant problem out there. But I would \nmake a strong case that this is an airline/airport security bill. This \nis to improve aviation security. It is not a bill for unemployment \ncompensation or any other. This legislation is directly tailored to \naviation security and airline safety.\n  Last week, we passed a bill to give financial relief to the airlines. \nThat was what it was about. That is for what it was tailored. We did \nnot add extraneous amendments.\n  So I have to say to my colleagues that I think it is not the time to \nadd that to an aviation security bill, especially in light of the fact \nthat we all know within a week or two we are going to take up a \nstimulus package. Clearly, that issue would be addressed in some shape \nor form when the stimulus package is considered.\n  So I intend to oppose any nongermane amendment to this legislation. I \nbelieve there are at least 41 of us, if not 51 of us, who would object, \nso therefore we would not have the bill become bogged down in extended \ndebate.\n  Those who insist on putting a nongermane amendment on an aviation \nsecurity bill would then be responsible for preventing passage of a \nbill that has to do with aviation security.\n  So I hope those Members who are concerned and committed to assisting \nthose whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown of the \nairlines--we are in complete sympathy with them and we intend to act. \nAnd we intend to negotiate a reasonable package that would provide some \nbenefits and compensation, depending on how directly their lives were \naffected, et cetera--something that, by the way, we would have to have \na lot of facts and figures about, too. But to put it on this bill would \nbe obfuscation, delay, and prevention of us acting to ensure the safety \nand security of airlines and airline passengers throughout America.\n  So I want to make that perfectly clear, that we should not have any \namendment, no matter how virtuous it may be, on an airport and airline \nsecurity bill.\n  I hope we can move forward with this bill. There are a lot of Members \nwho want to talk about it. There are not too many amendments. We could \nget this thing done today if we could move forward on it and have some \nagreement.\n  I also remind my colleagues that we are in negotiation and will \ncontinue to try to work with the administration. We also have to work \nwith the Members of the House on this legislation as well. But for us \nto delay because we have our own pet agendas, our own specific \npriorities, and not act as speedily as possible to restore confidence \non the part of the American people in their ability to get on an \nairline is somewhat of an abrogation of our responsibilities.\n  I am pleased that Senator Hollings, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, has also pledged to oppose any nongermane amendments as \nwell.\n  So, Mr. President, I really want to emphasize that we need to move \nforward. I think it would be wrong of us to go into the weekend without \ndoing so, at least making some progress. We are prepared to do so, and \nI hope we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to discuss for a little bit the \nairline issue. I thank my friend from Arizona for the work he has done \non this issue. Certainly, security in flying is an issue on which all \nof us want to move forward. So this is not a failure to act.\n  Some people have said we are holding it up, it is slow, and so on. I \ndo not think that is the case at all. I think what is the case is that \nthis is a very important issue. This is an issue that could be done in \nseveral ways. I think there is a legitimate effort to try to ensure \nthat we think it through enough to come up with a process that would \nmost likely achieve the goals that we have; that is, of course, safety \nand security on airlines.\n  There are a number of different issues that need to be talked about, \nbut I do not think there is a soul in this body who does not want to \nmove forward on airline security. It is the security issue of the \nmoment.\n  There needs to be some major changes in the process. We have had \nsecurity for some time. We have a higher security level now, I believe, \nthan we did before September 11. I happen to have been in Wyoming three \ntimes since then and have found that there is security. There are armed \npeople in Dulles, for example--more security. Is it enough? Probably \nnot. We probably need to do it better and more professionally. And that \nis what this is all about.\n  But I do want to make the point that I think you will see airline \npassenger numbers going up. There is more security than there has been \nin the past, but we need to change the process. And we need to do it as \nquickly as we possibly can.\n  We need to have more experienced people there, particularly in \nbaggage examination. We need to do it so that we do not develop a long-\nterm Federal bureaucracy. That is an opinion that some do not share. \nBut, nevertheless, in order to achieve the goals we want, we have to \nmake some changes. And even though I would like to see it done in the \nnext 15 minutes, and move out of here, I must say, I am glad that we \nare taking the time to examine these issues and to come up with what we \nthink is the best solution, even if it takes a little longer.\n  As I say, we now have substantially more security than we did have. \nIn\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\nsome of the smaller States, the National Guard has been made available \nto help, and so on. One of the puzzles, of course, is to find the \nproper agency. I don't know that it is a puzzle, but it is a challenge \nto find the proper agency to supervise and be responsible for airline \nsecurity. Many believe--and I am one of those who think it--that it \nought to be a law enforcement agency and not really belong in the FAA. \nThose people have responsibilities, but law enforcement is not one of \nthose responsibilities. So that is one of the issues.\n  I see my friend from Texas is in the Chamber. She has been very \ninvolved in this issue. I yield my time to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, who has also been working on this issue, coming forward.\n  I see the Senator from Montana in the Chamber; he is a very important \npart of the negotiations on this issue.\n  The bottom line is, we want to go to the bill. The American people \nexpect us to pass a bill to securitize the airplanes and the airports \nin this country. What is holding us up is people who want to offer \nextraneous amendments. Some of them I agree with; some of them I do \nnot.\n  But the point is, we cannot put every amendment, on any different \nsubject, on the security bill and pass it. We have legitimate \ndisagreements on how to best securitize our aviation system.\n  Let us go to the bill and start talking about those differences \nbecause I think we can work them out. I believe we are 90 percent \nthere. There are a few things on which we are going to continue to \nnegotiate, but we need to be on the bill. We cannot go to the bill if \nwe are worried about having extraneous amendments, whether it is on \nemployee problems and benefits or whether it is on Amtrak security--all \nof which I think are very legitimate issues. I want to add security to \nAmtrak, as long as we add security for the entire system and not just \none part of the system.\n  But the bottom line is, we have an aviation security package that is \na very good first step forward, where we would put sky marshals in the \nair, where we would secure the cockpit, where we would have better \ntrained and equipped screeners, where we would have better equipment. \nAll of these things must be done. And we can do it this week if we can \nget to the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues not to have process drag us down. The Senate has \na bill before it that is good, solid legislation. We are working with \nDemocrats and Republicans and with the administration to make sure we \ndo what we do well, correctly, and give the flying public the \nconfidence that when they get on an airplane, they are going to be \nsafe.\n  If we can do that, it will be the beginning of rebuilding our \neconomy. If we can secure the airlines so people will come back and \nfly, then more of those people who have been laid off by the airline \nindustry will be called back to work.\n  The travel industry will be uplifted. We will have people staying in \nhotels. We will have people renting cars, employed in the airports, and \nin the shops. These are the things that will stimulate our economy.\n  We are talking about a stimulus package, which I hope we will look at \nnext week. That is very important. We can stimulate the economy with an \naviation security package. We can put people back to work in the \naviation industry and stop the domino effect to our economy caused by \nlayoffs in the airline industry because people are not coming back to \nfly.\n  I appreciate the cooperation we are getting. Senator Hollings, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator McCain, and I have worked well together to \ntry to get a consensus. We are very close. If we can go to the bill and \nif people will agree not to offer amendments that delay the ability for \nus to consider relevant amendments, we can work it out this week and \nsend something to the House and hopefully go to the President and do \nthe very important part of the stimulus package, and that is to beef up \nthe aviation industry.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I certainly thank my colleague \nfrom Montana, who has been a very important part of the aviation \nsubcommittee, working to put something together that all of us will be \nable to support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas who has \nworked very hard on aviation matters. We are moving forward. No one is \nseeking to hold up this bill. All of us agree aviation security is \nsomething that needs to be done and needs to be done very soon.\n  The Senator from Montana has been a part of this committee and has \nworked very hard. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Wyoming.\n  When we examine this issue, we find several approaches we have to \ntake a look at. We do want to move forward on it because there is a \nsense of urgency, if not in this body, in America.\n  Last weekend when I was in Montana, that is what they discussed: How \ndo we travel; how do we know we are safe; and the anger they feel \nbecause of the events on September 11. Whatever was important to us on \nSeptember 10, by September 12 it was not important anymore.\n  Now we have before us the very important issue of airport security \nand this legislation. Let's talk about the areas of concern: \nintelligence and passenger lists, who is in charge of those, who can \nbetter manage those; security at airports on the perimeter, the total \nfacility, the check-in area, the departure gate, the cargo, which \nincludes baggage and how they handle baggage, and the tremendous \ntonnage of air freight that moves through each airport and each \nfacility every year; how do we secure the area where the aircraft are \nparked; and finally, and most importantly, the security of the \naircraft.\n  We had an opportunity to visit with the security people who are in \ncharge of passenger safety and security for El Al. It is a Government-\nowned airline by the country of Israel. If there is one thing of which \nthe Israeli people are apprised and aware, it is terrorism. How do they \nhandle this? Granted, their domestic air transportation isn't as great \nas the system we find here in the United States. However, in principle, \nit has to be the same heightened awareness of security before we see \nload factors going from what they are running, around 40, 45 percent \nnow, to 70, 75 percent, and profitability of the airlines. Air \ntransportation is one of those linchpins of the American economy, our \nability to move.\n  El Al has 31 airplanes. Living in a very volatile region of the \nworld, the areas of responsibility to which I referred are very \nimportant to them. They have 7,000 employees, 1,500 of whom are \nemployed in the security part of their operation. They do nothing but \nsecurity. They secure the areas I previously enumerated: intelligence \nand passenger lists, the airport facility, the check-in area, departure \ngate, cargo, aircraft area, and aircraft.\n  They have been pretty successful in the last 20 years. They have not \nhad a hijacking or anything such as that, operating in an area of the \nworld that is very volatile.\n  They have one man who is in charge of security in all of these areas. \nHe doesn't operate the airport, the runways, the luggage, the people \nwho handle luggage, the people who handle cargo. He handles security. \nThey have accountability and responsibility.\n  That is what the American public wants us to do. In this legislation, \nthere has to be a strong, bright line of accountability and \nresponsibility to one agency or one area of government.\n  I have proposed an amendment. It has very strong bipartisan support. \nThe amendment would give that responsibility to the Department of \nJustice. Not that the Department of Transportation is not efficient and \nwould not be dedicated to passenger safety and security, not that the \nFAA could not do it, but we do not need a convoluted and nondistinct \nline of responsibility or accountability.\n  The American public are telling us Justice does it best, with the \nconfidence in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the Federal \nmarshal system. We have a model right in front of us, as those folks \nare responsible for the security of our Federal buildings,\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nthe movement of Federal prisoners. They understand secure areas and \ndanger points. However the Attorney General wants to do it matters not \nto me. It is that we have a bright line of authority and accountability \nand responsibility.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Montana, I was speaking earlier \ntoday to the chairman of the committee, Senator Hollings. He, too, \nthought that perhaps there should be some other entity other than the \nDepartment of Transportation that would supervise and control this. He \nsuggested, for example,--I know there is a dispute as to whether or not \nthey should be federalized, but he suggested maybe the Department of \nDefense. I say to my friend, in the form of a question, I think the \nSenator's suggestion is worth consideration. I think it is not a bad \nidea.\n  Maybe the Department of Justice, which has wide law enforcement \nresponsibilities already, could do this. But the question I ask my \nfriend--my friend from Texas, the junior Senator from Texas, who was \nhere in the Chamber saying we should get to the bill and get some of \nthis stuff decided, I agree with her; we should get on the bill. But I \nsay to my friend from Montana, the minority is holding up the bill. I \nthink the issue the Senator is talking about as to who should \nsupervise, whether it should be federalized or not--we should get to \nthe floor and offer amendments.\n  I think the Senator's idea is good. I will not do this now because it \nis inappropriate, but if I offered a unanimous consent agreement now \nthat we would go to the bill immediately, would the Senator allow me to \ndo that?\n  Mr. BURNS. How loaded was that? I think there are still disagreements \namong leadership. I could not do that personally. If it were in my \npower--which it is not--I am a soldier around here and everybody in the \nworld is smarter than I am--I am ready to go to the bill. I would offer \nmy amendment and we would vote on it, and we would win or lose and we \nwould go on down the trail.\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to offer a unanimous consent at this time \nbecause, as the Senator has indicated, leadership on his side perhaps \ndoesn't agree. I hope the Senator, with the persuasive nature that he \nhas in his down-home, homespun, very persistent and persuasive way, \nwould be able to talk to his side and let us get to this bill. There \nare some things that I would like to offer as an amendment on the bill. \nThe Senator from Montana agrees, and I agree, that airport security is \nsomething we should fasten onto quickly. We should get to the bill. If \nthere is something somebody doesn't like in the way of an amendment--\nand people are not complaining about the underlying bill, but if there \nis an amendment someone doesn't like, vote it up or down.\n  I hope today we can get to the bill. I appreciate the courtesy of my \nfriend from Montana for yielding.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I will say, the Senator mentioned he is one \nof the soldiers. If I were going to war, I would not mind having the \nSenator from Montana with me.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator for that. I feel the same way about \nhim. I want to reiterate that I think we can complete this bill today. \nI don't know whether or not we are in session tomorrow, but I think we \ncan get it done. I am not sure if we have an agreement with the folks \non the House side. That is another important piece of this puzzle that \nwe have to solve in the next 2 or 3 days in order to move this \nlegislation to the President's desk.\n\n  I am sure the President wants a piece of legislation that he can \nsign, which gives him the direction and also allows him the flexibility \nto provide the safety and security for the American people. He is \nbasically the ultimate director of how this will work. What I am saying \nis that I think the American people are watching this very closely.\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing on border security. Nobody is more in \ntune than I am as far as border security. The Senator from Nevada \nunderstands the Western States and how big they are. We have just a \nlittle under 4,000 miles of border with our friends in Canada, with \ncultures that are similar, and no language barrier; and 25 percent of \nthat border is my State of Montana. We have farmers who farm both in \nMontana and in Canada. So for the movement of livestock, and for farm \nmachinery, and farm chemicals, and everything it takes to make a farm \nor ranch go, it is important that we have not only secure borders but \nalso borders that are flexible enough to allow movement of commerce and \nto get the job done for those people who live on the border. There are \nranches that lay on both sides, part in Canada and part in the United \nStates. No, we don't have a lot of ports and the gates are rusted open. \nNine times out of 10 they set out a red cone and it says: The gate is \nclosed. You can go 100 yards on either side of the gate of entry and go \nin unnoticed, undetected. So we understand that, too.\n  To conclude my statement, Mr. President, even though there is a sense \nof urgency for the passage of airport security, I think there is also a \nfeeling in the United States--even though we are working in this highly \ncharged environment because of the events of September 11--that we do \nit right. I think we can do it right. We also can be accountable to the \nAmerican people for whom we are doing this legislation. It is for their \nbenefit, their movement, and for the safety of this country. I \nappreciate the attention of the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10274-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I come to the Chamber to discuss further \nthe need for transportation security that encompasses not only our \nairlines but also our rail lines and our ports. Others with their own \nexperiences and perspectives have already spoken to these issues and I \nam sure will continue to do so because as we address these critical \nneeds of transportation security, it is imperative we look at all the \nmeans of transportation our people require and that we found to be \nparticularly important in responding to the events of September 11.\n  I want to focus my remarks on Amtrak and our rail transportation \nsystem. I think anyone who followed the events of September 11 is well \naware that Amtrak played a critical and essential role in responding to \nthis national disaster. We know that without Amtrak being able to \nrespond, New York would have been cut off. The natural flow of commerce \nand passengers between Boston and Washington, the busiest rail corridor \nin our country, would have been severely undermined. We know, too, that \nAmtrak did its part to make sure people not only could reach their \ndestinations but, for example, those who had planned to fly by air when \nour air system was shut down, their tickets were honored and they were \npart of the continuing and increasing flow of people and goods that \ndemonstrated that America was still moving.\n  Ridership on Amtrak has been up 17 percent across the Nation and \ncertainly in the Northeast corridor, which was so devastated by the \nattack on the Pentagon, the closure of our airports, the attack in New \nYork City, the continued, until thankfully today, closure of our \nWashington National Airport. We know that Amtrak's increase here was up \nby 30 percent.\n\n  How do we make sure this critical mode of transportation is safe and \nsecure in the future? We cannot be in a position of looking backwards. \nWe have to look forward and say, what do we need to do to make sure our \ntransportation system is redundant and safe? I\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nbelieve we have to focus, as we look at transportation security, on \nensuring that our thousands and thousands of rail passengers are safe.\n  I am grateful Amtrak has come forward with a specific plan to address \nthe needs of those passengers. We need, for example, more police \nofficers on our trains, more canine units to inspect the trains, more \npower and switch upgrades to ensure they absolutely run without any \ndelay or disruption.\n  In New York, we have immediate safety concerns which demand we act \nnow, not later--hopefully in time to make sure we are always moving--\nand, if there is any natural or other disaster, that we keep our people \nmoving.\n  I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues some specific \nsafety concerns. Anyone who has ever been on a train in or out of New \nYork knows, I assume, that there are four tunnels under the East River \nand two tunnels under the Hudson River that serve as vital links \nbetween New York City and the surrounding area and the rest of America.\n  These tunnels were built in 1910, and now almost a century later they \nhave not undergone any serious security upgrade. Under today's \nregulations, the tunnels would never be allowed to be constructed in \nthe same shape in which they currently exist.\n  Penn Station in New York City is the busiest railroad station in the \nUnited States. More than 500,000 passengers, from all parts of our \nNation, on more than 750 trains pass through Penn Station each day. As \nmany as 300,000 commuters pass through the East River tunnels on the \nLong Island Railroad trains each day. So these tunnels are essential to \nour national railroad network and to the moving of people who commute \nevery day in and out of New York City. The tunnels are so essential \nthat we must turn our attention to ensuring they are safe for the \nhundreds of thousands of people who use them every single day.\n  If for some reason a train were to become incapacitated in one of our \ntunnels, the only means of escape would be through one of two \nantiquated spiral staircases on either side of the river or by walking \nin the dark almost 2 miles out of the tunnels. These are also the only \nroutes by which firefighters and other emergency workers can get into \nthe tunnels.\n  I have a picture, and it shows a narrow 10-flight spiral staircase \nwhich serves as the evacuation route for passengers as well as the \nmeans for rescue workers to enter the tunnels. I can barely even \nimagine what the situation would be like under the ground, under the \nrivers, if some kind of disaster were to occur, with passengers and \ncrew trying to move up this narrow spiral staircase and rescue workers \ntrying to move down; or, in the alternative, people being, in some \ninstances, carried or trying to get out on their own going 2 miles in \nwhatever conditions existed at the time.\n  I bring this to the attention of my colleagues because I think it is \nimperative, as we look at transportation security, that we do not turn \nour backs on the hundreds of thousands of people every single day who \nuse our railroads. I fully support adding air marshals on our flights. \nI support federalizing the inspection that passengers and cargo and \nluggage must go through, and I support doing everything we humanly can \nthink of that will guarantee to the American public we are doing all \nthat can be imagined to make our airlines safe.\n  I also want to be able to stand in front of the people in my State \nwho rely on these trains to get to and from work, who rely on these \ntrains to commute, who travel out of New York City, and people all over \nour country who similarly rely on our trains, that they also will be \nsecure. We don't want to leave any American out of our security \nefforts. This is an opportunity to do right what is required, what we \nnow know will prepare America for any future problems.\n\n  The airline security bill, which I hope we will be considering soon, \ncalls for the creation of a Deputy Secretary of Transportation Security \nwho will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of all modes of \ntransportation. I applaud this provision. I think it is long overdue. \nIt certainly will be a strong endorsement of the kind of broad-based \nsecurity required for our millions of airline passengers, for those who \nuse our ports, for those who come in and out of our transportation \nnetwork, and for the 20 million passengers who rode Amtrak last year.\n  Over a week ago--it is hard to keep track of time in the last weeks--\n40 of our colleagues took the train to New York City. I am so grateful. \nFor some, it was the first time they had been on the train. It was fun \nto see their surprise and enjoyment provided by the ride to and from \nNew York City. They were, in a sense, following in the footsteps of the \nhundreds of thousands of people who either have used trains out of \nnecessity or out of choice for years or who were forced to use trains \nin the wake of September 11. And, thank goodness, the trains were \nthere.\n  I cannot even begin to calculate the economic and psychological costs \nwe would have suffered had we been totally shut off. We could not have \nmoved people as easily as we did if Amtrak had not responded as well as \nit did in putting on additional equipment and personnel.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember this picture of this spiral \nstaircase. I hope they will think about everyone they have ever known \nwho perhaps has been a passenger, as I have been many times on these \ntrains, through these tunnels. I hope they will join in the commitment \nwe must make to every single American that we will guarantee the \nhighest possible level of security for all transportation. It is the \nleast we can do. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make \nsure it happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator leaves the Chamber, I appreciate the \ninvitation from her and Senator Schumer to travel to New York. Having \ntraveled on the train on a number of occasions, I have always enjoyed \nit. That day it was not a time of enjoyment but a time for learning. It \nis a trip I will never forget. We have seen and understand a little bit \nbetter the devastation, the hardship, and the sorrow of the people of \nNew York.\n  I express publicly my appreciation and the appreciation of the people \nof Nevada for the great work the Senator has done representing the \nState of New York in these events following September 11. What a \npleasure it is to serve with her in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10275-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I will talk about where we are with regard \nto aviation security. I appreciate very much the comments of the \nSenator from New York and her information about railroad security. I \ncertainly agree with her that we have to look at all our transportation \nsystems and, indeed, we have an opportunity to look at it all. If it is \ndifferent in different parts of the country. Of course, we don't have \nto have Amtrak trains in Wyoming. Nevertheless, I fully understand the \nimportance of railroads.\n  I raise the question of how we complete the work before the Senate. \nHopefully we will have back this afternoon a bill to improve aviation \nsecurity. It is called the Aviation Security Act, and it has been \ndeveloped for that very purpose. It has to do with the Deputy \nAdministrator for Aviation Security. It has to do with the Aviation \nSecurity Coordinating Council. It has to do with training and improving \nflight deck integrity.\n  This bill is an aviation bill. We have a number of things on which we \nhave not quite yet come together on this bill, but I think our \nchallenge is to pass this bill. I don't think there is anyone who would \nargue on the point of the Senator from New York that we need to do that \nand we need to get to railroads, but I guess there is a question as to \nwhether those issues will hold up doing what we want to do with regard \nto aviation. That is the question before the Senate. Hopefully, it will \nbe resolved shortly so we can move forward.\n  Obviously, there are unique aspects to airlines and airports. There \nneeds to\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nbe changes made in their operation. And there have been. We have \nalready made a great deal of progress in terms of security. There is a \ngreat deal more to make. I hope that not only this issue but other \nissues that have been suggested become a part of this air security bill \ncould be handled on a free standing bill so we move this bill as soon \nas it is possible to do that.\n  We have before the Senate that challenge. There is no question about \nthe safety aspect of other modes. We have not come together on this one \nyet. There is a difference of view as to the proper agency to do this \nwork, whether it ought to be a law enforcement agency, whether it ought \nto be the FAA. There are fairly strong feelings about that. But that \nhas not been resolved.\n  There are questions as to staffing and what supervision and criteria \nwill be required in order to have people who are, indeed, qualified to \ndo the kind of work that is necessary to be done, and whether or not \nthese persons ought to be supervised by a law enforcement agency of the \nFederal Government, which I happen to think is probably the better way \nto do it, and do some contracting so we can move more quickly.\n  We do have questions and problems. We are talking about that now. I \nam hopeful we can settle a couple of those disputes. One is the idea of \nbringing in other issues into this bill through amendments and changes \nthat would then require the same kind of consideration, or whether we \ncan move this package, designed for airline security and aircraft \nsafety, and turn to the others that are equally as important. Which is \nthe better way?\n  There are other fairly unrelated issues having to do with health \ncare, unemployment compensation, all of which are very important, but \nthey are not part of this issue and not part of the considerations.\n  I am hopeful we can deal with these issues as they come forward. We \nare slowed by the idea of bringing more and more issues into the same \nbase bill when it is designed to be specifically oriented toward \nairline safety. I suggest we move with this bill and come in as soon as \npossible with the other issues that are equally important, but we not \nhold this waiting to try to make other proposals fit into this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, I rise today during this period of time \nwhen we are discussing the need for additional security for airports \nand airliners to again voice my strong support for the measures \nincluded in the legislation that is soon to be before us.\n  Having said that, I also observe that this country has shown it is \npretty good at fighting the last war in preparing to fight the next \nwar. Those of us who are students of the history of World War I know \nthat World War II was a lot different from World War I, and we only \nhave to think of the Maginot Line to know how different it was. Korea \nwas different from World War II; Vietnam was different from Korea; the \nPersian Gulf was different from Vietnam.\n  We are now struggling in this war against terrorism to make sure the \nkinds of tragedies that occurred on September 11 do not occur again, \nand we should do that. If we look back at the history of the last \nseveral years with respect to terrorism, we had the bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center in 1993, the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East \nAfrica in 1998, the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole last year as it was at \nanchor, and now the use of our own aircraft as guided missiles to be \nused against the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.\n  Now as we prepare this fight against terrorism to fight the last war, \nto make sure no other hijacked aircraft can be flown into other \ntargets, we need to remember there is a different element to this war, \na different front to this war, and it is not just airplanes; it is not \njust airlines; it is not just airports.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I travel to my State of Delaware most \nmornings and nights on the train. We are mindful of trains in our \nState. We do not have a commercial airport. We use Philadelphia or BWI \nfor most of our commercial flights. A lot of people take the train. It \nis not just in Delaware. It is a lot of folks up and down the Northeast \ncorridor; indeed, a lot of people around the country.\n  During a given day, we have people who get on the trains in my State \nand some head south toward Washington and others head North toward New \nYork City where they work or go for business or pleasure.\n  In order to get into New York City, a train has to go through \ntunnels. There is a network of tunnels underneath New York City, \nunderneath the waterways. Some of those tunnels are used by Amtrak, \nsome are used by New Jersey Transit, some by the Long Island Railroad. \nAmtrak is a minority user of those tunnels.\n  All told, I understand between 300,000 and 400,000 people a day ride \ntrains, whether they are intercity passenger rail trains of Amtrak or \ncommuter rails, transit trains--between 300,000 to 400,000 people a day \ngo through those tunnels into New York City.\n  Those tunnels were built during the Great Depression, between World \nWar I and World War II. We have tunnels that are even older than that \naround Baltimore and indeed right here in our Nation's Capital, some of \nwhich go back to the administration, not of FDR, but of President \nGrant.\n  I would like to stand before you and say each of those tunnels \nthrough which trains pass carrying hundreds of thousands of people \nevery day is not a target for terrorists, but if they were, they are \ntunnels that are well ventilated, well lit, there are adequate \nprovisions to detect those who might want to do damage to the tunnels \nor to people who use the trains. Unfortunately, that is not the case. \nThe tunnels are not well ventilated. They are not well lit. They are \nnot tunnels with good surveillance that would enable security officers \nto detect the movements of suspicious persons or materiel.\n\n  As we prepare to fight the last war that grew out of the tragedies of \nSeptember 11, I hope we will not forget those hundreds of thousands of \npeople who are in those tunnels every day going in and out of New York \nCity. I hope we will not forget the thousands of people who are in \nthose tunnels every day beneath this city and beneath Baltimore.\n  I am told, as far as passenger capacity aboard airplanes is \nconcerned, there are about 150 people who can be seated aboard a 727 \njetliner. The new Acela Express trains carry over 200 people. I am told \nthe seating capacity aboard a 737 is roughly 150 people. The \nMetroliners that go up and down the Northeast corridor carry 225 \npeople. A 747 aircraft can seat maybe 400 people. A conventional train, \nthe Acela regional trains that go up and down the Northeast corridor, \ncan seat up to 500 people. And a new 767 airliner can carry as many as \n500 people. The Auto Train that goes from Lorton, VA, to Sanford, FL, \nnear Disney World, carries 500 people and some 600 cars.\n  My hope and my fervent prayer is that nothing ever happens to any of \nthose people on any of the airliners again or any of the trains I \ntalked about or the other commuter trains that work their way through \nthe Northeast corridor and the cities around the country. I hope that \nis the case.\n  That may not be the case. As we prepare to fight this next war, we \nneed to keep in mind the Achilles heel with respect to security of \npassenger rail.\n  A package has been put together addressing some of our biggest \nconcerns for the safety of folks who are using trains. I will tell my \ncolleagues one of the reasons I think this is important.\n  Think back to what happened on September 11. One of the first things \nthat happened was the airplanes that were ready to take off did not \ntake off, and those in the air were ordered to land. As that happened, \nin the Northeast corridor Amtrak kept working.\n  The first trains heading north from here pull out at 3:30 a.m. The \nfirst trains coming out of New York City heading south pull out at 3:30 \na.m. As aircraft were downed across the country, Amtrak was running and \ncarrying\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nhundreds of people. When people could not get out of Montreal, Amtrak \nmade provisions to get them where they needed to go in the United \nStates. When O'Hare and Los Angeles shut down and the Postal Service \nwas grounded, Amtrak carried over 200,000 carloads of mail, I am told.\n  When people and planes around this country--Raleigh and Pittsburgh--\nwere grounded, Amtrak stepped in to move emergency personnel and \nequipment from one end of the country to the other where it was needed.\n  My colleagues know the two Senators from Delaware are big supporters \nof passenger rail service. We think that is an important component of \nour national transportation policy.\n  This is not an effort during this time of distress and fear to try to \nobtain extra funding for passenger rail service, although some suggest \nthis is an appropriate time to do that. Instead, what we have in mind \nis to try to strategically pick a handful of items that need to be \nfixed in order to ensure, just as we are making travel for airline \npassengers safer, that we simultaneously make travel for rail \npassengers safer.\n  What we are proposing to do is to rehabilitate those seven tunnels \nthat go into Manhattan. We have, as was said earlier, old tunnels in \nBaltimore and in Washington as well. They all have the same problems. \nThey need to be fixed, and we ought to get started fixing them.\n  I have been riding trains lately that have Amtrak police officers on \nthem. They are working extra shifts. They are working doubles. They are \nworking a lot of extra hours. They cannot continue to do that forever. \nWe need additional Amtrak police officers to meet the security burdens \nthat are placed on them. We are going to have sky marshals on aircraft, \nand we ought to. We ought to have, in many cases, Amtrak police \nofficers on our trains. We do not have enough of them to go around.\n  More people are taking the train these days. It is not just here; it \nis the Texas Eagle, trains out on the west coast. It is trains all over \nthe United States. It is the Acela Express trains, the Metroliners, \nconventional trains in the corridor and conventional trains all over \nthe country. More people are riding rail, and my guess is more people \nwill ride rail as we go forward. We need to make sure they are safe.\n  In addition to more police officers, we need more canine and we need \ntraining for those officers who are going to be using the dogs. We need \nvideo equipment that allows Amtrak to monitor sensitive points along \nrail lines. We can do that remotely. We can do it effectively. It makes \nsense. We can use, and ought to have some beefing up of, the aerial \ninspections that are available to use with Amtrak. We can do it by day; \nwe can do it by night.\n  Some people have said to this Senator and to Senator Biden and others \nthat they support making travel by rail safer; that it sounds like a \ngood idea. But what they also say is this is not the time and place to \ndo that.\n  I say to my friends and colleagues who have made the offer of \nsupporting legislation like this sometime further down the line, we \nhave heard similar promises, literally, right in this Chamber about a \nyear ago. We are now doing something for passenger rail further down \nthe line, and we are a year further down the line. That which was \nsupposed to have been done has not been done.\n  What was supposed to have been done was the creation of high-speed \nrail corridors in places all around the country. It makes no sense to \nput people on an airplane to fly 150 miles, 200 miles in densely \npopulated corridors where they could as efficiently, or more \nefficiently, take a train. That would make easier the security job, the \nsafety job of the people running the airports. We ought to do that.\n  We have not come back and addressed that question raised a year ago \nto enable us to work with State and local governments to create high-\nspeed rail corridors. That is another issue. We are not going to talk \nabout that. We are going to stay away from that. This is a different \nargument, but this is the right day, and this is the right place, to \nraise that argument.\n  Passenger rail utilization is up probably 30 to 40 percent since \nSeptember 11. Any number of the trains I have ridden in the corridor, \nevery seat is full--Acela Express, Metroliners, conventional trains as \nwell. We are seeing a similar kind of jump in ridership around the \ncountry. A lot of the people riding those trains used to fly airplanes. \nThey are now on a train because they feel safer, maybe because it is \nmore convenient.\n  I want to make sure they feel safer, not just continue to feel safer \nbut to make sure they are safer because we will take right now the kind \nof steps to protect their safety, just as we are taking steps to \nprotect the safety of those who would fly in their 727s, 737s, 747s, or \n767s.\n  This is the time, this is the place, this is the legislation on which \nwe should debate these issues and we should approve them. We should \naffirm them and we should put these safety precautions in place for \npassengers on rail as we do the passengers of airlines.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me ask a question in the largely empty Senate on a \nThursday afternoon. It is now 4:05. We came to the Senate this week \ndealing with Defense authorization at a time when defense is critically \nimportant to this country. This country was attacked. Thousands of \nAmericans tragically were killed by mass murderers who committed the \nmost heinous crime that any of us have ever seen.\n  The issue of defense at a moment when we are sending American men and \nwomen who wear our country's uniform into harm's way is a very \nimportant issue. Our first order of business in dealing with the \nDefense authorization bill in the Senate was to have to vote on cloture \nto shut off debate so we could complete this bill.\n  What does that say about our priorities? We had a cloture vote, we \ngot through that, we finished that bill, finally, and now it is \nThursday at 4:05 in the afternoon, and the subject is airport security. \nWhen those commercial airliners hit the Trade Towers in New York, and \nthat commercial airliner hit the Pentagon, it is something that none of \nus will ever forget--the image of the airplanes hitting the Trade \nTowers in New York, seeing the fire at the Pentagon, seeing the crater \ndug into the ground in Pennsylvania by the United Airlines jet. When \nall of that happened, immediately the FAA shut down all air service in \nthe United States. Every single airplane was ordered grounded. All \ncommercial airlines flying and private airplanes flying in this country \nwere ordered grounded and, as I understand it, moved to the nearest \nairport they could find.\n  At that moment of that day, September 11, the only thing in the skies \nover Washington, New York, and other parts of the country were F-16s, \narmed, flying combat missions over American cities.\n  Our commercial airlines were ordered grounded. None flew for a number \nof days. And then commercial airlines were allowed to come back with \nadded security and they began to fly once again.\n  What has happened in this country is people have not been coming back \nto the airports to use commercial air service because they are \nconcerned about the issue of security. Last week I boarded an airplane \nand flew to North Dakota for the weekend and came back. I appreciate \nthe air service. I appreciate the added security at the airports. I \nhope all Americans will understand a substantial amount is being done \nin this country to try to make sure we will not see airplane hijackings \nonce again. It is important.\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\n  But the Congress is moving to do more with an airport security bill \nthat we have been considering for a number of days on the floor of the \nSenate, but we cannot move forward. The issue of the Congress of the \nUnited States to put sky marshals on virtually every flight in this \ncountry, hiring a lot of sky marshals to say to the American people, \nwhen you fly, someone will fly with you, a sky marshal, trained and \narmed and ready to take over that plane if needed. That is an important \nmessage to the American people.\n  When you fly, you will go through baggage screening that is not \nhaphazard as it is in some airports but screening by somebody who is \ntrained and following procedures. When you fly, that the airport \nperimeter, at airports in this country, will be a perimeter that is \nguarded, in which law enforcement understands what is happening around \nthat airport perimeter.\n\n  When you fly in the future, you will be on an airplane in which \nsomeone is not going to be able to get through that cockpit door \nbecause it is a hardened cockpit, as it is on some carriers overseas. \nAll of these things relate to the question, Do we provide confidence to \nthe American people that we have taken the steps as a country to \nprotect ourselves against hijackers?\n  So we bring a bill to the floor of the Senate, largely agreed to, \nnegotiated over a long period of time--and it is now Thursday at 10 \nminutes after 4--and we have a motion to proceed to the bill on airline \nand airport security, a motion to proceed to the bill that we cannot \nadvance. There is a filibuster on the motion to proceed.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong with that. The last thing in \nthe world you would expect, in my judgment, is stalling on a motion to \nproceed to the airport security bill in the Congress in the aftermath \nof the September 11 tragedy.\n  If there are things people object to, if there are things they do not \nlike in this bill, things they want to change--if they have heartache \nabout something, let the bill come to the floor and offer an amendment. \nJust offer it, grab a microphone, stand up, and have at it. We will be \nhere. We do not have to go anyplace real soon. There is nothing, in my \njudgment, that has a higher priority than this at the moment.\n  If we do not get people back in the air, if we do not get commerce \ngoing again in this country--business travelers and travelers for \nvacations, pleasure travelers and so forth--if we do not have people \nback in the air, we will not have a commercial aviation system left in \nthis country. They are hemorrhaging in red ink, and we did a bill to \ntry to provide some support for that, but that bill only lasts a very \nshort period of time. We must give people confidence that when they get \non an airplane, they are not going to have substantial risk of \nhijacking, that the security procedures in place are going to protect \nthem. We must give them that confidence. That is what this legislation \nis about, and it is just unfathomable to me that there is nothing \nhappening here because we have an objection on the motion to proceed.\n  My colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, said if you will not agree to \ngo to the airport security bill, we have five appropriations bills that \nshould have been done by October 1 but we did not get them done. Let's \nhave an appropriations bill on the floor this afternoon. Let's work on \nthat. We can be here until midnight. Hard work is not something that is \na stranger to most people in this Chamber.\n  Do you know what? We have five appropriations bills that should have \nbeen done already, and we cannot get one to the floor of the Senate \ntoday because when the Senator from Nevada makes a unanimous consent \nrequest--if you will not go to airport security, then let's go to an \nappropriations bill--and the words ``I object'' are heard.\n  So who is objecting, and for what purpose? And how does it advance \nthis country's public policy interests, in a range of critically \nimportant issues--notably airport security, which I think ought to rank \nnear the top, given what happened on September 11? How does it advance \nthis country's interest to shut this place down?--just stop it. It \ndoesn't seem to me to be the mood that ought to exist.\n  Post-September 11, we have had a period unprecedented, at least in my \njudgment, here in the Congress. President Bush came to speak to a joint \nsession. I thought he gave a strong and powerful speech. I thought he \nspoke for this country, saying this country is unified, this country \nhas one voice. That is a voice of determination saying to the rest of \nthe world that what happened in this country was a heinous act of mass \nmurder. We will find those who did it, and we will punish them, and we \nwill take all steps necessary to prevent that sort of thing from \nhappening again in America.\n  One part of that, and I must say a very important part of that, is \ndealing with security in the area of commercial airlines and commercial \naviation. This legislation dealing with sky marshals, airport \nscreening, perimeter law enforcement, hardening of the cockpit, and so \nmany other issues--the appointment of an Assistant Secretary of \nTransportation whose sole authority it is to deal with security--all of \nthat is in this legislation. So, on Thursday afternoon we sit in a \nspooky quiet Chamber because somehow this cooperation is not there.\n  I am not here just to point my finger. I haven't named anybody or \ntalked about sides here. All I say is those who say ``I object'' when \nwe say at least let's move to the motion to proceed to the airport \nsecurity bill, when they say ``I object,'' I think they retard rather \nthan advance this country's interests on something so important and so \ntimely and so necessary at this moment.\n  The reason I wanted to speak beyond the piece of legislation I \nintroduced here is to say how disappointed I am this afternoon. I think \nmany of my colleagues feel the same way. I am not angry about it, I am \njust disappointed. This is not what we should do. We know how to do \ngood public policy. We do good public policy by getting together and \ngetting the best of what everybody has to offer, not the worst of each. \nIf you have an objection, if you have a burr under your saddle \nsomeplace about something, if you are cranky about something, got up on \nthe wrong side of the bed, didn't have sugar in your cereal, good for \nyou. That doesn't mean you have to hold up the whole place. If you have \na problem with something, come offer an amendment. These microphones \nwork at every single desk. Come offer an amendment, and if you have \nenough support, you are going to win, and God bless you, that is the \nway life is here in the Senate.\n  I understand people say we have a right to use the rules and the \nrules allow us to object to a motion to proceed. That is true, \nabsolutely the case. But there are times, unusual times, in my \njudgment, in this country, when the American people do not want to see \nbusiness at usual; when what the American people want to see is \ncooperation and people coming here to say, we know we have a problem, \nand when this country has a problem, we are one; we are going to work \ntogether and solve it.\n  That doesn't mean every voice has to be singing exactly the same \nnote. Someone said when everyone in the room is thinking the same \nthing, nobody is thinking very much. I am not asking for a unison of \nthought, but I am asking that we decide to take some action in this \nCongress. This is the opposite of action, and it is not the best of \nwhat Congress has to offer the American people so soon after the \ntragedy that occurred on September 11.\n  I express my disappointment as only one Member of the Senate. But I \nhope very much others will join and we will begin next week--the Senate \nhas no votes tomorrow, and Monday is Columbus Day. The Senate will not \nhave votes on Monday. My hope is when we come back Tuesday, we will see \na series of actions on the part of the Senate with a new determination \nto cooperate, to say, yes, let's do these things. We know they need to \nget done; let's do them. Bring up the airport security bill, offer some \namendments, agree to some limitation on time on debate. If you don't \nwant to do that, that is fine, but it seems to me it makes sense to get \nthese things done. Bring the appropriations bills up. Let's get these \ndone. Let's work in a spirit of cooperation.\n\n  I am not saying one side is bad and the other side is good. I am \nsaying all of us are on the same side. There is only one side in \nAmerica at this point, and that is the side of trying to get the right \nthing done at the right time for the American people.\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan).

I was so inspired by the comments of the \nSenator from North Dakota that I felt compelled to rise to offer my \nadditional comments to the thoughts the Senator from North Dakota has \noffered.\n  I have gone home each weekend and heard my people respond that they \nare so proud that they have seen a unanimity of purpose, a unity of \nleadership, unity of the executive and legislative branches of \nGovernment, and they are so proud that they have seen bipartisanship as \nAmerica has responded to the crisis we now face.\n  In the midst of that unity and that bipartisanship, we have seen \nswift action on a number of pieces of legislation:\n  First of all, the emergency supplemental that would appropriate $20 \nbillion to respond to the terrorists and another $10 billion to respond \nto the crisis in New York;\n  Then, as the Senator pointed out, the quick action on the financial \npackage for the airlines so that we can get people back into the air \nand help shore up this major component of our economy.\n  But in the midst of all this unity, I think that partisanship and \nideological rigidity is beginning to raise its ugly head again, for as \nthe Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, there was an objection \noffered last week when we needed to pass a Department of Defense \nauthorization bill that held it up some 5 days more. Finally, we got an \nagreement after a tortuous process of trying to explain to others that \nyou couldn't load down the Department of Defense authorization bill \nwith everybody's agenda, that you had to keep it pure and address the \ndefense needs of this country, particularly at a time such as this.\n  We came to a point yesterday late in the day where the majority \nleader--and I believe the minority leader--wanted to agree to the \nunanimous consent request of the majority leader to proceed on this \nairline security bill, and yet there were objections--perhaps for some \npartisan reasons, perhaps for some ideological reasons, perhaps for \nsome parochial reasons. But as so eloquently pointed out by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, are we forgetting what is in the interest of the \ncountry, which is to get the American public flying again, and to help \nall of these myriad of industries that are dependent upon a healthy \nairline industry with lots of passengers?\n\n  My State is clearly one that is so desperately affected by the lack \nof airline travel and its spillover into the hotels, restaurants, and \nthe visitor attractions. You can go on with car rental companies, on \nand on.\n  The majority leader, our wonderful leader, Senator Daschle--I think \nwith the concurrence of the minority leader certainly in wanting to be \nthere--wants a bill that would put sky marshals on the planes, that \nwould strengthen the cockpit doors, that would have enhanced and \nfederalized screening of passengers, that would help train the crews \nfor anti-hijacking procedures, that would require background checks on \nthose who are not citizens who want to learn to fly in our flight \nschools, and all of those things that are unanimously embraced in this \ncountry and that we want to pass.\n  As so adequately pointed out by the Senator from North Dakota, it is \n4:25 on Thursday and we can't proceed to the bill. We can't even \nproceed to the motion to proceed because it is going to be \nfilibustered.\n  We will pass the motion to proceed next Tuesday. But then there are \n30 hours of debate on the motion to proceed before we can ever get to \nthe airline security bill unless people will come to their senses as to \nwhat is in the national interest, putting aside their partisan \nconcerns, putting aside their parochial concerns, and coming together \nagain in what has been a bright, shining moment for America in the \nunity and bipartisanship that has been displayed in the last 3 weeks.\n  I was sufficiently moved by the comments of the Senator from North \nDakota that I wanted--I thank him for taking my place in the chair as \nthe Presiding Officer--to offer these remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak with strong support \nfor an amendment that I know my colleague from Delaware, the senior \nSenator, Joe Biden, will be offering which deals with the issue of rail \ntransportation up and down the east coast--actually across the country, \nan amendment that provides about $3 billion to enhance the security of \nour rail transportation network.\n  This happens to be an amendment that I think fits extraordinarily \nwell and is extraordinarily important in providing a comprehensive \nsecurity package for our transportation network in this country.\n  The tragic events of recent weeks have focused attention on our need \nto improve the safety and soundness of our transportation network, in \nparticular our airlines. I congratulate the leaders of the Senate, our \nmajority leader, Tom Daschle, and the minority leader, Trent Lott, \nalong with Senators Hollings and McCain, for their outstanding work to \nbring forward a package that I believe our Nation is asking for, is \ndemanding: that we recognize we need to improve the safety of our \naviation system in this country.\n  We need to be a little more forward looking. We need to think outside \njust the events that have occurred to what could occur and where the \nnext tragedies might very well occur.\n  While we are tightening aviation security, we need to address \nproblems that may very well exist in other parts of our transportation \nsystem.\n  Just yesterday we experienced a serious problem in our country's bus \nnetwork. Fortunately, it was not of the same tragic proportions, but we \nsaw, once again, a criminal taking over a bus and attacking the driver, \nleading to the death of five innocent passengers.\n  We have a vulnerable transportation system in this country. \nUnfortunately, our rail system may be the most vulnerable. That is why \nwe need the Biden initiative, hopefully with a number of Senators from \nacross the country supporting it. We need to address this issue before \na problem occurs.\n  Talk about proportionality. In fiscal year 2000, Amtrak provided \nridership for 22.5 million folks. Out of New York City, there were 8.5 \nmillion boardings. It is an enormous contributor to the transportation \nsystem in this country. It is an important one.\n  We learned that it is complementary to our transportation system as \nwe saw the shutdown of Reagan National and we saw the aftermath of the \nevents.\n  It is not just passenger traffic. Freight traffic feeds one of the \nmost important ports in our country, the New York-New Jersey port. Up \nand down the east coast, there is tremendous interconnectivity of our \nsociety through rail traffic. This is one of our most vulnerable spots, \nand I think it needs to be addressed on an emergency basis. I think a \nlot of my colleagues do,\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\nand that is why we are so impassioned about the need to address this \nnow in this time when we are looking at various needs for security.\n  When you ride Amtrak, which a number of Senators did when they \nvisited ground zero a couple of weeks ago, and as a number of us do \nregularly, you do not have to go through any security checkpoints \nbefore boarding, no metal detectors, no x-ray machines to check \nluggage, and there are very few security officers. Someone can just \nwalk on a train and put a bag in the storage bins. One does not even \nhave to be suicidal to accomplish destruction.\n  Indications are that security on trains is light. Under these \ncircumstances, we have been very fortunate, in my view, to have avoided \na major terrorist attack on our Nation's rail system. It is not just a \nNortheast corridor problem. It is a problem across the country where we \nhave heavy rail traffic.\n  It is time to improve that security now. We need to think ahead to \nwhat could be a major disaster, a human tragedy for our country. That \nis why the Biden initiative, and the initiative of so many of us, is so \nimportant.\n  This amendment will provide the resources to substantially improve \nthe security of the Nation's passenger rail system--not just in the \nNortheast but the Nation's rail transportation system. Funds could be \nused for a variety of purposes, including hiring more police officers, \nimproving training and security personnel, purchase of security \ncameras, and the establishment of special emergency response teams that \ncan respond instantly if we have a problem on our rails. It could \nprovide helicopters to check the track coverage to make sure we are not \nbeing attacked before an event.\n  There are a number of things we need to do on a commonsense basis to \nmake sure we are more secure in our rail traffic, to make sure our \neconomy continues to roll and provide the freight connections with \nwhich Amtrak and rail across our country use to service our economy. We \nought to do this now and not wait for a problem to occur.\n  It is also important--and this is absolutely more clear every day--\nMr. President, I encourage you to come to New York, New Jersey, and try \nto commute across the various forms of transportation under the Hudson \nRiver or over it and see the 1\\1/2\\ to 2 hour lines that are taking \nplace because of the breakdown, obviously, of the path tunnel that went \ninto the World Trade Center. There were 50,000 riders one way each day \non that pathway, and now they are looking for other ways to get into \nthe city.\n  With the entry level of the Holland Tunnel now stopped because of \nsecurity reasons, there is an absolute need for us to understand that \nthese are important security chokepoints, risk points in our \ntransportation network.\n  A lot of these tunnels are extraordinarily dated and, by the way, not \njust the ones in New York and New Jersey, but Baltimore, Washington, \nand other places across the country are not up to scale for the 21st \ncentury. In fact, some of them are not up to scale for the 20th \ncentury.\n  The ones in Baltimore were put in place in the 1870s. The tunnels \nunder the Hudson River were built in the early 1900s when we had the \nPennsylvania railroad. They have gone through different ownerships and \nstruggles to stay current.\n  If a terrorist were to attack the ones I know best under the Hudson \nRiver, there are two exits in a tunnel that is the better part of 6 or \n7 miles long. Lousy ventilation was put in place, as I said, in the \nearly 1900s, and a narrow passageway virtually makes it impossible to \nevacuate.\n  On an average day there are 100,000 passengers who go through that \ntunnel. It is not just Amtrak, but it is the New Jersey transit, which \nis one of the vital links to have a connected economy in the \nmetropolitan New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area.\n  I stress that it is not only New York-New Jersey. We have similar \nissues in the Baltimore tunnels, and, frankly, they have a tunnel in \nWashington that runs right next to the Capitol Building. There are \nenormous risks and inefficiencies that occur here.\n  We have a safety issue for sure. All one has to do is watch grade B \nmovies of days in the West, as we might have seen in South Dakota, \nwhere people blew up bridges or blew up tunnels to know it does not \ntake a genius to figure out that these are places where security \nmeasures need to be taken and attended to.\n  I hope my friends in the Senate will realize this is not about \nporkbarrel spending. This is a serious concern for literally millions \nof folks who are involved in our rail transportation system.\n  Finally, this is a vital economic link for this country. There is an \nenormous amount of freight traffic up and down the east coast. There is \nin other parts of the country as well, and our friends need to have \nprotection to make sure those links stay in place. If we are ever going \nto worry about where the status of our economy is and how we are going \nto keep it thriving, get it back on the right track, now is the time to \nbe thinking about that. That is why I think we have to make sure we \nmove on these issues with regard to rail transportation at the same \ntime we are talking about aviation.\n\n  There is the old saying: Fool us once, shame on you; fool us twice, \nshame on us. Frankly, I think we are in that position. That is why I \nfeel so strongly about support of the initiative that a number of us \nare taking under the leadership of Senator Biden, and I hope we will \nmove that forward. Economic reasons for sure, but when you want to \nthink about the safety of the people of America, we do not need another \nSeptember 11 to produce movement on things where we know there are \nproblems.\n  As a matter of fact, the traffic has increased over 40 percent in \nthat Northeast corridor since September 11 because a lot of people \nbelieve it is an alternative to air transportation. I hope we will move \non this bill, move on it quickly, so we are looking after our citizens \nin a prospective way, not in a reactive way.\n  For all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthe Biden amendment when it is presented. I hope to come back and speak \nto this again and make sure people forcefully understand this is a need \nthat has to be addressed now, not after the fact. I appreciate the \nattention of the Senate, and I hope we will all be attentive to the \nneeds of what I think are important rail safety issues, as well as our \naviation safety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10280-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10280-S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RESOLVING DIFFERENCES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon I want to speak to the issue \nthat many of my colleagues have spoken about. For the first time since \nSeptember 11, I have heard an interesting word used by the majority \nleader of the Senate, the word ``obstruction.''\n  I am disappointed Senator Daschle has decided that is a word he needs \nto use to express his concern about where we are in the Senate at this \nmoment.\n  What I will say this afternoon to the majority leader is there is an \nawful lot about trying to get the work product we are going to offer to \nthe American people next week right correct, well done, before we bring \nit to the floor. For example, if Senator Daschle had suggested we bring \nthe antiterrorism package to the floor yesterday, we would not have had \na completed product. Somebody would have had to stand up and object and \nsay, wait a moment, Tom, somehow you have the cart before the horse.\n  If we spend another 24 hours on it, maybe we can resolve our \ndifferences. You know what happened in that 24-hour period? Differences \nwere resolved. The Senate stood in a bipartisan way last night and \ncrafted an antiterrorism package, and the House voted out of committee \nunanimously in a bipartisan way to resolve it.\n  There is not a great deal of difference between that and the airport \nsafety package that came to the floor without clear instructions and a \nbipartisan unity that would have led us to resolve it in the correct \nfashion. Many of our colleagues were lining up, and rightfully so, to \noffer a variety of amendments that could have taken us well into next \nweek, substantially changed the character of an airport safety package, \nand sent a very confusing message to the American public. The public \nhas a right to be concerned at this moment because current airport \nsafety failed us\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\non September 11. They want to make darn sure that whatever we do this \ntime we get it right.\n  In getting it right, my guess is the first question you would ask is, \nAre you going to use the old model that failed us on September 11 and \nthrow more money at it and throw more people at it, or are you going to \nthink differently? Are you going to step out of that box and look at \nsomething new that really is an awful lot about law enforcement and a \nlot less about hiring the cheapest kind of personnel you can get to \nfill what is required by the FAA? That really is the debate that is \ngoing on behind the closed doors that the majority leader has not been \nwilling to expose to the American people this afternoon. He has simply \nstood on this floor, wrung his hands, and used the word \n``obstruction.''\n  Let me say what is going on in the back rooms at this moment: The \nWhite House, the Secretary of Transportation, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and a \ngood many others are trying to craft a final product that is a hybrid, \nthat is out of the box, that is different, that is unique, that we can \nbring to the floor next Tuesday and show to the American people we can \nget it right and they will, from that day forward, as this new product \ngets implemented, have the kind of airport security they want, demand, \nand are going to require of their government.\n  Is it more of a model of law enforcement, maybe like the U.S. \nMarshals Service that has a cadre of professionals that allows \ncontracting out but does so with very strict parameters? The White \nHouse has said they do not want to federalize all of it. They recognize \nyou cannot make all of these people Federal employees and expect the \nbest product, but if you do, then you have to change the character of \nthe way you hire a Federal employee, and you have to allow hiring and \nyou have to allow firing. You have to be able to proscribe and demand \nand inspect and make sure the end product, the inability to penetrate \nsecurity at all of our Nation's airports, is absolute.\n\n  I suggest to the majority leader the reason we are not debating this \nissue on the floor this afternoon is not a matter of obstruction; it is \na matter of getting it right before it is brought to the floor. It is \nan awful lot more about airport security in the long term because we \nonly have one more bite at this apple. If we get it wrong this time, \nshame on us.\n  We heard the Senator from New Jersey talk about a very important \nissue: rebuilding the infrastructure of the rail delivery system of the \neast coast. Should it be a part of airport security or should it be a \npart of an infrastructure bill that has long been needed that addresses \nthe refurbishing of a very antiquated rail system? How much money is it \ngoing to cost? Should we rush to judgment and spend a few billion \ndollars more when we are on the verge of spending beyond what we now \nhave available to spend?\n  September 11 awakened us to a great many needs, but it does not mean \nwe do them all overnight or we spend hundreds of billions of dollars \ninto deficit to accommodate it. It says, though, that we have some \nimmediate needs. One of the most immediate is airport security.\n  While Americans are beginning to return to our airports because they \nknow security has been substantially heightened, what we are going to \noffer them in the package that is brought to the floor next week is a \nnew model that creates a new paradigm of thinking, that clearly allows \nthe American people to see on an annual basis, as we review it, as it \nis implemented by this administration, an airport security system that \nhas the integrity not to allow the penetration, not to allow a \nSeptember 11 to ever happen again in this country, and to say to them, \nas I should as a policymaker in a legitimate way, we have offered the \nbest product available to guarantee security and a sense of well-being \nwhen one steps on an airliner at any airport in this country.\n  So should we be rushing now to get it out or should we be trying to \ndo it right?\n  Our President spoke about being calm, about missiles or bombs not \nflying the day after September 11, about going out and finding out \nwhere the enemy is, building coalitions and doing it in a progressive, \nconstructive way that forever would rid this world of terrorism. He \npreached calmness and he asked us to unite. The kind of divisive word, \n``obstruction,'' that I heard this afternoon does not serve this body \nwell. It does not bring us together. It divides us. It divides Members \nalong a line that says: there is somebody for something and somebody \nagainst something.\n\n  I suggest there isn't anything that we can all be unanimously for at \nthis moment because there are very legitimate questions about the \nintegrity of the proposal and how it will work and who will manage it--\nFAA? Department of Transportation? Department of Justice? Is it a \ntransportation issue? Is it a law enforcement issue? They are \nreasonable questions to be asked, not after the fact but before the \nfact, before you get to the floor, before you have a final product, so \nwe can stand united, together, as the American people are expecting in \nthis time of national crisis, and not to divide along party lines.\n  As a result of that need that I think is critical and that my leader \nthinks is critical, we had to say: Wait a moment; back off for just a \nlittle bit. Let's finish that product and let the chairman of the \ncommittee, who has worked hard and had a good idea, and the ranking \nmember and the White House, and others, come together.\n  It is true there was a bill and the bill they tried to present and \nbring forward yesterday afternoon had not been before the committee, \nhad not had hearings, had not worked the process. I understand that. We \nall understand that. It is a time of urgency. But in that urgency, in \nthe very critical character of what we do, we cannot do it wrong. We \ncannot rush to judgment and load it down with everything else, \nincluding social agendas, unemployment agendas, a whole infrastructure, \ntransportation system for Amtrak. That is for another day and another \nissue. Darned important, yes. We need time to debate it on the floor. \nLet the committee work its will.\n  I am not going to suggest I understand exactly how any of these \nsystems ought to work. I understand when we take our time and involve \nall of our colleagues and use the process appropriately, we produce \nbetter public policy.\n  Clearly, the White House engaged us yesterday in a much more direct \nway with some examples of things they believed were necessary that were \nnot in the bill, that the leader was trying to bring to the floor, that \nhe now accuses us of having obstructed. Mr. Leader, of course you speak \nout as you wish, but I will suggest that come next Tuesday or Wednesday \nwe will have a better product. We will be more united. We will stand \ntogether as the American people ask. We will craft out of a box, out of \nthe old failed paradigm, a new product, and we will be able to turn to \nthe American people and say, in the collective best thinking of the \nU.S. Congress, the President of the United States, the Secretary of \nTransportation, and all of the experts we could assemble, we are \ncreating an airport security system in this Nation that will work.\n  Following that, I hope we can move to antiterrorism and the kind of \npackage that was crafted in an unhurried but aggressive environment \nwhich the House voted out unanimously last night from their committee, \nand Senators came around yesterday evening in final draft to say that \nis a product that will work, that will give the FBI, that will give \nother law enforcement agencies in our country the kind of seamless web \nand communications system that allows them to know what the right hand \nis doing for the left hand, and vice versa, and the ability to track in \na modern, electronic way those who might be brewing ill will for our \nNation and our Nation's citizens.\n  Let us stand together in this Nation's time of need. ``Obstruction'' \nis not a constructive word. It is not the glue we need. My guess is, \ngetting it right is what we are about and what the American people \nexpect.\n\n  For tomorrow, for Saturday, and for Monday, our work is all about \ngetting an airport security bill right. When we do, then we can turn to \nthe American people and say we are putting in place a security system \nsecond to none. And from that, we can suggest the skies of America and \nAmerica's air carriers are\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\nsafer than they have ever been. That is our goal. It is our charge. \nFrankly, it is our responsibility. We are up to it in a bipartisan \nfashion with the whole Senate speaking as one voice. Next week we will \nbe prepared to do that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Marion is retiring from the fellowship program this year, \nafter 14 years of dedicated service during which she guided and \nmentored scores of health care professionals from around the United \nStates who took time off from their careers to participate in the \npolicymaking process in Washington, DC. Her mixture of warmth, wisdom, \nand compassion will be sorely missed by future RWJ fellows and by the \nMembers of Congress and the administration offices who have had the \ngood fortune to work with Marion and the top-notch fellows she has \noverseen.\n  For almost 30 years, the RWJ Health Policy Fellowship program has \nselected a small group of leaders in America's academic health centers \nto participate in the development of America's health policy. RWJ \nFellows come to Washington understanding health care delivery, and, \nduring an extensive training program, they supplement their health care \nexpertise with lessons about health policy and the process to develop \nthat policy. This training and the unique opportunities created by \nworking on the health staffs of Members of Congress and in the \nExecutive Branch have allowed RWJ Fellows to participate in every major \nhealth care debate over the last 25 years.\n  Marion Ein Lewin has served as the guiding light for the last 14 \nclasses of RWJ Fellows. As teacher, mentor and policy analyst, Marion \nhas helped new Fellows understand the history and opportunities of \nhealth policy. She has introduced Fellows to the most important health \npolicy thinkers in the country. The greatest testament to her \nextraordinary impact is the warmth and fondness departing Fellows feel \nfor her.\n  Appropriately, Marion's experience in health policy began in a \nMember's office. She served as the Legislative Assistant for Health for \nCongressman James H. Scheurer (D-NY), where she helped develop \nlegislation and performed all the activities of a Congressional \nstaffer.\n  Though Marion is known for her grace and warmth, she has made \nsubstantial contributions to the annals of American health policy. \nMarion's broad experience in health policy was bolstered by stints at \nthe American Enterprise Institute and the National Health Policy Forum. \nShe became director of the AEI Center for Health Policy Research before \njoining the Institute of Medicine. While at AEI, Marion edited five \ntexts on health policy.\n  During her 14 years on the staff of the Institute of Medicine, Marion \nserved as the study director for three IOM reports on critical issues \nranging from improving Medicare, to the impact of information on the \ndevelopment of health policy, to the status of safety net providers. \nWhile at the IOM, she also directed the Pew Health Policy Fellowship.\n  Now, after 14 years, Marion Ein Lewin has decided to leave her \npivotal role in the Robert Wood Johnson Fellowship. Her influence upon \nthe 85 Fellows who served during her tenure is indelible. She has \noverseen the transformation of academic faculty into reasonable \nfacsimiles of congressional health LAs. Fellows have provided my staff \nand me incalculable assistance over the years, and I know other Members \nof Congress and the administration share my appreciation. Marion's \nguidance has enabled these Fellows to make these valuable contributions \nas we seek to improve the healthcare system in our country.\n  Through the dint of her long service and extraordinary knowledge of \nhealth policy, Marion has come to personify the Fellowship and its \nvalues. It is hard to imagine the Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy \nFellowship without Marion Ein Lewin. Mr. President, I ask my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating Marion and the Robert Wood \nJohnson Program on their many successes, and sending a heartfelt thank \nyou for her many years of dedicated service. Marion has made a genuine \ndifference in health care. We wish her well and expect her to continue \nher good work as she enters this new phase in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10282-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to President Chen Shui-bian \nand Ambassador C.J. Chen of the Republic of China on Taiwan for their \nsupport of the United States in the aftermath of the September 11 \nattacks on New York and Washington.\n  Taiwan was one of the first countries to declare its unequivocal \nsupport and cooperation with the United States, and deserves our \ngratitude for its firm stand with us.\n  In offering us whatever we need to combat worldwide terrorism, Taiwan \nhas demonstrated its unity with America during our time of grief. \nDuring this period of turmoil and anxiety, I remind my colleagues that \nTaiwan will mark its National Day on October 10.\n  In recent years Taiwan has sought to return to the United Nations. I \nbelieve we should give Taiwan our support. The Republic of China on \nTaiwan is a democracy guaranteeing rights to all its citizens; it is \none of the most important economic entities in the world; and despite \nits small population, 23 million people, Taiwan has financial resources \nsurpassing those of many western countries.\n  Sadly, the international community accords Taiwan less recognition \nthan many other non-state entities, including the terrorist Palestine \nLiberation Organization.\n  As the people of Taiwan, the East Asian region's leading free market \ndemocracy, celebrate their National Day on October 10, we should \ncommend them for their successes and encourage other nations to support \nTaiwan's participation and membership in international organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10282-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMON SENSE ON FIFTY CALIBER WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, long-range fifty caliber sniper weapons are \namong the most powerful firearms legally available. According to a \nrifle catalogue cited in a 1999 report by minority staff on the House \nGovernment Reform committee, one manufacturer touted his product's \nability to ``wreck several million dollars' worth of jet aircraft with \none or two dollars' worth of cartridge.'' Some fifty caliber ammunition \nis even capable of piercing several inches of metal or exploding on \nimpact.\n  These weapons are not only powerful, but they're accurate. According \nto the Government Reform staff report, the most common fifty caliber \nweapon can accurately hit targets a mile away and can inflict damage to \ntargets more than four miles away.\n  Despite these facts, long-range fifty caliber weapons are less \nregulated than handguns. Buyers must simply be 18 years old and submit \nto a Federal background check. In addition, there is no Federal minimum \nage for possessing a fifty caliber weapon and no regulation on second-\nhand sales.\n  Given the facts on fifty caliber weapons, I'm pleased that Senator \nFeinstein has introduced a bill, which I have cosponsored, that would \nchange the way they're regulated. Senator Feinstein's bill would ensure \nthat fifty caliber weapons could only be legally purchased though \nlicensed dealers. Her bill would also ensure that they could not be \npurchased second-hand. Buyers would have to fill out license transfer \napplications with the ATF, supply fingerprints and submit to a detailed \nFBI criminal background check. By any measure Senator Feinstein's bill \nmakes sense and I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the \nbill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10283-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 13, \n2001 in San Antonio, TX. According to police, a 39-year-old man was \nattacked because the suspect thought he was a homosexual. The victim \nhad stopped in a park to look at some rocks when a man with a knife \ncame up behind him. The man held the victim in a bear hug before \nstabbing him in the chest with a knife that he described as a three-\ninch Buck knife. The suspect allegedly called him anti-gay names as he \nstabbed him.\n  I believe the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10283-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10283-S10284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2001\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate our Nation's 33rd \nHispanic Heritage Month, which commemorates Hispanic Americans and \ntheir contributions to the strength of our Nation in the past, present, \nand future.\n  Congress started the tradition of Hispanic Heritage Month in 1968 \nwith the National Hispanic Heritage Week, and expanded the annual \ncelebration to a month-long event in 1989. This year, the month follows \nthe terrorist attacks on our country on September 11. More than ever, \nit is essential to take this opportunity to recognize the many \nhardworking Hispanic Americans who have helped make our country great \nand will continue to do so throughout our future. Our country stands \nunited, with Americans of Central and South American descent standing \nalongside Americans with roots from all over the world.\n  There are many shining examples of Hispanic Americans who have stood \nup for our country and communities in times of war and peace. Ancestors \nof present-day Hispanics sacrificed or risked their lives throughout \nthe many years of North American history that led to our country's \nbeginning. Hispanic Americans have served the United States in every \nwar since World War I. Many Hispanic American service members have \nearned distinction in our military, such as Emilio A. De La Garza, who \nentered the U.S. Marine Corps in Illinois and was awarded the Medal of \nHonor, America's highest decoration for valor.\n  In Silvis, IL, there is a monument to eight heroes of Mexican-\nAmerican descent who gave their lives in defense of this nation. The \nstreet the monument is on was once called Second Street USA, but it is \nnow called Hero Street USA. The street's name honors 84 men from the 22 \nfamilies on one small block of this street participated in World War \nII, Korea and Vietnam. Many of them grew up on this street, some \nworking for the railroad as their fathers did in Mexico. Today the \nstreet serves as a remembrance of those who courageously served our \ncountry.\n  Other Hispanic Americans stand up for their communities on a daily \nbasis. Whether serving in our town councils, fire departments, or \npolice departments, they are always working to advance our safety and \nquality of life. These local heroes include Raymond Orozco, who led the \nChicago Fire Department with distinction until his recent retirement, \nand Jaime Gonzalez, the first Hispanic police officer in Elgin, IL.\n  Hispanic Americans also have enhanced our national prosperity and \nwill continue to play an important role in our economy. A study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences found that the Latino community \ncontributes about $10 billion to the U.S. economy per year. According \nto the Census, Hispanics owned about 1.2 million nonfarm businesses in \n1997, employing over 1.3 million people and generating $186.3 billion \nin business. The Small Business Administration tells us that minority \nand women-owned businesses are the most rapidly growing segments of the \nbusiness community, and the number of Hispanic-owned businesses has \nincreased by over 600 percent over the past 20 years. Female Latino-\nowned businesses are growing faster than any other segment of business \nowners. According to the Center for Women's Business Research, two-\nthirds of Latina entrepreneurs came into business ownership not by \npurchasing, inheriting or acquiring a business, but by starting their \nown. These are women like Chicagoan Sonia Archer, who, while raising a \nchild, founded a home-based business marketing discounted legal \nservices for people who cannot afford attorneys' fees. Stories like \nSonia's illustrate how Hispanic Americans bring great innovation and \nsuccess to our economy.\n  A wide array of talented Hispanic Americans enrich arts and athletics \nin our country. In the literary world, Sandra Cisneros brings us \npowerful, eloquent stories of young women growing up in communities in \nChicago, or on the Mexican border, that are full of challenges and \nbeauty. Tito Puente, known as ``El Rey'' or The King of Mambo, \ndelighted audiences around the world with his musical gifts, using the \ntimbal, vibraphone, trap drums, conga drums, claves, piano, saxophone, \nand clarinet. Hispanic Americans have also brought tremendous talent to \nAmerica's pastime: baseball. Among the earlier figures was Roberto \nClemente, who played right-field for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 \nto 1972, and won four National League batting titles, twelve Golden \nGlove awards, and the title of National League's Most Valuable Player \nin 1966. Then there is Nomar Garciaparra, who in 1997 set several \nrookie records during what Baseball Weekly called the greatest rookie \nseason in history. Today we have Sammy Sosa, who is outfielder for the \nChicago Cubs and the only player in the history of baseball to hit 60 \nhome runs in each of three different seasons.\n  As we take time to reflect upon the strength Hispanic Americans bring \nto our country, we must also remember that many Latinos face challenges \nin our society. Fair and equal treatment of all Americans is a \ncornerstone of our society and our political system. Unfortunately, \ndespite great progress, the struggle for civil rights and equal \ntreatment under the law continues today for many citizens, including \nour fellow Hispanic Americans.\n  A time of national crisis reminds us that we must unite against hate \nand bigotry. I support several key bills that would bring us closer to \nthis goal. First, I hope to see passage of the Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 2001, also known as the hate crimes bill. Among \nother things, this legislation would expand current Federal protections \nagainst hate crimes based on race, religion, and national origin; \nauthorize grants for programs designed to combat and prevent hate \ncrimes; and enable the Federal Government to assist State and local law \nenforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. I have also \nintroduced the Reasonable Search Standards Act, which would prohibit \nUnited States Customs Service personnel working at our borders and in \nour airports from searching or detaining individuals solely based on \ntheir race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. \nFinally, I am cosponsoring the End Racial Profiling Act, which would \nmake profiling by any law enforcement agent or agency a crime \nprosecutable in any State court of general jurisdiction or in a \nDistrict Court of the United States; and would require Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement agencies receiving Federal grants to maintain \nadequate policies and procedures designed to eliminate racial \nprofiling. I believe these measures take important steps toward \npreventing discrimination and violence based on race and ethnicity.\n  There are currently 31.5 million Hispanic Americans living in the \nUnited States, and Hispanic Americans comprise 35 percent of the \npopulation under the age of 18. Sadly, only 57 percent of Latino \nstudents complete high school and only 10.6 percent earn a bachelor's \ndegree. We can do better. This year Congress has worked with the \nadministration to facilitate real education reform based on high \nstandards and meaningful accountability measures.\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n As we work to raise the bar for students and teachers, we must also \nensure that schools across the country have adequate resources to hire \nand train teachers and principals, help all students attain fluency in \nEnglish, integrate technology effectively in the classroom, and provide \nchildren with enriching after-school activities. I support the 21st \nCentury Higher Education Initiative, which will substantially expand \ncollege opportunity through student aid, early intervention efforts, \nand more resources to strengthen minority-serving institutions. I also \nintroduced the Children's Adjustment, Relief, and Education, CARE, Act \nto enable immigrant children to fulfill their potential and pursue \nhigher education on the same terms as other children.\n  According to the 2000 Census, 60 percent of Latinos in this Nation \nare natives of the United States. Whether Hispanic Americans were born \nhere or moved to our country later in life, most of them feel the \nimpact of immigration policy. Many live in immigrant families or \ncommunities, and many, like most Americans, have strong memories of or \nconnections to our immigrant heritage. I support reforming immigration \nlaws to ensure the due process rights of immigrants, so that they are \nguaranteed fairness in our courts and are not unnecessarily detained \nfor indefinite periods. We also need to enhance the efficiency and \naccountability of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Finally, \nit is essential to protect the safety of our Nation's immigrants and \ntheir due process rights at our borders, while enforcing our \nimmigration laws and protecting our national security.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month in 2001 gives us an opportunity to deepen our \nunderstanding, appreciation, and common bonds with each other. It also \ngives us pause, reminding us of the American ideals we must continue to \nfight for. The challenges that we face in Congress and our Nation are \nnot insurmountable. Together, we can stand up for the rights of all \nAmericans, including our Hispanic American friends. And together, we \ncan recognize how our diverse cultures and talents contribute to our \ncollective strength as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10284-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO REV.

As Pastor of \nthe St. James A.M.E. Church in Newark, he ensures that everyone has a \nvoice and gives hope to those who feel they have no hope. Under his \nleadership, St. James A.M.E. Church has reached out to the community \nand established numerous programs, including a soup kitchen that feed \nover 1,000 people per week, a clothing program, and a drug and alcohol \nabuse program. Reverend Watley is also an outstanding advocate for \nchildren and families. His vision was to start a state of the art \npreparatory school in the heart of Newark, preparing students mentally, \nphysically, and spiritually for the challenges ahead. His dream \nrealized, St. James Prep opens its doors every day stressing academic \nexcellence and social responsibility.\n  Reverend Watley is a true American, one who believes that all people \nshould have access to America's promise. One of his many gifts is the \nability to bring people together to work for a common cause. Reverend \nWatley is an unselfish man whose motivation is not self-gratification. \nHe possesses a higher calling.\n  This week, Reverend Watley celebrates 17 wonderful years of pastoral \nministry at the St. James A.M.E. Church in Newark, NJ where over 3,000 \npeople attend services each Sunday, and where I have frequently joined \nwith the congregation in being spiritually uplifted by Reverend \nWatley's message of hope. Under his expert guidance, St. James A.M.E. \nChurch has experienced enormous growth and is a warm congregation \nfilled with joy and love.\n  Reverend Watley has been a true friend to me. I admire him for his \nleadership in and outside the walls of his church. He is a role model \nfor all of us. I can boldly say that the State of New Jersey is a \nbetter place because of the leadership of Reverend Doctor William D. \nWatley and I am a better man today because of my friendship with him. \nIt is an honor for me to bring him to your attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10284-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNITION OF MISSOURI STATE REPRESENTATIVE LINDA BARTELSMEYER\n\n Mr. BOND.

DAVID LISTON\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, life as a smokejumper is not \nglamorous\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nwith huge financial benefits or personal recognition. Smokejumping is a \ndangerous job undertaken by those with a strong spirit who simply love \nwhat they do fighting forest fires.\n  My home state of Alaska, and the states of many of my colleagues, \nhave been struck by the wrath of forest fires. We often forget the men \nand women who bravely enter the ring of fire to battle the often times \ninsurmountable flames. These courageous firefighters, known in the \nindustry as smokejumpers, parachute out from DC-3 airplanes as they fly \nlow over acres of intense smoke and flames shooting up from the forest \ncanopy. On top of the physical and emotional danger related to \nsmokejumping, work-related injuries such as broken bones, burns and \nchainsaw gashes are common but occasionally smokejumping claims the \nlife of one of its own.\n  Twenty-eight-year-old Bureau of Land Management-Alaska smokejumper \nDavid J. Liston loved firefighting, and he died doing what he loved. \nDuring a refresher jump April 29, 2000 in Fort Wainwright, Alaska, \nDavid's parachute and the back-up chute failed to open. David was \nreturning to work after his honeymoon in Mexico with new wife Kristin; \nthe two were married 21 days earlier, on April 8.\n  Mr. President, David's dedication to firefighting will be remembered \non October 7 by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush at a \nMemorial Service at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in \nEmmitsburg, Maryland. David's name will be inscribed on a plaque at the \nmemorial, along with the names of 100 other firefighters who died in \n2000. Sadly, after the service, the memorial will bear the names of \n2,181 firefighters from 38 states and Puerto Rico. Each family, \nincluding David's, will be presented with an American flag that has \nbeen flown over the nation's Capitol.\n  None of us can thank firefighters enough for the work they do \neveryday. The heroism and bravery we witnessed in the firefighters in \nNew York City, at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania on September 11, \nremind us of the courage America's firefighters must embrace daily. \nTheir selflessness and their desire to help others is to be commended, \nand we always need to remember those, like David Liston, for their \nservice and determination to get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10285-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXCELLENCE IN PHYSICAL FITNESS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize with \npleasure Texas A University on its 125th anniversary. Texas A, one \nof our Nation's finest institutions of higher education, was opened on \nOctober 4, 1876 as the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Texas. \nFrom its roots of agriculture and engineering, A has grown into a \nworld class university that is a leader in university research and \ndevelopment. It also offers an amazing 383 degree-granting programs. \nAlthough the university is justifiably proud of its academic \nreputation, A is especially proud of its famous Corps of Cadets.\n  For 125 years, A's Corps of Cadets have provided our State and \ncountry with leaders in the military, government and business. Texas \nA has the largest cadet corps outside the U.S. military academies and \ncommissions more officers in all four branches of service than any \nother university military program. Former cadets have served in every \nmilitary conflict, from the Indian Wars to Desert Storm. During World \nWar II, 54,000 Aggies served as officers, more than any other school, \nincluding the service academies. They have always answered our Nation's \ncall, and they have always met the challenge. Although only a small \npercentage of Texas A's student population, members of the Corps of \nCadets are the keepers of the many famous traditions at A that \ncontribute to the unique culture and spirit that is ``Aggieland.'' \nToday, former cadets serve in leadership and frontline forces \nthroughout our military services and will help lead our Nation to \nsuccess in this 21st century war against terrorism.\n  Although the military has seen technology move from horse and rifle \nto spacecraft and lasers, the foundations of our military, leadership \nand teamwork, remain the same. These traits are the bedrock of the \nCorps and of Texas A University and explain the success of the \nUniversity and its graduates. During this most difficult time in our \nNation's history, we are all learning the value and strength of A's \nCorps of Cadets motto, Per Unitatem Vis--Through Unity, Strength.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the United States Senate, and with just \nand lasting pride, I offer heartfelt appreciation and respect to all \nthe current and former members of the illustrious Texas A University \nCorps of Cadets. I also wish all Aggies around the world a Happy 125th \nAnniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10285-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time\n\n       S. 1499.

A bill to convey certain property to the city of St. George, \nUtah, in order to provide for the protection and preservation of \ncertain rare paleontological resources on that property, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Virgin River \nDinosaur Footprint Preservation Act. Originally introduced in the House \nby Representative James Hansen of Utah, this legislation is vital in \nguaranteeing the preservation of one of our Nation's most intact and \nrate pre-Jurassic paleontological discoveries. I applaud Chairman \nHansen for his leadership on this issue.\n  In February 2000, Sheldon Johnson of St. George, UT began development \npreparations on his land when he uncovered one of the world's most \nsignificant collections of dinosaur tracks, traildraggings, and skin \nimprints in the surrounding rock. The site has attracted thousands of \nvisitors and the interest of some of the world's top paleontologists.\n  This valuable resource is now in jeopardy. The fragile sandstone in \nwhich the impressions have been made is in jeopardy due to the heat and \nwind typical of the southern Utah climate. We must act quickly if these \nfootprints from our past are to be preserved. This bill would authorize \nthe Secretary of the Interior to purchase the land where the footprints \nand traildraggings are found and convey the property to the city of St. \nGeorge, UT, which will work with the property owners and the county to \npreserve and protect the area and resources in question. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort to protect our national treasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. \n        Hollings, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Levin, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Biden, Ms. Collins, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Burns, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1499.

Mr. President, I am introducing today, together with \nSenator Bond, the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and 26 of my colleagues, including Senators \nWellstone, Harkin, Cleland, Lieberman, Edwards, Carnahan, Levin, Snowe, \nSchumer, Clinton, Daschle, Bingaman, Inouye, Sarbanes, Akaka, Reed of \nRhode Island, Durbin, Kennedy, Grassley, Torricelli, Lincoln, \nRockefeller, Hollings, Leahy, Corzine, Cantwell, Landrieu, Allen, \nMurray, and Johnson, the American Small Business Emergency Relief and \nRecovery Act of 2001.\n  This is emergency legislation to help small businesses that have been \nimpacted as a consequence of the attacks that took place on September \n11. Thousands of small businesses employing millions of Americans are \nsuffering significantly as a consequence of what has happened. Many of \nthese companies may not survive. But these businesses are the engine of \nour economy and we need to act to help them.\n  This bill is the product of bipartisan work on our committee. I thank \nSenator Bond for cosponsoring it and for working with us. It includes \ninput from many sources, much of which was gathered through a \ncombination of about 30 meetings and conference calls with small \nbusiness trade associations, contractors, subcontractors, small \nbusiness lenders, and small business consultants.\n  Of course, I think we have all learned firsthand a lot from the small \nbusiness owners who have told us their personal stories of healthy \nbusinesses--up until September 11--which have simply taken a nosedive \nas a consequence of the tragic events.\n  Our airport small businesses, our taxi drivers, small hotels and \nrestaurants, small suppliers, travel agents, crop dusters, charter bus \ncompanies, and many others have called to explain their plight. For \nexample, there is a woman in my State who started a travel agency 26 \nyears ago in a suburb of Boston. She has six employees. She is hanging \non now only through personal savings because they have zero business \nall of a sudden. The agency has virtually no incoming sales, and has \nhad to refund commissions on all canceled vacation packages, cruises \nand airline tickets that had generated income over the past 6 months.\n  Yesterday, I met with a fellow who does a lot of business out in \nNorth Dakota. Senator Conrad introduced us. They were doing 20,000 \nsales a day. They went down to two sales a day for a period of time. \nThey are now back up to about 10,000. But the problem is that banks are \nwithholding the lines of credit for many of these companies, and we \nwant them to survive.\n  In New York where more than 14,000 businesses inside and around \nground zero have been impacted, there's the story of Sydmore Sportswear \njust four blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. Joseph \nPinkas, who's owned the small business for 20 years owes $100,000 to \nhis suppliers, and revenues are down 65 percent. ``We don't know where \nour customers are going to come from,'' he said in an AP story. ``I'm \nworried about the future, about survival. I don't sleep at night.'' \nOther businesses in the area are filled with dust and debris, and their \nphones are dead.\n  Small businesses doing business with the Federal government have also \nfelt the impact of the attacks on September 11, 2001. Small business \ncontractors, because of very real and legitimate security concerns, \nhave experienced a dramatic increase in costs for work in and around \nFederal government facilities. We have heard reports of small \nbusinesses being denied access to their equipment on military bases, \nwaiting for hours each day to enter government facilities and being \nlimited in the hours they can work on their\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\ncontracts. Once again, let me stress, these security precautions are \nvery necessary, but they are having a dramatic impact on our small \nbusinesses. Many small businesses, particularly those performing \ngovernment contracts, operate on a tight profit margin, so when the \ncontract takes longer to complete, or rented equipment goes unused or \ncan not be returned, unanticipated costs are incurred.\n\n  Let me cite the situation faced by Dave Krueger, president of AS \nHorner Construction, Inc. out of Albuquerque, NM. Dave is currently \ndoing work on a Federal contract at an Air Force facility pouring \nconcrete parking aprons. Immediately after the attack, his company was \nlocked out of the facility for nearly two weeks and currently have \nlimited hours to access the construction site. Dave estimates that this \nwill result in cost increases of at least 10 to 15 percent, meaning he \nwill take a loss on this contract.\n  Such situations cannot go unresolved. Small businesses are far too \nimportant, not just to our national economy, but to our national \ndefense as well. Small business are a vital component of our national \nsupply chain and essential to our national security interests.\n  This act was designed to mitigate bankruptcies, business closures, \nand layoffs related to the attacks. It also addresses the shrinking \navailability of credit and venture capital to small businesses through \ntraditional lenders and investors, which has been exacerbated by the \nattacks. It includes changes in SBA's main non-disaster lending and \nventure capital programs in order to encourage borrowing and lending \nfor new and expanding small businesses that might otherwise be \nreluctant to start or expand their businesses in the post-September 11 \neconomy.\n  This legislation addresses three categories of small businesses:\n  One, small businesses directly affected because they are physically \nlocated in or near the buildings or areas attacked or closed for \nsecurity measures, or are located in national airports. For example, a \nbrokerage firm located in one of the World Trade Center Towers or an \nindependent souvenir shop in the Reagan National Airport or the Miami \nInternational Airport. These businesses will be eligible for SBA's \neconomic injury disaster loans, under more favorable terms, such as \ndeferring the payments and forgiving the interest on these loans for \ntwo years, as well as increasing the loan caps and extending the \ndeadline for applying for disaster loans to one year.\n  Small businesses not physically damaged or destroyed or in the \nvicinity of such businesses, but directly or indirectly affected \nbecause they are a supplier, service provider or complementary \nindustry, especially the financial, hospitality, travel and tour \nindustries. For example, a tour company in Hawaii or Rhode Island that \nhas had hardly any sales since the attacks because the average \noccupancy at its client hotels has dropped to 10 percent. These \nbusinesses are eligible for 7(a) loans, tailored to be easier to \nqualify for, to have lower interest rates, and to offer the option of \ndeferring the principal payments for 1 year.\n  Small businesses in need of capital and investment financing, \nprocurement assistance or management counseling in the economic \naftermath of September 11. These businesses will have access to a \nvariety of SBA's programs with incentive features, such as waiving the \nborrower's fee for a regular 7(a) loan for working capital or a 504 \nloan to buy equipment to increase productivity and beat the \ncompetition, or cut energy consumption and utility costs.\n\n  Mr. President, history has taught us that, during an economic down \nturn, lenders become increasingly reluctant to lend to small \nbusinesses. From our contact with lenders, we know loan committees \ndecided days after the attacks to clamp down on loans to small \nbusinesses. And to make matters worse, lenders are already calling in \nexisting loans. One example is a woman who owns a manufacturing \nbusinesses in Quincy, MA, whose bank called her loan and credit line. \nShe's never missed a payment. Where is she going to come up with more \nthan $1 million? If her business closes, 40 jobs are lost, her \ncontribution to the tax base is lost, and she's out of a job. It is \ncritical to keep credit available to small businesses.\n  In addition to getting credit into the hands of small businesses, it \nis important to make sure they have access to counseling and training \nto run their businesses better, deal with the volatile market, and \nadjust to the changing times. Providing access to such counseling helps \nprotect our investment in their loans because a stronger business is \nmore likely to repay its loans. This legislation increases funding for \nthe Small Business Development Centers, with an emphasis on New York \nand Virginia, as well as the volunteer Service Corps of Retired \nExecutives, the Women's Business Centers, and SBA's microlending \nexperts.\n  To help alleviate the unfortunate situations related to delayed \nFederal contracts, my legislation includes provisions to help expedite \nthe claims of small business contractors applying for equitable \nadjustments to their contracts. The goal of this provision, simply, is \nto help offset the unanticipated and temporary costs of the increased \nsecurity at Federal Government facilities. Additionally, it establishes \na $100 million fund under the control of the Small Business \nAdministration to ensure that no contracting agency has to pay out of \npreviously allocated funds the increased costs of existing contracts \nbecause of the security measures implemented as a result of the \nSeptember 11th attacks.\n  I have confidence in our economy. The attacks may have arrested one \nof our financial centers momentarily and robbed families and businesses \nof thousands of brilliant and hard-working folks who helped make our \ncountry prosperous, but our economic foundation is strong. We have \nworld-class universities, we have a great work force made up of people \nwith an amazing work ethic, our banks are strong, we have a reliable \ninfrastructure for communications, energy and transport, and the dollar \nis holding up.\n  Now is not the time to pull back on investing in our economy, \nparticularly in small-business development and growth. The SBA is doing \na good job with the tools it has, but we need to improve those tools \nand give SBA more resources to deal with the scope of the problems \nfaced by small businesses in the aftermath of September 11th. This \nlegislation does just that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, \nand the Senate to act quickly so that this emergency help is available \nvery soon.\n  Mr. President, Senator Akaka could not be present to voice his \nsupport for this bill and concern for the small businesses in Hawaii, \nso I ask unanimous consent that his statement be included in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  In addition to this legislation that I am introducing today, there \nare a series of tax items that we believe fall into the category of \nstimulus, but they are not within the jurisdiction of our committee. As \na member of the Finance Committee, I am going to encourage our \ncommittee to embrace these. One would be an increase in expensing, so \nthat you can deduct an expense up to $24,000 of the cost of qualifying \nproperty; and we would encourage that increase and expensing to \nencourage greater business investment, and we want that expensing \nallowance increased to a higher amount.\n\n  In addition, I have several times introduced--and I will \nreintroduce--a zero capital gains tax for those companies with \ncapitalization up to $200 million or $300 million in new capitalization \nin the critical technologies or entrepreneurial businesses, where we \nwould most respond to the creation of the high-value-added jobs or some \nof the technology fixes that will exist for security, for instance, or \nfor national defense and other things that we need to do with respect \nto the battle against terrorism.\n  Third would be changes in depreciation. There are a number of \nproposals for changes to depreciation rules. We would support some, \nsuch as changing the depreciation schedule for computer hardware from 5 \nyears to 3, software from 3 years to 2, or several other proposals.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of these tax proposals which the \nSmall Business Committee will refer to the Finance Committee and to our \ncolleagues with hopes that we can embrace them as a component of the \nstimulus package because they will have a\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nstimulus effect and a long-term beneficial effect on our economy.\n  Small businesses, as we all know, small businesses represent 99 \npercent of all employers, provide 75 percent of all net new jobs and \ncontribute significantly to our economy. Every single company on the \nstock exchange today began as a small business. Some of them, such as \nCallaway Golf, Federal Express, Intel, and many others, got help \nthrough the Small Business Administration's loans or venture capital.\n  The Federal Government helped provide the impetus for those \ncompanies. We have many times over repaid the Federal Treasury the \nentire budget of the Small Business Administration and its lending \nprograms through the taxes paid by the success stories of our \ninvestments.\n  I encourage my colleagues to embrace this emergency relief act, the \nAmerican Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act, and these \nemergency tax measures, as a way of encouraging further business growth \nand development.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from the National Community Reinvestment Corporation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                National Community\n\n\n                                       Reinvestment Coalition,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2001.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry: The National Community Reinvestment \n     Coalition (NCRC) strongly supports the American Small \n     Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001 as \n     essential to the efforts of lending institutions, community \n     organizations and local public agencies to help small \n     businesses directly and indirectly impacted by the September \n     11th terrorist attacks. NCRC and our 800+ member \n     organizations community groups and local public agencies \n     around the country also commend your leadership on this \n     legislative measure and pledge to promote this bill via our \n     membership and through our policy initiatives.\n       In today's new enterprise marketplace, entrepreneurs have \n     surged into small businesses ownership in record numbers. \n     Their impact on U.S. growth and productivity is evident.\n       America's 25.5 million small businesses represent more than \n     99 percent of our nation's employers. They employ 51 percent \n     of the private sector workforce and create over 80 percent of \n     all the net new jobs in the United States.\n       In 2000, there were 612,400 new employer firms, an increase \n     of 4.3 percent from 1999. Small business bankruptcies \n     decreased by 14.8 percent between 1999 and 2000, to the \n     lowest level in over 20 years. And the business failure index \n     also decreased by 1.7 percent since, 1999.\n       Small businesses' income increased 7.2 percent, rising from \n     595.2 billion in 1998 to $638.2 billion in 1999. They \n     represent 96 percent of all exporters of goods and generate \n     more than half of the nation's gross domestic product.\n       Today, however, hardship and economic adversity have \n     stricken the small business marketplace as a result of the \n     September 11th attacks. NCRC commends the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) for acting quickly to help entrepreneurs \n     deal with the aftermath of the attacks. Unfortunately, SBA's \n     authority is limited under the Disaster Loan Program \n     guidelines. SBA may only provide assistance in declared \n     disaster areas' contiguous communities.\n       What will happen to the gift basket service whose sole \n     distribution source was a florist in one of the World Trade \n     Center towers? What will happen to the small catering \n     business that has had to lay off staff as a result of banquet \n     cancellations and no new bookings? And what will happen to \n     the independent souvenir store in Ronald Reagan International \n     Airport and other airports, given current lack of traffic in \n     the terminals?\n       Your American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery \n     Act of 2001 is key to the recovery efforts. If enacted, it \n     will help small business entrepreneurs drive the American \n     economy. NCRC has long championed the role of small \n     businesses in growing and expanding our economy. Since our \n     inception in 1990, we have led the charge to bring equal \n     access to credit and capital to all emerging market sectors. \n     One highly successful capacity-building initiative is the \n     SBA/NCRC partnership on the CommunityExpress program.\n       CommunityExpress is part of SBA's initiative to spur \n     economic development and job creation in under-served \n     communities. The program combines SBA loan guarantees, \n     targeted lending by select banks, and technical assistance \n     from local NCRC membes. The key to CommunityExpress is that \n     it provides small business entrepreneurs with technical and \n     managerial assistance before and after the loan is made.\n       The SBA/NCRC cooperative effort has led to the rapid growth \n     of the loan program from a level of just over $2 million in \n     Fall 1999 to over $42 million in loans as of September 2001. \n     Of the 439 loans to date, women and minority entrepreneurs \n     have been the greatest beneficiaries, as nearly 56 percent of \n     the loans have gone to women and 52 percent of loans have \n     gone to minorities. The average size of a CommunityExpress \n     loan is $96,527 with 61 loans between $200,000 and $250,000.\n       Your leadership has paved the way to support small \n     businesses in the wake of the September 11th tragedy. NCRC \n     pledges to continue support your efforts and to help \n     entrepreneurs in low- and moderate-income areas through \n     CommunityExpress and other initiatives.\n       We thank you for your continuing efforts. We look forward \n     to working with you and your outstanding staff during the \n     course of the 107th Congress--and beyond.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      John Taylor,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of \n2001. I thank Senator John Kerry for introducing this bill, and I am \npleased to be its principal cosponsor. In this period immediately \nfollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon, I urge all my colleagues to review this bill closely. \nIts prompt passage will provide important tools to small businesses \nthat were directly and indirectly harmed by the terrorist attacks.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I receive on a daily basis pleas for help from small \nbusiness in Missouri and across the Nation: small restaurants who have \nlost much of their business due to the fall off in business travel; \nlocal flight schools that have been grounded as a result of the recent \nterrorist attacks; and Main Street retailers who are struggling to \nsurvive in the slowing economy. Clearly, we in Congress must act and \nact soon to help our Nation's small businesses.\n  In response to these urgent calls for help, yesterday, I introduced \nthe Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (S. 1493), \nwhich is designed to provide effective economic stimulus in three \ndistinct but complementary ways: increasing access to capital for the \nNation's small enterprises; providing tax relief and investment \nincentives for our small firms and the self-employed; and directing one \nof the Nation's largest consumers, the Federal Government, to shop with \nsmall business in America.\n  The Kerry-Bond bill goes to the heart of the problem by addressing \nthe access to capital barriers now confronting small businesses. This \nbill is a bipartisan collaboration between Senator Kerry and me and our \nstaffs of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. We have \nworked together to devise one-time modifications to the SBA Disaster \nRelief, 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs because the traditional approach to \ndisaster relief will not address the critical needs of thousands of \nsmall businesses located at or around the World Trade Center, the \nPentagon and in strategic locations throughout the United States.\n  In New York City, it may be a year or more before many of the small \nbusinesses destroyed or shut down by the terrorist attacks can reopen \ntheir doors for business. Small firms near the Pentagon, such as those \nat the Reagan National Airport or Crystal City, Virginia, are also shut \ndown or barely operating. And there are small businesses throughout the \nUnited States that have been shut down for national security concerns. \nFor example, General Aviation aircraft remain grounded, closing all \nflight schools and other small businesses dependent on single engine \naircraft.\n  Regular small business disaster loans fall short of providing \neffective disaster relief to help these small businesses. Therefore, \nour bill will allow small businesses to defer for up to two years \nrepayment of principal and interest on their SBA disaster relief loans. \nInterest that would otherwise accrue during the deferment period would \nbe forgiven. The thrust of this essential new ingredient is to allow \nthe small businesses to get back on their feet without jeopardizing \ntheir credit or driving them into bankruptcy.\n\n  Small enterprises located in the presidentially declared disaster \nareas surrounding the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are not the \nonly businesses experiencing extreme hardship as a direct result of the \nterrorist\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nattacks of September 11. Nationwide, thousands of small businesses are \nunable to conduct business or are operating at a bare-minimum level. \nTens of thousands of jobs are at risk of being lost as small businesses \nweather the fall out from the September 11 attacks.\n  The Kerry-Bond bill provides a special financial tool to assist small \nbusinesses as they deal with these significant business disruptions. \nSmall businesses in need of working capital would be able to obtain \nSBA-guaranteed ``Emergency Relief Loans'' from their banks to help them \nduring this period. Fees normally paid by the borrower to the SBA would \nbe eliminated, and the SBA would guarantee 95 percent of the loan. A \nkey feature of the bill is the authorization for banks to defer \nrepayment of principal for up to one year.\n  My colleagues and I have been hearing time and time again during the \nlast three weeks since the terrorist attacks that small businesses are \nexperiencing significant hardship. The downturn in business activity, \nhowever, was clearly underway prior to September 11. The downturn was \nfurther exacerbated by the terrorist attacks.\n  Historically, when our economy slows or turns into a recession, the \nstrength of the small business sector helps to right our economic ship, \nwith small businesses leading the nation to economic recovery. Today, \nsmall businesses employ 58 percent of the U.S. workforce and create 75 \npercent of the net new jobs. Clearly, we cannot afford to ignore \nAmerica's small businesses as we consider measures to stimulate our \neconomy.\n  The Kerry-Bond bill would provide for changes in the SBA 7(a) \nGuaranteed Business Loan Program and the 504 Certified Development \nCompany Loan Program to stimulate lending to small businesses that are \nmost likely to grow and add new employees. These enhancements to the \nSBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs are to extend for one year. They are \ndesigned to make the program more affordable during the period when the \neconomy is weak and banks have tightened their underwriting \nrequirements for small business loans.\n  Specifically, when the economy is slowing, it is normal for banks to \nraise the bar for obtaining commercial loans. However, making it harder \nfor small businesses to survive is the wrong reaction to a slowing \neconomy. By making these one-year adjustments to the 7(a) and 504 loans \nto make them more affordable to borrowers and lenders, we will be \nworking against history's rules governing a slowing economy, thereby \nadding a stimulus for small businesses. Essentially, we will be \nproviding a counter-cyclical action in the face of a slow economy with \nthe express purpose of accelerating the recovery.\n  The SBA has a very effective infrastructure for providing management \nassistance to small businesses located nationwide. The Small Business \nDevelopment Center (SBDC), SCORE, Women's Business Center and Microloan \nprograms provide much needed counseling to small businesses that are \nstruggling or facing problems in their start-up phase. With the U.S. \neconomy under unusual stress, many segments of the small business \ncommunity are today unable to cope with daily management issues.\n  The Kerry-Bond bill would authorize expansions in these programs so \nthat the SBDCs, the SCORE chapters and the Women's Business Centers are \npositioned to address the needs of a large influx of small businesses \nlooking for help. Our bill would create special authorizations for each \nprogram to provide assistance tailored to the needs of small businesses \nfollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, the bill \nwould increase the authorization levels by the following amounts: SBDC \nprogram $25 million, SCORE $2 million, Women's Business Centers, $2 \nmillion, and Microloan technical assistance, $5 million.\n  In order to measure the impact of the terrorist attacks on small \nbusinesses and the effectiveness of the Federal response to provide \nassistance, the Kerry-Bond bill directs the Office of Advocacy at the \nSBA to submit annual studies to the Congress for the next five years \noutlining its findings. Specifically, each annual report should include \ninformation and data on bankruptcies and business failures, job losses, \nand the impact of the assistance to the adversely affected small \nbusinesses. $500,000 annually is authorized for the Office of Advocacy \nto carry out this important five year project.\n  The American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of 2001 \nis important legislation that is needed to help the many struggling \nsmall businesses. I am pleased to join Senator Kerry and my colleagues \nwho are cosponsoring the bill in urging an early debate on this bill. \nSwift passage will very helpful to the long-term survival of many of \nAmerican's small businesses.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in extremely strong support \nof S. 1499, the American Small Business Emergency Relief and Protection \nAct, and I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the legislation. \nIn the aftermath of the attacks on New York City and the Pentagon on \nSeptember 11, we were right I believe, to focus our attention on the \nloss of human life and the enormous tragedy that had affected our \nentire Nation. From my perspective, there would have been something \ncallous about calculating economic impact when there was so much \nvisible pain and suffering going on around us.\n  But as time has passed, there is an economic reality that must be \naddressed in a coherent and effective fashion. The increasingly \nnegative economic reports we face cannot be ignored as they have \nimmediate and tangible effects on the people and communities of our \ncountry. Over the last week or so the administration, along with key \nMembers of Congress, have discussed the creation of an economic \nstimulus plan that is designed to pull our country and our economy back \non track and back to where it belongs. Although this plan has yet to be \nsolidified, it will provide Americans with a stable and secure \nfoundation upon which public confidence can grow again, economic growth \ncan expand again, and business productivity can increase again.\n  The bipartisan legislation that was introduced today by Senator Kerry \nwill complement this economic stimulus package by giving substantial \nassistance to the small businesses that were either directly affected \nby the events on September 11 or subsequently affected by the ripple \nthat has spread across the United States. Senator Kerry has very wisely \ntaken an approach that looks not only at the small businesses that were \nin the immediate areas of the attack and thus suffered as a result of \nthe damage or closures, but also those businesses--supplier firms, \ncontractors, and so on--that have suffered indirectly as a result of \nthe initial destruction. These businesses will now have the opportunity \nto obtain a number of benefits not previously available under current \nlegislation. In brief, the legislation: expands and facilities access \nfor small business to the SBA Disaster Loan Program; offers incentives \nthat allows business to use the 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs; provides \nadditional funds to the SCORE and SBDC Programs, and; increases \noutreach done by SBA to small businesses in need of management \nconsulting.\n  Let me provide some context to this effort. From where I sit, no \nsector of the economy is as vital, dynamic, and creative as small \nbusiness. If you read the paper or listen to the news, you know that \nthere has been an entrepreneurial explosion in the United States over \nthe last decade, and that this explosion has significantly impacted \nevery region in the country. According to the latest estimates, there \nare at least 24 million full time small businesses in the United States \nat this time, employing millions of Americans. Make no mistake about \nit, these businesses drive the U.S. economy, as they are the ones that \nfire innovation, provide jobs, and create wealth for the country as a \nwhole. When we talk about the knowledge economy, we are talking about \nsmall business. When we talk about energy and risk-taking, we are \ntalking about small business. When we talk about the ``creative \ndestruction'' that enhances our over-all competitiveness and pushes our \ncountry forward, we are talking about small business.\n  Small business represents the best of the United States, and from \nwhere I sit we should always make sure it has everything it needs to \nmake a go of it. In my State of New Mexico, there are nearly 40,000 \nsmall businesses, over half\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\nowned by women and minorities. These entities employ nearly 60 percent \nof the individuals that are now working in my state and generate \nbillions of dollars in revenue. New Mexico depends on small business \nfor its continued economic welfare, and I am committed to helping them \nsucceed in good times and in bad.\n  It is never easy to start a small business or earn a profit, but it \nhas gotten significantly harder recently. Many small businesses were \nalready teetering on the brink as a result of the economic downturn, \nbut in number of cases, conditions have become unmanageable as a result \nof the September 11 events and the recession. It is time to recognize \nthat these folks need some help. This legislation does that. It shows \nthat the Congress cares about what has happened and will do everything \nin its power to put things back on track again. It accepts the fact \nthat these folks are not experiencing a normal business cycle downturn, \nand that they can't wait for the next upturn for things to get better. \nThey need some assistance, and they need it now.\n  As far as I am concerned, it would be a good fit to have this \nspecific legislation in the economic stimulus package being put \ntogether at this time. However, given how far down the road the \nnegotiations over that package are, I doubt if that is possible. If \nthis is indeed the case, I think it is imperative absolutely \nimperative, that this legislation be passed by both the Senate and the \nHouse, and then signed by the President as soon as possible. If we are \nlooking for stability and confidence to be re-established in the United \nStates, small business is a good place to start. It is time to act, and \nI urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and Missouri, Mr. Bond, as an original \ncosponsor of the American Small Business Emergency Relief and \nProtection Act of 2001.\n  As our Nation grieves for the victims and honors the rescuers, the \nAmerican people stand with President Bush and support his assurance \nthat our response to this terrible event and our pursuit of justice \nwill be ``calm and resolute.'' The challenge and responsibility we all \nshare in the aftermath of September 11 is to return to work, carry on \nwith business, bolster our economy, and restore public confidence in \nthe freedom of movement which we enjoy.\n  We have already begun to repair the damage, enhance airline security, \nstrengthen our national security, and fight terrorism. We have acted to \nsupport the airline industry in this difficult time. Now, legislation \nis needed to support small businesses as they face increasing \nchallenges.\n  It has been twenty-three days since the disaster and millions of \nworkers and small businesses nationwide in a variety of industries have \nfelt the economic aftershock of these events. Hawaii's hospitality \nindustry has been hit particularly hard by the significant decrease in \nbusiness and leisure travelers who are staying close to home. Airlines \nare having to adjust to the reduced number of travelers, while hotels \nare dealing with low occupancy rates due to the cancellation or \npostponement of planned trips to Hawaii. Since the airports reopened, \ndomestic visitor arrivals in Hawaii have decreased by 31 percent \ncompared to the same time period last year. Comparing international \narrivals during the period from September 15-25 for 2000 and 2001, \nreveals a 65 percent decrease in visitors. Restaurants, hospitality \nservices, shopping centers, and other tourism-related businesses are \nalso being affected by the lack of visitors. The Hawaii Department of \nLabor and Industrial Relations reports that unemployment claims for the \nweek of September 17 were double the weekly average. It is estimated \nthat 80 percent of these claims are tourism related.\n  Hawaii is not alone in experiencing a downturn in tourist and \nbusiness travel. Popular visitor destinations across the country, \nincluding Washington, DC, Florida, and Las Vegas have also endured \nsharp drops in visitors. The losses to airlines, hotels, restaurants, \nand other small businesses are already in the billions of dollars. The \neconomic repercussions extend to all fifty states, as the economic \ndecline impacts the lives of millions of people.\n  While I am confident that Hawaii's and our Nation's tourism industry \ncan withstand this downturn in the economy, action is necessary to help \npreserve existing jobs and support the economy during this difficult \ntime. Further job reductions will have significant spillover effects on \nthe economy.\n  The legislation is aimed at alleviating the economic strain on small \nbusinesses by providing crucial access to credit. By expanding the \napplication eligibility of the Small Business Administration's Disaster \nLoan programs to event-based instead of location-based criteria, many \nmore struggling companies in all 50 states will be able to obtain the \nassistance they need. For example, small companies which provide \nhospitality or travel services would be eligible. Many others in a wide \nrange of industries would be permitted to apply for assistance. The \nmeasure would also create incentives for small businesses to utilize \nthe non-disaster relief loan programs. The incentives would encourage \nwary individuals and companies to borrow and lend to establish and \nexpand small businesses in the current economic environment.\n  I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and Missouri for introducing \nthis legislation and ask my colleagues to join in supporting this \nessential measure to assist small businesses in the aftermath of the \nheinous attacks of September 11.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 1500. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax and other incentives to maintain a vibrant travel and tourism \nindustry, to keep working people working, and to stimulate economic \ngrowth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce critical \nlegislation that will help restore confidence in our country's ailing \ntravel and tourism industry as well as serve as an immediate stimulus \nto our economy in general.\n  As recent economic data have confirmed, our economy was ailing before \nthe terrorist attacks on Tuesday, September, 11, but few were talking \nabout emergency measures to stimulate it. What is different after \nSeptember 11 is the downward spiral of the economy, led by the travel \nindustry.\n  Proposals for stimulating the economy have centered on traditional \narguments as to whether we should focus more on stimulating business \ninvestment, consumer demand, or infrastructure. Eager for a bipartisan \napproach, members of Congress and President Bush appear agreeable to \nsplitting the difference and doing a little of each. To me, that's a \npolitical solution and it ignores the emergency created in the \naftermath of September 11.\n  I believe that we need to rethink what has happened to our economy to \narrive at the stimulus legislation that attacks the major problem, and, \ntherefore, will do the most overall good.\n  Before September 11, our economy was ailing for precisely the reasons \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan articulated, a lack of business \ninvestment. The terrorist attacks have made the general situation worse \nand caused an absolute emergency in certain sectors of the economy. \nAlthough I certainly agree that Congress should stimulate business \ninvestment and shore up consumer expectations, for example, by making \nour recent tax law permanent, cutting capital gains taxes, eliminating \ncorporate AMT and accelerating our outdated cost recovery periods, I \ncontend that our first focus should be directly on the sector hardest \nhit by these events.\n  To illustrate my point, an analogy is useful. Our economy had a bad \ncase of the flu before September 11. Reducing interest rates, providing \ntax relief, and cutting regulatory burdens were all part of the \nantibiotic medicine needed to get the economy healthy again. During the \neconomy's rehabilitation period, however, it sustained a major trauma. \nUnder these circumstances, what should be a first priority, another \ndose of flue medication, or treatment applied directly to the gaping \nwound?\n  I believe that we must focus an emergency economic stimulus on the \nsector that has been most harmed: our travel industry. If we are to \nprevent thousands of bankruptcies, hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, \nas well as numerous indirect consequences to the\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nrest of the economy, it is essential that we provide some immediate \nhelp to the travel industry.\n  Accordingly, I am introducing legislation that seeks to treat this \nemergency economic situation or wound before it spreads an infection \nthroughout the entire economy. Elements of my legislation include: \nProviding a temporary $500 tax credit per person ($1,000 for a couple \nfiling jointly) for personal travel expenses for travel originating in \nand within the United States. This will help encourage Americans to \nresume their normal travel habits. Unlike general rebate checks to \ntaxpayers, a tax credit conditioned on travel expenses ensures that the \nmoney is spent on a specific activity, in this case an activity that \nwill generate positive economic ripples throughout the entire American \neconomy. It will also help create confidence and encourage Americans to \nget back on airplanes.\n  Since business travel expenses are already deductible, temporarily \nrestoring full deductibility for all business entertainment expenses, \nincluding meals, that are now subject to a 50 percent limitation, would \nhelp bring back the backbone of the travel industry, the business \ntraveler.\n  Finally, in order to provide tax relief to those travel-related \nbusinesses most hurt by the terrorist attacks, Congress should allow \nthese companies to ``carry back'' their losses incurred after September \n11, for a temporary period of three additional years, a total, \ntemporary, ``carry back'' period of five years. This will allow \ncompanies that have been profitable until September 11, but then lost \nmoney in excess of the past two years' amount of profit, to offset \nprevious years' profit. Without this relief, many companies will go \nbankrupt, solely due to the terrorist attacks.\n  To be quick and temporary, the credit should be available for \nexpenses incurred before December 31, 2001. The travel could occur \nlater.\n  This legislation meets the criteria set forth by President Bush and \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee. By definition, the relief would \nbe temporary. The revenue loss attributable to this legislation for \n2001 should occur no later than 2002 and so there would not be a long-\nterm, negative drag on our federal budget. In fact, I believe that it \nwould help ensure a positive, long-term budgetary position by getting \nAmerica moving and doing business again. As for the need to stimulate \nconsumer spending, providing consumers with incentives to travel is \nclearly a demand-driven idea. I also contend that it will help stem the \nretrenchment in business investment that the economy is experiencing in \nthe travel industry and many related industries. Finally, travel is not \na partisan issue, it is one of the most bipartisan of all issues.\n  As Secretary O' Neill said before the Finance Committee on October 3, \n``The medicine has to work and be worth the cost.'' Without airline \ntravel, collateral consequences to related industries will be \nsubstantial. Of all the competing proposals I can think of, none more \ndirectly affects the major cause of the problem in our economy.\n  So there it is. Our economy has sustained a specific trauma. We need \na quick and focused response to this emergency condition. the ``Travel \nAmerica Now Act'' provides the right medicine for the most acute \nproblem. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Travel America Now Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Prior to September 11, 2001, more than 19,000,000 \n     Americans were employed in travel and travel-related jobs, \n     with an estimated annual payroll of $171,500,000,000.\n       (2) In recent years, the travel and tourism industry has \n     grown to be the third largest industry in the United States \n     as measured by retail sales, with over $582,000,000,000 in \n     expenditures, generating over $99,600,000,000 in Federal, \n     State, and local tax revenues in 2000.\n       (3) In 2000, the travel and tourism industry created a \n     $14,000,000,000 balance of trade surplus for the United \n     States.\n       (4) The travel and tourism industry and all levels of \n     government are working together to ensure that, following the \n     horrific terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon on September 11, 2001, travel is safe and secure, \n     and that confidence among travelers is maintained.\n       (5) Urgent, short-term measures are necessary to keep \n     working people working and to generate cash flow to assist \n     the travel and tourism industry in its ongoing efforts to \n     retain its economic footing.\n       (6) Increased consumer spending on travel and tourism is \n     essential to revitalizing the United States economy.\n       (7) The American public should be encouraged to travel for \n     personal, as well as business, reasons as a means of keeping \n     working people working and generating cash flow that can help \n     stimulate a rebound in the Nation's economy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to consolidate in a single independent agency in the \nExecutive branch the responsibilities regarding food safety, labeling, \nand inspection currently divided among several Federal agencies; to the \nCommittee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould replace the current fragmented Federal food safety system with a \nsingle agency responsible for all Federal food safety activities, the \nSafe Food Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nTorricelli, Mikulski, and Clinton in this important effort.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest \nand most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do \nbetter. Foodborne illnesses and hazards are still a significant problem \nthat cannot be passively dismissed.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimate that as \nmany as 76 million people will suffer from food poisoning this year. Of \nthose individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more \nthan 5,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, \nalso predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-15 \npercent over the next decade. With emerging pathogens, an aging \npopulation with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne \nillnesses, broader distribution patterns, an increasing volume of food \nimports, and changing consumption patterns, this situation is not \nlikely to improve without decisive action.\n  Foodborne illnesses are not only a safety concern for our citizens. \nThey are also a costly problem for the Nation. In terms of medical \ncosts and productivity losses, foodborne illness costs the Nation up to \n$37 billion annually.\n  American consumers spend more than $617 billion annually on food, of \nwhich about $511 billion is spent on foods grown on U.S. farms. Our \nability to ensure that our food supply is safe, and to react rapidly to \npotential threats to food safety is critical not only for public \nhealth, but also to the vitality of both domestic and rural economies \nand international trade.\n  Many of you have probably followed the stories about the European \nfood crises, dioxin contamination of Belgian food, foot-and-mouth \ndisease in the United Kingdom, and mad cow disease spreading to 13 \nEuropean countries, as well as to Asia. While these diseases have \nthankfully not reached the United States, they do cause American \nconsumers concern and remind us that food safety fears are global.\n  Today, food moves through a global marketplace. This was not the case \nin the early 1900s when the first Federal food safety agencies were \ncreated. Throughout this century, Congress responded by adding layer \nupon layer, agency upon agency, to answer the pressing food safety \nneeds of the day. That's how the Federal food safety system got to the \npoint where it is today. And again as we face increasing pressures on \nfood safety, the Federal Government must respond. But we must respond \nnot only to these pressures but also to the highly fragmented nature of \nthe Federal food safety structure.\n\n  Fragmentation of our food safety system is a burden that must be \nchanged to protect the public health from these increasing pressures. \nCurrently, there are at least 12 different Federal agencies and 35 \ndifferent laws governing food safety. With overlapping jurisdictions, \nFederal agencies often lack accountability on food safety-related \nissues.\n  The General Accounting Office, GAO, has also been unequivocal in its \nrecommendation for consolidation of Federal food safety programs. Over \nthe past two years, GAO has issued numerous reports on topics such as \nfood recalls, food safety inspections, and the transport of animal \nfeeds. Each of these reports highlight the current fragmentation and \ninconsistent organization of the various agencies involved in food \nsafety oversight. In August 1999, GAO testified that a ``single \nindependent food safety agency administering a unified, risk-based food \nsafety system is the preferred approach . . .'' to food safety \noversight. Also, in a May 25, 1994 report, GAO cites that its testimony \nin support of a unified, risk-based food safety system ``is based on \nover 60 reports and studies issued over the last 25 years by GAO, \nagency Inspectors General, and others.'' The Appendix to the 1994 GAO \nreport lists 49 reports since 1977, 9 USDA Office of Inspector General \nreports since 1986, 1 HHS Office of Inspector General report in 1991, \nand 15 reports and studies by Congress, scientific organizations, and \nothers since 1981.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, NAS, has also concluded that the \ncurrent fragmented food safety system is less than adequate to meet \nAmerica's food safety needs. In August 1998, the NAS released a report \nrecommending the establishment of a ``unified and central framework'' \nfor managing Federal food safety programs. They instructed that the \nunified system should be ``one that is headed by a single official and \nwhich has the responsibility and control of resources for all Federal \nfood safety activities.''\n  I agree with the recommendations of both the GAO and the NAS. A \nsingle food safety agency is needed to replace the current, fragmented \nsystem. My proposed legislation would combine the functions of USDA's \nFood Safety and Inspection Service, FDA's Center for Food Safety and \nApplied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the \nDepartment of Commerce's Seafood Inspection Program, and the food \nsafety functions of other Federal agencies. This agency would be funded \nwith the combined budgets from these consolidated agencies.\n  Following the events of September 11, we are more keenly focused on \nhow varied aspects of America's homeland\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nsecurity, including our Nation's food supply, may be vulnerable to \nattack. Our Federal food safety system must be able to prevent \npotential food hazards from reaching the public. A single food safety \nagency will help ensure that we have a cohesive process to address all \nongoing and emerging threats to food safety.\n  With overlapping jurisdictions, Federal agencies many times lack \naccountability on food safety-related issues. There are simply too many \ncooks in the kitchen. A single agency would help focus our policy and \nimprove enforcement of food safety and inspection laws.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nadvised that consolidation is essential to avoid conflicts of interest \nand overlapping jurisdictions. This 1977 report stated, ``While we \nsupport the recent efforts of FDA and USDA to improve coordination \nbetween the agencies, periodic meetings will not be enough to overcome \n[these] problems.''\n  It's time to move forward. Let's stop discussing the need to \nconsolidate and instead take steps to make consolidation happen. Let us \ncreate what only makes sense, a single food safety agency!\n  A single agency with uniform food safety standards and regulations \nbased on food hazards would provide an easier framework for \nimplementing U.S. standards in an international context. When our own \nagencies don't have uniform safety and inspection standards for all \npotentially hazardous foods, the establishment of uniform international \nstandards will be next to impossible.\n  Research could be better coordinated within a single agency than \namong multiple programs. Currently, Federal funding for food safety \nresearch is spread over at least 20 Federal agencies, and coordination \namong those agencies is ad hoc at best.\n  New technologies to improve food safety could be approved more \nrapidly with one food safety agency. Currently, food safety \ntechnologies must go through multiple agencies for approval, often \nadding years of delay.\n  Food recalls are on the rise. In fact, at the end of August 2001, \nFSIS reported that there have been over fifty recalls of meat and \npoultry products throughout the Nation this year alone. Under these \nserious circumstances, it is important to move beyond short-term \nsolutions to major food safety problems. A single food safety and \ninspection agency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to \nthe frustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety.\n  In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to modernize \nand streamline the food safety system. The U.S. simply cannot afford to \ncontinue operating multiple systems. This is not about more regulation, \na super agency, or increased bureaucracy. It is about common sense and \nmore effective marshaling of our existing Federal resources.\n  Together, we can bring the various agencies together to eliminate the \noverlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at times characterized \nour food safety efforts. We need action, not simply reaction. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to consolidate the \nfood safety and inspection functions of numerous agencies and offices \ninto a single food safety agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Bayh, \n        and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1502. A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable tax credit for health insurance costs for COBRA continuation \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORD. Mr. President, as President Bush said yesterday, \nregarding the need for an economic stimulus package: ``one person laid \noff is one person too many.'' I strongly agree. Today, I'm pleased to \njoin with Senator Lincoln and my other colleagues in introducing the \nCOBRA Plus Act of 2001. This legislation will help those who've lost \ntheir jobs in the aftermath of the terrorist acts of September 11 keep \nhealth insurance coverage for themselves and their families as they \nseek new employment.\n  As we in Congress work with the administration to develop an economic \nstimulus package, it needs to reflect the three themes spelled out by \nSecretary O'Neill. The package must restore consumer confidence. For \nwith the restoration of confidence, the American people will again \nbegin buying our Nation's goods and services. We must also support \nincreased business investment. Business investment is what creates new \njobs and is the engine of our economy. And finally, and I think most \nimportantly, we must help those individual Americans who lost their \njobs as a consequence of the terrorist bombings of September 11.\n  COBRA provides an existing mechanism to allow these laid-off workers \nthe opportunity to keep their health insurance while they seek new \nemployment. Under COBRA, an employer with 20 or more employees must \nprovide those employees and their families the option of continuing \ntheir coverage under the employer's group health insurance plan in the \ncase of losing their job. The employer is not required to pay for this \ncoverage; instead, the individual can be required to pay up to 102 \npercent of the premium.\n  For all of its strengths, COBRA has some significant deficiencies. \nWhile it allows those who've lost their job to keep their health \ninsurance coverage, it requires them to pay the entire premium at a \ntime when they have no income. The high cost of COBRA is the major \nreason cited for the fact that only 18 percent of eligible enrollees \nutilize their coverage option. The COBRA Plus Act of 2001 solves this \nproblem. It provides a 50-percent subsidy for the individual's health \ninsurance premium, not to exceed a total of $110 per month for single \ncoverage and $290 per month for family coverage. This subsidy would be \na refundable tax credit, which means it is available regardless of \none's tax liability, and the credit could be advanced directly on a \nmonthly basis to the individual's employer or health insurance plan.\n  The credit would be available for a period not to exceed 9 months and \nthe credit must be used to purchase COBRA coverage. The credit would be \navailable for 2 years beginning January 1, 2002 and it would sunset on \nDecember 31, 2003. While the Joint Committee on Taxation has not \nreleased a cost estimate, rough informal estimates are that the \nlegislation will cost between $3.3 billion and $5 billion per year and \nit would more than double the number of individuals utilizing COBRA at \nany one time from the current level of $2.5 million to $6 million.\n  Vermont's motto of ``Freedom and Unity'' captures the sense of \nindividual responsibility and shared community that are the twin goals \nof the COBRA Plus Act of 2001. First, by giving unemployed workers \naccess to additional financial resources, it will significantly \nincrease the number of Americans who take advantage of COBRA's health \ninsurance coverage option. And second, by relying on the tax code, the \ncredit will go directly to individuals and eliminate the need to create \na new Federal program.\n  In my home State of Vermont, as is the case across the country, these \nrecent events have put the security of a well-paid job with health \ninsurance coverage at risk. It is important that we here in Congress \nhelp to restore confidence in the fundamental strength of our Nation's \neconomy. Americans should know that they will still have productive \njobs with health insurance coverage for their families now and into the \nfuture. I believe that the enactment of this legislation will be an \nimportant strand in strengthening the fabric of our society as we move \nforward in addressing the terrible acts of September 11.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Jeffords, \nLincoln, Snowe, and Bayh today in introducing the COBRA Plus Act of \n2001.\n  The COBRA Plus Act of 2001 will provide a tax credit to help offset \nthe costs of COBRA health insurance for unemployed workers. This is \nparticularly important due to the challenges that our economy faces and \nthe number of individuals who have lost or will lose their jobs as a \nresult of the terrorist attacks on September 11. Specifically, this \nbill will help unemployed individuals keep their health insurance \ncoverage by subsidizing their COBRA premiums through an individual tax \ncredit.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, it is estimated that \n4.7 million Americans are enrolled in\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nCOBRA health plans at any given moment. With average annual COBRA \ninsurance costing over $6,000, many individuals opt not to participate \nand therefore join the ranks of the 39 million uninsured in this \ncountry. A recent survey indicated that less than 20 percent of those \neligible for COBRA insurance actually took advantage of the insurance. \nWithout a premium subsidy such as the one offered in this bill, COBRA \ninsurance is cost-prohibitive. The goal of this legislation is to \ndecrease the number of uninsured individuals by providing an incentive \nto use COBRA insurance. This legislation will hopefully increase the \nnumber of COBRA users to at least six million.\n  While I am deeply saddened by the events that led to the introduction \nof this bill, I am heartened that we are able to provide a way for \nindividuals to retain their health insurance.\n  I commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue, and am \nhopeful that it will get signed into law in the near future to assist \nour nation's displaced workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKFELLER (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, Mr. Craig, \n        and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1503. A bill to extend and amend the Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies Program under subpart 2 of part B of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act, to provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nwith new authority to support programs mentoring children of \nincarcerated parents to amend the Foster Care Independent Living \nProgram under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide \nfor educational and training vouchers for youths aging out of foster \ncare, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators \nDeWine Landrieu, Snowe, Breaux, Bond, and Levin to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation which includes President Bush's initiative to reauthorize \nand increase funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \nProgram. The President's initiative increases funding to help abused \nand neglected children by $200 million. He knows this group of \nvulnerable children deserves our attention, even in this most \nchallenging of times in American history. These children face their own \nform of terror in their own homes, at the hands of their own parents. \nIt is a horrible circumstance that we know something about how to \naddress--and address it we must.\n  Our legislation also includes the President's initiative to start a \nnew program to provide mentoring services to the more than 2 million \nchildren whose parents are in prison. These children are at high-risk \nand they too, deserve our support.\n  This bill includes the President's initiative to provide $5,000 in \neducation vouchers to teens who age out of foster care so they have \nincentives to continue their education. This final program suggested by \nPresident Bush means a great deal to me because in 1999, I worked \nclosely with the late Senator John Chafee to develop a new program to \nhelp teenagers from the foster care system. Senator Chafee passed away \nthat fall, but I was proud to work with a bipartisan group to enact the \nfoster care legislation that meant so much to him. It is one important \npiece of Senator John Chafee's remarkable legacy of leadership for \nchildren and families.\n  Senator DeWine and I added a small, but important provision to help \nadoption agencies, like Catholic Charities and others, finding \npermanent homes for children with special needs. On January 23, 2001, \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a new policy \nannouncement which changed current practice for children with special \nneeds. We need a legislative clarification to ensure that children with \nspecial needs who are voluntarily relinquished to private, non-profit \nadoption agencies can still receive the adoption assistance they need \nand deserve.\n  In the Senate, there is a long, strong tradition of bipartisanship on \nchild welfare issues. Over recent years we have made real progress. In \n1993, working with Senator Bond and others we created a new program to \ninvest in prevention and treatment. In 1997, another bipartisan group \nworked long and hard on the Adoption and Safe Families Act. This act \nsignificantly revised child welfare policy. It said for the first time \nin Federal law that a child's safety and health are paramount, and \nevery child deserve a safe, permanent home. In this act, thanks to the \nleadership of Senator DeWine we clarified ``reasonable efforts'' to \nfocus more concern and attention on the needs of the child.\n  The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Act was part of that historic \nagreement, and it must be reauthorized this year or we will lose the \nfunding that exists in the budget baseline, and, more importantly, \nchildren and families will lose needed services and support. The Safe \nand Stable Families Program provides a range of services including \npromoting adoptions and post-adoption support, family support to avoid \nplacements and neglect, family preservation, and time-limited \nreunification for children who return home from foster care. Each is a \nnecessary piece. This program is one of the major funding resources for \nadoption.\n  Almost daily and far too often we read tragic stories about abuse and \nneglect in our newspapers. Such reports are disturbing and \ndisheartening. But the untold story is the progress that is being made \nthanks to new policy and new investments which is why I believe so \nstrongly that we must continue those investments and progress by \nenacting the President's initiative.\n  In 1996, 28,000 children were adopted from the foster care system. In \n2000, nearly 50,000 were adopted from foster care.\n  I am proud to report that my State of West Virginia is one of many \nStates that is increasing the number of adoptions. But almost 100,000 \nchildren nationwide are still waiting for adoption which is why the \nincrease in Safe and Stable Families is crucial. With the $200 million \nincrease included in our legislation, we will make the commitment to \ninvest a minimum of $100 million in adoption promotion and the adoption \nsupport.\n  Victimization rates are slowly declining. In 1993, the children \nvictimization rate was 15.3 per 1,000 children. In 1999, the child \nvictimization rate was 11.8 per 1,000 children. The 1999 rate is the \nlowest rate since we started collecting this data in 1990.\n  In some States within a year or two, there will be more children \nreceiving adoption assistance and subsidized guardianship payments than \nin the foster care system, and that is a major shift and historic \nprogress towards the fundamental goal of permanency for vulnerable \nchildren.\n  These are encouraging trends, but there are still 581,000l children \nin foster care and about one million substantiated cases of abuse or \nneglect each year. We are making progress, but we should and must do \nmore for the most vulnerable children in our country.\n  Since September 11, 2001, our world has changed. We face new \nchallenges for recovery, national security and combating terrorism. We \nmust focus on this immediate threat, but we also must remember those \nvulnerable children who are at risk of abuse and neglect in their own \nhomes. The Senate has a long tradition of working hard, and doing the \nright thing, usually as one of the last orders of business to help such \nchildren. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting President \nBush's initiative. Delivering on this promise truly will help ensure \nthat no children is left behind as the President eloquently insisted in \nhis campaign and in his State of the Union address.\n  Remembering our commitment to vulnerable children is one clear way to \nemphasize how our country is unique and strong. In the midst of \nchallenge and terror, we should remember our youngest victims, too. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

GRANTS FOR PROGRAMS FOR MENTORING CHILDREN OF \n                   INCARCERATED PARENTS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       ``(1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the number of \n     children with a parent incarcerated in a Federal or State \n     correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, \n     from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. In \n     1999, 2.1 percent of all children in the United States had a \n     parent in a Federal or State correctional facility.\n       ``(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female \n     prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State \n     facilities lived with their children.\n       ``(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of incarcerated \n     fathers live with their mothers, and 79 percent of the \n     children of incarcerated mothers live with a grandparent or \n     other relative. Only 10 percent of incarcerated mothers and 2 \n     percent of incarcerated fathers in State facilities report \n     that their child or children are in foster care.\n       ``(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to stress, \n     trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems for children. \n     These problems are coupled with existing problems that \n     include poverty, violence, parental substance abuse, high-\n     crime environments, intrafamilial abuse, child abuse and \n     neglect, multiple care givers, or prior separations. As a \n     result, children of an incarcerated parent often exhibit a \n     broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and \n     educational problems that are often compounded by the pain of \n     separation.\n       ``(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring is a \n     potent force for improving children's behavior across all \n     risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, one-on-one \n     relationships that provide young people with caring role \n     models for future success have profound, life-changing \n     potential. Done right, mentoring markedly advances youths' \n     life prospects. A widely cited 1995 study by Public/Private \n     Ventures measured the impact of one Big Brothers Big Sisters \n     program and found significant effects in the lives of youth--\n     cutting first-time drug use by almost half and first-time \n     alcohol use by about a third, reducing school absenteeism by \n     half, cutting assaultive behavior by a third, improving \n     parental and peer relationships, giving youth greater \n     confidence in their school work, and improving academic \n     performance.\n       ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to authorize \n     the Secretary to make competitive grants to local governments \n     in areas with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated \n     parents to support the establishment or expansion and \n     operation of programs using a network of public and private \n     community entities to provide mentoring services for children \n     of incarcerated parents.\n       ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Children of incarcerated parents.--The term `children \n     of incarcerated parents' means a child, 1 or both of whose \n     parents are incarcerated in a Federal or State correctional \n     facility. Such term shall be deemed to include any child who \n     is in an ongoing mentoring relationship in a program under \n     this section at the time of the release of the child's parent \n     or parents from a correctional facility, for purposes of \n     continued participation in the program.\n       ``(2) Mentoring.--The term `mentoring' means a structured, \n     managed program in which children are appropriately matched \n     with screened and trained adult volunteers for one-on-one \n     relationships, involving meetings and activities on a regular \n     basis, intended to meet, in part, the child's need for \n     involvement with a caring and supportive adult who provides a \n     positive role model.\n       ``(3) Mentoring services.--The term `mentoring services' \n     means those services and activities that support a \n     structured, managed program of mentoring, including the \n     management by trained personnel of outreach to, and screening \n     of, eligible children; outreach to, education and training \n     of, and liaison with sponsoring local organizations; \n     screening and training of adult volunteers; matching of \n     children with suitable adult volunteer mentors;

Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Rockefeller, to introduce the ``Promoting Safe and Stable \nFamilies'' bill. This legislation reauthorizes four programs designed \nto help child welfare agencies establish and maintain permanency by \nproviding grants to States and Indian tribes. The bill also includes \nprograms that the President has proposed, which have my utmost support, \nas well as a technical correction that Senator Rockefeller and I have \nproposed to ensure that special needs children continue to be eligible \nfor adoption assistance.\n  It would be impossible for me to talk about the challenges facing \nchildren and the agencies dedicated to protecting them, without saying \na few brief words about the recent terrorist bombings in New York and \nWashington. Following those tragic events, we awoke to a whole new \nworld, a world forever changed by a faceless, cowardly band of \nterrorists, a world filled with sorrow at the senseless, needless \ninjury and loss of countless members of our American family.\n  Though it is going to take time to eradicate the terrorist enemy, I \nam confident that our efforts will bring about peace and security both \nhere at home and across that globe. Ultimately, our efforts to protect \nthe Nation is about the future of our children and grandchildren. And \nso, we must do all we can to protect them and give them a world that is \nsafe and secure.\n  In creating that kind of a world, we have to realize that there are \nthousands of children in this Nation right now who don't live in safe \nand secure environments, children who have only one parent or no \nparents at all, as sadly is now the case for many of the children who \nlost parents in the terrorist attacks.\n  Far too many children in our country are at risk, not because of the \nterrorist threat, but because they are neglected or abused by parents \nor because they are trapped in the legal limbo that is our child \nwelfare system. Because of this, we have an obligation to these \nchildren. We have an obligation to protect these innocent lives.\n  With the bill we are introducing today, we are taking a big step \ntoward meeting that obligation. By reauthorizing and improving the Safe \nand Stable Families program, we can help strengthen families and ensure \nthe safety of vulnerable children. The funding provided to the States \nthrough this legislation is used for four categories of services: \nfamily preservation, community-based family support, time-limited \nfamily reunification, and adoption promotion and support. These \nservices are designed to prevent child abuse and neglect in communities \nat risk, avoid the removal of children from their homes, and support \ntimely reunification or adoption.\n  Our bill reauthorizes the only program that provides funding for \npost-adoption services. With a 30-percent increase in the number of \nadoptions since the implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct, funding for adoption promotion and support services is especially \nvital. These services are necessary to ensure that adoptions are not \ndisrupted, which risks further traumatizing a child.\n  Our bill also amends the Foster Care Independent Living Program to \nextend the eligibility age from 21 to 23, so that children aging out of \nfoster care can qualify for educational and training vouchers. \nCurrently, too many of the 16,000 children youth who age out of foster \ncare are not able to pursue educational or vocational training because \nthey just don't have the money. This provision helps these young people \nget the education and career training they need and deserve.\n  The bill doubles the funding for the Court Improvement Program, CIP, \nand reauthorizes it through 2006. The CIP program provides grants to \nthe States to develop a system of more timely court actions that \nprovides for the safety of children in foster care and expedites the \nplacement of such children in appropriate permanent settings. This \nmoney helps ensure that state courts have the resources necessary to \nstay in compliance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act. In my own \nhome State of Ohio, this money has been used to develop and implement \nan attorney certification program in family law. Additionally, the CIP \nmoney has been used to implement the Court Appointed Special Advocate, \nCASA, program throughout Ohio and to implement five pilot programs that \nuniquely address family law issues.\n\n  Also, Senator Rockefeller and I have added a technical correction to \nthe bill that would clarify how Adoption Assistance Payments are \ndistributed. Prior to January 23, 2001, title IV-E Adoption Assistance \nPayments were available to parents adopting children who met three \nspecial needs criteria, regardless of whether a child was placed by a \nprivate agency or the State foster care system. Unfortunately, some \nprivate agencies were using only one of the three special needs \ncriteria to access payments for these adoptive families.\n  The January 23rd Adoption Assistance decision draws a distinction \nbetween private and State foster care systems to prevent the misuse of \nfunds. However, the decision has had the unintended consequence of \nadversely affecting agencies like Catholic Charities and their ability \nto provide adoptive families with payments. Our correction focuses on \nthe children, not the placement agency, by making special needs \nchildren adopted through voluntary relinquishment eligible for adoption \nassistance payments.\n  I am particularly pleased with some of the President's new \ninitiatives authorized in our bill. For example, the President has \nproposed that the Department of Health and Human Services be authorized \nto provide competitive grants to support mentoring programs for \nchildren of incarcerated parents. With more than 2 million children \nwith incarcerated parents, this program would provide valuable outreach \nto this vulnerable group of children.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by drawing my colleagues' \nattention to a recent Washington Post series on the dire state of the \nDistrict of Columbia's child welfare system. This series outlines \nmultiple mistakes made by the Government by placing children in unsafe \nhomes or institutions. Unfortunately, these same mistakes occur in the \nchild welfare system throughout our country. Here in Washington, these \nmistakes resulted in over 180 deaths of children in foster care since \n1993, 40 of whom died as a direct result of government workers' failure \nto take key preventative actions or because they placed children in \nunsafe homes or institutions.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help make sure that these \nkinds of mistakes are never repeated. The Senate has a tradition of \nhelping our most vulnerable children, and so I urge my\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\ncolleagues to join us in supporting the Reauthorization of Promoting \nSafe and Stable Families. It is the right thing to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1504. A bill to extend the moratorium enacted by the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act through June 30, 2002; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to introduce legislation today \non behalf of myself, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, and Senator \nHutchison from Texas dealing with the extension of the moratorium on \nInternet taxation. Let me describe what that is and what it means.\n  We already have in law a provision that provides a moratorium on the \ntaxation of the Internet as it is called, but it really provides a \nmoratorium on a State government's or a local government's ability to \nprovide a tax on the access to the Internet. There is a moratorium. \nThat moratorium expires on October 21. Except those few that are \ngrandfathered, the moratorium bill not only prohibits State and local \ngovernments, from imposing a tax on access to the Internet, it also \nprohibits punitive or discriminatory taxes with respect to the \nInternet.\n  The Congress passed that legislation a couple of years ago. It was \ndesigned to expire October 21 of this year. In a few days, it will \nexpire, and there are colleagues of mine who have offered in recent \ndays extensions of the moratorium. Some are talking 5 years; some are \ntalking 2 years. I think both of those are far too long. I propose we \nextend the moratorium until June 30 of next year.\n  There is another issue that relates to this, which is why I believe \nthere needs to be an extension. We need to solve the problem of tax \ncollections with respect to Internet transactions and all transactions \nof remote sales. When you use a computer, or a catalog for that matter, \nto buy a product, when you receive that product, in most cases you are \nsupposed to pay a sales or a consumption tax to your local government \nor your State government.\n  In point of fact, most people never pay that tax. So the State and \nlocal governments lose that revenue. The seller, a catalog company or \nan Internet company that is doing business in most of the States, is \nnot required to collect that sales tax so the seller does not collect \nit. The person who receives it or orders it and then receives the goods \ndoes not pay it, even though they are required to, and the State and \nlocal governments lose a substantial amount of money.\n  A recent study from the Institute for State Studies says this year \nthe loss will be $13.3 billion for State and local governments, and by \nthe year 2011 it is expected State and local governments will lose \n$54.8 billion of expected revenue. Most of this, incidentally, is \nrevenue that is essential to school systems around the country. Most of \nthis is essential for State and local governments to keep their school \nsystems operating and pay for their schools and education programs.\n  So State and local governments have a very serious problem. What do \nthey do about it? Internet sellers and catalog sellers also have a \nproblem. If one is set up in business to sell all across the country, \nbut they really have only one location and that is the area where they \nare set up in business, they do not want to have to subscribe to 5,000 \nor 7,000 different sales tax jurisdictions. That is far too \ncomplicated. The remote sellers have a right to say: We don't want to \nhave to subscribe and pay taxes and file forms in thousands and \nthousands of different jurisdictions. They are right about that.\n\n  What is to be done? It seems to me there is a requirement for State \nand local governments to simplify their sales tax systems, and when \nthey have dramatically simplified those systems so that companies that \nare doing business all across the country can easily comply with the \nrequirements--when that happens, when State and local government do \nthat--I believe those engaged in remote sales should collect the tax \nand remit it to State and local governments. It will be easy for the \nconsumer to have that happen. The tax is already owed. It seems to me \nit will be convenient enough for the seller to do it if the States have \ndramatically simplified their system. And it will finally provide the \nresources the States and local governments have been counting on to \nsupport their school systems. All of that ought to be done.\n  As far as I am concerned, I don't mind extending this moratorium \nforever--6 months, 2 years, 5 years. It doesn't matter to me. We should \nnot apply discriminatory taxes. We should not apply punitive taxes to \nInternet transactions. I don't care much about the question of taxing \naccess. As far as I'm concerned, we can prevent all State and local \ngovernments from doing that. It does not matter much to me. Speaking \nfor myself, we could make permanent the moratorium. But it should be \nmade permanent or should be made a long-term extension only when we \nagree, all of us, that we have another problem attendant to it: the \nproblem of the collection and remission of taxes that support our \nschool system.\n  Let's do both. We have some in the Chamber who say, let's ignore the \nissue of school finance; say that doesn't exist. You cannot do that. \nYou cannot cast a blind eye to that problem. It is a problem that is \nserious and growing. Governor Leavitt from Utah sent me a note about it \nalong with the study of the Institute for States Studies describing \nthis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Institute for State Studies,\n\n                                 Salt Lake City, UT, Oct. 2, 2001.\n\n  New Study Shows Sales Tax Revenue Losses From E-Commerce 41 Percent \n                     Higher Than Previous Estimates\n\n\n   States, localities projected to lose $54.8 billion a year by 2011\n\n       Washington.--New figures released here today show that \n     state and local governments will lose $13.3 billion in \n     revenue this year--41 percent higher than previously \n     estimated--because taxes are not paid on remote online \n     purchases as they are on ``Main Street'' purchases. Projected \n     annual revenue losses jump to $45.2 billion in 2006 and a \n     staggering $54.8 billion by 2011 as a result of skyrocketing \n     business-to-business e-commerce activity.\n       This continued loss of revenue highlights fairness issues \n     for Main Street retailers, taxpayers and state and local \n     governments. It creates difficult choices for the 45 states \n     and the District of Columbia that rely on sales tax revenue; \n     raise sales, income and/or property tax rates to compensate; \n     cut services like education and public safety; or a \n     combination of both.\n       The study was prepared by the Center for Business and \n     Research at the University of Tennessee, the pioneers in \n     research on the subject. Data was collected by Forrester \n     Research, Inc., the recognized leader in e-commerce research. \n     The study was commissioned by the Institute for State \n     Studies, a nonprofit public policy group. The study \n     quantifies the amount of sales tax revenue states and local \n     governments stand to lose in 2001, 2006 and 2011 because \n     remote Internet-based retailers are not required to collect \n     and remit sales tax. The U.S. Congress is currently debating \n     how to address this inequity. The report is available online \n     at www.statestudies.org.\n       A broad coalition of retailers, shopping center owners, \n     state and local government leaders and national associations \n     has for some time maintained that current tax policy as it \n     applies to e-commerce isn't fair. They argue that the lack of \n     a ``level playing field'' in collecting sales taxes leads to \n     significant fairness issues for consumers and businesses. It \n     also creates huge revenue losses for states and local \n     governments, affecting their ability to provide citizens with \n     quality education, effective public safety and other basic \n     services. This research supports those assertions.\n       For example, Texas will lose $1.2 billion to e-commerce \n     sales tax erosion this year. In Florida, the number is $932.2 \n     million. Illinois will lose out on $532.9 million, Michigan \n     will lose $502.9, Tennessee will lose $362.3 million, \n     Maryland, $194.4 million. In the smallest states, the revenue \n     erosion is large as well. Wyoming will lose $26.1 million; \n     Rhode Island, $36.8 million; North Dakota, $26.4 million; and \n     the District of Columbia, $36.7 million.\n       In a decade, the revenue losses grow tremendously, \n     according to Donald Bruce, assistant professor at the \n     University of Tennessee and the study's co-author. ``By 2011, \n     the potential revenue loss in Texas alone will be $4.8 \n     billion--that's almost 10 percent of the state's total \n     expected tax collections. To make up for this revenue, \n     Texas's current statewide sales tax rate of 6.25 percent \n     would have to rise to 7.86 percent.''\n       Historically, states and localities have responded to this \n     erosion in sales tax revenue by raising tax rates, Bruce \n     pointed out. In 1970, the median sales tax rate in the U.S. \n     was 3.25 percent. This rose to 4.0 percent in 1980 and 5.0 \n     percent in 1990. Fifteen states now have rates at or above \n     6.0 percent.\n       ``We determined that, to make up for revenue losses due to \n     e-commerce, states and local governments would have to raise \n     their\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n     sales tax rates between 0.83 and 1.73 percentage points by \n     2011,'' said William F. Fox, study co-author and University \n     of Tennessee professor. ``When other factors causing sales \n     tax revenue to shrink are added in, the projected tax \n     increases are even higher.''\n       In addition to erosion from remote sales, states and local \n     governments are facing a loss of sales tax revenue from two \n     other major trends: 1) a greater consumption of generally \n     non-taxable services rather than taxable goods; and 2) a \n     continual practice of state-legislated exemptions that are \n     narrowing the tax base.\n       Steps are being taken to simplify the sales tax system, \n     such as streamlining the rules and regulations of the 7,500 \n     taxing jurisdictions in the U.S. This Streamlined Sales Tax \n     Project is sponsored by a consortium of government \n     associations led by the National Governors Association. So \n     far, 32 states are participating in the effort to simplify \n     tax rates and definitions of taxable goods, and to certify \n     software that will make it easier for retailers, both on Main \n     Street and on the Internet, to collect sales taxes.

Mr. President, virtually every Governor, or 45 Governors \nin this country believe strongly we ought to do this, give the States \nthe ability to develop a compact to dramatically simplify their revenue \nsystems. Then, with that compact, we would allow or require the remote \nsellers to collect the taxes owed.\n  I am introducing the legislation on behalf of myself, Senator Breaux, \nand Senator Hutchison, that would extend until June 30 the moratorium \nthat now exists. Between now and June 30 I believe Congress has a \nresponsibility to solve this problem. I don't want there to be and will \nnot support punitive or discriminatory taxes on the Internet. I don't \nbelieve we ought to be taxing access to the Internet, and it would not \nmatter to me if we shut it off even for the grandfathered States. The \nissue of extending the moratorium is not a problem with me.\n  But we must not extend the moratorium and ignore the other \nsignificant problem that exists; and that is, the erosion of billions \nand billions of dollars that are expected to come in to our State and \nlocal government coffers to support our schools. That erosion, to the \ntune of what is expected to be $54 billion in the year 2011 is a very \nserious problem and serves no purpose for people to talk only of \nextending the moratorium and not about the other problem. Let's solve \nboth problems at once on behalf of America's kids and on behalf of \nremote sellers.\n  I happen to think the growth of the Internet is a wonderful thing. I \nthink catalog sales are a wonderful thing. I think Main Street \nbusinesses are great. I think all the commerce opportunities that exist \nin this country enhance this country. The Main Street business people \nsay to us: We rent the business, we hire the employees, we carry the \ninventory, and if you come to our Main Street business and buy a \nproduct, we must collect the sales tax. But someone a thousand miles \naway who competes by catalog or television monitor can make the same \nsale and sell it without collecting the sales tax. It is true the buyer \nhas a tax responsibility, but the buyer almost never remits that small \nuse tax to the State when that sale is made.\n  Those are the issues. I call attention today to the fact that some \ncolleagues introduced a piece of legislation that calls for a \nmoratorium for 2 years, some are talking about 5 years. One was \nintroduced, I believe, by my colleague from Virginia and my colleague \nfrom California for a 5-year extension. Another was introduced for a 2-\nyear extension. I believe both are too long. I believe the extension \nuntil June 30 of next year, with a requirement we get to work, will \ngive the States and the Internet sellers and remote sellers the time \nthey need to get to work and solve this problem. Let's extend it \nforever as far as I am concerned, but we should fix the long-term \nproblem as we do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that State governments and \n     interested business organizations should expedite efforts to \n     develop a streamlined sales and use tax system that, once \n     approved by Congress, would allow sellers to collect and \n     remit sales and use taxes without imposing an undue burden on \n     interstate commerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 1505. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \nTravel and Tourism Promotion Bureau; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rediscover \nAmerica Act of 2001 along with my colleagues, Senator Allen, Senator \nInouye, and Senator Kerry. The Rediscover America Act is a bipartisan \neffort to help promote travel and tourism in the United States in the \nwake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America.\n  The bill directs the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to establish a Travel \nand Tourism Promotion Bureau. The Bureau would work with the private \nsector to develop a public service/advertising campaign to encourage \npeople to rediscover America. While the Bureau will work in the same \nspirit as the former Travel and Tourism Administration, it will not be \na large new bureaucracy. The bill is designed to give the Secretary the \nflexibility to appoint up to three existing Department of Commerce \nemployees to work on this 2-year project. At least $60 million of the \nfunds provided in the supplemental appropriations bill would be \navailable for this effort so that the campaign can begin quickly. We \nenvision celebrities and national leaders participating in ads that \nwill tout the beauty of the nation and encourage people here and abroad \nto Rediscover America.\n  We need the Rediscover America Act at this time for a number of \nreasons. The revitalization of the travel and\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\ntourism industry following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on \nthe United States is a national economic necessity. The travel and \ntourism industry has a large impact on the U.S. economy, adding nearly \n5 percent of the GDP, generating more than $578 million in revenues, \nsupporting more than 17 million jobs, and providing a $14 million trade \nsurplus for the country.\n  In California, the travel and tourism industry provides over 1.1 \nmillion jobs. Those jobs are now in danger. We estimate that the total \ndirect and indirect losses in the travel and tourism industry as a \nresult of declining consumer confidence could reach nearly 20,000. We \nneed to encourage people to travel in order to restore jobs for people \nin the industry.\n  In light of the effect that the attacks have had on the travel and \ntourism industry, it is important to put measures immediately into \nplace to encourage consumer confidence in travel and in the economy.\n  Safety and security in travel is of utmost importance in order to \nrestore consumer confidence in the industry. But we will have to get \nthe message out there that it is safe to travel again in order to get \npassengers back on planes.\n  While this marketing assistance can only constitute one facet of our \nresponse to the current crisis in the travel and tourism industry, we \nhope its impact will be widely felt. More than 95 percent of the \nbusinesses in travel and tourism are small to medium sized enterprises \nwho need help now. Again, this is only one step toward getting the \ntravel and tourism industry back on its feet. Its restoration is vital \nfor the future well being of our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 1506. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to repeal the \nrequirement for reduction of SBP survivor annuities by dependency and \nindemnity compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \ntoday to take care of a major problem we overlooked recently in passing \nthe defense authorization bill.\n  I take my inspiration from Holy Scripture where we are told that in \nGod's eyes, the measure of our faith is to look after orphans and \nwidows in their distress.\n  The fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill we just passed \ncorrected one long-standing inequity but not another longstanding \ninequity. What the Defense authorization bill did was correct an \ninequity by restoring benefits to our disabled military retirees \nbecause currently our system penalizes military retirees, who have \ngiven our country the best years of their lives, by reducing their \nretirement pay by the amount of disability pay they are entitled to \nreceive.\n  This simply is not fair. Senator Reid, our great Democratic floor \nleader, offered the amendment to the Defense authorization bill, and it \nwas accepted. It allows the disabled military retirees to receive both \ntheir disability pay and their retirement pay concurrently instead of \none offsetting the other. It makes it effective upon the Defense \nauthorization bill becoming law.\n  I supported it. All of us supported the Reid amendment. It is now \nincluded in the final version of the bill. That correction in law is \nlong overdue.\n  Now there is another related injustice which needs to be addressed. \nThe legislation I am offering will extend the same protection of \nbenefits to the widows and orphans of military retirees because the \nsame kind of rule that penalized disabled retirees, the offset of \ndisability pay to military retirement pay, also hurts the widows and \nthe surviving children.\n  Mr. President, go back to 1972 when Congress established the military \nsurvival benefits plan to provide retirees' survivors an annuity that \nwas specifically modeled after the civil service survival benefit plan. \nLike the civilian plan, the military survivors benefit plan is a \nvolunteer benefit program purchased by the retiree. Retired service \nmembers pay for this benefit from their retired pay. Then upon their \ndeath, their spouse or dependent children can receive up to 55 percent \nof their retired pay as an annuity.\n  Surviving spouses or dependent children of 100-percent service-\nconnected disabled retirees are also entitled to dependency and \nindemnity compensation from the Veterans' Administration. But the \nannuity paid by the survivors benefits plan and received by a widow or \nan orphan is reduced by the amount of the dependency and indemnity \ncompensation received from the VA--the same unfair offset that we are \nnow correcting for our military retirees.\n  So the penalty for widows or orphans is no more justifiable than for \nretirees. In fact, in the absence of their veteran spouse or parent, \nthe survivors' need for a stable income is often greater. They have \ndepended on the person who has received this disability pay because \nthat disabled person's income was lowered because of their disability, \nand often because the spouse or the children have to be caregivers to \nthe disabled person, their incomes likewise are reduced; thus the need \nfor this disability pay as set up in law sometime ago for the \nsurvivors' need.\n  Well, Mr. President, I know of no other surviving spouse annuity \nprogram in the Federal or private sector that is permitted to offset, \nterminate, or reduce their survivor payments because of disability \npayments. Naturally, I was disappointed in this year's Defense \nauthorization bill that we have left behind the widows or orphans of \n100-percent disabled retirees. I am not talking about 50-percent \ndisabled; I am talking about the widows or orphans of 100-percent \ndisabled retirees.\n  I believe we should have and could have addressed this issue when we \nfixed the offset problem for military retirees. But we didn't. So that \nis what we are trying to correct with the offering of this legislation.\n  We should honor our commitments with disabled military retirees and \ntheir surviving widows and dependent children. So today I am offering \nstand-alone legislation to eliminate that offset called the VA \ndependency and indemnity compensation offset against the annuity paid \nby the survivors benefit plan.\n  I will repeat what I said at the outset. In the first chapter of \nJames, verse 27 of the Holy Scriptures, we are told in God's eyes that \nthe true measure of our faith is to look after orphans and widows in \ntheir distress. So we simply can't allow this situation to stand. We \nneed to restore the full benefits to our country's military retirees \nand their families. I will continue to work to do right by those who \nhave given this Nation their all, and especially for the loved ones \nthey may leave to our care.\n  Thank you for the opportunity of addressing the Senate as I introduce \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the preparedness of the United States to \nrespond to a biological or chemical weapons attack; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Biological \nand Chemical Attack Preparedness Act, legislation that would help \nprepare our public health infrastructure for the possibility of a \nfuture biological or chemical attack.\n  The attacks of September 11 have focused attention on the threat \nposed to our entire Nation by terrorists, especially the threat of \nbiological and chemical attacks. My office has received numerous \nletters and phone\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\ncalls from constituents alarmed by recent news reports that the Federal \nAviation Administration grounded crop dusters. Some speculate that the \nsmall propeller planes might be used to deliver chemical or biological \nweapons over a broad area, threatening the health and well being of the \npeople below. The implications of such an attack are enormous. One \nanalysis from the Centers for Disease Control predicted that a few \nkilograms of anthrax delivered over a major metropolitan area would \nkill more people than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n  While the US is fortunate to have avoided a biological or chemical \nattack thus far, the threat of such an attack is very real. In 1995, it \nwas hard to imagine that Japan would be targeted for such an attack. \nBut that year, an apocalyptic cult did just that in a Tokyo subway \nstation. The highly sophisticated cult counted scientists among its \nadherents and developed a deadly chemical weapon: sarin gas. They \nemployed a crude form of delivery, filling soda cans and lunch boxes \nwith sarin gas and puncturing the improvised containers as they left a \nrail car.\n  While technical expertise and considerable resources are required, it \nis clear that a motivated terrorist group can unleash a chemical or \nbiological weapon on a complacent population. The possibility of such \nan attack seems even greater when one realize that many of the \ncountries considered to be active state sponsors of terrorism by the \nState Department are also believed to be developing chemical and \nbiological weapons.\n  The events of September 11 have brought our country's vulnerability \nto an attack with chemical and biological weapons into even greater \nfocus. However, the challenge of maintaining the functionality of key \ninfrastructure in the event of a chemical or biological emergency has \nbeen a concern for some time. The well-regarded Hart-Rudman report \ncalls for careful preparation and explains that in a biological attack, \n``citizen cooperation with government authorities will depend on public \nconfidence that those authorities can manage the emergency.'' A recent \nNewsweek poll found that 46 percent of respondents were not convinced \nthat national and local governments are prepared to handle an attack \nwith biological or chemical weapons.\n  Unfortunately, Americans have reason to be skeptical about the extent \nor which our public health system is prepared for a chemical or \nbiological attack. The overwhelming consensus among public health \nofficials is that our health care infrastructure today is not equipped \nto address a mass casualty incident involving chemical and biological \nweapons.\n  The attack in Japan in 1995 was the first time in history when \nchemical weapons were turned on a civilian population. As such, it is a \nvaluable and instructive case study. The attack itself killed eleven \nJapanese civilians and injured several hundred, a tragedy by any \nmeasure, but with a limited death count. The incident has broader \nsignificance for what it shows about the failure of an advanced public \nhealth system to respond to a biological or chemical weapon emergency. \nSpecifically, the attack highlighted unfortunate weaknesses in Japan's \nability to coordinate a comprehensive public health response.\n  To put it mildly, the subway attack caught Japan's public health \nsystem off guard. St. Luke's International Hospital received most \nvictims of the attack, treating over six hundred Japanese patients. \nAlthough even before the attack the hospital maintained a high level of \nemergency preparedness and conducted periodic emergency drills, it was \nnot ready for the tremendous surge of acutely ill patients that \noverwhelmed the emergency room. The hospital was not prepared to treat \nvictims manifesting the symptoms characteristics of sarin gas \npoisoning. It was not prepared to guarantee the health and safety of \nthe healthcare workers employed there. And, although terribly \noverburdened with patients being treated in the chapel and cafeteria, \nit was unable to release patients to other hospitals, knowing that \nother hospitals were even less prepared to deal with the unique \nchallenges posed by victims of chemical weapons. Because of the use of \nchemical weapons, standards already established for mass casualty \nincidents were found to be inadequate, and the staff was forced to \nimprovise. According to a study conducted by the hospital, more than \ntwenty-percent of the health professionals assisting the victims \ndeveloped sarin gas poisoning themselves.\n  Healthcare workers helping the sick were put into harm's way. Had the \nchemical or biological agent been more severe or had the health \nprofessionals received a greater dose, the implications of Japan's lack \nof preparation could have been even more serious.\n  The United States must learn from the nightmare experienced by Japan \nand shore up our public health infrastructure before it is too late.\n  Unfortunately, despite several programs that have moved us in the \nright direction, including the historic Frist-Kennedy emerging threats \nlegislation passed in the last Congress that I hope will receive the \nfunding it deserves, the United States' public health system is not \nmuch more prepared than Japan's in 1995.\n  A study appearing in the May 2001 issue of the respected American \nJournal of Public Health reveals a troubling situation. Of the \nhospitals that responded to a survey, fewer than 20 percent had any \nplans for biological or chemical weapons incidents. That means only \none-fifth of hospitals nationwide had even considered the implications \nof a chemical or biological attack on delivery of care. And only 6 \npercent had the minimum recommended physical resources for a \nhypothetical sarin incident. It is clear, that the U.S. is not \nprepared.\n  The study outlines that the ``Domestic Preparedness Program . . . has \nincluded no systemic efforts to integrate hospitals into response \nplans, and it has provided only limited funds to acquire resources for \nstate and local responders and none for hospitals.'' It is time to \nensure that our public health system is up to the challenges of the new \nthreat environment, including the possibility that chemical weapons or \nbiological agents will be released on the United States.\n  A report published by the American Hospital Association in \nconjunction with the Office of Emergency Preparedness, found that the \nfundamental problem is, and I quote, ``there is no general societal \nsupport for the preparedness role of the hospital.'' Up until this \npoint, there was no requirement for individual hospitals or departments \nof health to plan for the possibility of a chemical or biological \nattack. Nor was there any funding to help them in this important \nprocess. In our previous approach to bioterrorism, we have focused on \nstockpiling medical supplies and creating additional laboratory \ncapacity, but we have ignored the emergency preparedness of our \nhospitals.\n  The Biological and Chemical Attack Preparedness Act seeks to overcome \nthis failing of our public health system in several important ways. \nFirst, it would require States to develop public health disaster plans \nin consultation with local governments. It is vital that the various \nstate governments rapidly devise and implement plans based on their own \nspecific needs and strengths. The public health disaster plan developed \nby Nebraska will be very different from the one developed by New \nJersey, and for good reason. The public health challenges posed by a \nrural population are different than those posed by a suburban or urban \npopulation. State plans must take into account the distribution and the \npre-existing capabilities of hospitals in their states. They must \naddress issues surrounding proximity to care and the financial costs of \nimplementing a system. Simply put, they must devise a mechanism for \nproviding care to all affected state residents in the event of an \nattack.\n  This being said, as with national security issues generally, there is \nan important federal role. It is the job of the Department of Health \nand Human Services to establish broad guidelines and oversee the \nimplementation of the various plans. Just as we need coordination \nbetween States, localities, and hospitals, we need coordination with \nthe national health system. To ensure that states comply, Medical \nfunding would be withheld for any state that failed to meet the broad \nrequirements of the legislation.\n  Second, as part of the public health disaster plan, States would be \nrequired to designate hospitals so that all state residents affected by \na chemical or biological weapons disaster would have access to \ntreatment. Each designated\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nhospital would be required to devise and implement a chemical and \nbiological weapons response that complies with their responsibilities \nas a component of the State's overall response. Right now, with only 6 \npercent of hospitals providing a high level of chemical and biological \nweapons attack readiness, we are far from the goal of ensuring that any \nperson affected by chemical or biological weapons can receive \ntreatment. Hospitals designated as part of the plan must be prepared \nwith equipment, trained personnel, and pharmaceutical products \nsufficient to meet the anticipated need in the event of chemical or \nbiological attack.\n  I know we are asking a lot of our States and of our hospitals. \nCertainly, the additional precautions taken to prepare for an \nunconventional attack will be expensive. To address this real concern, \nthe bill would create a new grant program administered by the Office of \nEmergency Preparedness of HHS to fund the implementation of biological \nand chemical attack preparedness strategies by health care providers. \nHospitals could use the funds to purchase Class-A suits to protect \nhealthcare professionals, filtration equipment to clean the air, shower \nunits to remove chemical agents, antibiotics and vaccines to treat \npatients, and, perhaps most importantly, training for the staff to \nrecognize the warning signs of an attack. And, because we are asking \nfor additional preparation on the part of designated hospitals, they \nwill receive preferential treatment in the grant program. Not \nincidentally, local governments would be eligible for the grants as \nwell, providing a level of local control and oversight that is a vital \ncomponent of a truly coordinated response.\n  The Biological and Chemical Attack Preparedness Act would help ensure \nthat our national public health system is prepared to orchestrate a \nskillful, quick and coordinated response to an attack with chemical or \nbiological weapons. The bill would provide the resources necessary to \nassist hospitals and local governments in getting up to speed. And it \nwould ensure that the various jurisdictions in our public health system \nare working together towards a single compelling goal: preparing for \nthe devastating implications of a chemical or biological weapons \nattack. It would be far better to spend the money now than suffer the \ngrim consequences later.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators \nCorzine and Torricelli of New Jersey in introducing this timely and \nimportant legislation. The Biological and Chemical Attack Preparedness \nAct seeks to address a critical need that currently exists in our \nhealth care emergency preparedness network.\n  Since the devastating attacks of September 11, it has become apparent \nthat we as a Nation face many threats for which we must be prepared. \nOver the past decade, the Federal Government has made significant \ninvestments in research, planning and implementation of procedures \ndesigned to deal with a variety of terrorist attacks, including \nstrengthening our public health system so that it may respond \neffectively to a potential biological or chemical terrorist event. In \nthat time, we have made great progress in solidifying our level of \npreparedness for these kinds of insidious events. Nevertheless, the \nevents of last month have also made us keenly aware of our \nvulnerabilities, particularly when it comes to State and local health \nsystems, where our ability to resond to a major catastrophic event is \nnot what it should be.\n  Specifically, while the 1996 Defense Against Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Act required the development of a Domestic Preparedness \nProgram, including efforts to improve capacity of local emergency \nresponse agencies, only limited funds were provided to state and local \nresponders and none for hospitals. For those hospitals that have \ndevised\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nplans, the challenge is often finding the resources to acquire the \nappropriate equipment and training necessary to respond to a chemical \nor biological event.\n  The Biological and Chemical Attack Preparedness Act we are \nintroducing today would address this urgent problem by requiring all \nStates to think strategically about their health systems and how they \nmight be called to respond to a biological or chemical attack. Each \nState would submit to the Department of Health and Human Services for \nreview and approval a disaster preparedness plan that would designate \ncertain hospitals and providers to respond to a terrorist attack. These \nfacilities would devise and implement chemical and biological weapons \nresponse plans that conform to their responsibilities as a component of \nthe State's overall disaster response. To help defray these additional \ncosts, the bill authorizes a new grant program administered by HHS' \nOffice of Emergency Preparedness to fund the implementation of \nbiological and chemical attack preparedness strategies.\n  This legislation compliments ongoing efforts to enhance our public \nhealth capability to minimize casualties should a biological or \nchemical attack occur within our borders. Indeed, it is absolutely \nessential that every link in the health system chain, from the \nindividual provider to our Federal health agencies, has the tools it \nneeds to carry out the tasks for which it is responsible in this new \nworld.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to join them today in this \nimportant endeavor and urge the Senate to take quick action to adopt \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1509. A bill to establish a grant program to enable rural police \ndepartments to gain access to the various crime-fighting, \ninvestigatory, and information-sharing resources available on the \nInternet, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the \nNetworking Electronically To Connect Our Police Act of 2001, or the NET \nCOP Act, which will help police departments in rural communities \nthroughout the United States take advantage of the many crime-fighting \nand information-sharing resources available through the Internet.\n  In the first decade of widespread use of the Internet, people \neverywhere have become accustomed to ready availability of a tremendous \nvolume of useful information available to anyone with a computer and \naccess to the Web. Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies \nin this country have made extremely good use of this capability to \nshare intelligence, to widen their investigatory nets, to find lost or \nabducted children, to locate deadbeat parents, to tap into centralized \ncriminal databases, and to track and apprehend criminals with a speed \nthey could not have dreamed of before using the Internet.\n  Unfortunately, as truly amazing as the law enforcement successes have \nbeen, the results could be better. Much as schools, libraries, local \ngovernments, and businesses in rural America have not always shared \nequally in the benefits of Internet access with their counterparts in \nurban and suburban areas, police departments serving some smaller \ncommunities have been unable to participate in this revolutionary \ncrime-fighting technology to the same degree enjoyed by big-city \ndepartments.\n  Of the many lessons this country learned so painfully because of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, perhaps the most painful is that \ninformation and intelligence that is not shared is information and \nintelligence wasted, often with tragic results. Crimes, including acts \nof terrorism, might be prevented if the right information finds its way \nto the appropriate law enforcement officials. We are also sensitized to \nthe fact that crime knows no boundaries. In the world today, criminal \nactivity is as great a concern for citizens and police officers in \nsmall towns as it is for those in large population centers. With our \nrenewed national dedication to supplying law enforcement agencies with \nthe tools they need to fight crime, we cannot doubt the necessity of \nensuring that police departments in rural communities, like their \ncolleagues in cities, have access to Internet-based crime-fighting and \ninformation-sharing resources.\n  The NET COP Act does just this. This bill sets up a grant program, \nadministered by the United States Department of Justice, to enable \nrural police departments without Internet access to purchase \nappropriate computer hardware and software, or to pay for Internet \naccess, so that they can join the many thousands of federal, State, and \nlocal agencies already sharing information and cooperating to track \ndown and arrest criminals via such Internet-based services as DOJ's \nRegional Information Sharing Systems, RISS, and the FBI's Law \nEnforcement On-Line, LEO, program. NET COP grants will be given \ndirectly to police chiefs, so that they can buy just what they need to \nhook into the growing network of web-based law enforcement tools. NET \nCOP grants will also be available for computer upgrades, if they are \ndetermined to be necessary.\n\n  Some rural police department officials and officers have been able to \nafford computer equipment, or to have their departments wired for the \nInternet, and have paid for out of their own pockets. So, NET COP \ngrants will also be made available for reimbursement to those police \nofficers and officials who have taken it upon themselves to provide \ntheir departments with these essential tools. Criteria for this \nreimbursement will be set by the Attorney General.\n  Additionally, this bill will require the Attorney General to set up a \nPolice Department Technology Assistance Desk, to answer questions from \nlocal police chiefs about necessary technologies, and to assist police \nofficials and local governments in making appropriate purchases from \nreputable dealers.\n  Finally, to gauge how effective the NET COP grant program is, the \nbill requires the General Accounting Office to make an annual report to \nCongress comparing the concentration of the nation's ``wired'' police \ndepartments generally with the number of rural departments having \nInternet access.\n  I believe the NET COP Act will serve as an extremely important crime-\nfighting tool for rural America. As we endeavor to create a safer and \nmore secure United States, I recommend this legislation as a crucial \ncomponent of a comprehensive response to crime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 1510.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) money laundering, estimated by the International \n     Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global \n     gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 \n     annually, provides the financial fuel that permits \n     transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand \n     their operations to the detriment of the safety and security \n     of American citizens;\n       (2) money laundering, and the defects in financial \n     transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to \n     the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds \n     for terrorist attacks;\n       (3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial \n     mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as \n     protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and \n     the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can \n     threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine \n     the integrity of United States financial institutions and of \n     the global financial and trading systems upon which \n     prosperity and growth depend;\n       (4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that \n     offer ``offshore'' banking and related facilities designed to \n     provide anonymity, coupled with special tax advantages and \n     weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide \n     essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of \n     criminal funds, derived from, or used to commit, offenses \n     ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms \n     smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial \n     frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;\n       (5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make \n     it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to \n     follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized \n     international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist \n     organizations;\n       (6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking \n     mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation \n     by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding \n     the identity of real parties in interest to financial \n     transactions;\n       (7) private banking services can be susceptible to \n     manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign \n     government officials, particularly if those services include \n     the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large \n     personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts \n     around the globe;\n       (8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded \n     by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make \n     investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, \n     particularly in cases in which money laundering involves \n     foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;\n       (9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to \n     international money launderers requires national, as well as \n     bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially \n     designed for that effort; and\n       (10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and \n     Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on \n     Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a \n     member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering \n     principles and recommendations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to increase the strength of United States measures to \n     prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering \n     and the financing of terrorism;\n       (2) to ensure that--\n       (A) banking transactions and financial relationships and \n     the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not \n     contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of \n     title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Act, or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law \n     91-508 (84 Stat. 1116), or facilitate the evasion of any such \n     provision; and\n       (B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be \n     fulfilled, and that such provisions of law are effectively \n     and efficiently administered;\n       (3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the \n     Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note), \n     especially with respect to crimes by non-United States \n     nationals and foreign financial institutions;\n       (4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to \n     special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions that pose particular, \n     identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;\n       (5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Secretary'') with broad discretion, \n     subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative \n     Procedures Act under title 5, United States Code, to take \n     measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems \n     presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions operating outside of the United States, and \n     classes of international transactions;\n       (6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the \n     Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by \n     affected financial institutions;\n       (7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions \n     on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions \n     operating outside of the United States, and classes of \n     international transactions that are of primary money \n     laundering concern to the United States Government;\n       (8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in \n     connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United \n     States permits for adequate challenge consistent with \n     providing due process rights;\n       (9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil \n     liability for filing suspicious activity reports;\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n       (10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue \n     and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify \n     that violations of such orders or any other requirement \n     imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I \n     of Public Law 91-508 and subchapters II and III of chapter 53 \n     of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and \n     civil penalties;\n       (11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the \n     financial services industry are subject to appropriate \n     requirements to report potential money laundering \n     transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional \n     disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial \n     institutions with relevant reporting requirements;\n       (12) to fix responsibility for high level coordination of \n     the anti-money laundering efforts of the Department of the \n     Treasury;\n       (13) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to \n     maintain the integrity of their employee population; and\n       (14) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the \n     United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt \n     foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any \n     stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such \n     assets belong.\n\n     SEC. 303. 4-YEAR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW-EXPEDITED \n                   CONSIDERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective on and after the first day of \n     fiscal year 2005, the provisions of this title and the \n     amendments made by this title shall terminate if the Congress \n     enacts a joint resolution, the text after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That provisions of the \n     International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist \n     Financing Act of 2001, and the amendments made thereby, shall \n     no longer have the force of law.''.\n       (b) Expedited Consideration.--Any joint resolution \n     submitted pursuant to this section shall be considered in the \n     Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of \n     the International Security Assistance and Arms Control Act of \n     1976.

BULK CASH SMUGGLING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) effective enforcement of the currency reporting \n     requirements of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, has forced drug dealers \n     and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid \n     using traditional financial institutions;\n       (2) in their effort to avoid using traditional financial \n     institutions, drug dealers, and other criminals are forced to \n     move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through \n     the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry \n     where it can be smuggled out of the United States and placed \n     in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black \n     market;\n       (3) the transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form \n     may, at the time of enactment of this Act, be the most common \n     form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of \n     cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug \n     trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax \n     evasion, and similar crimes;\n       (4) the intentional transportation into or out of the \n     United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n     instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n     reporting provisions of chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the \n     smuggling of goods;\n       (5) the arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers is an \n     important part of law enforcement's effort to stop the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt \n     to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically \n     low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and are \n     easily replaced, and therefore only the confiscation of the \n     smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of \n     criminal activity of which the laundering of bulk cash is a \n     critical part;\n       (6) the penalties for violations of the currency reporting \n     requirements of the chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the \n     laundering of criminal proceeds;\n       (7) because the only criminal violation under Federal law \n     before the date of enactment of this Act was a reporting \n     offense, the law does not adequately provide for the \n     confiscation of smuggled currency; and\n       (8) if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, \n     the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the \n     smuggling offense.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a \n     criminal offense;\n       (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of \n     the smuggling offense;\n       (3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash \n     smuggling; and\n       (4) to prescribe guidelines for determining the amount of \n     property subject to such forfeiture in various situations.\n       (c) Bulk Cash Smuggling Offense.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 5331.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 24\n\n       Whereas the Congress is greatly saddened by the tragic \n     death of Maureen Reagan on August 8, 2001;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan's love of life and countless \n     contributions to family and the Nation serve as an \n     inspiration to millions;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan was a remarkable advocate for a \n     number of causes and had many passions, the greatest being \n     her dedication to addressing the scourge of Alzheimer's \n     disease;\n       Whereas in 1994 when former President Ronald Reagan \n     announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's \n     disease, Maureen Reagan joined her father and Nancy Reagan in \n     the fight against Alzheimer's disease and became a national \n     spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan served as a tireless advocate to \n     raise public awareness about Alzheimer's disease, support \n     care givers, and substantially increase the Nation's \n     commitment to research on Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan helped inspire the Congress to \n     increase Federal research funding for Alzheimer's disease by \n     amounts proportionate to increases in research funding for \n     other major diseases;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan went far beyond merely lending her \n     name to the work of the Alzheimer's Association: she was a \n     hands-on activist on the association's board of directors, a \n     masterful fund-raiser, a forceful advocate, and a selfless \n     and constant traveler to anywhere and everywhere Alzheimer's \n     advocates needed help;\n       Whereas at every stop she made and every event she attended \n     in her efforts to eradicate Alzheimer's disease through \n     research, Maureen Reagan emphasized that researchers are in a \n     ``race against time before Alzheimer's reaches epidemic \n     levels'' with the aging of the Baby Boomers;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan stated before the Congress in 2000 \n     that ``14 million Baby Boomers are living with a death \n     sentence of Alzheimer's today'';\n       Whereas despite her declining health, Maureen Reagan never \n     decreased her efforts in her battle to eliminate Alzheimer's \n     disease;\n       Whereas during the last six months of her life, from her \n     hospital bed and home, Maureen Reagan urged the Congress to \n     invest $1,000,000,000 to fund research at the National \n     Institutes of Health focused on Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas Maureen Reagan said, ``The best scientific minds \n     have been brought into the race against Alzheimer's, a solid \n     infrastructure is in place, and the path for further \n     investigations is clear.

Con. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and \n     destroyed 4 civilian aircraft, crashing 2 of them into the \n     towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third \n     into the Pentagon, and a fourth in rural southwest \n     Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas thousands of innocent Americans and many foreign \n     nationals were killed and injured as a result of the surprise \n     terrorist attacks, including the passengers and crews of the \n     4 aircraft, workers in the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon, firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency \n     assistance personnel, and bystanders;\n       Whereas hundreds of public safety officers were killed and \n     injured as a result of the terrorist attacks, many of whom \n     would perish when the twin towers of the World Trade Center \n     collapsed upon them after they rushed to the aid of innocent \n     civilians who were imperiled when the terrorists first \n     launched their attacks;\n       Whereas thousands more public safety officers continued to \n     risk their own lives and long-term health in sifting through \n     the aftermath and rubble of the terrorist attacks to rescue \n     those who may have survived and to recover the dead;\n       Whereas the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-12, 115 Stat. 20) authorizes the \n     President to award and present in the name of Congress, a \n     Medal of Valor to public safety officers for extraordinary \n     valor above and beyond the call of duty;\n       Whereas the Attorney General of the United States has \n     discretion to increase the number of recipients of the Medal \n     of Valor under that Act beyond that recommended by the Medal \n     of Valor Review Board in extraordinary cases in any given \n     year;\n       Whereas the terrorist attacks against the United States on \n     September 11, 2001 and their aftermath constitute the single \n     most deadly assault on our American homeland in our Nation's \n     history; and\n       Whereas those public safety officers who perished and were \n     injured, and all those who participated in the efforts to \n     rescue whomever may have survived the terrorist attacks and \n     recover those whose lives were taken so suddenly and \n     violently are the first casualties and veterans of America's \n     new war against terrorism, which was unanimously authorized \n     by the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Senate Joint \n     Resolution 23, enacted September 14, 2001): Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should award and present in the name of \n     Congress a Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to every \n     public safety officer who was killed or seriously injured as \n     a result of the terrorist attacks perpetrated against the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, and to deserving public \n     safety officers who participated in the search, rescue, and \n     recovery efforts in the aftermath of those attacks; and\n       (2) such assistance and compensation as may be needed \n     should be provided to the public safety officers who were \n     injured or whose health was otherwise adversely affected as a \n     result of their participation in the search, rescue, and \n     recovery efforts undertaken in the aftermath of the terrorist \n     attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleagues from New \nYork and Virginia to honor those public safety officials, our police, \nfirefighters, and emergency services personnel, who were lost, or \nseriously wounded in the attacks of September 11 and to public safety \nofficers who participated in the subsequent search, rescue, and \nrecovery efforts.\n  In a tragedy so horrific, when so many were lost so unexpectedly, \nthere is little we can do to console a grieving family. A thank you \nwon't console a child whose father won't be there to say good night. \nIt's little solace to the men and women of a firehouse who even now are \nwaiting to welcome their brothers and sisters home. But by showing our \ngratitude for their sacrifice, by saying a simple thank you, we can \nhelp heal the hearts of the men, women, and children who were left \nbehind, or who struggled to save their friends and neighbors.\n  Today, my colleagues and I hope to be part of this process of healing \nby introducing a resolution recommending that the President award the \nCongressional Medal of Valor for Public Safety Officers to those public \nsafety officials killed or seriously wounded in the September 11 \nattacks and to deserving public safety officers who participated in the \nsubsequent search, rescue and recovery efforts.\n  These medals will serve as a thank you to those still with us. But I \nthink they can do much more for the families who lost loved ones. I've \nseen how medals awarded in combat can help tell a story to a child \nabout a lost loved one. They can show a child and an entire family that \ntheir loved one did not die in vain. These medals can say that these \nmen and women gave their lives in service to their neighbors and to \ntheir nation, and that nation is a grateful one.\n  History will mark September 11, 2001 as one of the darkest days in \nour Nation's history. In less than two hours, more Americans were \nkilled than those who died during the Revolutionary War or the surprise \nattack on Pearl Harbor. Words cannot begin to capture our grief, our \nloss, or our resolve to strike back against global terrorism.\n  But in that darkest of hours, the bravery and selflessness of our \npublic safety officials shined a light of hope for us all to follow. \nYou see it reflected back in towns large and small across America. You \nsee it in flag-lined streets, lines of blood donors, and in the \nmillions contributed to help care for the victims families. The example \nset by our police, firefighters and emergency services personal steeled \nthe resolve of every American.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank my colleague and the senior \nSenator from Alaska Senator Stevens. Earlier this year the Congress \npassed, the president signed, the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor \nAct, which was authorized by my friend from Alaska. That earlier \nrecognition of the need to honor the heroism of public service officers \nmakes today's resolution possible, and I thank my colleague from \nAlaska.\n  I should also note that Senator Stevens has also introduced a \nresolution similar to the one we offer today. My resolution goes \nsomewhat further by calling on the President to award the Congressional \nMedal of Valor to those killed and those seriously injured in the \nattacks and to deserving public safety officers who participated in the \nsubsequent search, rescue, and recovery efforts.\n  The men and women this resolution would honor are the first victims \nof America's first war of the 21st century. My solemn prayer is that \nthey will be the final casualties of a final war. But then I remember \nthe destruction of the past century, how we spoke of a War to End All \nWars, only to see the century unfold with more destruction. As we move \ncloser to some form of military action, I hope for a day when we can \nstop throwing more young lives into the breech and instead repair the \nbreech itself.\n  But today, to these new fellow veterans, we say thank you. A grateful \nNation has drawn its strength from the courageous firefighters, police \nofficers, and emergency services personnel who have sacrificed so much \nwithout hesitation. It is my privilege to have this chance to say thank \nyou in this small way. I want to thank my colleagues from New York and \nVirginia. I hope we can move this resolution forward with the help of \nall of my colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10336-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10336]]\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 76--HONORING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, \nFIREFIGHTERS, EMERGENCY RESCUE PERSONNEL, AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS \nWHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO SEARCH FOR AND RESCUE THE VICTIMS OF THE \n      HORRIFIC ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Clinton, and \nMr. Schumer) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 168, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski, and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 168) congratulating and honoring Cal \n     Ripken, Jr., for his amazing and storybook career as a player \n     for the Baltimore Orioles and thanking him for his \n     contributions to baseball, the State of Maryland, and the \n     United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I submitted S. Res. 168 with my \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, honoring Cal Ripken, Jr.\n  On Saturday October 6, 2001, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, not far \nfrom my home in Baltimore, Cal Ripken, Jr. will play in his final \nbaseball game. Cal Ripken's career will have spanned 21 seasons in the \nmajor leagues, every one of them with the Baltimore Orioles. In fact, \nbeginning with Cal's father, Cal Ripken, Sr., there has been a Ripken \nin the Orioles organization for 45 consecutive years. Over the past 21 \nyears, Cal Ripken, Jr. has built what will be a lasting legacy not only \nas one of the greatest players in the history of professional baseball, \nbut as a true ambassador of the game and a shining example of \nsportsmanship, character, and the American work ethic.\n  An entire generation was born and grew up watching Cal Ripken play \nbaseball every day the right way. Many of my constituents in Maryland \nhave rooted for the Orioles knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that Cal \nRipken would be playing, first at Memorial Stadium and then later at \nCamden Yards, and that they would be able to see Cal give that one game \neverything that he had. Not only will the city of Baltimore miss Cal's \nnumber 8 on the left-side of the infield and in the heart of the line-\nup, but all residents of Maryland, and millions of Americans, from die-\nhard baseball fans, to those who have only seen one game, will always \nassociate the Baltimore Orioles with their legendary shortstop, Cal \nRipken.\n  Cal Ripken's achievements on the field of play are legendary: Ripken \nis one of only seven players in history to record both 400 home runs \nand 3,000 hits and along with fellow Oriole, longtime teammate, and \ngood friend, Eddie Murray, they are the only infielders to accomplish \nthis feat. Simply put, Cal redefined the position of shortstop in every \nrespect: offense, defense, durability, consistency, and popularity.\n  Listing all of Cal's baseball accomplishments could go on forever, \nbut there is one record for which he is best known, and that in \nMaryland is simply referred to as ``The Streak.'' For 17 straight \nyears, Ripken played in every single game on the Baltimore Orioles' \nschedule, never succumbing to injury or weakness, always willing to do \nhis best to help the Orioles over an amazing 2,632 consecutive games. \nIt is this consistency and work ethic that has so endeared him to the \nAmerican public, and was so stirringly celebrated on the evening of \nSeptember 6, 1995, the day that he played has 2,131st consecutive game, \nsurpassing the record set by the ``Iron Horse,'' Hall-of-Famer Lou \nGehrig. I will repeat what I said on this very floor on September 7, \n1995: throughout both ``The Streak'' and the rest of Cal's storybook \ncareer, Cal played baseball for one reason and one reason only: because \nhe loves the game. And, Cal, the game loves you.\n  When Cal was approaching Mr. Gehrig's record in 1995, it was a \nturbulent time in the history of Major League Baseball; the sport was \ntrying to recover from the damage done by a players' strike in the 1994 \nseason that canceled the World Series for the first time in history. \nThere was a breach of trust between the sport and its fans, but there \nis no doubt in anyone's mind that Cal Ripken's journey toward this \ngreat record was a focus point in the healing process that \nultimately restored much of the good will lost for America's pastime.\n\n  Ripken, over the course of 21 consecutive seasons, spent hours before \nand after games signing autographs for countless fans. There were jokes \nin the Baltimore clubhouse that if anything were to end ``The Streak,'' \nit would be an injury to his right hand from signing too many \nautographs. But it is this willingness to go the extra mile, to not \ntreat his fame and influence as a burden but to welcome his \nresponsibility to the public, particularly to children, as a role model \nthat distinguishes Cal Ripken from even the greatest athletes and \nenables him to transcend his sport.\n  Unlike so many of our modern athletes, Cal Ripken embraced his status \nas a role model. With his wife Kelly by his side, the Ripkens engaged \nin charity work ranging from literacy programs to fighting Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, as well as working tirelessly to promote the game of baseball \nto all children, especially those that are disadvantaged. Fittingly, \none of the many tasks that Cal will devote himself to in his retirement \nis the Cal Ripken Little League Division of Babe Ruth Baseball, which \nhas over 700,000 children learning the fundamentals of baseball. \nAnother project that Cal will be working on is that of building \nInspiration Field in his home community of Harford County, Maryland. \nCal has always been devoted\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\nto his Maryland roots, but beyond that is his devotion to his family, \nhis mother Vi, his late father Cal Ripken, Sr., his wife Kelly, and his \nchildren Ryan and Rachel. Cal has shown this devotion countless times, \nand I know that in his retirement, Cal, will have more time to enjoy \nthe loving family that we are all proud to know simply as the Ripkens.\n  But here, as with the statistics and records, listing Cal's \ncharitable programs and donations and noting his loving role as son, \nhusband, and father, can not fully capture the phenomenal manner in \nwhich Cal Ripken has lived his life and given back to his community. \nCal was born in Havre de Grace, MD, and was raised in the neighboring \nCity of Aberdeen. He was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles organization \nin 1978, and spent every year of his professional career, except one, \nplaying baseball in the State of Maryland. Cal Ripken's career has been \nthe fulfillment of the childhood dream of so many of us, to become an \nathletic superstar and play your entire career for your hometown team. \nAnd beyond that, Cal Ripken has lived this dream with the dignity, \nhonor, humility, charity, passion, and pure love of baseball that make \nmyself, the City of Aberdeen, the City of Baltimore, the State of \nMaryland, and the United States of America proud to call Cal a legend \nand a role model for us all. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nhonoring and congratulating Cal Ripken's amazing and storybook career \nby saying thank you Cal.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and \ncareer of Cal Ripken. He has given us 21 glorious years--and I know \nthat we have seen nothing yet. The resolution that I am introducing \nwith Senator Sarbanes seeks to commemorate one of the great careers in \nbaseball--and one of the great role models of our time.\n  Most Marylanders will confess to some sadness about what will happen \nthis weekend. We will see the Iron Man take the field for the last time \nat Camden Yards. But I promise my colleagues--this is not the last you \nwill hear of Cal Ripken. He will go on to other careers and other \nchallenges. He will continue his extraordinary service to his \ncommunity. He will continue to be someone we can all look up to and \nrespect.\n  We all know the amazing statistics he compiled in his career. In \n1982, he won Rookie of the Year--and after that, the records kept \nbreaking. He set a record for most home runs by a shortstop. He \nreceived the most Silver Slugger Awards of any shortstop and set eleven \ndifferent fielding records. He was MVP twice during the regular season \ntwice, and twice during the All-Star Games. He also amassed over three \nthousand hits and four hundred home runs.\n  He is best known for setting the record for most consecutive games \nplayed. It is unlikely that his record of 2,632 games will ever be \nbroken.\n  Cal did not do this just for the sake of breaking a record; he broke \nthat record because that is how he lives. He gives 100 percent every \nday. Ask any of the hundreds of Baltimore Orioles who played with him \nover the last twenty-one years.\n  Ask Cal's coaches who have seen him rededicate himself every day. Ask \nany of the thousands and thousands and even millions of Orioles fans \nfor whom he stayed at the ballpark late at night, willing to sign \nautographs. Ask the community and charitable organizations who he \nvolunteered for. Ask the thousands of children who he helps through his \nfoundations.\n  Athletes of Cal's caliber often move from town to town and team to \nteam. Yet Cal spent his entire career here in Baltimore. He did it for \nhis family--his father Cal, Sr.--the great former manager of the \nOrioles. He did it for his children--to enable them to grow up as he \ndid--in a community that values faith, family, community and \npatriotism.\n  Cal always puts these values into action. He has a passion for \nteaching baseball to children and for his charitable organizations. He \ncreated ``Reading, Runs and Ripken'' program, the Cal Ripken Little \nLeague Division, the Kelly and Cal Ripken, Jr., Foundation, and the Cal \nRipken, Jr./Lou Gehrig ALS Research Fund. These service organizations \nwill continue--serving children into the future.\n  Cal Ripken is the Iron Man, not because of his streak but because of \nhis values, the Oriole way--showing up every day, working hard, playing \nby the rules, putting the team first. Cal will have lots of adulation \nover the next few days--and he absolutely deserves it. But Cal would \nwant us to honor him not only with resolutions and parades and cheers \nfrom the grandstand. He would want us to practice the Oriole way: show \nup, work hard, play by the rules--and put your family and team first.\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) memorializing fallen \n     firefighters by lowering the American flag to half-staff in \n     honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in \n     Emmitsburg, Maryland.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of House Joint \nResolution 42, a bill to memorialize our Nation's fallen firefighters \nby lowering the American flag to half-staff in honor of the National \nFallen Firefighters Memorial Service in Emmitsburg, MD. This measure is \nsimilar to legislation\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\nthat I introduced earlier this year. Both bills seek to recognize the \ncourage and commitment of America's fire service and to pay this \nspecial tribute to those firefighters who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the line of duty.\n  Our Nation's firefighters are among our most dedicated public \nservants. From major cities such as New York to our smaller rural \ncommunities, every day America's firefighters answer emergency calls, \nwilling to sacrifice their own lives to protect the lives and property \nof their fellow citizens. Sadly, this dedication to service can result \nin tragedy.\n  Few would question the fact that our fallen firefighters are heroes. \nThroughout our Nation's history, we have recognized the passing of our \npublic servants by lowering our Nation's flag to half-staff in their \nhonor. In the past, this list has included elected officials, members \nof the Armed Services, and America's peace officers. In my view, our \nfallen firefighters are equally deserving of this high honor.\n  For the past 19 years, a memorial service has been held on the campus \nof the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg to honor those firefighters \nwho have given their lives while protecting the lives and property of \ntheir fellow citizens. Since 1981, the names of 2,081 fallen \nfirefighters have been inscribed on plaques surrounding the National \nFallen Firefighters Memorial, Congressionally designated monument to \nthese brave men and women. On October 7, at the 20th Annual National \nMemorial Service, an additional 101 names will be added. I am pleased \nthat President and Mrs. Bush will be present this year to lead the \nNation in honoring these fallen fire heroes and to pay special tribute \nto those firefighters who perished as a result of the events of \nSeptember 11.\n  Over the years, I have worked very closely with the National Fallen \nFirefighters Foundation to ensure that National Memorial Service is an \noccasion befitting the sacrifices that these individuals have made, In \nmy view, lowering the United States flag to half-staff is an essential \ncomponent of this ``Day of Remembrance.'' It will be a fitting tribute \nto the men and women who die each year performing their duties as our \nnation's career and volunteer firefighters. It will also serve to \nremind us of the critical role played by the 1.2 million fire service \npersonnel who risk their lives every day to ensure our safety and that \nof our communities.\n  I express my gratitude to those Senators who agreed to cosponsor my \nlegislation, S.J. Res. 18, and urge my colleagues to support the swift \npassage of H.J. Res. 42.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \nthis legislation, which was reported by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations earlier today. The bill addresses an urgent priority in the \nfight against terrorism by clearing the way for U.S. assistance to \nPakistan. After the attacks of September 11, we asked the world to \nchoose sides. Pakistan has chosen to stand with the United States.\n  We need to assist this important front-line state. The President has \nalready done so by committing $100 million in economic assistance to \nPakistan under the extraordinary authority of Section 614 of the \nForeign Assistance Act. But to provide additional assistance requires \nCongress to amend several laws restricting such assistance. The bill \nbefore the Senate therefore provides the following authority.\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\n  First, the bill waives, for Fiscal Year 2002, the restriction in law \nagainst assistance to countries where a democratic government has been \noverthrown by military coup. The President may waive the restriction in \nFiscal Year 2003, but only if he determines that doing so would \nfacilitate the transition to democratic rule in Pakistan and if it is \nimportant to the fight against terrorism. As we all know, there was a \nmilitary coup in Pakistan in 1999. The current government has pledged \nto hold elections next fall. This provision keeps the focus on the U.S. \npolicy objective that elections should be held in Pakistan.\n  Second, the bill permits an expeditious waiver of sanctions imposed \nlast fall against the Pakistani Ministry of Defense for violations of \nthe Missile Technology Control Regime. Current law permits the \nPresident to waive these sanctions if it is essential to the national \nsecurity. But he is required to notify Congress 45 working days before \ndoing so. The bill allows the President to exercise the waiver without \nwaiting those nine weeks.\n  Third, the bill waives provisions of law which restrict assistance to \nnations in arrears on their payments of official debt to the United \nStates. The United States just rescheduled some of Pakistan's debt, but \nthat rescheduling does not take effect for several weeks, so this \nprovision allows assistance to flow to Pakistan in the meantime.\n  Finally, the bill provides additional flexibility in providing \nemergency military assistance to any country assisting us in the \ncampaign against terrorism by reducing, but not eliminating, the \nnotification periods for these authorities for two years.\n  The bill makes no other changes to current law. Rather than provide \nbroad waiver authority to override the significant structure of laws we \nhave enacted in recent decades, as the State Department asked, we have \nnarrowly tailored the legislation to address the specific provisions of \nlaw that were obstacles to helping Pakistan. In so doing, we are not \nforegoing any of the important policy objectives we have in Pakistan, \nparticularly our non-proliferation objectives.\n  I should emphasize that this provision has broad support. It was \nnegotiated on a bipartisan basis within the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, and with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell. Because \nof the urgency of trying to get this legislation to the President, we \nhave agreed to ``double-track'' the bill. We will move it free-standing \ntoday, and the Appropriations Committee will incorporate it into the \nforeign operations appropriations bill when that is considered in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, as we have since September 11, we stand united in \nsupport of the President. We stand ready to assist the Administration \nin the campaign against terrorism. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the title \namendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1465), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title amendment was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/04/senate-section/article/S10340-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1499\n\n  Mr. REID.
