Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nInhofe be added to this amendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nunderlying bill.\n  My amendment corrects an inconsistency in the Tax Code that unfairly \npunishes foster care families and the foster care family members for \nwhom they care.\n  Many families that take in foster care family members receive a \nstipend from the placement agency to help provide this care.\n  These stipends help defray the costs for food, shelter, and the basic \nnecessities.\n  In some cases, families get these stipends tax-free. But in others, \nfamilies pay taxes on them as if they were ordinary income.\n  My amendment replaces this patchwork system by providing a single, \nblanket rule that gives equal treatment to all of these stipends by \nsimply excluding them from taxation.\n  Because real world changes in foster care have outpaced the Tax Code, \nwe presently have a situation where stipends are taxed depending on the \nage of the foster care family member, and whether or not they were \nplaced by a for-profit agency or a nonprofit agency.\n  This makes no sense.\n  Presently, if the placement is done by a for-profit agency, or if the \nfoster family member is over 18, the stipends are taxed.\n  It is only if the foster family member is placed by a not-for-profit \nand they are under 18 that the stipends are not taxed.\n  This is a distinction without a difference.\n  It shouldn't matter if the stipends come from a for-profit or a \nnonprofit agency, or if it is a needy individual who is 12 or 42.\n  We shouldn't tax love and compassion on such an arbitrary basis.\n  Instead of sending a tax bill to the foster parents who are doing the \nright thing, we should give them a break and encourage their good \nintentions.\n  What is important is that these needy individuals are getting help, \nand the families who help by offering to help should not be penalized \nfor their good deeds.\n  Instead of punishing foster care, we should reward it.\n  My amendment helps to do just this by making it more attractive and \nmore affordable to take in foster care family members.\n  This is a noncontroversial, bipartisan idea. In fact, this proposal \npassed Congress as part of the 1999 tax bill that was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. It also passed the House last year on two separate \noccasions as both a stand-alone bill and as part of the centrist \nstimulus package, H.R. 3529.\n  I have been working on this issue for almost 5 years, and I have \nnever heard one bit of criticism about it.\n  It is a commonsense improvement to the Tax Code that would \nimmediately benefit families by letting them keep more of the money \nthat they receive for the foster care of children of any age.\n  And it has the added, more important, benefit of promoting care and \ncompassion for some of our most needy individuals.\n  There are hundreds of thousands of children and adults in foster \ncare. Both they and the families who are looking after them would \nbenefit from my amendment.\n  My amendment is nothing new to Congress. But let's make it new to \nthose foster care families all across the Nation.\n  Foster parenting is hard work. The stipends are very small. Foster \ncare families and their charges deserve and need tax relief and \nfairness as much as anyone else.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient number?\n  There is a sufficient number.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess until 4 o'clock today.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:11 p.m., recessed until \n3:59 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer \n(Mr. Reid).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S154-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S154-S158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE STIMULUS BILL\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last week we were debating the stimulus \nbill. In that regard, there was some discussion by some of the \nleadership on the other side of the aisle to the effect that they were \nasking for all these tax cuts. However, on Saturday morning I listened \nto the President. I heard him in his weekly radio address.\n  He said:\n\n       I urge it to pass a strong stimulus bill, the one that \n     passed the House last year.\n\n  So there is no question that the issue of tax cuts as a stimulus is \nstill one of the main issues to this particular Senator, and it really \nhackles this Senator in that we don't have any taxes to cut. We don't \nhave any revenues. We don't have any surplus. I have been saying this \never since we balanced the budget back under Lyndon Baines Johnson. I \nwill never forget at that particular time George Mahon on the House \nside, the distinguished Congressman from Texas, was chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and we were working in December, after the \nNovember elections; and in that particular December session it looked \nlike in order to balance that budget, pay down the debt, not increase \nit, not have a deficit, that we needed some $5 billion more in cuts. We \ncalled over to Marvin Watson and said: ``Ask the President will he go \nalong with another cut of some $5 billion.'' We did it at that \nparticular time, and we balanced the budget for 1968-1969. We were in \nthe black as we ended that particular year. It was right at $2.9 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this particular point the deficits and interest costs over the past \nhalf century, since President Truman in 1947, including President Bush \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\n\n\n

CBO's The Budget and Economic\n  Outlook: Fiscal Years 2003-2012 January 23, 2002.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you will see from this particular chart \nthe truthfulness of what I have just stated; namely, we have not had a \nbalanced budget since 1968-1969. More specifically, we keep talking \nabout surpluses, but we get surpluses by using all kinds of fancy \nterminologies to dance around in order to hide the money and the debt. \nThe truth is, though, the net figure as to whether the national debt \ngoes up or goes down; whether or not we spend only the money we have, \nor we have to borrow in order to provide for the appropriations that we \nhave provided; whether those things occur or not, the actual national \ndebt has gone up, up, and away. It has gone up some billions of dollars \neach year for the past 31 years, to the extent that when we talked \nabout surpluses all last year, we did not end up with a surplus when \nPresident Clinton left town.\n  In fiscal 2000, there was a deficit of $22.7 billion. For the first \nyear of President Bush, we now have a $143.4 billion deficit, and the \nCongressional Budget Office last week attested to the fact that they \nproject that the deficit next year, in 2002, is going to be $271.2 \nbillion. Can you imagine that? Last year at this time we were talking \nabout $5.6 trillion in the black and now we are talking about $271.2 \nbillion in the red.\n  I think it was Mark Twain years ago who said: ``The truth is such a \nprecious thing, it should be used very sparingly.'' That is exactly the \nway we approach this particular role of ours as budgeteers and \nCongressmen and Senators and everything else of that kind. We actually \nhide the debt. The way we hide the debt is what Alan Greenspan \neuphemistically calls ``intragovernmental transfers.'' That sounds \npretty, but what you are doing is looting the retirement funds, the \ntrust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record, \nwhich reflects ``trust funds looted to balance the budget.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 2001     2002     2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security..............................    1,170    1,333    1,512\nMedicare:\n  HI.........................................      197      230      266\n  SMI........................................       42       43       42\nMilitary Retirement..........................      157      165      173\nCivilian Retirement..........................      543      577      611\nUnemployment.................................       89       74       59\nHighway......................................       24       20       13\nAirport......................................       14       12        9\nRailroad Retirement..........................       27       27       28\nOther........................................       72       77       81\n                                              --------------------------\n      Total..................................    2,335    2,558    2,794\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that shows in 2001 we took $1.170 \ntrillion from Social Security. We took from Medicare some $240 billion. \nFrom military retirement--the retirees who we say we want to look \nafter--we looted their retirement moneys, some $157 billion; from \ncivilian retirement, $543 billion--that is the civil service; from \nunemployment compensation fund, $89 billion. Now they say we might have \nto start paying into that.\n  In 2001, we looted the highway trust funds by $24 billion; airports \nby $14 billion; railroad retirement by some $27 billion: and another \n$72 billion from other entities like the Federal Finance Bank. The \nsavings and loan debacle is when we started that fever about \nderegulating. We deregulated the savings and loan industry and that up-\nended. We deregulated the airlines and they have gone broke. We \nderegulated the trucking companies and they have gone out of business. \nNow we are on course to deregulating energy, which is before us now. \nOur experience is that when we have deregulated, it has been a \ndisaster. The point is, we have hidden $2.335 trillion. We have hidden \n$2.335 trillion.\n  Let me refer to the January 28th edition of Business Week. This says: \nAccounting in crisis, what needs to be done. I refer to page 36 and the \narticle, ``Who Else is Hiding Debt?''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Who Else Is Hiding Debt\n\n     Moving financial obligations into off-book vehicles is now a \n         common ploy\n\n                        (By David Henry, et al.)\n\n       When energy trader Enron Corp. admitted to hiding billions \n     of dollars of liabilities in mysterious off-book entities, it \n     trotted out the lame excuse of scoundrels: Everyone does it. \n     And this time, it was the gospel truth.\n       Hundreds of respected U.S. companies are ferreting away \n     trillions of dollars in debt in off-balance-sheet \n     subsidiaries, partnerships, and assorted obligations, \n     including leases, pension plans, and take-or-pay contracts \n     with suppliers. Potentially bankrupting contracts are \n     mentioned vaguely in footnotes to company accounts, at best. \n     The goal is to skirt the rules of consolidation, the bedrock \n     of the American financial reporting system and the source of \n     much of its credibility. These rules, set clear in 1959, aim \n     to make public companies give a full and fair picture of \n     their business--including all the assets and liabilities of \n     any subsidiaries. But accountants, lawyers, and bankers have \n     learned to drive a coach and horses through them.\n       Because of a gaping loophole in accounting practice, \n     companies create arcane legal structures, often called \n     special-purpose entities (SPEs). Then, the parent can \n     bankroll up to 97% of the initial investment in an SPE \n     without having to consolidate it into its own accounts. \n     Normally, once a company owns 50% or more of another, it must \n     consolidate it under the 1959 rules. The controversial \n     exception that outsiders need invest only 3% of an SPE's \n     capital for it to be independent and off the balance sheet \n     came about through fumbles by the Securities & Exchange \n     Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. In \n     1990, accounting firms asked the SEC to endorse the 3% rule \n     that had become a common, though unofficial practice in the \n     '80s. The SEC didn't like the idea, but it didn't stomp on \n     it, either. It asked the FASB to set tighter rules to force \n     consolidation of entities that were effectively controlled by \n     companies. FASB drafted two overhauls of the rules but never \n     finished the job, and the SEC is still waiting.\n       It's not just the energy industry that exploits the \n     loophole and stashes major liabilities in the never-never \n     land of SPEs. Increasingly, companies of all stripes \n     routinely use them to offload potential balance-sheet \n     bombshells such as loan guarantees or the financing of sales \n     of their own products. For example, the accounts of data \n     processor Electronic Data Systems Corp. don't show $500 \n     million--half of last year's earnings--that it would owe if \n     its customers were to cancel their contracts and leave it \n     holding the bag for loans on their computer equipment. The \n     arrangement is acknowledged only in a footnote. An EDS \n     spokesman says the tactic is common in the industry and does \n     not put the company at undue risk.\n       Airlines keep appearances aloft by shunting billions worth \n     of airplane financing into off-balance-sheet vehicles, says \n     credit analyst Philip Baggaley of Standard & Poor's Corp. \n     United Airlines Inc. parent UAL Corp.'s published balanced \n     sheet for 2000 shows $5 billion of long-term debt. But only a \n     footnote describes the bulk of its lease payments, which \n     Baggaley estimates have a present value of $12.7 billion, due \n     over 26 years on 233 airplanes. AMR Corp., parent of American \n     Airlines Inc., is on the hook for $7.9 billion in lease \n     payments not on its balance sheet. ``Everyone who's involved \n     in the industry knows that the true leverage is higher'' than \n     what's shown on the balance sheet, says Baggaley. UAL and AMR \n     declined to comment.\n       Banks arrange many of the devices and are big users \n     themselves. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., for example, has \n     revealed in the Enron bankruptcy that it has nearly $1 \n     billion in potential liabilities stemming from a single 49%-\n     owned Channel Islands entity called Mahonia that traded with \n     Enron. The liabilities bring the bank's total Enron exposure \n     to $2.6 billion. And J.P. Morgan is not alone. A suit filed \n     earlier this month shows that many U.S. finance companies are \n     among 52 partners in LJM2, an Enron off-balance-sheet entity \n     with over $300 million in assets. The partners, including \n     Citigroup, Wachovia, and American International Group, may \n     all have to take losses on it.\n       The banks' participation in SPEs is attracting scrutiny of \n     federal regulators. A Federal Reserve spokesman said it is \n     ``concerned about'' off-balance-sheet exposures and hopes new \n     accounting rules will be put in place. How many more Mahonia \n     or LJM2-like entities are there? The Channel Islands tax \n     haven boasts more than 350 SPEs and similar entities, though \n     it is impossible to know how many should really be \n     consolidated on balance sheets of U.S. companies. Assets in \n     the entities total more than $635 billion, according to \n     Fitzrovia International PLC, a London-based research firm. \n     The Cayman Islands, which has been competing for the business \n     since the 1980s, claims another 600 trusts and banks, most of \n     which have SPE expertise.\n       With some of the vehicles, it is impossible for investors \n     to know from financial reports who could be responsible for \n     what. For example, Dell Computer Corp. has a joint venture \n     with Tyco International Ltd. called Del Financial Services \n     that last year originated $2.5 billion in customer financing, \n     according to a footnote to Dell's accounts. According to the \n     note, Dell owns 70% of DFS, but does not control it and \n     therefore keeps DFS debts off its own balance sheet. What if \n     DFS has trouble from customers not paying? Dell spokesman \n     T.R. Reid says any obligation of DFS are Tyco's \n     responsibility and Tyco agrees. Jeffrey D. Simon, president \n     of the global vendor financing business at Tyco Capital, says \n     Tyco would look at Dell's customers to pay and not to Dell. \n     Tyco's balance sheet reflects borrowing to finance Dell's \n     customers.\n       Companies argue that off-balance sheet vehicles benefit \n     investors because they enable management to tap extra sources \n     of financing and hedge trading risks that could roil \n     earnings. Maybe so, but they sure make the companies, and \n     their executives, look good: Return on capital looks better \n     than it is because balance sheets understate the amount \n     employed. And investors and regulators don't freak out as \n     corporate debt balloons. But critics charge that the \n     widespread use of off-balance-sheet schemes encourages \n     contempt for accounting rules in the executive suite and \n     spreads confusion among investors. ``The nonprofessional has \n     no idea of the extent of the real liabilities,'' says J. \n     Edward Ketz, accounting professor at Pennsylvania State \n     University. ``Professionals can be easily fooled, too.''\n       Worse yet, many SPEs have provisions that can throw their \n     users into a full-blown financial crisis. To get assets off \n     its books, a company typically sells them to an SPE, funding \n     the purchase by borrowing cash from institutional investors. \n     As a sweetener to protect investors, many SPEs incorporate \n     triggers that require the parent to repay loans or give them \n     new securities if its stock falls below a certain price or \n     credit-rating agencies downgrade its debt. It was just such \n     triggers in its notorious off-balance-sheet partnerships that \n     sent Enron into a death spiral. And triggers fueled the \n     crises last year at Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern \n     California Edison, and Xerox, according to Moody's Investors \n     Service. ``All of this hidden debt and these triggers could \n     make the next economic downturn a lot worse than it would \n     otherwise be,'' says Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant at \n     the Securities & Exchange Commission until July.\n       Despite the risks, SPEs remain very appealing to companies. \n     And any attempt to curb them or abolish the 3% rule will run \n     into furious opposition. Since the early '90s, an army of \n     accountants, lawyers, and bankers built a huge industry to \n     concoct ever more creative ways to evade consolidated \n     reporting. So reform won't come easily. ``It will be a \n     phenomenal flight,'' says Turner.\n       Maybe so, but Enron's demise shows how quickly a tiny \n     loophole can tear the country's economic fabric. And there \n     may never be a better time to close it.\n\n\n                              out of sight\n\n       Many companies keep debts and other obligations out of \n     investors' view in partnerships and other entities. Often, \n     financial liabilities are secured by physical assets such as \n     planes or computers.

Mr. President, this says, ``Moving financial \nobligations into off-book vehicles is now a common\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\nploy.'' Could it be that Kenneth Lay is acting like a Senator, acting \nlike a Congressman, acting like a President, or acting like Alan \nGreenspan? Chairman Greenspan testified before our committee and it was \nlike pulling teeth to try to get him to admit that the debt went up. He \ncame and we went around and around and around, and finally, I said:\n\n       Let me ask you this. Here is the CBO report. Does it \n     project that the debt goes up and the Government will have to \n     borrow over the next 10 years, or not? Mr. Greenspan \n     answered, it does.\n\n  The reason I wanted to fit that into the Record is because Mr. \nGreenspan is no different than the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, our good friend Dr. Crippen, when it comes to the budget. Last \nweek at our Budget hearing on national TV, he says this is the CBO \nreport, and all he has in this thin little document is the revenue, but \nnone of the expenditures, so we are left with only surpluses. He kept \ntalking about how the surplus has gone down from $5.6 trillion to $1.6 \ntrillion. He kept saying the word surplus--surplus, surplus, surplus, \nsurplus.\n  That is all we heard. We did not hear about the debt and the deficit.\n  I finally got the sheet that shows the gross Federal debt, according \nto CBO, goes from $5.772 trillion to $7.644 trillion; in other words, \nit goes up about $1.9 trillion. That is what we ought to be talking \nabout, that is the reality; but we keep talking about intragovernmental \ntransfers, as Dr. Greenspan says, or we talk about surpluses, as Dr. \nCrippin testified to. The fact is, we are doing what Kenneth Lay was \ndoing: Misleading the public.\n  We are trying to get reelected. So if we all go along with this $1.6 \ntrillion surplus, surplus, surplus, that gives some substance, some \ncredibility to a tax cut. I do not believe in letting a surplus sit \naround any more than anybody else, but the truth of the matter is, \nthere is no surplus.\n  I have the public debt to the penny chart which you can find on the \ninternet at: http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm.\n  Mr. President, the chart shows we ended up last year with a $143.4 \nbillion deficit. That was the end of September-October 1 of 2001. \nAlready this year, the current amount of public debt, has gone up $122 \nbillion. We are starting the year in the red and talking about \nstimulating with tax cuts.\n  Let's get to the point. How did we get those 8 glowing years of the \ngreatest economic boom in America's history? By what? By paying down \nthe debt. Somehow we have gotten lost in the politics of all of this. \nThey are all talking tax cuts, they are all talking surpluses, they are \nall talking about giving money back that nobody has. The truth is, \neconomic growth is not about consumer confidence; it is about market \nconfidence. It is the financial community up on Wall Street who know \nthe truth. They read this budget the same way I do.\n  Wall Street does not look for intragovernmental transfers. They look \nat the long range, whether or not the Government will be crowding into \nthe market with its sharp elbows to borrow money to pay its bills. They \nknow that instead of surpluses we have deficits; instead of paying down \nthe debt, we have the national debt increasing. This is why the long-\nrange bond rates and interest rates are staying high.\n  Yes, Dr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve had 11 cuts to the short-\nterm rate, and where is the long-term rate? Still at 5 percent, and it \ncould be increasing, according to Dr. Greenspan's statement.\n  I have had hearings. We have about a dozen committees and scores of \nhearings about Enron hiding the debt. But according to Business Week, \nwho is hiding the debt? None other than the United States Government. \nWe owe $2.3 trillion, and if we do not pay down the debt and continue \nto borrow, we will owe these particular trust funds $2.8 trillion at \nthis time next year.\n\n  In 1994, this supposedly conscientious Congress passed the Pension \nReform Act. We said we were not going to have these fast operating \nartists come in, take over a company, pay down the debt with the \npension fund and take the money that is left and run. We had that going \non all through the eighties. So at the beginning of the nineties, we \npassed legislation making it a felony to pay off corporate debt with a \npension fund.\n  I refer to Denny McLain, the former pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, \nabout whom the distinguished Presiding Officer knows. He took over a \ncompany when he got out of baseball and paid down the debt with the \ncompany's pension fund. He was charged with a felony under the law and \nsentenced to 8 years. Now he is out, I take it, by now, and I wish him \nwell, but I have to use that example to sear the conscience and \nawareness of this dormant body. Senators still want to keep their eyes \nand ears closed as to the truth about budgeting.\n  They all have schemes to save Social Security. All they have to do is \nquit spending, quit looting the Social Security trust fund. I remember \nwhen Dr. Greenspan came to us in the early eighties, and he projected \nto Congress: If we do not do something about this, Social Security is \ngoing bottom up. It will go bankrupt.\n  What happened? They appointed the Greenspan Commission, and the \nGreenspan Commission recommended, among other things, that we have an \ninordinately high payroll tax graduated upwards. Why did we graduate it \nupwards over the years? They said to take care of the baby boomers. The \ntruth is, they knew this 20 years ago, so they put in that inordinately \nhigh payroll tax which, for most Americans, exceeds their income tax. \nThe money was there and section 31 of the Greenspan report said do not \ntouch that money. Put it off budget. Get it out of the unified budget, \nas they were talking about in those times.\n  This Senator over several years tried to get that into law. Finally, \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush--Bush senior--on November 5, 1990, signed \ninto law section 13301 of the Budget Act: Thou shalt not use Social \nSecurity in your budget.\n  We did not put a penalty in the law. The law is violated every day by \nthe Congress and the President. It has long since been law. We all \nvoted for it. The vote was 98 to 2 in the Senate. But they spend that \nmoney willy-nilly, spending Social Security in violation of that law; \nin violation of the spirit of the Pension Reform Act. They all go out \nand say: I am a responsible Senator, reelect me; the Government is too \nbig; the Government is not the answer; the Government is the problem; \nthe Government is the enemy.\n  Let us not act like Kenneth Lay this year. I hope that sears the \nconscience of not only the American people but the Senate body in which \nI serve.\n  For years I have been trying to limit campaign spending. I was in the \ndiscussions during the Campaign Finance Act which we finally enacted in \n1974. At the time, I looked over at the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Buckley, and said: You are not going to buy it.\n  He said: Oh, yes, I am.\n  And he sued; Buckley v. Valeo. He sued the Secretary of the Senate, \nand we got the Buckley v. Valeo decision. I could see exactly what \nhappened with that Buckley v. Valeo decision. The Supreme Court turned \naround the intent of the Congress. And that particular decision by the \nCourt said we are not going to be able to buy the office. But that is \nthe only way you can get into office is to buy it. It is a disgrace.\n  So I offered a one-line constitutional amendment, and I still propose \nit every Congress. It says the Congress is hereby empowered to regulate \nor control spending in Federal elections.\n  But I cannot get a two-thirds vote. I used to get a lot of my \nRepublican colleagues on the other side of the aisle to vote for it. I \nwould get Bill Cohen, Alan Simpson, Nancy Kassenbaum, and Bill Roth, \nbut they are all gone now. The distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, said: Now, wait a minute. We have the money. They have the \nunions. Of course, I come from South Carolina and I don't get money and \nI don't get unions, neither one.\n  So that being the case, I believe I am going to have to go for public \ncampaign financing. I have resisted the idea of public financing \npolitics, but it is currently being financed in the most corrupt \nfashion.\n  Do not give me McCain-Feingold. That does away with the soft money. \nInstead, contributions are directed into hard money and those \nparticular special interest entities. I call McCain-Feingold the Give-\nthe-money-to-Grover bill; that is, Grover Norquist and\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\nall of that crowd. So we take all the contributions from soft money and \nthe parties have the duty and the responsibility of running elections. \nNow we are giving it to corporate America, and corporate America and \nthe hard money will be there. This will end, I say, the Democratic \nParty down in my backyard. It will not even have a chance on that \nscore.\n  So I believe we ought to have public financing, where we can get away \nfrom this corruption that the Enron case has brought to the fore.\n  Back to the point, remember, we do not have a surplus. It is a \ndeficit and debt. Is there any way better to emphasize how we got this \nway than a Wall Street Journal of August 16 2001, almost a month before \n9-11?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Wall Street Journal article \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Nasdaq Companies' Losses Erase 5 Years of Profit\n\n                           (By Steve Liesman)\n\n       Mounting losses have wiped out all the corporate profits \n     from the technology stock boom of the late 1990s, which could \n     make the road back to the previous level of profitability \n     longer and harder than previously estimated.\n       The massive losses reported over the most recent four \n     quarters by companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market have \n     erased five years' worth of profits, according to figures \n     from investment-research company Multex.com that were \n     analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.\n       Put another way, the companies currently listed on the \n     market that symbolized the New Economy haven't made a \n     collective dime since the fall of 1995, when Intel introduced \n     the 200-megahertz computer chip, Bill Clinton was in his \n     first term in office and the O.J. Simpson trial obsessed the \n     nation. ``What it means is that with the benefit of \n     hindsight, the late '90s never happened,'' says Robert \n     Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Co.\n       The Wall Street Journal analysis looked at earnings \n     excluding extraordinary items going back to September 1995 \n     for about 4,200 companies listed on Nasdaq, which is heavily \n     weighted toward technology stocks but also includes hundreds \n     of financial and other growth companies. For the most \n     recently reported four quarters, those companies tallied \n     $148.3 billion in losses. That roughly equaled the $145.3 \n     billion in profit before extraordinary items these companies \n     have reported since September 1995. Because companies have \n     different quarter ending dates, the analysis doesn't entirely \n     correspond to calendar quarters.\n       Large charges that aren't considered extraordinary items \n     were responsible for much of the red ink, including \n     restructuring expenses and huge write-downs of inventories \n     and assets acquired at high prices during the technology \n     bubble.\n       Analysts, economists and accountants say these losses raise \n     significant doubts about both the quality of past reported \n     earnings and the potential future profit growth for these \n     companies. Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at \n     Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said the losses raise the question \n     of ``whether the Nasdaq is still too expensive. These \n     companies aren't going to give us the kind of awesome \n     performance they did in the '90s, because a lot of it wasn't \n     really sustainable.''\n       The Nasdaq Composite Index stood at around 1043 in \n     September 1995, soared to 5048.62 in March 2000 and now \n     stands at 1918.89. Because companies in the Nasdaq Composite \n     Index now have a cumulative loss, for the first time in \n     memory the Nasdaq's value can't be gauged using the popular \n     price-earnings ratio, which divides the price of stocks by \n     their earnings. That means it is impossible to say whether \n     the market is cheap or expensive in historical terms.\n       The extent of the losses surprised a senior Nasdaq \n     official, who asked not to be named. ``I wouldn't have \n     thought they were that high,'' he said.\n       Nasdaq spokesman Andrew MacMillan, while not disputing the \n     losses, pointed to the $1.5 trillion in revenue Nasdaq \n     companies generated over the past year, saying that \n     represented ``a huge contribution to the economy, to \n     productivity, and to people's lives . . . regardless of \n     what's happening to the bottom line during a rough business \n     cycle.''\n       Staya Pradhuman, director of small-capitalization research \n     at Merrill Lynch, says the recent massive losses tell a story \n     of a market where investors became focused on revenue instead \n     of earnings. With billions of dollars in financing chasing \n     every glimmer of an Internet idea, Mr. Pradhuman says, a lot \n     of companies came to market long before they were ready.\n       ``The underwriting was very aggressive, so earlier-stage \n     companies came to market than the kind of companies that came \n     to market five or 10 years ago,'' he adds. He believes there \n     is plenty of potential profitability out there in this crop \n     of young companies. But, he notes, ``only among those that \n     survive.''\n       The data show that the very companies whose technology \n     produces were supposed to boost productivity and help smooth \n     out the business cycle by providing better information have \n     been among the hardest-hit in this economic slowdown. \n     ``Management got caught up with how smart they were and \n     completely forgot about the business cycle and competition,'' \n     says Mr. Yardeni. ``They were managed for only ongoing \n     success.''\n       to be sure, some of Nasdaq's largest star-powered companies \n     earned substantial sums over the period. Intel led the pack \n     with $37.6 billion in profit before extraordinary items since \n     September 1995, followed closely by Microsoft's $34.6 billion \n     in earnings. Together, the 20 most profitable companies \n     earned $153.3 billion, compared with losses of $140.9 billion \n     for the 20 least profitable. Included in the losses was a \n     $44.8 billion write-down of acquisitions by JDS Uniphase and \n     an $11.2 billion charge by VeriSign, also to reduce the value \n     on its book of companies it had bought with its high-price \n     stock.\n       These charges lead some analysts and economists to believe \n     that including these losses overstates the magnitude of the \n     decline. According to generally accepted accounting \n     principles, these write-offs are treated as regular expenses. \n     But corporate executives say they should be treated as one-\n     time items. ``It's an accounting entry rather than a true \n     loss,'' maintains Bill Dudley, chief U.S. economist at \n     Goldman Sachs Group.\n       Removing these unusual charges, the losses over the most \n     recently reported four quarters shrink to $6.5 billion on a \n     before-tax basis. By writing down the value of assets, \n     companies have used the slowdown to clean up their balance \n     sheets, a move that should allow them to move forward with a \n     smaller expense base and could pump up future earnings.\n       ``It sets the table for future dramatic growth,'' says \n     independent accounting analyst Jack Ciesielski. Because of \n     the write-downs, ``when the natural cycle begins again, the \n     returns on assets and returns on equity will look \n     fantastic.'' But Mr. Ciesielski adds that this benefit will \n     be short-lived.\n       Cisco Systems in the first quarter took a $2.25 billion \n     pretax inventory charge. This quarter, it partly reversed \n     that write-down, taking a gain of $187 million form the \n     revaluation of the previously written-down inventory. The \n     reversal pushed Cisco into the black.\n       But Mr. Barbera warns that investors shouldn't be so quick \n     to ignore the unusual charges. For example, during good times \n     it wasn't unusual for companies to book large gains from \n     investments in other companies. Now that the value of those \n     investments are under water, companies are calling the losses \n     unusual. ``If they are going to exclude the unusual losses, \n     then they should exclude the unusual gains,'' says Mr. \n     Barbera.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote a couple of lines:\n\n       The Wall Street Journal analysis looked at earnings \n     excluding extraordinary items going back to September 1995 \n     for about 4,200 companies listed on NASDAQ, which is heavily \n     weighted toward technology stocks but also includes hundreds \n     of financial and other growth companies. For the most \n     recently reported four quarters--that is since January 1 of \n     2000--those companies tallied $148.3 billion in losses. This \n     figure roughly equaled the $145.3 billion in profits before \n     extraordinary items these companies reported since September \n     1995. It was as if the last 5 years never happened, and now \n     they want to tell me it was because of 9-11. Come on.\n\n  It is the same thing with the government. Do you mean to tell me that \nthe $143.4 billion deficit for 2001 was incurred from September 11 \nuntil September 30? The Government did not spend $143.4 billion in 20-\nsome days. No. No. It was going down on account of tax cuts. We did not \nhave a surplus. It was a deficit. We were operating in the red, and \nmore than anything else we were operating just like Enron. Who is \nhiding debt? We are.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S158-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S158-S161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOPE FOR CHILDREN ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Bennett, I \nhave sent this amendment to the desk. This is an amendment to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The amendment we offer today would add a provision that is much \nneeded for any economic stimulus bill--a temporary enhanced net \noperating loss carryback provision. Simply stated, this amendment would \nhelp distressed American companies, including a number of them in my \nhome State of Utah, deal with losses they have been experiencing as a \nresult of the terrorist attacks and as a result of the economic \nslowdown. And it will help those employees who are going to lose their \njobs unless we help these distressed companies.\n  Over the past months, as both Houses of Congress have worked toward \ndeveloping various legislative packages to stimulate the economy, there \nis one provision that has been common to practically every plan--a \nprovision to enhance the net operating loss carryback to make it more \nbeneficial to distressed companies and their employees.\n  This provision was in both of the House-passed stimulus plans, it was \nin the Democratic plan passed out by the Finance Committee last \nNovember, and it was in the compromise plan developed by the Senate \nCentrists. In short, the concept of temporarily increasing the \ncarryback period for net operating losses to get quick relief to \ncorporations that have paid taxes in recent years but are now losing \nmoney is one that is widely supported on both sides of the aisle. It is \nsupported because it helps these distressed companies and their \nemployees, who are likely to lose their jobs if we do not do something.\n  There are two major differences--which we consider improvements--\nbetween the net operating loss amendment we are offering today and the \nprovision that is included in all the other economic stimulus plans. \nThe first difference is in the length of time that the net operating \nloss can be carried back to previous years. This period is 5 years in \nthe other stimulus bills, compared with a 2-year carryback period \nallowed by current law.\n  Our amendment would go further and allow a 7-year net operating loss \ncarryback. This is important for distressed companies with large losses \nor that have been losing money for several years because of the \neconomic slowdown and various other matters that are beyond their \ncontrol. Companies such as these often have no taxable income within \nthe past 5 years to which they can reach back and offset losses. For \nthese companies, a 5-year carryback simply provides no relief. Allowing \nthem to go back 7 years offers them a better chance to immediately \noffset these losses and get the quick relief they need.\n  The second difference between this amendment and the other net \noperating loss provisions is that, for the 6th and 7th years of the \ncarryback period, our provision includes a $50 million cap per company \nper year on how much net operating loss can be carried back.\n  In other words, the amendment limits the amount of immediate tax \nrefund that a distressed company is able to get from going back beyond \n5 years to $50 million. This limitation both keeps the estimated \nrevenue loss of this provision down to a reasonable level and also \neliminates the suggestion that these companies might be getting a \nwindfall in refunds from these earlier years.\n  A few commentators have argued that a net operating loss relief \nprovision does not belong in an economic stimulus bill. I strongly \ndisagree. Companies that are losing money face some very hard choices. \nOne option that is a very difficult one, but one that is being turned \nto more and more as the economic slowdown continues, is that of laying \noff workers.\n  Such layoffs, of course, are devastating to the families involved and \nto our entire economy. One reason for this is these displaced workers \nbegin to slow down their consumer spending in order to conserve their \nmoney. Moreover, layoffs have the effect of lowering the confidence of \nother consumers who become worried that their jobs could also be lost.\n  One of the best ways to prevent layoffs, in my view, would be to help \ndistressed companies that are experiencing losses through an enhanced \nnet operating loss carryback provision. By allowing these companies to \nget immediate refunds of their previously paid taxes can keep some of \nthese businesses viable, so they do not need to turn to layoffs for \nrelief. Extra cash in the form of tax refunds can help these companies \nride out the recession storm.\n  The Internal Revenue Code has long included provisions allowing \ntaxpayers to offset losses with gains in other tax years. This is only \nfair because the designation of the tax year, whether a calendar year \nor a fiscal year, as the proper measurement period for computing tax \nliability is purely arbitrary.\n  Many companies have business cycles that exceed a year in length, and \nsome have shorter cycles. Any kind of limit we place on the ability of \nbusinesses to carry back or carry forward the loss they might incur in \n1 year to another year where taxes were paid artificially reduces the \nfairness of the tax system.\n  Because of the realities of administering the tax system, it is \nobvious that we must have some kind of limits on the number of years to \nwhich we can carry the losses, but there is nothing magical about the \ncurrent law limitation of 2 years for carrybacks and 20 years for \ncarryforwards. Indeed, the carryback period was 3 years until the 1997 \ntax act shortened it to 2 years. Thus, if we can increase fairness and \nhelp distressed companies by allowing them to carry tax losses back 7 \nyears, rather than 2, we certainly ought to do so.\n  This amendment does not add a permanent extended net operating loss \nprovision carryback period to the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, it is \ndesigned to help alleviate losses incurred\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\nby taxpayers only in tax years that end in 2000, 2001, and 2002. After \nthis period, the carryback period would revert to the 2 years now in \nthe law.\n  I might add, that the revenue effects of timing changes such as these \nare relatively short-term. For example, the estimated loss to the \nTreasury for the 5-year net operating loss provision passed by the \nHouse in December was about $1.6 billion. However, the 10 year loss was \nestimated to be only $271 million. This is because most of the loss \nreverses itself within the 10-year budget window. While the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has not yet estimated the cost of the 7-year \ncarryback provision in this amendment, it is also likely to be largely \nreversed within 10 years.\n  In conclusion, this is a common-sense amendment that adds a provision \nthat is in every other economic stimulus plan, and that has support \nfrom both sides of the aisle. If we want to help distressed companies \navoid the layoff option, this is an excellent place to start. In \naddition, this amendment would increase tax equity. I urge all of our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  It is in the best interests of the distressed companies, those \ncompanies that have had a difficult time over the last number of years. \nIt is in the best interests of the employees of those companies because \nthose employees will stand a much better chance of not being laid off. \nThird, it is in the best interests of everyone because it will \nstimulate the economy.\n  This is a good amendment. I hope our colleagues will support it. I \nhope it will win by an overwhelming margin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside and I be permitted to speak in favor of amendment No. 2717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2717\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have always been a very strong \nsupporter of small business, the engine of our economy. According to \nthe Small Business Administration, it is our smaller firms that account \nfor three-quarters of our Nation's economic growth and almost all of \nthe net new jobs that are created. These are good jobs, jobs that make \nour communities strong. Indeed, small businesses are often the last to \nlay off employees because the employees tend to be their neighbors, \ntheir family members, and their friends. They will go to great lengths \nto try to retain employees while a larger corporation might cut without \nmuch thought.\n  More than 95 percent of all the businesses in the United States are \nconsidered small businesses. Yet the economic recovery plan put forth \nby the distinguished majority leader does not assist this critical \nsector of our economy.\n  I support much of what is in Senator Daschle's package. For example, \nI have long proposed extending unemployment compensation to help those \nworkers who have exhausted their State unemployment benefits yet have \nbeen unable to find new work because of the poor economy. I also \nsupport the provisions in Senator Daschle's plan to have stimulus \nchecks go to those taxpayers and other citizens who did not receive \nrebate checks last summer and fall.\n  While I support much of what is in the majority leader's package, it \ndoes virtually nothing for small businesses. I think that is a serious \nmistake because if we can get the small business sector booming again, \nwe will increase employment and stimulate our economy. That is why I \nhave offered, with my good friend from Missouri, Senator Bond, the \nranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, an amendment \nthat gives small businesses the boost they need to grow, to create new \njobs, and to energize our sluggish economy. I included a very similar \nprovision as part of an economic recovery bill I introduced on October \n4.\n  I ask unanimous consent two more cosponsors be added to the Bond-\nCollins amendment, Senator Bennett and Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our amendment is as straightforward as it \nis effective. Under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, a small \nbusiness can deduct up to $24,000 of the cost of qualifying property \nplaced in service in any given year. The deduction is phased out for \ntaxpayers that invest more than $200,000 per year in qualifying \nproperty. For the rest of this year and for all of next year, the Bond-\nCollins amendment permitted small businesses to expense up to $40,000 \nin new equipment purchases per year. So the limit would go from $24,000 \nto $40,000. It would also increase the total investment limit from \n$200,000 to $325,000.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to encourage small businesses to make \nimportant investments that create jobs. It would allow them to write \noff more of their new equipment purchases immediately. Many small \nbusinesses have put on hold investments in equipment that they were \nplanning to make in the wake of the September 11 attacks and because of \nthe poor economy. This tax incentive would help encourage them to go \nahead with these critical investments.\n\n  Direct expensing allows small businesses to also avoid the \ncomplicated rules of depreciation as well as the unrealistic recovery \nperiods for many assets. For example, under current law a computer must \nbe depreciated over 5 years, even though we all know from the \nexperience in our offices that the useful life of most computers is 2 \nto 3 years.\n  Our amendment would also help to address a critical need of small \nbusinesses to access more capital. As the Small Business Administration \nhas noted:\n\n       Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be \n     America's greatest economic policy challenge for small \n     business in [this] century.\n\n  As our economy has slid into recession, capital has become \nincreasingly scarce for smaller companies. Indeed, venture capital \ninvestment in the third quarter of 2001--which is the latest data \navailable--represents a 31-percent decline from the previous quarter \nand a 73-percent decline from just 1 year ago. So our small businesses \nare having great difficulty in accessing the capital they need. \nMoreover, the capital gap disproportionately affects minority-owned and \nwomen-owned businesses.\n  By raising the section 179 expensing limit by two-thirds, our \namendment will, in effect, free up more capital for small businesses to \npurchase more equipment. These purchases in turn will stimulate other \nindustries that produce that new equipment.\n  As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has pointed out, enacting \ntemporary expensing provisions would have the ``most immediate impact'' \non our economy of all the provisions and proposals that have been \nadvanced. It is the right medicine and it is the right tonic for our \neconomy today.\n  I have spoken with entrepreneurs in my home State of Maine about what \nthe impact would be on their particular business if we were to increase \nthe expensing allowance. They have told me, without exception, that our \namendment is needed and that it will help to stimulate our sluggish \neconomy. Let me give an example by quoting Terry Skillins of Skillins' \nGreenhouses, a fourth-generation Maine family business founded in 1885. \nSkillins' employs between 70 and 120 employees, depending upon the \nseason, in its landscaping, greenhouse, and floral businesses. Terry \ntold me that Skillins' is looking to expand but that to do so is \nexpensive. It takes money. From tractors to conveyor belts to machines \nthat fill flowerpots automatically, the equipment that Skillins' needs \nto expand is expensive. Terry says raising the small business expensing \nlimit to $40,000 would help his company a lot.\n  He told me something else that I think is very important and telling. \nTerry said that it is very important for the increased expensing to \nlast through next year. He told me it often takes more than 1 year for \na small business to carry out an expansion plan and if the increased \nexpensing were available for 2 years, his ability to grow his business, \nSkillins' Greenhouses, would be far greater.\n  I think we should heed Terry's advice and help our small businesses, \njust as they will help drive our economy back to prosperity.\n  We also must not lose sight of the human side to this amendment. As \nMark Carpentier, the owner of a small media business in Portland, ME, \nrecently told me, increasing the expensing limit will provide his \nbusiness with\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nmore cash, cash he could use to hire another employee, to pay his \nemployees more, or to purchase them better health insurance--a major \nproblem for many small businesses as premiums continue to soar.\n\n  It seems to me that a true consensus package, a package that is going \nto make a real difference to our economic recovery, should and must \ninclude a provision like the Bond-Collins amendment to help small \nbusinesses pull through these difficult times and to give them the \nboost they need so they can be, once again, the engine of our economy.\n  Indeed, an increase in the small business expensing limit is a \nprovision that is common to pretty much every economic recovery package \nother than the one advanced by the majority leader. Increased small \nbusiness expensing was included in both the economic recovery packages \nthat passed the House, the Centrist Coalition proposal--which I, along \nwith my colleague from Maine, with Senator Voinovich, and three of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle joined together to draft--and \nthe Senate Finance Committee bill which was reported with unanimous \nDemocratic support in committee.\n  The help that our amendment would provide comes at a relatively \nmodest cost to the Treasury. It is needed by small businesses across \nthe Nation. I believe it would make a real difference.\n  A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, our \nNation's largest small business advocacy group, showed that the \nSeptember 11 attacks and the economic downturn have significantly \ndamaged small business economic activity. According to the NFIB's \nmembers, 34 percent of those responding reported that their sales are \nlower since September 11; 13 percent reported that business investment \nplans had been postponed or canceled altogether.\n  The Senate, tomorrow, will have the opportunity to put the investment \nplans of our Nation's small businesses back on track. This is a modest \nstep we can take, but it is a step that will make a real difference to \nour small businesses and to the millions of employees for whom they \nprovide good jobs. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which \nthe NFIB considers to be a key one in favor of small business.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent a letter from the NFIB, \nendorsing the Bond-Collins amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      NFIB Key Small-Business Vote\n\n\n  small business needs help now!! Vote yes on bond-collins expensing \n                               amendment\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I urge \n     you to support Senator Kit Bond's and Senator Susan Collin's \n     amendment increasing for two years the amount of equipment \n     purchases that small businesses may expense each year from \n     the current $24,000 to $40,000.\n       Many small businesses are currently struggling to cope with \n     the recession and the events of September 11. Increasing the \n     expensing limit would provide small and growing firms with \n     the funds to make critical investments and keep their firms \n     running and growing, creating new jobs.\n       The Bond amendment will also help small business by \n     eliminating burdensome record keeping involved in \n     depreciating equipment. And it adjusts the investment limit \n     on expensing from 200,000 to $325,000.\n       Small business is the major job generator for the economy. \n     Let's give them the tools to grow, hire more employees, and \n     lead this country out of recession. Support the Bond-Collins \n     expensing amendment. Votes on or related to this amendment \n     will be an NFIB Key Small-Business Vote for the 107th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I spoke last Friday to Howard Cannon. Howard \nCannon served the State of Nevada for 24 years in the Senate. The \nreason I spoke to him on Friday was because the next day--this past \nSaturday--was his 90th birthday.\n  Howard Cannon has a great history. Howard Cannon has served his \ncountry well. For me, personally, I can remember when I was back here \nworking as a Capitol Hill police officer and he was a Senator. I was \ngoing to law school. I attended law school full time during the daytime \nand then I worked a shift at night as a Capitol Police officer. Howard \nCannon had previously been a bar examiner. To be a bar examiner in \nNevada means you are one of the best lawyers in the State. It is a very \nexclusive group of people. They actually grade the bar exams for the \npeople who take the bar to become lawyers.\n  Howard Cannon, as I reflect back, becomes even more significant to \nme. I was a young man here going to law school and working, and he was \na Senator tremendously burdened with responsibilities, but yet he took \nthe time to have me in his office on more than one occasion to help me \nprepare for the bar examination. He did that when all the other \nactivities were going on in the Senate. He wanted to make sure I \nunderstood how to prepare for a bar exam. This was done by a man who \ngraded the exams.\n\n  I pay tribute to Howard Cannon, my friend and fellow Nevadan, for all \nhe has done for me personally over the years and all he has done for \nthe State of Nevada and this country.\n  Howard Cannon is a true American hero. On January 26, as I have \nindicated--last Saturday--he turned 90 years old. His service to Nevada \nand our Nation includes a lot of things, not the least of which is 24 \nyears as a U.S. Senator.\n  During his youth, he enjoyed being a cowboy, lassoed wild horses, and \nbroke them to ride. In fact, as a boy he used one of these horses to \ndeliver newspapers to ranches in the area where he was raised.\n  Today, even though he is 90 years old, he still gets up every morning \nand goes out into his yard to take care of his favorite horse, a \npalomino named Bandit.\n  It isn't surprising that in growing up in the West, Howard Cannon, \nthe son of a rancher, was comfortable with horses. But more \nsurprisingly, he was comfortable playing the saxophone. He started a \nband called ``Howard Cannon and His Orchestra.'' He performed in small \ntowns throughout the West, and he even went on a cruise ship and played \nin Japan.\n  During law school, Howard pursued his fascination with airplanes and \ntook flying lessons. He paid for those flying lessons with earnings \nfrom his musical gigs. He became an accomplished pilot and developed a \nlifelong passion for flying.\n  I can remember on a number of occasions that he piloted airplanes in \nwhich I accompanied him around the State of Nevada while he was a \nSenator. I can remember specifically one airplane ride that I took from \nLovelock, NV, to Las Vegas with Howard Cannon flying that airplane. I \nhave many fond memories of Howard Cannon, but that certainly is one of \nthem.\n  He went into the U.S. military in 1941. He was about 10 years older \nthan most people who went into the military, as indicated by his age \nnow being 90 and the average World War II veteran is about 79. While in \nthe Army, he served in a unit of combat engineers. But later he \ntransferred to the Army Air Corps because they learned he was an \nexperienced pilot.\n  In September of 1944, Howard Cannon was the commander of a C-47 in \nwhich he was flying American paratroopers. This was before the Allied \ninvasion into Europe. His plane was brought down by enemy fire. In \nfact, it came down in Nazi-occupied Holland. He had dropped these \nparatroopers near the Arnheim Bridge. He bailed out and parachuted \nbehind enemy lines.\n  For 42 days, 6 weeks--I have heard Senator Cannon tell this story; it \nis a wonderful story--with courage and creativity and the aid of Dutch \nfarmers and underground police, he made his way out of Holland into \nAllied hands.\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\n  He had a picture on his wall in his Senate office--he now has it in \nhis home--of two boys with an apple. The reason that was so important \nis, in his getting out of Holland, he always had to find two boys \neating an apple. He, of course, would take a bite out of his apple. \nThat meant it was safe to go where he wanted to go through enemy \nterritory.\n  As a consequence of his gallantry, of evading these German soldiers--\nof course, if he had been caught he would have been executed--he was \nable to unite with American troops, and for his efforts he received a \nPurple Heart, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal \nwith two oakleaf clusters, the French Croix de Guerre with Silver Star, \nthe European Theatre Ribbon with eight Battle Stars, and a Presidential \ncitation.\n  After the war ended, Howard Cannon moved from Utah to Las Vegas where \nhe settled with his wife Dorothy and they raised their daughter Nancy \nand son Alan.\n  He served as a Las Vegas city attorney. He was a fine lawyer. He was \nelected in 1958 to the U.S. Senate. He accomplished so much for the \nState of Nevada.\n  He had a personal commitment to the U.S. military based upon his \npatriotism but also based on the fact that he had been such an \noutstanding part of the U.S. military during the Second World War.\n  When he was in the Senate, he test-flew all new aircraft before \nvoting for money to develop them. He could fly those airplanes. He \nhelped preserve Nellis Air Force Base when it was threatened with Air \nForce funding cuts and worked to make Nellis what is now the preeminent \nmilitary installation for training American fighter pilots.\n  Senator Cannon considers the impact he had on aviation, though, even \nmore significant. His support of the Airport and Airways Development \nAct, and later airline deregulation, helped make air travel what it was \nprior to September 11.\n  Howard Cannon's contributions enabled Nevada to attract more \ntravelers and become the tourist capital of the world, one of the most \npopular destination resort areas in the world. He helped expand our \nNation's transportation system. He served as chairman of the Senate \nRules Committee. We were very proud of Howard Cannon at that time. And, \nof course, later he served as chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n  He contributed so much for the State of Nevada, not the least of \nwhich was his farsightedness in providing money through the Congress \nfor the Southern Nevada Water Project that has allowed Las Vegas to \ngrow the way it has, drawing water out of the Colorado River. This was \njust one of his accomplishments, but he had numerous accomplishments.\n  One reason I admire Howard Cannon so much is Nevada was and is a very \nconservative State, but he was willing to take political risks to do \nthe right thing, as he demonstrated in 1964 when he voted for cloture, \nallowing the Civil Rights Act to come up for a vote. That was a very \ncourageous vote for him. He voted for the Panama Canal Treaty, also \npolitically dangerous. It hurt him, but he did it because he thought it \nwas proper.\n  Howard Cannon provides a legacy which endures. His work continues to \nhave a positive impact on the country.\n  On behalf of all the people of the State of Nevada and those people \nwho served with him in the Senate, I thank Howard Cannon for his \nservice.\n  I also want to say a word about his lovely wife.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a payroll tax holiday)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PAYROLL TAX HOLIDAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the rate of tax with respect to remuneration received \n     during the payroll tax holiday period shall be zero under \n     sections 1401(a), 3101(a), and 3111(a) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and for purposes of determining the \n     applicable percentage under section 3201(a), 3211(a)(1), and \n     3221(a) of such Code.\n       (b) Payroll Tax Holiday Period.--The term ``payroll tax \n     holiday period'' means the period beginning after February \n     28, 2002, and ending before April 1, 2002.\n       (c) Employer Notification.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall notify employers of the payroll tax holiday period in \n     any manner the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (d) Transfer of Funds.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer from the general revenues of the Federal Government \n     an amount sufficient so as to ensure that the income and \n     balances of the trust funds under section 201 of the Social \n     Security Act and the Social Security Equivalent Benefit \n     Account under section 15A of the Railroad Retirement Act of \n     1974 (45 U.S.C. 231n-1) are not reduced as a result of the \n     application of subsection (a).\n       (e) Determination of Benefits.--In making any determination \n     of benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, the \n     Commissioner of Social Security shall disregard the effect of \n     the payroll tax holiday period on any individual's earnings \n     record.\n\n  Mr. Domenici. Mr. President, I am offering this payroll tax holiday \namendment today to move this process forward. Right now, we have a \nRepublican stimulus bill that passed the House; we have the President's \nplan and the Senate Republicans' plan; we have the Senate Democrats' \nplan.\n  But we don't yet have a stimulus plan that will pass the Senate and \nbe signed by the President.\n  Let me be clear. I support the President. I think this administration \nis right on track when it comes to an economic stimulus package. \nHowever, any existing plan has to be modified to garner enough Senate \nsupport to pass.\n  The payroll tax holiday is an idea supported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Yes, I think we should have acted on a stimulus plan last October or \nNovember. I would have preferred that this payroll tax holiday had been \nin place for the December holidays.\n  But having said that, whenever implemented, a payroll tax holiday \nwill be more effective at increasing spending than the rebate checks \nsent out earlier. It will put the tax cut in paychecks automatically, \nwithout the need for special mailings.\n  This tax holiday would be in March 2002. This gives employers and \npayroll administrators time to adjust their systems for the change.\n  Psychologically, workers are used to adjusting their spending habits \nbased on the size of their paychecks. At present, workers spend about \n95 cents for every dollar of after-tax earnings. Increasing their \nafter-tax earnings will therefore lead to more spending--if they \nperceive the tax cut to be part of their regular earnings.\n  The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the various stimulus \nproposals. CBO said:\n\n       Among the options being considered for providing fiscal \n     stimulus, a payroll tax holiday could have a comparatively \n     large bang for the buck . . . bigger paychecks might induce \n     more spending than rebates would and a payroll tax holiday \n     would reach many lower income working families.\n\n  The bottom line: A payroll tax holiday is truly a stimulative, \ntemporary tax cut that is very likely to be spent.\n  Nearly all wage earners, all except those who have already reached \nthe taxable maximum of $84,700, even those who don't earn enough to pay \nincome taxes, would benefit.\n  Both the employee and employer share--6.2% each--of the Social \nSecurity--OASDI--payroll tax would be suspended. Self-employed Social \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\npayroll taxes would also be suspended. The Social Security trust fund \nwould be made whole via a transfer from the general fund.\n  Employees would have more take-home pay and employers would have \nincreased cash flow.\n  A school teacher making $40,000 would see an increase in their take-\nhome pay of $207 in May. A self-employed contractor earning $40,000 per \nyear, who pays both the employer and employee share of 12.4%, would see \nan increase in pay of $413.\n  This proposal enjoys wide support. The majority leader was ready to \ninclude it in his earlier plan. Several Senators have cosponsored the \nbill here in the Senate. I believe this proposal could provide us with \na bipartisan way to enact a stimulus bill quickly.\n  Mr. President, I didn't want to let today go by without reintroducing \nthis measure we call the ``payroll tax holiday'' amendment. The \noccupant of the chair has on a couple of occasions spoken to the \nSenator from New Mexico about this amendment. At some point in the \nhistory of the so-called stimulus, are we going to do it or are we not? \nThe distinguished Senator was a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  People are now talking about the fact that a very large surplus that \nwe were reporting at the beginning of this year, some $300 billion, has \ndisappeared for all intents and purposes and that the President \ntomorrow night is going to deliver to the American people his ideas and \nhis proposals and concepts. And, obviously, shortly thereafter he will \ncall for the budget that will be his proposals to match fiscal policy \nand tax policies with the speech he made and what he intends to do \nduring the ensuing year.\n  I remind everyone, once again, what actually happened to this surplus \nfor the year we are talking about, this year, had very little to do \nwith whether we cut or raised taxes. Some are saying to the American \npeople, the tax cut is what brought down this wonderful surplus that \nwas going to pay down our debt and we should not be cutting taxes. \nWell, the point is, we only cut $38 billion worth of taxes as a \ntemporary reduction in that surplus. The fact that we have gone down in \nterms of our economic prosperity and slowly but surely ended up with a \nrecession, a real recession--it doesn't seem as if it is going to last \ntoo long--that period of time of the American economy coming from a \nprojected growth of over 3 percent to what all of us know is currently \na negative growth, that is what took $220 billion of this surplus.\n  I know as I say this, if there are people interested in what we say, \nsome are asking, what do you mean?\n  In the U.S. Government, when we have a growing economy, an economy \nthat is projected to grow for the rest of this year at 3.4 percent, we \nhave to estimate how much in taxes is going to come into the Treasury \nof the United States based on that kind of growth. What I am saying to \nSenators and to the public is that everyone agreed we should project \nthe growth for this year at about 3.4 percent, a pretty healthy growth \nyear over year. That means the entire basic growth of the United States \nwas going to go up substantially. It turned out the estimates were \nwrong, and it came down. We lost $220 billion in the assumption with \nreference to how much money we were going to take in.\n  Let me repeat, that is about a 72-percent reduction in the surplus we \nhad expected to accumulate, just that one item. For those who wonder \nabout the effect of our tax cut, it was $28 billion compared to the 220 \nthat came from the economy plunging. It is 14 percent for the tax cut. \nThat is the reality of it.\n  I remember rather vividly that the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nwho presided over two hearings early this year, at the last one or the \nsecond-to-last hearing, did acknowledge that in terms of this year the \ntax cut had only the impact about which the Senator from New Mexico is \ntalking.\n  When we speak about a tax cut that we have already passed being too \nbig, then we have to try to look at what we are talking about. We \npassed a tax cut that came into play little by little over a full \ndecade, a little bit each year, with the biggest tax cuts coming 6, 7, \nand 8 years from now. That was already passed, but it will not take \neffect. So for those who think it is too big and that we should not \ngive the American people that kind of tax relief 6, 7, 8, 9 years from \nnow, they have plenty of time to fix it. They could fix it this year in \nthe budget, if they would like, by suggesting we increase taxes in lieu \nof the decrease we passed. They could wait until next year and say \nlet's increase taxes.\n  I don't believe we should increase taxes. Actually, the tax \nreductions we made over the next decade still leave the overall tax on \nthe American people at a high level compared to other tax years during \nthe last 30 to 40 years.\n  Let me quickly tell you about that. For 60 years, postwar, the \naverage taxes as a percentage of GDP were 18 percent. For a period of \n60 years, after the war and continuing on, the average tax take was 18 \npercent. Now even with the tax cut over the 10 years, the taxes are \ngoing to be 19 percent of the gross domestic product. They are \nprojected by CBO to rise to 20 percent of the gross domestic product \nover the next decade. In this year, it will be 19 percent. Over the \ndecade it will go up to 20.\n  How can they be higher than they have been on average for the past 60 \nyears and yet there are some who would like to increase taxes from this \nhigh level that already is imposed upon them?\n  So we ought to be talking about that for some time. But right now, \nthe President will be speaking to us tomorrow, Senators and House \nMembers. On behalf of our people, we are going to have to make a \nchoice. He is going to suggest that while there is evidence the \nAmerican economy is coming back and, as some say--perhaps Dr. Greenspan \nwould say--if he were to put nine criteria up there on the economy, he \nwould say we are now out of recession on five out of nine. So if you \nwant to weigh that, a majority of the indicators of growth, or \nnongrowth, are on the growth side.\n  We still have to ask ourselves, is it going to take too long to come \nout of this recession or should we pass a bill that would stimulate the \nAmerican economy?\n  I believe the President is going to say he would like us to join him \nin passing a stimulative tax incentive package. It is with reference \nthereto that today I ask if the Senate is going to consider passing a \ntax incentive bill, that they give serious consideration to a payroll \ntax holiday--that is, a Social Security payroll tax holiday--for all of \nthe employees of the Nation for 1 month and all of the employers of the \ncountry for 1 month, and that that month be the month of March. That is \nabout as fast as you can do it. It is also about as fast as any of the \nother taxes you are going to consider and get implemented and become \npart of the tax laws of the land, to either cause growth or restrain \ngrowth.\n  As I have said, I knew this was going to be the case when I asked for \ncosponsors, and many helped. Many have said this is probably a good way \nto get the economy going. It probably amounts to about $40 billion that \ngets back into the hands of American workers everywhere and employers, \nlarge and small, in 1 month, for they don't have to pay their half.\n  In the meantime, we also heard from various institutional analysts--\nin this case the CBO, which does a lot of analysis and upon whose \nnumbers we base our projections with reference to what is going to \nhappen when you pass tax packages. We run it through a joint committee, \nbut CBO gives their estimates, and they are pretty good. They indicated \nthat, of the taxes being contemplated, the most stimulative would be \nthis tax holiday. They base that on assumptions as to what happens when \nyou get more money in your paycheck and what happens when you get less \nin your paycheck. They have concluded that the overwhelming percentage \nof Americans will spend the money if it is reflected in their check as \na payroll check. This will not be huge for each taxpayer of America. \nBut somebody making $40,000--depending on who is working, the husband \nand wife, it could be between $200 and $400 in 1 month. That would be \nthe change in their checks.\n  If an employer has 10 such employees--you see, they don't pay--their \nhalf is the same amount. They don't pay that to the Federal Government. \nThey get it to invest or do whatever they would like, in terms of \nhelping their\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\nbusiness grow and helping them to add more employees or, as may be the \ncase, staving off having to lay someone off or, indeed, being able to \nbuy equipment they weren't going to be able to buy.\n  All of this is going to be at the disposal of businesses, large and \nsmall. It will be a very healthy dollar amount as we move through that \n1 month and the effective date that will take place, depending upon \nwhether we in the Congress decide to pass this proposal.\n  Let me repeat, for simplicity, we will call it the payroll tax \nholiday amendment. So everybody will know, it is the payroll \nwithholding for Social Security for 1 month on employers and employees \nof America. I believe I am correct in saying it is somewhere between \n$39 billion and $42 billion in that 1 month. And to the extent there is \na month that we do not put the money into the Social Security fund, we \ndo replenish it from the general tax revenues of the United States, \nwhich is the way we have done it for years when indeed we have had this \nkind of expenditure occurring.\n\n  I will repeat that when the President sends his budget here and he is \nasking that we spend more, not less, on defense--in fact, I think he \nwill ask for a 12-percent increase in defense spending. I believe on \nhomeland defense spending he is going to ask that it be doubled in \npercentages--about a 111-percent increase. Of course, it was a small \nnumber. He is going to ask that those two items across our various \nexpenditure lines be considered the highest priority and that we spend \nour money on those two. And a third is that we produce a stimulus. I \nbelieve the stimulus I am talking about here--the payroll tax holiday--\nwill ultimately, depending upon what you put with it, receive the \nsupport of the President. I believe he will sign a bill with that in \nit.\n  I think if Senators begin to pay attention to what might work, surely \nwe have to do something on unemployment compensation and we have to do \nsomething on a few other of the social programs that affect our working \nmen and women. But we are also going to do something on the tax side of \nthe ledger. I submit that this one is more apt to get us out of the \nlethargy that is currently in various parts of our economy, which \ndoesn't seem to want to move.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of this speech, the chart on \nthe CBO baseline projections of the surplus since January 2001 by \nfiscal year in the billions of dollars be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CHANGES IN CBO'S BASELINE PROJECTIONS OF THE SURPLUS SINCE JANUARY 2001\n                [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Total             % 2002-\n                                     2002   2002-2011  % 2002     2011\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Surplus as Projected in          313      5,610  ......  .........\n January 2001....................\n                                  ======================================\nChanges a\n  Legislative\n    Tax act b....................

That will be in the budget if we choose to do \nsomething on the tax side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had an agreement with the minority \nsince this bill came up that we would alternate amendments. We have \ndone that, but we have never formalized that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first-degree amendments offered with \nrespect to H.R. 622, the economic recovery/stimulus measure, be offered \nand considered in an alternating fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That being the case, there would be two Democratic \namendments next in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Baucus and Senator \nDaschle for their leadership and their determination on this important \nissue of the ever-deepening recession of the United States and the fact \nthat so many people are out of work. They have consistently returned \ntime and time again to make sure we commit to the real needs of the \npeople in this country.\n  But in our slowing economy, States are already facing a serious \nbudget crunch, forcing some of our State leaders to make tough \ndecisions. In fact, the recession would force Iowa to cut $18 million \nfrom its State Medicaid budget, funds that would have brought an \nadditional $32 million in Federal money to our State.\n  All of us, when we are talking about a stimulus, have to think about \nwhat is happening in the State budgets. I know the occupant of the \nchair is the former Governor of the distinguished State of Delaware and \nhe knows, as well as others, that when recessions go up and \nunemployment goes up, the impact on the State budgets to meet their \nrequirement for Medicaid increases dramatically.\n  What happens is, as these rolls grow, then there is more of a demand \non the State moneys. For example, there are already 240,000 Iowans on \nMedicaid, about 15 percent more than what the State expected to serve \nthis year. The same providers who are facing the cuts will also be \ncalled upon to serve a growing number of people. When the providers are \ncut, the patients they serve feel it.\n  As we look at what is going on in the country today, we cannot allow \nMedicaid recipients, some of the most vulnerable people in our country, \nthe most vulnerable of my constituents in Iowa, to fall through the \ncracks. But unless Iowa and other States get help, they will have to \neither make deeper provider cuts take effect, make eligibility \nrequirements tougher, or cut benefits, all of which are going to impact \nthe most vulnerable people in our society.\n  One provision in the stimulus bill is of particular importance to my \nState of Iowa, and I would say all States across the country. This \nprovision will give States critical assistance in meeting their \nMedicaid responsibilities by increasing the Federal match for Medicaid, \nthe FMAP, for 1 year.\n  Under the Daschle amendment, every State would get a 1.5-percent \nincrease in their 2002 FMAP. I do not know what it will mean to all the \nStates, but I do know it will mean an additional $30 million to the \nState of Iowa.\n  Again, while what is in the underlying bill is an important first \nstep, we must remember it was developed when State-projected deficits \nwere estimated to be a lot lower than they are today.\n  On October 31 of last year, the National Association of State Budget \nOfficers predicted a $15 billion shortfall for the States for 2002. On \nOctober 31, there was a $15 billion estimated shortfall in our State \nbudgets. Six weeks later, on December 19, they updated that to a $38 \nbillion shortfall in our State budgets. We all know when we talk about \nState budget deficits, we are talking in large part about their \nMedicaid budgets. In many States, that is the largest part.\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\n  Because most States are required by their constitutions to balance \ntheir budgets every year, they have to look to Medicaid for cost \nsavings.\n  Without adequate State fiscal relief through a temporary increase in \nthe FMAP, the Federal Medicaid matching rate, these cuts are likely to \nbe approved. It could be even worse as the deficits worsen further.\n  To help States avert these otherwise unavoidable cuts, I have offered \nan amendment which is in the lineup for tomorrow that will increase the \nFederal Government's match of State Medicaid spending by 3 percent \ninstead of the 1.5 percent that is in the underlying amendment for the \nnext fiscal year.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, all States will receive an enhanced \n3-percent increase on their FMAP. Also, the States that have high \nunemployment rates will still get their 1.5-percent bonus and all \nStates will still be held harmless.\n  Basically, my amendment takes the underlying 1.5 percent and makes it \n3 percent in terms of the Federal match for Medicaid.\n  It will provide about $3.5 billion more to the States than the \npending legislation and over $7.5 billion more than the House-passed \nplan to help offset the impending State Medicaid cuts for providers and \nbeneficiaries.\n  Again, State fiscal relief is one of the best ways to stimulate the \neconomy because Federal dollars used for this purpose help avert the \nState budget cuts and the tax increases that can be detrimental to any \neconomic recovery.\n\n  The people in Iowa and all across the Nation have enough trouble \nfinding affordable quality health care. They need our help and support \nduring this recession. When it comes to protecting the vulnerable in \nthese difficult times while getting our economy back on track, putting \nIowans and all Americans back to work, this proposal to increase the \nFMAP, the Federal match on Medicaid, is right on the mark.\n  This amendment will be up tomorrow for a vote. I hope it will get \noverwhelming support because, again, we cannot afford to let the most \nvulnerable in our society fall through the cracks, and we have to \nrecognize that States are facing over a doubling of the initial \nestimate of what their State shortfalls would be in their budgets for \nthis next fiscal year.\n  Looking at all that, we need to make sure we increase the Federal \nshare. For a small amount of money we put into it, considering the \nnationwide impact, the multiple effect it will have on our economy will \nbe tremendous, especially as it affects those State budgets.\n  Again, I commend Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus for the \nunderlying amendment. If we had voted on this last year, perhaps 1.5 \npercent might have been sufficient with what we knew then. But with \nwhat we know now, 1.5 percent is not sufficient. I believe this \namendment I have offered to double that from 1.5 percent to 3 percent \nwill make it so that the States will not have to cut their Medicaid \nbudgets this year.\n  I hope we can adopt this amendment. I hope we can get the stimulus \nbill passed and get increased unemployment benefits out there, health \ncare benefits, and help our States with their Medicaid budgets. This \nwill do more to stimulate the economy than anything else we are doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow evening President Bush will be \ngiving his State of the Union speech. He will undoubtedly review the \nactions of the past year and talk about his plans for this current \nyear. It seems to me appropriate to focus a little bit on what I \nbelieve is one of the most important decisions he made in the last year \nand to reflect a little bit upon what that decision will mean for the \nUnited States in the years to come. It was made at a time when Congress \nwas not in session and the country, frankly, was primarily thinking \nabout the Christmas season. There was not a lot of media attention paid \nto the decision.\n  For reasons I will discuss in some subsequent speeches, it seems to \nme one of the most fundamental and important decisions of any President \nin recent years and certainly of President Bush during his first term. \nI refer to his decision on behalf of the United States to give notice \nto Russia of the withdrawal of the United States from the 1972 ABM \nTreaty. As I said, I am going to discuss different aspects of this \ndecision in some subsequent remarks.\n  For example, I will discuss the President's legal authority to \nwithdraw. Some have suggested action by the Senate should take place or \nthat somehow the President doesn't necessarily have the authority to \nwithdraw from the treaty. That is not true; he does. I will be \ndiscussing that. I also want to address in subsequent remarks how I \nthink this decision changes the geopolitical relationships and, \nfrankly, reflects a 21st century view of the world, especially the \nrelationship between the United States on one hand and Russia on the \nother hand, a view far different from that of the adversarial cold war \nrelationship between the two superpowers, and how this ABM decision is \nprobably the most dramatic recognition of that new relationship.\n  I will discuss what that means both in terms of the relationship \nbetween the two countries in the future but also what it means in terms \nof a change in the direction of the philosophy of this country with \nrespect to national security issues, especially how it relates to the \nquestion of how we protect ourselves. Is it through a combination of \nideas that are premised on peace through strength, going back to the \nReagan days, or more of a focus on arms control agreements, reflecting \nmore of the Clinton administration view?\n  Clearly, the Bush administration has decided defending the United \nStates depends first and foremost upon our ability to defend ourselves \nthrough missile defense, for example, and less on arms control \nagreements. I will be discussing what I think are the important \nramifications of that decision.\n  Today, I will first of all commend the President for his decision, \nmade on December 13 of last year, of the intent to withdraw from the \nABM Treaty and, secondly, discuss the reasons I believe this was the \nright decision for the President to make. Let me note those two reasons \nin summary.\n  It is highly questionable whether the ABM Treaty ever served U.S. \ninterests. It did not stop an arms race, its purpose, as proponents \nclaims. It was the product of a bipolar international structure, as I \nsaid before, that no longer exists and no longer reflects the \nrelationship we should have with Russia as a result. It remains a \nserious obstacle to U.S. ability to defend itself against the long-\nrange threat of ballistic missiles. The President's decision was a \nnecessary step forward in addressing that threat. The future national \nsecurity of the United States requires the construction of ballistic \nmissile defenses that were flatly prohibited by the treaty.\n\n  Let me discuss those items in turn. First, with respect to the \npurpose of the treaty, the premise of the ABM Treaty back in 1972 was \nthat if neither the United States nor the Soviet Union took steps to \nprotect itself against a devastating nuclear strike, then both nations \nwould feel confident in their ability to retaliate against each other, \nsecure in the knowledge that each possessed that capability, and \nneither would find it necessary to increase the size of their nuclear \narsenals. An accompanying agreement, SALT I, was intended to limit the \nsize and shape of the arsenals in order to enhance strategic stability.\n  Proponents of the ABM Treaty--and their numbers are many --have for \nthe 30 years or so since the treaty's ratification considered it the \ncornerstone of strategic stability. They view the treaty not just as \nthe guiding document in United States-Soviet and now United\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\nStates-Russian relations but as the principal constraint on all \ncountries considering developing missile forces with which to threaten \nneighbors and argue that the absence unleashes a destabilizing arms \nbuildup around the world, including in Russia.\n  Well, what of this?\n  The central premise of the ABM Treaty, that the United States and \nSoviet nuclear arsenals would be restrained by the absence of missile \ndefenses, is refuted through the simplest quantitative analysis. In the \n15 years since the treaty's ratification, the number of strategic \nballistic missile warheads in the inventory of the Soviet Union grew \nfrom around 2,000 to 10,000. The U.S. level grew from around 3,700 in \n1972 to about 8,000 in 1987. In fact, strategic nuclear forces expanded \nnot just quantitatively but qualitatively as well. The decade following \nthe ABM Treaty signing witnessed introduction into the Soviet arsenal \nof entire generations of new long-range missiles, not just in \ncontradiction to the intent of the ABM Treaty but in contravention of \nthe accompanying SALT I accord as well.\n  The post-cold-war picture similarly argues against the treaty's \neffectiveness at restraining offensive forces. China has been \nexceedingly belligerent in its use of warlike rhetoric targeted against \nthe concept of a regional missile defense plan encompassing the island \nof Taiwan. Yet in the absence of missile defenses, it has been \ndeploying missiles opposite Taiwan at the rate of 50 a year. China made \nthe decision and embarked on a modernization of its long-range missile \nforce targeted against the United States long before the United States \nmade a decision to deploy missile defense systems.\n  Similarly, India and Pakistan missile developments which, combined \nwith each country's nuclear weapons programs, create the most dangerous \nregion on Earth right now, occur without reference to missile defenses. \nAnd of course missile programs of countries such as Iran, Iraq, and \nNorth Korea have been restrained at times by technological factors but \nnever by the presence of missile defenses in countries they might \ntarget.\n  The point is that missile forces are not a response to missile \ndefenses. They are the result of national perceptions of threat and \npolitical and military requirements. As the new National Intelligence \nEstimate on foreign ballistic missiles states:\n\n       The ballistic missile remains a central element in the \n     military arsenals of nations around the globe and almost \n     certainly will retain this status over the next 15 years.\n\n  In other words, ballistic missiles are not being built as a result of \nmissile defenses being built. Those missile forces are already \noccurring, are already being built, and it is the defenses which now \nneed to restrain them.\n  Another point: The bipolar world structure that I referred to no \nlonger exists. The problem of proliferation here has to be addressed.\n  The ABM Treaty was negotiated between two countries, one of which no \nlonger exists. At its signing, little consideration was given to a \npost-Cold War world. The developments of the late 1980s and early 1990s \nwere simply not foreseen. Nuclear and missile proliferation, while \ncertainly acknowledged as issues, took a backseat in the two \nsuperpowers' thinking to direct bipolar considerations back in 1972.\n  Proliferation is today, however, one of our principal national \nsecurity challenges. Roughly two dozen countries have or are developing \nballistic missiles. These weapons have also become a common feature of \nmodern warfare. Used but once between 1945 and 1980, thousands of \nballistic missiles have been fired in at least six conflicts since \n1980, and their range and sophistication are growing. In fact, despite \nthe promised reductions in Russian strategic forces, the threat from \nother countries seeking to target the United States with long-range \nmissiles has grown since the end of the Cold War.\n  Let me give some examples of this trend:\n  China is actively modernizing and expanding its long-range missile \nforce. The newly released National Intelligence Estimate states that, \nby 2015, ``the total number of Chinese strategic warheads will rise \nseveral-fold.''\n  Despite difficulties it has experienced in developing its Shahab-3 \nmedium-range missile--and it should be pointed out that all countries, \nincluding the United States, experience developmental problems with new \nmissile programs--Iran continues to place much emphasis on its missile \nactivities. With considerable Russian assistance, it is developing \nmissiles capable of striking Central Europe. The new NIE concludes that \n``Teheran's longstanding commitment to its ballistic missile programs . \n. . is unlikely to diminish.''\n  Iraq is believed to covertly possess a stockpile of banned missiles. \nWhile Iraq's missile programs have been constrained by sanctions in \neffect since the Persian Gulf War, the gradual but steady erosion of \nthose sanctions could result in its being able to reconstitute its \nlong-range missile programs. Iraq's ability to surprise us in the past \nwith the scale of its missile and nuclear, chemical and biological \nprograms should serve as a warning of what can happen should the \nsanctions regime collapse completely.\n  North Korea has extended its moratorium on testing its \nintercontinental-range Taepo-dong missiles, but its surprise August \n1998 test flight over Japan of one such missile should similarly temper \nany enthusiasm about that regime's capabilities and intentions. The \nNational Intelligence Estimate pointed out that North Korea has not \nabandoned the the Taepo-dong 2, and that it could reappear ``as a \n[space-launch vehicle] with a third stage to place a small payload into \nthe same orbit the North Koreans tried to achieve in 1998.''\n\n  If the National Intelligence Estimate is nebulous in its description \nof the threat to the continental United States of long-range ballistic \nmissiles, it is emphatic in its description of the threat from shorter-\nrange missiles:\n\n       The probability that a missile with a weapon of mass \n     destruction will be used against U.S. forces or interests is \n     higher today than during most of the Cold War, and it will \n     continue to grow as the capabilities of potential adversaries \n     mature . . . (T)he missile threat will continue to grow, in \n     part because missiles have become important regional weapons \n     in the arsenals of numerous countries. Moreover, missiles \n     provide a level of prestige, coercive diplomacy, and \n     deterrence that nonmissile means do not.\n\n  What this tells us is that missiles remain an extremely important \ncomponent of the arsenals of the very regimes that represent our \ngreatest foreign policy challenges. Yet, the NIE suggests that the \nthreat from medium-range missiles is not likely to be matched by a \ncommensurate threat from long-range missiles in the next 15 years, in \nspite of the fact that the very same arguments for medium-range \nmissiles exists in the case of longer-range ones.\n  Fortunately, we have today a Secretary of Defense who understands \nintimately the weaknesses of intelligence estimates that seek to \npredict foreign technological developments. As chairman of the \nbipartisan Rumsfeld Commission, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld led an \neffort to assess the threat of foreign ballistic missiles and the \nability of the intelligence community to accurately estimate the scale \nof that threat. The commission's unanimous conclusion was that the \nmissile threat to the United States ``is broader, more mature and \nevolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports \nby the intelligence community,'' and a rogue nation could acquire the \ncapability to strike the United States with a ballistic missile in as \nlittle as 5 years.\n  That analysis was accepted by the Congress, by the President, and by \na majority of the intelligence community. The Rumsfeld Commission \nturned out to be more prescient than anybody anticipated. Within months \nof the completion of its report, North Korea shocked the intelligence \ncommunity with its launch of the Taepo-dong.\n  Indeed, for all of its successes--and they have been both numerous \nand vital to our security--it does not disgrace the intelligence \ncommunity to point out that either it or its political overseers have, \nat times, missed important developments. A recent article in Jane's \nIntelligence Review describes the three times during the 1990s that \nNorth Korea alone surprised the United States within the realm of \nmissile programs:\n\n       The first was in 1990 with the testing of the No-dong IRBM \n     . . . The second surprise was in 1994, when aerial \n     photographs revealed mock-ups of two new two-stage ballistic \n     missiles, named Taepo-dong 1 and 2. The third surprise came \n     in August 1998 with the test launch of Taepo-dong 1. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\n\n  President Bush recognized the changed post-Cold War security \nenvironment typified by the ballistic missile programs of numerous real \nor potentially hostile countries, when he stated in his December 13 \nannouncement of his intent to withdraw the United States from the ABM \nTreaty:\n\n       . . . as the events of September the 11th made all too \n     clear, the greatest threats to both our countries come not \n     from each other, or other big powers in the world, but from \n     terrorists who strike without warning, or rogue states who \n     seek weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  The President's announcement was the culmination of a period of \nnegotiations intended to convince Russia of the need to amend or scrap \nan outdated treaty. He did this because he believes that the \nappropriate response to the threat from foreign missile programs must \ninclude defenses against those missiles, and that the ABM Treaty \nprevents the United States from developing and deploying those \ndefenses.\n  What of that latter point? Some have argued maybe we could stretch \nour research time and testing time and still not be in direct violation \nof the treaty. In fact, the previous administration sought to deal with \nthe threat of ballistic missile attack primarily by relying on treaties \nor agreements as articulated in 1994 by Under Secretary of State John \nHolum:\n\n       The Clinton Administration's policy aims to protect us \n     first and foremost through arms control--by working hard to \n     prevent new threats--and second, by legally pursuing the \n     development of theater defenses for those cases where arms \n     control is not yet successful.\n\n  Arms control, first and foremost; only secondarily by pursuing the \ndevelopment--not deployment--of theater defenses, not defenses against \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, and only in those cases where arms \ncontrol is not yet successful. That is an entirely different paradigm, \nthat we can rely upon arms control to protect the people of the United \nStates.\n  There are no arms control agreements with rogue states, and they \ndon't prevent nuclear blackmail. National Security Advisor Condoleezza \nRice noted this problem in her July 13 speech before the National Press \nClub:\n\n       We must deal with today's world and today's threats, \n     including weapons of mass destruction and missiles in the \n     hands of states that would blackmail us from coming to the \n     aid of friends and allies.\n\n  Nor do I think it is a good idea to rely principally on deterrence. \nOne problem with deterrence is that it does fail. We acknowledge that \nfact when applied regionally. We support the Israeli Arrow missile \nprogram because we know that Israel's adversaries may not be deterred \nby threat of retaliation. In fact, in the case of Saddam Hussein during \nthe Gulf War, such retaliation was invited.\n  When the subject becomes the safety of American cities, however, such \nacknowledgements disappear. The fact remains, though, that deterrence \ndoes fail, and we ought not be left with massive retaliation as the \nonly response to an attack on the United States.\n  It has always been of concern to me that we would rely on deterrence \nagainst a largely innocent population of a country headed by a tyrant. \nThe best deterrence is the ability to defeat an attack. The principal \nimpediment to our ability to develop the means to actually defend \nagainst missile attack is not technology. It is the ABM Treaty, as I \nsaid before. As the President stated in his December 13 announcement:\n\n       We must have the freedom and the flexibility to develop \n     effective defenses against those attacks. Defending the \n     American people is my highest priority as Commander in Chief, \n     and I cannot and will not allow the United States to remain \n     in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective \n     defenses.\n\n  Despite the failure of the ABM Treaty to slow the growth in nuclear \narms, it was remarkably successfully at preventing the development of \nmissile defenses. We cannot develop, let alone deploy, a national \nmissile defense system under the constraints of the ABM Treaty. That \nwas its whole purpose. But times have changed, and, as the President \nhas pointed out, the treaty has become an unacceptable restraint on our \nability to defend ourselves against the threat of ballistic missile \nattack.\n  To repeat, we cannot develop, let alone deploy, a national missile \ndefense system under the constraints of the ABM Treaty. Both its letter \nand its intent are very clear on this point. Let me just take a moment \nto explain why.\n  Article I, Section 2, states:\n\n       Each Party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems for a \n     defense of the territory of its country and not to provide a \n     base for such a defense, and not to deploy ABM systems for an \n     individual region except as provided for in Article III of \n     this treaty.\n\n  Additionally, under the terms of the treaty, specifically Article \nIII, we can only build one treaty-permissible site around either \nWashington, D.C., or around an ICBM field. The treaty prevents the \ndefense of any other part of the United States. That is why the Fort \nGreely, AK, site under the terms of the treaty, cannot be an \noperational missile defense site.\n  Critics of the President argue that the decision to withdraw from the \ntreaty is premature, and that the treaty does not really prevent the \ndevelopment of the capability to build a nationwide defense.\n  For example: The Union of Concerned Scientists concludes, on the \nbasis of its own examination of the issue, that ``there is no \ncompelling reason for the United States to withdraw from the ABM Treaty \nfor at least the next several years.'' One of our colleagues from the \nState of Florida, Senator Nelson, stated at a hearing in June:\n\n       We need, for the sake of defense of our country, to proceed \n     with robust research and development, but you can't deploy \n     something that's not developed.\n\n  The fact is, we cannot develop a nationwide system under the \nconstraints of the ABM Treaty. That was the efficacious thing about the \ntreaty: it effectively prevented the development of such a system.\n  Furthermore, we cannot even research the kind of layered defense \nnecessary to maximize the prospects of a successful intercept.\n  Article V of the treaty states:\n\n       Each Party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy ABM \n     systems or components which are sea-based, air-based, space-\n     based, or mobile land-based.\n\n  Article VI states:\n\n       Each Party undertakes not to give missiles, launchers, or \n     radars, other than ABM interceptor missiles, ABM launchers, \n     or ABM radars, capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles or their element in flight trajectory, and not to \n     test them in an ABM mode.\n\n  It is critical. That is why the Secretary of Defense was forced in \nOctober to alter the most recent missile-flight test. It would have \nviolated the treaty had we used a U.S. Navy ship to track the target \nmissile in flight--precisely, by the way, what we want to do in \ndeveloping a successful missile defense system. Because the sea-based \noption remains among the most promising for a secure, flexible missile \ntracking capability, we should be actively integrating the AEGIS system \ninto these flight tests, but under Articles V and VI of the treaty that \nis prohibited.\n  Similarly, use of a Multiple Object Tracking Radar at Vandenberg Air \nForce Base, which was going to be used to track the target missile, is \nprohibited. An administration official was quoted in the Washington \nPost as noting:\n\n       This shows that the ABM Treaty is already constraining us \n     in a very material way. These are aspects of tests that we \n     canceled, and they need to be done at some point.\n\n  Similarly, how can we exploit the capabilities that may emerge from \ndevelopment of the Airborne Laser Program, a system designed to shoot \ndown enemy missiles early in their ascent phase when they are larger \nand hotter and therefore easier to target? The Airborne Laser won't \nnecessarily know whether it is shooting at a short-range missile, or \none with intercontinental range. The former would be permissible under \nthe treaty, but not the latter.\n  In short, the treaty, as it was designed to do, prevents us from even \ndeveloping let alone deploying a national missile defense system that \nexploits the most promising technologies.\n  In conclusion, the ABM Treaty was signed in a vastly different \nstrategic environment than exists today. It can hardly be said to have \nbeen a success during the cold war, the geopolitical context in which \nit was written. Today, it serves only to prevent us from addressing the \npost-cold war challenges that confront us from a number of other \ncountries. A treaty that failed in a strictly bipolar structure to \nrestrain nuclear weapons developments, it is even more ill-suited to \nthe security environment of today's multipolar world.\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\n The President's decision to withdraw the United States from its \nprovisions should be commended. We cannot predicate the defense of the \nAmerican people on a theory of deterrence that assumes hostile regimes \nmake decisions in the same manner as do we, and that leaves us \nvulnerable to a particular type of threat we know is on the horizon.\n  We have a fundamental responsibility to the American public to defend \nit against all threats. The threat from the ballistic missile programs \nof foreign countries is real, and it can be expected to grow. We cannot \naddress that threat within the confines of the ABM Treaty. The decision \nto move beyond it was the right decision, and I applaud President \nBush's leadership on this issue of tremendous importance to all \nAmericans.\n  As I said, he probably will be too modest to address this much in his \nState of the Union speech tomorrow evening, but I believe it to be one \nof the most important decisions he made last year, and its \nramifications will be felt and be defined by greater security for the \nAmerican people for decades to come.\n  I commend him for that decision.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to offer an \namendment making the research and development tax credit permanent. I \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Hatch, the distinguished ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch has been working on this \nissue for years, and I am grateful for the opportunity to join him in \nthis continuing effort on this essential piece of legislation. I also \nexpress my thanks to Senator George Allen who has distinguished himself \nas the chairman of the High Tech Task Force.\n  I am pleased to serve with Senator Allen on the task force, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him as we address the many \nnumerous technology issues that confront this Nation. Both of our \nStates take a very active role in high tech. We have many businesses in \nboth of our States--Virginia and Colorado--that rely on high tech in \norder to grow.\n  As a member of the Senate High Tech Task Force, I have been fortunate \nto work with a number of my colleagues on an agenda that is both \nprobusiness and proconsumer. We have focused on expanding the reach of \nInternet and broadband technologies, putting more computers in \nclassrooms, more schools online dealing with cyber security issues in \ngeneral relating to e-commerce, the spectrum, and intellectual property \nissues. None of these issues has the power to make as immediate an \nimpact in the technology industry as a permanent extension of the \nresearch and development tax credit. It is altogether appropriate that \nwe include this language in any stimulus bill to pass out of the \nSenate.\n  A study by Coopers & Lybrand in 1998 showed that a permanent \nextension of the R tax credit would create nearly $58 billion in \ndomestic economic growth through 2010.\n  This is an astounding and immediate impact that affects virtually \nevery American. Available solely for incremental research activities in \nthe United States and Puerto Rico, approximately 75 percent of the R \ntax credit dollars pay for salaries of employees associated with \nresearch and development. These are high-skilled, high-paying American \njobs.\n  In an ever expanding global marketplace, it is important that \nAmerican companies be able to compete abroad. It is also important that \nmultinational firms see the United States as a welcome laboratory for \nresearch and development.\n  Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, and Japan all offer \nfinancial incentives to companies to perform research and development \nwithin their borders which lowers the cost of R and gives companies \nboth a competitive advantage and an incentive to bring their resources \nand jobs to the marketplace where they can get the most bang for the \nbuck. It is my hope that international research and development \ninvestors will recognize that the United States is just such a place.\n  The R tax credit provides an effective incentive for companies to \ncreate valuable, skilled jobs. This is not just theory. The research \nand development tax credit was originally enacted in 1981 and has been \nextended 11 times.\n  From 1995 through 1998, the innovation and economic growth in \ninformation technology alone was responsible for one-third of the real \neconomic growth. Studies by the General Accounting Office, the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, and others have documented the impact the research \nand development tax credit has on private research and development \nspending. One such study found that every dollar of tax benefit spurs \nan additional dollar in private research and development investment. \nThis is to say nothing of the major economic benefits associated with \nincreased productivity and efficiency that new technologies and \nproducts bring.\n  And the benefits don't stop there. Investment in research and \ndevelopment has generated countless products and technological advances \naffecting every facet of American life.\n  In 1866, American farmers could expect to yield 11.6 bushels of wheat \nper acre. Then, about 34 years later, in 1900, the expected yield was \n12.2 bushels, climbing to 16.5 bushels per acre in 1950. Today, thanks \nto advances in pesticides and crop genetics, that yield can reach well \nover 43 bushels per acre.\n  Medical patients today benefit from a variety of wonder drugs and \nmedical devices previously unimaginable. The hardware, software, and \nfiber that makes the Internet run, even the Internet itself, provide \nexamples of what aggressive research and development can\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\ndo. The benefits of investment in research and development in short \nmakes our lives better.\n  Every American has benefited from the giant leap forward in \ntechnology. Our standard of living is higher. Our quality of life is \ngreater.\n  I realize that many of my colleagues may ask why we must make this \ntax credit permanent rather than continuing to extend it annually \nsemiannually. As a former small businessman, I know many of my \ncolleagues can relate to this. A business must budget, look forward, \nand plan in order to get the highest use of their hard-earned dollars. \nThis principle applies to all businesses, regardless of size, location, \nor the number of borders they cross in doing business.\n  The process of ongoing renewal year to year means the research and \ndevelopment tax credit offers less value to the businesses and research \ninitiatives we are seeking to support. Business and technology leaders \nlook at multiyear projects often over 10 years down the road. When we \nlook around today and take stock of the many goods and services today \nthat did not exist 10 years ago, I believe we can agree that this kind \nof planning must be encouraged.\n\n  I mentioned my experience as a small businessman. As my colleagues \nknow, I ran my own veterinary hospital. Trained as a scientist, I \ncontinue to keep up on the latest developments in pharmaceuticals, \ntreatment techniques, and chemistry. I would like to make one thing \nvery clear today: That is, scientific development does not fit in \ncalendar or fiscal years. It is not cyclical or situational. Science is \nan evolving, growing, expanding study. This vital process through which \nvirtually all human endeavor can be traced is one that should not be \ninhibited by regular policy debates when the result is so clear.\n  Research and development is the cornerstone of healthy industry and \nprovides solutions to problems we may not even realize exist. \nUncertainty can equate to less investment and undermines the entire \npurpose of the research and development tax credit.\n  President Bush included permanent extension of the R tax credit in \nhis initial tax relief plan. I was pleased to see that a majority of my \ncolleagues supported this credit by voting 62 to 38 on the final tax \npackage, which at that time included the permanent extension. It is my \nhope that we will be able to continue the momentum of last year's vote \nand seize this opportunity to state, in no uncertain terms, that the \nSenate recognizes the importance of this tax credit, the innovations it \ninspires, and the tangible impact it makes on the quality of life in \nAmerica.\n  A number of prominent trade organizations have organized the R \ncredit coalition in an effort to support the Congress in passing this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent to print a list of these \norganizations in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Association Members of R Credit Coalition\n\n       (Listing from NAM/R Workbook)\n\n     AeA (formerly American Electronics Association)\n     Aerospace Industries Association (AIA)\n     American Association of Engineering Societies\n     American Council on Education\n     American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n     American Institute of Chemical Engineers\n     American Society of Civil Engineers\n     American Society of Engineering Education Engineering Deans \n         Council\n     Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association\n     Biotechnology Industry Organization\n     Business Software Alliance\n     Computing Technology Industry Association\n     Electronic Industries Alliance\n     Federation of Materials Societies\n     Information Technology Association of America\n     Information Technology Industry Council\n     IPC, Association Connecting Electronics Industries\n     Medical Device Manufacturers Association\n     National Association of Manufacturers\n     National Electric Manufacturers Association\n     National Society of Professional Engineers\n     North American Die Casting Association\n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\n     Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI)\n     Semiconductor Industry Association\n     Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)\n     Software Finance and Tax Executives Council\n     Steel Manufacturers Association\n     Technology Network\n     Telecommunications Industry Association\n     The Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)\n     The Tax Council\n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I also ask unanimous consent to print a number of \nletters, from the American Electronics Association, the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, and the R Credit Coalition, regarding \nthe importance of including this permanent R tax credit extension in \nthe current stimulus bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Electronics Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the high-tech industry, I write \n     to express AeA's strong support for the Allard/Hatch/Allen \n     amendment which calls for a permanent extension of the \n     research and development tax credit (R tax credit) along \n     with a modest increase in the Alternative Incremental \n     Research Credit (AIRC) rates. We believe that this amendment \n     would provide businesses the certainty to invest in \n     additional R and would stimulate the economy. Our industry \n     is unified in its support of such a measure.\n       Please vote in support of the Allard/Hatch/Allen amendment \n     (SA 2772.) This amendment is identical to bipartisan \n     legislation, S. 41, sponsored by Senators Max Baucus and \n     Orrin Hatch and which currently has 53 Senate cosponsors.\n       The many economic benefits of the R tax credit are well \n     documented. A permanent R credit would: Create additional \n     high-paying, high-skilled jobs in the United States; increase \n     productivity in the U.S. almost immediately; stimulate \n     additional R spending in the United States, ranging from 1 \n     to 2 additional dollars for every dollar of foregone tax \n     revenue; and lower U.S. production costs and consumer prices.\n       In times of uncertainty, companies are reluctant to invest \n     in long term projects, and therefore anything that provides \n     certainty will make it that much easier to commit resources \n     now to hire people to pursue long term research projects. The \n     current economic slowdown requires this kind of dramatic, \n     effective action by the Congress.\n       AeA (American Electronics Association) is the nation's \n     largest high-tech trade association and is comprised of more \n     than 3,500 small, medium and large high-tech companies. \n     Passage of an economic stimulus package is very important to \n     the high-tech industry right now, and we hope the U.S. Senate \n     will act quickly to approve a stimulus package that includes \n     a permanent R tax credit extension.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William T. Archey,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: The Information Technology Industry Council \n     (ITI) wishes to express our strong support for your amendment \n     to permanently extend the Research and Development (R) \n     credit and to increase the rates of the alternative \n     incremental credit. We commend you for your leadership on \n     such a critical issue to the U.S. economy.\n       As the representative of the leading U.S. providers of \n     information technology (IT) products and services. ITI is \n     extremely proud of the critical role our member companies \n     have played in fueling the extraordinary growth in \n     productivity and job creation over the last decade. Much of \n     that growth was fueled by industry-funded investments in R\n       As you know, R is the lifeblood of the IT industry. It \n     has proven instrumental in helping America remain at the \n     forefront of technological development and innovation. While \n     we appreciate the fact that the credit has been extended many \n     times over the years, a permanent R tax credit will provide \n     a more predictable environment for sustaining our lead in \n     cutting-edge technology.\n       The R credit has long enjoyed bipartisan support in both \n     houses of Congress. We hope the Senate will once again \n     demonstrate its commitment to U.S. technology by voting in \n     favor of your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rhett Dawson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         R Credit Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2002.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       Dear Senator Allard: On behalf of the members of the R \n     Credit Coalition, we thank you for offering as an amendment \n     to the pending economic stimulus bill (S. 622) a permanent \n     extension of the research and experimentation tax credit (the \n     ``R credit'') with a modest increase in the Alternative \n     Incremental Research Credit (AIRC) rates.\n       Private-sector research is vital to our national security \n     as well as to our economic resilience. In order to maximize \n     the potential for new and continued U.S.-based research, it \n     is important that companies be able to rely on the long-term \n     availability of the R\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\n     credit. This is especially true in periods of economic \n     uncertainty, when it is particularly difficult for companies \n     to commit to high cost, high-risk projects.\n       The R tax credit encourages companies to create more \n     high-skilled, high-paying jobs, as well as increased economic \n     security and higher standards of living for American workers. \n     In addition, this credit enables companies to provide \n     increased jobs and salaries for engineers, researchers and \n     technicians. Just as important, however, are the additional \n     jobs created in manufacturing, administration and sales when \n     research yields new products taken to market.\n       By making the commitment to U.S. based research permanent, \n     Congress is in the unique position to help stimulate \n     investments now in more long-term research projects in the \n     U.S.-providing both an immediate boost to the economy and a \n     stronger foundation for future economic growth through \n     productivity gains. We look forward to working with you to \n     see a permanent extension of the R credit with a modest \n     increase in the AIRC rates enacted into law this year.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bill Sample, Microsoft Corporation, Chairman, R Credit \n           Coalition; Donna Siss Gleason, The Boeing Company, Vice \n           Chair, R Credit Coalition; Kristin Paulson, United \n           Technologies Corporation, Cochair, R Credit \n           Coalition, Government Affairs Committee; Karen Myers, \n           EDS, Cochair, R Credit Coalition, Government Affairs \n           Committee; Caroline Graves Hurley, American Electronics \n           Association, Executive Secretary, R Credit Coalition.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, at one time or another, we have had \nvarious Members from the Senate state how important it is to encourage \nresearch and development in our country. In fact, the majority leader \nhimself, Tom Daschle, on January 4, 2001, said:\n\n       We should act to make the research and development tax \n     credit permanent; the sooner the better.\n\n  And then majority leader Tom Daschle, on January 4, 2001, stated:\n\n       . . . the R tax credit is one of the most effective \n     mechanisms to encourage innovation, increase business \n     investment, and keep the economy growing.\n  Now, as I mentioned in my remarks, being a scientist and having been \nin business for myself, I fully understand the importance of research \nand bringing those technologies to the marketplace. Not only do the \nconsumers benefit, but society in general and the whole world benefit. \nIf we are going to continue to be a leading competitive nation in the \nworld, we need to continue research and development.\n  As members of the chamber of commerce in the town in which I \npracticed veterinary medicine, we tried to attract businesses that did \na sizable amount of research and development because we understood \nthat, with research and development, that company was likely to be with \nus for a long time because they were continually keeping up with \nadvancements in science and bringing that to the marketplace.\n  So as we talk about what it is with which we can stimulate the \neconomy in America, I think one of the most significant things we can \ndo as a Congress is to send to the President a research and development \ntax credit that is permanent, not one that will change every year.\n  I can understand the frustrations of business people who come to me \nand have talked in town meetings and said: Look, if we only had some \nidea of how long this research and development tax credit would last \ninstead of periodically renewing it, we could lay out long-term plans \nfor R I agree. I think it is important to have a very successful \nprogram of research and development in your company. You have to have a \nlong-range plan in place, and the only way to do that is to have some \nassurance from the Congress, the President, and the Federal Government \nthat the tax credits are going to be there to use in putting together \nany research needs you may have in order to meet product development \nwithin your company. So this is an extremely important piece of \nlegislation. I think it is an important issue.\n  The Senate should address it, and the sooner the better, during these \ntimes when our economy is not doing so well. Even if our economy was \ndoing well, this is what we need to have in place in order to sustain \neconomic growth. It would be less likely we would get into economic \ndownturns with this kind of encouraging tax credit on a permanent \nbasis. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for the permanent \nextension of the research and development tax credit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I commend him for \nbeing willing to file this amendment today. I rise to speak in support \nof the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Colorado to extend \npermanently the research credit.\n  This amendment we offer today is simple and straightforward. It would \nextend permanently the credit for increasing research activities, \ncommonly known as the research credit or the R credit. This provision \nwas an important contributor to our robust economic growth of the last \nhalf of the 1990s.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is necessary.\n  In July 1999, the Senate voted to make the research credit permanent. \nUnfortunately, the House version of the 1999 tax bill included only a \n5-year extension of the credit. The 5-year extension did prevail in the \nconference. Unfortunately, that bill was vetoed by President Clinton \nfor reasons unrelated to the research credit itself.\n  However, in November of 1999, Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which \nincluded a 5-year extension of the research credit. Therefore, the \ncredit was extended to June 30, 2004.\n  In mid-2000, the Senate again had the opportunity to vote on a \npermanent extension of the research credit. While we were debating that \nyear's version of the death tax repeal bill, Senator Baucus and I \noffered an amendment to make the research credit permanent. The Senate \npassed the amendment with a vote of 98 to 1. Once again, President \nClinton vetoed the underlying bill.\n  Again last May, as we debated the 2001 tax cut bill, I offered an \namendment to extend permanently the research credit. That amendment was \nwithdrawn, but the provision was included in a managers' amendment that \nwas approved by the Senate. Unfortunately again, however, the permanent \nresearch credit was dropped in conference and the credit was not \nextended.\n  Thus, as it stands under present law, the research credit is \nscheduled to expire on June 30, 2004. This is most unfortunate, Mr. \nPresident, because in 2004 the Congress and, more importantly, \nAmerica's business community will once again have to go through the \ncomplete rigmarole of on-again, off-again uncertainty of an important \ntax provision. Temporary extensions are poor tax policy. The ultimate \nloser in this game is not the Congress or even the companies that \nengage in research, but each American. That is because every one of us \nis the direct beneficiary of the research investments made by the \nbusinesses of America. We benefit from the higher economic growth and \nincreased productivity and the higher degree of global competitiveness \nthat increased research brings.\n  The research credit has been in the Internal Revenue Code for more \nthan 20 years in one form or another. It has expired and been extended \n10 times, Mr. President. Those extensions have been as short as 6 \nmonths and as long as 5 years. There have even been periods when the \ncredit was allowed to expire and then retroactively reestablish. On one \noccasion, the credit expired and was reenacted prospectively, leaving a \ngap period where the credit was not available. The one thing the credit \nhas never been is permanent. That is a shame.\n  This is significant because, as effective as the credit has been in \nproviding a strong incentive to companies to increase research \nactivities, it has been inherently limited in its effectiveness because \nbusiness leaders have never been able to count on the credit being \nthere on a long-term basis, and therefore their long-term planning \ncan't be entered into.\n\n  Anyone who has been in business more than 10 minutes knows that \nplanning and budgeting--unlike what we do in Congress--is a multiyear \nprocess. Anyone who has been involved in research knows that scientific \nenterprise does not fit neatly into calendar or fiscal years.\n  Our history of dealing with the research credit--that is, allowing it \nto run to the brink of expiration and bringing it back after it is dead \nwith\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\nretroactive extensions--results in not only very poor tax policy but is \nalso very detrimental--and I would say highly so--to our research-\nintensive business entities and indeed the whole country.\n  It is time to get serious about our commitment to a tax credit that \nis widely viewed by economists and business leaders as a very effective \nprovision in creating economic growth and keeping this country on the \nleading edge of high technology in the world. A 1998 study by Coopers \nand Lybrand dramatically illustrated the significant economic benefits \nprovided by the research credit. According to the study, making the \ncredit permanent would stimulate substantial amounts of additional R \nin the United States, increase national productivity and economic \ngrowth almost immediately, and provide U.S. workers with higher wages.\n  The vast majority of the Members of this body are on record in \nsupport of the permanent research credit. As I mentioned, only 18 \nmonths ago, 98 Senators voted in favor of permanence.\n  But, while practically everyone says they support a permanent \nresearch credit, it has become too easy for Congress to fall into its \ntwo-decade-long practice of merely extending the credit for a year or \ntwo, or even five years, and then not worrying about it until it is \ntime to extend it again.\n  These short-term extensions have occurred ten times since 1981. Ten \nshort-term extensions for a tax credit that most Members of this body \nstrongly support. I am not sure we realize how the lack of permanence \nof the credit damages its effectiveness.\n  Research and development projects cannot be turned on and off like a \nlight switch. They typically take a number of years and may even last \nlonger than a decade. As our business leaders plan these projects, they \nneed to look years ahead in making the projections and estimating the \npotential return on their investment. Because the research credit is \nnot permanent, and its extension is not assured, the availability of \nthe credit over the life of these projects is uncertain and is thus \noften not included in the numbers. As a result, the projected return on \nthe investment is lower and some promising research projects are simply \nnot funded.\n  With a permanent credit, these business planners would take the \nbenefits of the credit into account, knowing they would be there for \nall years in which the reason is to be performed. The result would be a \nlower projected cost, leading to more research projects being funded, \nwhich in turn would lead to more benefits to the economy, to our \nproductivity, and to each consumer. In fact, making the credit \npermanent would start these benefits now and actually give an immediate \nboost to the amount of research performed, even before the current \ncredit expires in 2004.\n  There is little doubt that a significant amount of the incentive \neffect of the research credit has been lost over the past 20 years \nbecause of the constant uncertainty about its continuing availability. \nThis uncertainty has undermined the very purpose of the credit. For the \ngovernment and the American people to maximize the return on their \ninvestment in U.S.-based research and development, this credit must be \nmade permanent. And now is the time to do so.\n  I believe a permanent research credit is one of the most important \nelements of our tax code because it is so tied in with the issues of \neconomic growth and our future prosperity.\n  According to Chairman Greenspan, the Nation's high productivity \ngrowth, which played an instrumental role in our economic growth during \nthe second half of the 1990s, would likely not have been possible \nwithout the innovations of recent decades, especially those in \ninformation technologies. The research credit is a key factor in \nkeeping these innovations coming. But a temporary credit is inherently \nlimited in its ability to do this.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I am afraid to many of us are stuck in a \nmindset that says that since the research credit can just be taken care \nof later this year in a tax extenders package, or when it gets closer \nto its 2004 expiration date, why bother about it now?\n  I want to emphasize that another temporary extension is not the issue \nhere. We can and probably will always extend the credit when the time \nfor its expiration comes. It will likely be on the less effective basis \nwe have always done it, perhaps only for a few months, or it may be on \na retroactive basis, and there may be a gap created, but we will \nprobably keep extending it. The issue is whether or not we should \nmagnify the power of this credit by making it permanent.\n  This amendment is about long-term growth; it is about fostering \ninnovation and keeping the innovation pipeline filled; and it is about \nsustaining the productivity gains that have brought us where we are \ntoday and that can help us stay prosperous in the future as we deal \nwith the entitlement challenges ahead.\n  In conclusion, if we decide not to make the research credit \npermanent, are we not limiting the potential growth of our economy? How \ncan we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global \neconomic race if we allow other countries, some of which provide huge \ngovernment direct subsidies, to offer stronger incentives than we do?\n  Making the credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the \npack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting from \nAmerican research and development will continue to improve the standard \nof living for every person in the U.S. and worldwide.\n  I have been making this case year after year, and I am so pleased to \nhave the leadership of our distinguished Senator from Colorado in \nhelping us to pass it on the economic stimulus bill. I do believe that \nalmost everybody in the Senate should vote for this amendment. This \nmakes sense. It creates jobs and gives businesses an opportunity to \nplan ahead. It literally keeps us at the cutting edge of technology and \nhelps us to really be what we should be, in a time such as this when we \nwant to stimulate the economy. I don't know of many amendments that \nwould do as much as this particular amendment of the Senator from \nColorado and myself. I praise him and thank him for his dedication in \nbringing this issue forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. \nI withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Utah for all his compliments. \nThis is a subject I know he has worked on for years. I appreciate what \nhe is trying to do.\n  I could not agree more with his statement that one of the most \nimportant things we can do to get the economy to grow is to make on a \npermanent basis the research and development tax credit.\n  I am also involved in the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force. I \nwould like to make a part of the Record their policy agenda for the \n107th Congress where they talk about a Tax Code for the 21st century \nand list a number of actions they believe we can take to encourage the \nhigh-tech industry to grow in America. They mention, among those, \nmaking the research and development tax credit permanent, in addition \nto a number of other provisions. I ask unanimous consent that be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senate Republican High Tech Task Force Policy Agenda for the 107th \n                                Congress\n\n       Protecting Internet Privacy and E-Commerce.--The Task Force \n     believes market-based solutions are the best way to balance \n     legitimate privacy concerns with the need for flexible e-\n     commerce. While certain types of medical and financial data \n     may warrant special legislative protections, we are skeptical \n     that the Congress should rush to delegate to government \n     bureaucrats the task of developing effective mandates related \n     to personal privacy. If legislation is considered, we believe \n     that it should not discriminate against Internet \n     transactions, should provide a uniform federal standard for \n     enforcement of privacy policies, and should limit the ability \n     to regulatory agencies to impose burdensome and cumbersome \n     mandates.\n       Promoting Education and Technology.--Without a workforce \n     fully capable in math, science, and computing skills, our \n     competitiveness is at risk. Without a consumer base able to \n     utilize the latest technological advances, our economic \n     growth may wane. The Task Force believes that a top priority \n     in education should be development of policies both \n     encouraging the use of technology in the classroom and using \n     this technology to\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n     master basic math, science, and computer skills.\n       Safeguarding Copyright in the Digital Age.--With our \n     economy dependent on cutting-edge software and our families \n     enjoying music, movies, and television through new \n     distribution models, protecting copyrighted material is of \n     paramount importance. The Task Force believes that the \n     Congress should bolster efforts to protect copyrighted \n     materials from piracy and to facilitate legal digital \n     distribution of copyrighted works.\n       Deploying Broadband Technologies.--The Task Force \n     understands that high speed Internet access has the power to \n     transform how we use the Internet. Encouraging tax and \n     regulatory policies that foster rapid, efficient, and \n     competitive deployment of broadband and other important \n     technologies to urban and rural areas will be crucial to \n     ensure our economic growth and technological competitiveness.\n       Enhancing Free Trade.--The Task Force believes that trading \n     freely with other countries has allowed our producers of \n     technology goods and services to lead the world in technology \n     innovation while significantly raising our standard of \n     living. We believe that a vital component of free trade is \n     ensuring enforcement of international trade agreements to \n     guarantee that our businesses are not placed at a competitive \n     disadvantage and that our intellectual property is not \n     pirated or copied illegally.\n       Protecting Internet Security and Combating \n     Cyberterrorism.--The Task Force supports legislation and \n     appropriations to protect the privacy of Internet users and \n     to aid law enforcement in making sure the Internet does not \n     become a haven for cybercriminals. Our goals include \n     enhancing deterrents to Internet piracy and counterfeiting of \n     intellectual property and bolstering international \n     cooperation against computer crimes. Also, our communications \n     infrastructures remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, and we \n     must support executive branch efforts to bolster cooperation \n     within and between Federal agencies and the private sector.\n       Digital Decency.--The Task Force believes that the growth \n     of the Internet does not have to mean a decline in cultural \n     decency. Advocating ``Digital Decency'' means using the bully \n     pulpit to advocate responsible entertainment products, \n     encouraging parents and children to turn their backs on \n     music, movies, and games advocating violence and \n     discrimination, and encouraging better private sector filters \n     to keep the Internet experience a healthy one.\n       Patent and Trademark Office Funding.--The Task Force \n     believes that the explosion of technology patents has made it \n     more necessary than ever to ensure that the PTO has adequate \n     funding through its own fee mechanisms, rather than siphoning \n     off these fees for general government use.\n       A Tax Code for the 21st Century.--The Task Force believes \n     our tax code must be reviewed and modernized to reflect \n     current business realities affecting technology industries. \n     Issues which the Task Force believes should be considered \n     include making the research and development tax credit \n     permanent, accelerating the depreciation schedules for \n     technology equipment and encouraging capital formation for \n     small technology businesses.\n       Keeping Government Out of Competition With E-Commerce \n     Businesses.--The Task Force believes that federal government \n     agencies should not use taxpayer dollars to compete with \n     private businesses developing new e-commerce products and \n     services.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a news \nrelease from the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force dated Friday, \nJune 29, 2001, be printed in the Record. It talks about, again, Senator \nSmith's effort in getting it attached to the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand reemphasizes the point we are trying to make today on how important \nit is we provide a permanent extension of the research and development \ntax credit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n High Tech Task Force Supports Smith-Hatch-Allen Amendment to Patients \n                 Bill To Make R Tax Credit Permanent\n\n       Washington, DC.--Senate Republican High Tech Task Force \n     Chairman Senator George Allen (VA) today pledged the \n     endorsement of the group of an amendment by Senators Gordon \n     Smith (OR), Orrin Hatch (UT) and Senator Allen to make the \n     federal Research and Development (R) Tax Credit permanent.\n       The Smith-Hatch-Allen amendment to the Patients' Bill of \n     Rights, currently being debated on the Senate floor, makes \n     the R tax credit permanent and increases the rates of the \n     alternative incremental research and development tax credit \n     as provided in S. 41, Senator Hatch's bill. Both Senators \n     Smith and Hatch are also High Tech Task Force members.\n       Chairman Allen said making the R tax credit permanent \n     will help improve the quality of medical care for all \n     Americans.\n       ``Providing every possible incentive for technological \n     advancements and innovations will lead to better and less \n     expensive medical treatments and devices,'' Chairman Allen \n     said. ``The R tax credit is crucial not only to the field \n     of medicine, but to the technology community at large.\n       ``A permanent R Tax Credit credibly encourages investment \n     in basic research that over the long term can lead to the \n     development of new, more cost-effective, and more efficient \n     technology products and services. Research and development is \n     also essential for our long-term, competitive economic \n     growth,''\n       Chairman Allen also pointed to a study conducted by Coopers \n     & Lybrand, which shows that workers in every State will \n     benefit from higher wages if the R credit is made \n     permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in \n     productivity stemming from the credit are estimated to exceed \n     $60 billion over the next 12 years.\n       The R tax credit was original enacted in 1981 and has \n     been temporarily extended ten times. Permanent extension of \n     the Research and Development Tax Credit is a component of the \n     Task Force's policy agenda, which was announced March 1, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that another \npress release from the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force for \nFriday June 29, 2001, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  High Tech Task Force Members Urge Finance Committee To Make R Tax \n                            Credit Permanent\n\n       Washington, DC.--Members of the Senate Republican High Tech \n     Task Force including Chairman Senator George Allen (VA) are \n     urging the Senate Finance Committee to include permanent \n     extension of the Research and Development (R) Tax Credit in \n     the tax relief package that they will soon consider.\n       Members of the Task Force, Senators Allen, Wayne Allard \n     (CO), Robert Bennett (UT), Sam Brownback (KS), Conrad Burns \n     (MT), Orrin Hatch (UT), Jeff Sessions (AL), Gordon Smith (OR) \n     and John Warner (VA), as well as Senators Mike Crapo (ID), \n     Bill Frist (TN), Tim Hutchinson (AR), and Republican Policy \n     Committee Chairman Larry Craig (ID) today sent letters to \n     Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) and \n     Ranking Member Max Baucus (D-MT) with their request.\n       ``We believe the R tax credit is essential to the \n     technology community,'' the Senators wrote. ``It encourages \n     investment in basic research that over the long term can lead \n     to the development of new, more cost-effective, and more \n     efficient technology products and services. Research and \n     development is essential for long-term economic growth.''\n       The R tax credit was originally enacted in 1981 and has \n     been temporarily extended ten times. ``Permanent extension is \n     long overdue,'' the Senators maintained. ``Yet because it has \n     never been made permanent, this vital tax credit offers \n     business less value than it should because of its \n     unpredictability.''\n       The Senators also noted that President Bush included the \n     permanent extension in his budget, and they urged Finance \n     Committee members include this measure in the tax relief \n     package as ``making the R tax credit permanent is essential \n     to helping maintain America's technology lead in the world.''\n       Permanent extension of the Research and Development Tax \n     Credit is a component of the Task Force's policy agenda, \n     which was announced March 1, 2001.\n\n                                                      May 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: We respectfully request that you \n     include permanent extension of the research and \n     experimentation (R) tax credit in the tax relief package \n     you will consider in your Committee shortly.\n       As Republican Senators and members of High Tech Task Force \n     (HTTF), we believe the R tax credit is essential to the \n     technology community. It encourages investment in basic \n     research that over the long term can lead to the development \n     of new, cheaper, and better technology products and services. \n     Research and development is essential for long-term economic \n     growth. Innovations in science and technology fueled the \n     massive economic expansion we witnessed over the course of \n     the 20th century. These advancements have improved the \n     standard of living for nearly every American. Simply put, the \n     research tax credit is an investment in economic growth, new \n     jobs, and important new products and processes.\n       As you know, the credit was originally enacted in 1981, and \n     has been temporarily extended ten times. Permanent extension \n     is long overdue. There is broad support among Republicans for \n     the credit, and President Bush included the credit in the \n     $1.6 trillion tax relief plan. Yet because it has never been \n     made permanent, this vital tax credit offers business less \n     value then it should. Business, unlike Congress, must plan \n     and budget in a multi-year process. Scientific enterprise \n     does not fit neatly into calendar or fiscal years. Research \n     and development projects typically take a number of years, \n     and may even last longer than a decade. As our business \n     leaders plan these projects, they need to know whether or not \n     they can count on this tax credit. The current uncertainty \n     surrounding the credit has induced businesses to allocate \n     significantly less to research than they otherwise would if \n     they knew the\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n     tax credit would be available in future years. This \n     uncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit.\n       We believe making the R tax credit permanent is essential \n     to helping maintain America's technology lead in the world. \n     We thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         George Allen, Larry E. Craig, Conrad Burns, Tim \n           Hutchinson, Gordon Smith, Wayne Allard, Jeff Sessions, \n           Orrin Hatch, Michael Crapo, Robert F. Bennett, Sam \n           Brownback, Bill Frist, John Warner.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a news \nrelease dated Tuesday, May 8, 2001, entitled ``High Tech Task Force \nMembers Urge Finance Committee to Make R Tax Credit Permanent,'' \nwhich documents the work of this task force and the importance they \nplace in making permanent the research and development tax credit, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRepublicans Will Keep Fighting To Make R Credit Permanent--High Tech \n  Task Force Chairman Allen Praises Senator Gordon Smith's Leadership\n\n       Washington, DC.--Senate Republican High Tech Task Force \n     Chairman Sen. George Allen (VA) today vowed to keep pushing \n     for an amendment to make the Research and Development (R) \n     Tax Credit permanent, despite almost universal Democrat \n     opposition to the provision in a Senate vote.

Only one Democrat \n     joined 40 Senate Republicans in supporting the Smith-Hatch-\n     Allen amendment. Cosponsors of the amendment were Senators \n     Wayne Allard (CO), Robert Bennett (UT), Sam Brownback (KS), \n     Conrad Burns (MT), Larry Craig (ID), Mike Crapo (ID), John \n     Ensign (NV), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (TX).\n       ``Senator Gordon Smith deserves commendation for his \n     leadership for the idea of a permanent R Tax Credit,'' \n     Chairman Allen said. ``Unfortunately, Democrats voted almost \n     universally to pull the plug on one of the top items on the \n     technology community's agenda.\n       ``I pledge the support of the High Tech Task Force in \n     working with Senators Smith and Hatch to find any avenue to \n     make the R Tax Credit a permanent part of our tax code.\n       ``A permanent R Tax Credit brings certainty and will spur \n     more American investment and more American jobs that can lead \n     to the development of new, more cost-effective, and more \n     efficient technology products and medicines Research and \n     development are also essential for America's long-term, \n     competitive economic growth.''\n       Studies have shown that a permanent R tax credit would \n     lead to higher wages for workers and gains in productivity.\n       The R tax credit was originally enacted in 1981 and has \n     been temporarily extended ten times.

Mr. President, our farmers are hurting, and they are \nfacing an uncertain future. They desperately need the stability this \nfarm bill will offer them.\n  Because we failed to act in December, many bankers are balking at \nissuing loans to farmers. The bankers want a guarantee that there will \nbe a new farm bill this season, or, at the very least, a disaster \nrelief package.\n  And our farmers cannot operate without loans. Their livelihood \ndepends on getting that bank loan each season. So, we've left them in \nlimbo, anxiously awaiting our next move.\n  That is why we must pass this farm bill as soon as possible.\n  Remember, the 1996 farm bill didn't pass until April of that year, \nand it was still able to be implemented for that year's growing season. \nWe will be able to do the same this year if we pass a bill early this \nspring.\n  I worked hard on the Agriculture Committee to protect the interests \nof Georgia and the Southeast. The bill we came up with is good for \nGeorgia. It provides more assistance for peanuts and cotton, and most \nGeorgia agriculture groups had displayed a rare unity in rallying \naround it.\n  We must pass this farm bill and get it to the President as quickly as \npossible. Our farmers and the rural areas they breathe life into cannot \nafford for us to put it off any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S173-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MOUNT UNION FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nMount Union Purple Raiders football team, from Alliance, OH, on a \nnumber of outstanding achievements. The Purple Raiders just recently \nwon the Division III National Championship for the fifth time in six \nyears. Maintaining a perfect record of 13 victories, Mount Union's team \nhas the longest current winning streak of any NCAA football team, and \nhas won 82 of the last 83 games.\n  While their execution of the split-back offense is flawless, it is \nMount Union's academic performance that is truly remarkable. The \ncollege, as a whole, boasts 14 Academic All Ohio Athletic Conference \nwinners and three Academic All-Americans. The football team has \ngraduated a near-perfect percentage of players in the last 16 seasons. \nI applaud the Purple Raider players who exceed all expectations on the \ngridiron, as well as in the classroom.\n  For the local residents of Alliance, OH and the students of Mount \nUnion, there is so much to be proud of. As they crowd into the oldest \ncollege football stadium in Ohio every fall, they are not only cheering \nfor the heroes of the Purple Raiders, but also for future heroes, \nfuture leaders who will have acquired the valuable experiences that \ncome with a solid education and a demanding athletic routine. These \nexperiences will aid them in making a positive impact years from now.\n  Again, I congratulate head coach Larry Kehres and his Purple Raiders \non a perfect championship season. They are a shining example of true \nstudent-athletes, and I wish them the best of luck next fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S173-4", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S173-S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GAINESVILLE, TX\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today with tremendous \npride for the city of Gainesville, Texas. This city deserves special \nrecognition for being the first city to establish The Medal of Honor \nHost City Program. The purpose of this unique program is to recognize \nthose legendary, humble heroes who, through great personal sacrifice, \nhave preserved our freedoms. At the same time this program will pay \ntribute to the principles that the medal represents--Duty, Honor, and \nCountry. To this end, it will provide Medal of Honor recipients a \nstipend to cover lodging, food, and fuel expenses while visiting the \ncity of Gainesville.\n  The local Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 1922, along with the \nleaders of the community, pioneered the project and have seen it \nthrough from idea to implementation. While designed to honor living \nrecipients of the nation's highest decoration for military valor, it \nalso was initiated with the intent of exposing the citizens of \nGainesville to these role models of selfless service. When visiting the \ncity, these men of uncommon valor will be invited to share their \nexperiences with students, clubs, and local organizations. By providing \nyouth the opportunity to hear, first-hand, these amazing tales of \ngallantry and the effect that these circumstances have had on the \nremainder of their lives, the principles of patriotism and duty will be \npropagated throughout the current generation and beyond. It also gives \ncivic groups and classes an opportunity to thank them for everything \nthat they have done for our country.\n  This project has not only been formalized, but has already been put \ninto action. The first two Medal of Honor recipients visited the city \nthis past\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nVeterans' Day and the Congressional Medal of Honor Society took the \nopportunity at its October annual reunion to announce the project to \nits members.\n  Mr. President, while sacrifice, patriotism, and a sense of duty have \nbeen a foundation for our great nation for over 200 years, the events \nof the past five months have made it even more appropriate to recognize \nthese heroes and provide them a singular opportunity to be the \nadvocates of the price of our freedom. Mayor Kenneth Kaden is to be \nespecially recognized for his leadership in advancing this unique \nproject. I am humbly honored to recognize The Medal of Honor Host City \nProgram, and I hope to see its success spawn similar programs \nthroughout the Great State of Texas and the rest of the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S174-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of this year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 31, \n1993 in Olympia, WA. In two separate incidents, men described as \n``skinheads'' attacked two groups of people because they were perceived \nto be gay. The assailants, Derek K. Jensen, 20, Samuel M. Tomasello, \n21, and a 16-year-old, were arrested in connection with the assaults.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S174-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messagers from the President of the United States were communicated \nto the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S174-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the President Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the Presiding of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/28/senate-section/article/S174-4", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S174-S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5205.

A bill to authorize the National Science Foundation and the \nNational Security Agency to establish programs to increase the number \nof qualified faculty teaching advanced courses conducting research in \nthe field of cybersecurity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. president, since the horrifying events of September \n11, our country's number one priority has been to secure our families \nagainst the scourge of terrorism.\n  First, in our hearts, of course, are the men and women on the \nfrontlines of the fight: the soldiers fighting for freedom half a world \naway; the firefighters and police officers in New York; the postal \nworkers here in Washington.\n  Those of us elected to serve in Washington have a special \nresponsibility to protect our security. To discharge that duty, I have \nbeen working with my colleagues here in the Senate. We have made a \ngreat deal of progress, but there's a lot more work to do.\n  After a long debate, Congress passed and the President signed \nimportant legislation, based partly on a bill I introduced, to tighten \nsecurity in our airports. But we have to do more.\n  There are several bills that I have helped author that are working \ntheir way through Congress. Two of these bills, to tighten security at \nseaports and to protect against bioterrorism, have already passed the \nSenate and are awaiting action in the House. Another bill, to tighten \nour border security, should reach the Senate floor soon. All three \nshould be enacted quickly. You can be sure our enemies are not waiting \nfor us to act.\n  One of the greatest challenges in the struggle for security is to \nprepare for the next attack, not just the last one. We have seen how \nvicious thugs can destroy innocent life with airplanes, how they can \nterrorize ordinary people with biological weapons. We are responding to \nthose threats. But what about threats whose awful consequences we \nhaven't yet felt?\n  Today I want to talk about one of those threats: the threat of \n``cyberterrorism'', an attack against the computer networks upon which \nour safety and economy now depend. Computers have become a foundation \nof our electricity, oil, gas, water, telephones, emergency services, \nand banks, not to mention our national defense apparatus.\n  Computer networks have brought extraordinary improvements in the way \nwe live and work. We communicate more often, more quickly, more \ncheaply. With the push of a button in a classroom or a bedroom, our \nchildren can get more information than most libraries have ever held.\n  Yet there is a dark side to the internet, a new set of dangers. \nToday, if you ask an expert quietly, he or she will tell you that \ncyberspace is a very vulnerable place. Terrorists could cause terrible \nharm. They might be able to stop all traffic on the internet. Shut down \npower for entire cities for extended periods. Disrupt our phones. \nPoison our water. Paralyze our emergency services--police, \nfirefighters, ambulances. The list goes on. We now live in a world \nwhere a terrorist can do as much damage with a keyboard and a modem as \nwith a gun or a bomb.\n\n  Already, one hacker has broken into a computer-controlled waste \nmanagement system and caused millions of gallons of raw sewage to spill \ninto parks, rivers, and private property. You probably haven't heard \nabout this attack because it occurred in Australia. But imagine if \nterrorists launched calculated, coordinated attacks on America.\n  Our enemies are already targeting our networks. After September 11, a \nPakistani group hacked into two government web services, including one \nat the Department of Defense, and declared a ``cyber jihad'' against \nthe United States. Another series of attacks, known as ``Moonlight \nMaze,'' assaulted the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and NASA, and \nobtained vast quantities of technical defense research. To date, we can \nbe thankful that these attacks have not been terribly sophisticated. \nBut that could change soon. As the Defense Science Board recently \nstated, the U.S. will eventually be attached ``by a sophisticated \nadversary using an effective array of information warfare tools and\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\ntechniques. Two choices are available: adapt before the attack or \nafterward.''\n  In addition, cybercrime is already a billion-dollar drain on our \neconomy, a drain growing larger each year. In 1955, one survey reported \nthat losses from FBI-reported computer crime had already reached $2 \nbillion. Last year, the ``ILOVEYOU'' virus alone caused $8.7 billion in \ndamage worldwide, much of it here. Cyberattacks have shut down major \nweb sites like Yahoo! and eBay, not to mention the FBI. According to a \nrecent survey, 85 percent of large corporations and government agencies \ndetected computer security breaches over the prior 12 months. Two \nthirds suffered financial losses as a result.\n  So the danger is clear, and the only question is how we address it. I \nthink we need to address it in many ways. Today I want to focus on just \ntwo that are especially critical.\n  The first is to encourage computer users to take proven measures to \nprotect themselves. In the industry, these proven measures are known as \n``best practices''--steps like using customized passwords, not the ones \nthat come with software, or promptly installing known ``patches'' to \nkeep intruders out.\n  The National Academy of Sciences recently reported that cybersecurity \ntoday is far worse than what known best practices can provide. As a \nresult, viruses have shut down tens of thousands of machines even after \npatches to block them were widely available. Because the password \nprotections on some systems are so weak, intruders have taken the \n``routers'' that control Internet traffic hostage. And the government \nis as guilty as anyone. According to the report card issued by a member \nof the House of Representatives, most government agencies rate between \na ``D'' and an ``F'' on cybersecurity. Improving our security by \nimplementing existing best practices is our first big task.\n  Our second challenge is to train more researchers, teachers, and \nworkers to fight cyberthreats. Today the private sector engages in some \nshort-term R on cybersecurity. But broader research and knowledge \nneeds aren't being met. In addition, our workforce in cybersecurity is \nwoefully inadequate, especially in academia. Each year, American \nuniversities award Ph.D.'s in computer science to about one thousand \npeople each year. But less than one-half of one-percent specialize in \ncybersecurity, and fewer still go on to train others in the discipline. \nAs Dr. Bill Chu, Chairman of the Software and Information Systems \nDepartment at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and one of \nthe country's leading experts on cybersecurity puts it: ``The weakest \nlink . . .  is the lack of qualified information security \nprofessionals. The majority of information technology professionals in \nthis country have not been trained in the basics of information \nsecurity. Information technology faculty in most universities do not \nhave sufficient background to properly train students.''\n  As a whole, the challenge of cybersecurity is not unlike the \nchallenge of a terrible disease like cancer. First, we have to \nencourage everyone to do what they can to reduce the risk of disease--\ndon't smoke, eat right, exercise. That is what cybersecurity ``best \npractices'' like changing passwords are all about. Second, we have to \nmake sure we have got top-notch scientists working to find new \nmedicines to prevent and fight the disease. And that is why we need \nmore cyber teachers and researchers.\n  To tackle these two challenges, I'm proud today to introduce two new \nbills that will support an intensive, $400 million cybersecurity effort \nover the next five years. The first bill is called the Cyberterrorism \nPreparedness Act of 2002.\n  That bill's first step is to establish a new, nonprofit, \nnongovernment, consortium of academic and private sector experts to lay \nout a clear set of ``best practices'' that protect against cyberattack. \nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Institute \nfor Defense Analyses, and the President's Committee of Advisors on \nScience and Technology have all recommended a new, nonprofit \ncybersecurity consortium. Such a consortium can work closely with the \nprivate sector, unfettered by bureaucracy, in a way that all the \ncountry can see and learn from.\n\n  The goals of the consortium are simple: first, the establishment of \n``best practices'' that are tailored to different computer systems and \nneeds; second, the widest possible dissemination of those practices; \nand third, long-term, multi-disciplinary research on cybersecurity-\nresearch that isn't occurring now.\n  The second part of the Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act will implement \n``best practices'' for government systems. The government has a duty to \nlead by example, something we aren't doing right now. And so, within 6 \nmonths after this Act passed, the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology would immediately begin the process of implementing best \npractices for government agencies, beginning with small-scale tests and \nconcluding with government-wide adoption of the recommended best \npractices.\n  The last part of my bill will assess the issue of best practices for \nthe private sector. While the bill doesn't impose new mandates beyond \nthe government, it does require careful consideration of how to \nencourage the widest possible use of known best practices. There's a \nparticular focus on entities that do business with the Federal \nGovernment as grantees or contractors. Government agencies should not \nbe exposed to security vulnerabilities in the products supplied by \nthese companies. And Federal dollars should not be flowing to firms \nthat expose America to cyberterrorism. So the new consortium would be \nrequired to study whether and how government could condition grants and \ncontracts on the adoption of cybersecurity best practices. The \nPresident is authorized to implement recommendations from that study.\n  The Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act will address the first goal of \ncybersecurity--making sure we're taking the steps we already know to \nimprove our security. The second bill I am introducing today--the \nCybersecurity Research and Education Act--focuses on our second task: \n``training the trainers'' and increasing the number of researchers, \nteachers, and workers committed to cybersecurity.\n  First, the bill establishes a Cybersecurity Graduate Fellowship \nProgram at the National Science Foundation. Individuals selected to \nparticipate in the program will receive a loan that covers the full \ntuition and fees as well as a living stipend for 4 years of doctoral \nstudy. Upon graduation, these loans will be forgiven at 20 percent per \nyear for each year that the individual teaches at a college or \nuniversity. After only 5 years of teaching, the entire loan will be \npaid off. That way, we can ensure that the money we invest in these \npromising young scientists will be used to train others interested in \ncybersecurity.\n\n  Second, my bill also establishes a competitive sabbatical for \nDistinguished Faculty in Cybersecurity. Under the program, a qualified \nfaculty member will receive a stipend to spend a year working and \nresearching at the Department of Defense, a university specializing in \ncybersecurity, or some other appropriate facility. Universities sending \nfaculty on sabbatical will receive funding to hire a temporary \nreplacement instructor. In addition, when the faculty member returns, \nthe university will get a generous grant to enhance its cybersecurity \ninfrastructure needs. For example, the university could purchase \nadvanced computing equipment and hire graduate research assistants. \nParticipants in this program will have a unique opportunity to engage \nin cutting-edge research with some of the best minds in the country. \nWhen they return to their schools, these faculty will be even better \nequipped to advance the state of cybersecurity education.\n  Third, this bill will create a Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, and \nEducation Program at the National Security Agency. NSA has a strong \nhistory of supporting cybersecurity education, as exemplified through \ninitiatives such as the Centers of Excellence program and the National \nColloquium for Information Systems Security Education. The program I \npropose would build on NSA's expertise and would enable the agency to \nmake grants to universities specializing in cybersecurity. The grants \ncould be used for projects like teaching basic computer security to K-\n12 teachers, or for the development of a ``virtual university.'' \nStudents who don't\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\nhave access to nearby course offerings would then be able to take \ncybersecurity classes online.\n  All of these programs are critical in our fight against \ncyberterrorism. A strong and vibrant academic community is essential \nfor building the trained workforce of tomorrow. We must be committed to \nfunding long-term research. And we must vigilantly maintain basic \ncybersecurity protections in government, while promoting them in the \nprivate sector.\n  When it comes to the threat of a sophisticated, coordinated \ncyberterrorist attack, the question most likely is not whether such an \nattack will come. The question is when. And so we must be prepared to \nfight against a ``cyberjihad,'' and we must be prepared to win.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my two bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain small businesses to defer payment of tax; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, each year, the United States economy \ngenerates 600,000 to 800,000 new businesses. While many of these \nbusinesses will succeed, some of them will fail. Whether they succeed \nor not, one fact is without question: the entrepreneurs building these \nsmall businesses lay the foundation for our Nation's productivity \ngains, employment growth, and economic progress. In fact, although \nspecific estimates vary, economists generally agree that small, \nentrepreneurial companies generate the majority of the Nation's new \njobs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Business Retained Income \nDuring Growth and Expansion, (BRIDGE), Act, will help ensure that \nrapidly expanding, entrepreneurial businesses have access to the \ncapital they need to continue creating jobs and stimulating the \neconomy.\n  Most new business start small and stay small. A portion, however, \nevolve into fast-growth companies with the capacity to propel the \neconomy forward. For these companies, access to financing presents a \npivotal challenge. A typical small business may open its doors with a \ncombination of personal savings, credit card borrowing, and family \nlending. Informal investors, family, friends, and work associates, \ncontribute the vast majority of the $56 billion of estimated initial \nfunding for new businesses. If a business is successful, it moves to \nthe next stage of development. Unfortunately, emerging growth companies \nwill often outstrip the capital financing available based solely on the \npersonal credit or assets of the entrepreneur.\n  Capital funding gaps frequently prevail when a firm seeks financing \nin the range of $250,000 to $1 million, a period when the business is \nparticularly vulnerable. Funding needs below $250,000 are often \nfulfilled by family, friends, credit cards, home mortgages, and home \nequity lines of credit. Beyond $250,000, businesses typically turn to \nso-called ``angel'' financiers; high-interest borrowing; and in limited \ncases, Small Business Investment Companies. Venture capital is usually \nnot an option for these companies because initial venture investments \ngenerally\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\nbegin at approximately $3 million, which is far more than most early-\nstage growth companies need or warrant. When sales reach $10 million, \nthe company is better able to attract external financing at a \nreasonable cost based on the business's underlying assets.\n  Congress should take steps to ease the credit crunch for small \nbusinesses climbing the economic ladder from small to medium-size \nenterprise. When the lack of available financing prevents a growing, \nsuccessful firm from expanding into new markets, we miss an opportunity \nto create new jobs and unleash productive forces. The legislation I am \nintroducing today with Senator Olympia Snowe will help bridge the gap \nin capital financing for emerging growth companies. A companion \nmeasures has been introduced in the House by Representatives Jim DeMint \nand Brian Baird.\n  The BRIDGE Act would allow mid-sized, fast-growing businesses to \ntemporarily defer a portion of their Federal income tax liability if \nthe firm's sales for the year are at least 10 percent higher than the \naverage sales of the prior two years. The two-year deferral would be \nlimited to $250,000 of tax, which would be repayable with interest over \na four-year period. The tax-deferred amount would be deposited in a \nseparate trust account at a bank or other approved intermediary, and \nthe firm could borrow against the deferred amount, as collateral, for \nbusiness purposes. Upon sale or merger of the business, any remaining \ntax deferral would be payable at that time.\n\n  To be eligible, a small business would have to have annual gross \nreceipts of $10,000,000 or less. Partnerships and S corporations would \nalso be eligible to make the election to defer taxes. To allow adequate \nreview of this new and innovative concept, the proposal would expire at \nthe end of 2005.\n  The BRIDGE Act will free up new investment capital for fast-growing \nfirms by allowing them to use a portion of their federal tax liability \nfor self-financing. These firms experience heavy demands on their cash \nflow as they reinvest receipts, hire new employees, create additional \nmarketing channels, and purchase new equipment. Tax liability directly \ntrades off with reinvestment. The BRIDGE Act will help reduce cash flow \npressures by allowing a limited tax deferral. As the firm prospers, it \nwill repay its original tax obligation as well as additional taxes on \nits higher receipts.\n  One of the most interesting aspects of the proposal is that its long-\nterm costs are negligible. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the legislation would generate a revenue loss of $22.9 \nbillion during the first four years. However, as businesses repay \ndeferred amounts, the revenue loss would reverse, and then some. During \nthe following six years, the proposal would raise $24.1 billion. Thus, \nover the ten year budget window, the proposal would raise $1.1 billion.\n  The entrepreneurial spirit lies at the foundation of our economy's \ntechnological advances, creative innovations, and dynamic growth. We \nshould take steps to ensure that rapidly growing companies have the \nresources needed to continue producing new jobs and opportunities. The \nBRIDGE Act will free entrepreneurial businesses from the shackles of \nunmet capital funding needs and empower them to expand into new \nmarkets. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
