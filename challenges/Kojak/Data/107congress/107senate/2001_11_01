Mr. President, this morning there will be two amendments \nthat will be debated for a maximum time of 1 hour each. These \namendments are the Gregg school construction amendment and the Landrieu \ntitle I targeting amendment.\n  For the information of all Senators, there will be two votes on these \namendments that will occur a little after noon today. Therefore, there \nwill be two back-to-back votes at that time.\n  As we move forward to complete action on this important \nappropriations bill--and we are going to complete it today; if not \ntoday, we will complete it tomorrow, but we are going to complete \naction on this bill--Senators should expect other votes throughout the \nday. We have had no recorded votes the last 2 days, even though the \nmanagers have worked through a number of important issues.\n  In addition, the Senate could also act on several appropriations \nconference reports as they become available. The first one is going to \nbe voted on in the House about noon today.\n  As the majority leader announced yesterday, should we complete action \non the Labor-HHS Appropriations Act today, and any available conference \nreports, then it is likely that there would not be any rollcall votes \non Friday, November 2. The managers of the bill have been encouraging \nSenators with amendments on this finite list that has been filed to \ncome to the floor and work with them on these amendments.\n  When we finish the votes at noon today, Senator Brownback has a \nnumber of amendments that the managers have been unable to resolve. I \nask he make himself available at that time to offer these amendments.\n  If there are other Senators wishing to offer amendments, they should \ncome forward and make their amendments known to the rest of us. We have \na finite list, but a number of Senators have indicated to the managers \nand to me that they are not going to offer those amendments. We need to \ncomplete action on this bill so we can move forward to other very \npressing matters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Nevada in urging \nour colleagues to come forward. It has been very slow making progress. \nThere were some 62 possible amendments listed. Most of those are place-\nholders, we know. But anybody who has an amendment to offer ought to \ncome to the floor now. Senator Harkin and I will be in a position to \ndiscuss the matters with you, to see what is acceptable, see what will \nrequire rollcall votes, to try to work out time agreements, and try to \nmove ahead to finish this bill as early today as possible.\n  It is no secret, Senators have a lot of commitments on Friday, and \nThursday is the heavy workday. But the sooner\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\nwe get this bill completed, the sooner we can move ahead and try to get \nit conferenced and resolved.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment? I want to make \nsure everyone understands what the majority leader said. We are going \nto complete this bill and conference reports before we leave this week.\n  Also, if we complete work on the bill, we could move to the D.C. \nappropriations bill, but at the very least we are going to complete the \nconference reports and complete this bill before we leave, no matter \nhow long it takes today or tomorrow.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Hampshire is recognized to offer an amendment, on \nwhich there shall be 60 minutes debate to be equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2056\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the two \nmanagers of the bill in setting up a timeframe for this amendment.\n  We have discussed this issue innumerable times in this Chamber. This \nis the issue of whether or not we are going to fund, at the expense of \nlow-income children, school construction. The amendment is very simple. \nIt takes money which is not authorized--in fact, the dollars which are \nbeing spent under this school construction account, that authorization \nwas rejected by this Congress, by this Senate on innumerable \noccasions--it takes the money which is being spent under this \nappropriations bill, which is therefore not authorized, and moves it \ninto the authorized account of the title I targeted formula, the \ntargeted formula being that formula which benefits low-income children \nin this country.\n  The purpose of funding under the Federal education initiatives has \nbasically two goals. Our primary responsibility as a Federal Government \ninvolves two basic areas in elementary and secondary school education. \nThe first is special education funding, IDEA funding.\n  I congratulate this committee and Senator Harkin and Senator Specter \nfor the tremendous job they have done in the area of funding special \neducation. They have added over $1 billion in the special education \naccounts. That is very appropriate.\n  The second primary purpose authorized by the Federal Government and \nchosen by us as a Congress as to where we were going to focus Federal \nattention is in helping low-income children be more competitive in \ntheir school systems and have an opportunity to succeed along with kids \nwho do not come from low-income families. Thus, we have put an \nexceptional commitment of resources into those accounts.\n  Unfortunately, it is a formula which was put in place 6 years ago to \ntarget the Federal money for kids who come from low-income backgrounds. \nIt has never been adequately funded--in fact, was never funded at all \nuntil this bill. Instead, we have peeled dollar after dollar off for \nother programmatic activity, which is not the primary thrust of the \nFederal effort.\n  Specifically, in the area of school construction, which we have \nrejected as a purpose of Federal responsibility, it being traditionally \nthe responsibility of the States and the local communities to make the \ndecisions as to what school construction should occur, we have now put \nin this bill $925 million for this program of school construction which \nis not authorized. We have essentially taken that $925 million away \nfrom the title I children--the low-income kids. We have taken it away \nfrom the targeted funding formula.\n  My amendment very simply takes the unauthorized construction money \nand moves it back to the authorized new targeted title I formula so \nthat low-income children will get the dollars and the support from the \nFederal Government.\n  The practical implications of this for each State are reflected in a \nchart which is going to be made available to every Member of the \nSenate, which I hope they will take the time to review. It shows that \nevery State is essentially a winner under this amendment. The new \ntargeted formula, when initially funded by the $925 million, \nsignificantly increases the money under title I that flows to low-\nincome kids for every State.\n  What is happening under the school construction money? It doesn't go \nto low-income children. It can go to rich districts. It can go to poor \ndistricts. It can go anywhere you want in the school system. It can \nalso go, for example, for the purposes of school safety, which makes it \nnot only unauthorized under this bill but duplicative of the money we \nalready put into the system for school safety in the Commerce-State-\nJustice bill.\n  We are spending $925 million for bricks and mortar. That was a \nprogram rejected by both the Senate and the House. It does not have any \nstrong component of poverty in it. This basically can be a welfare-to-\nrich-district funding mechanism. It is being done at the expense of \nlow-income kids.\n  We know for a fact that our low-income children simply aren't getting \nwhat they need out of the school system. We are about to reauthorize \nthe ESEA bill in an attempt to do a better job with the dollars that \nare directed to low-income schools. But we know, regrettably, that 70 \npercent of the children in high-poverty schools score below the most \nbasic levels in reading; that two out of three African-American and \nHispanic fourth graders can barely read; in math in high-poverty \nschools, they remain two grade levels behind their peers; in reading, \nthey are three to four grade levels behind their peers; that half the \nstudents in our urban school districts don't graduate at all.\n  It makes no sense, when we are supposed to be funding a formula \ntargeted for low-income kids who obviously need more support as \nreflected by those statistics, that we end up instead funding a bricks-\nand-mortar program that can go to high-end school districts and which \nis not authorized and which is duplicative of at least three other \nmajor programs we have at the Federal level that are authorized and \nthat are funded.\n  The result of my amendment is essentially this. A State such as \nLouisiana--I see the Senator from Louisiana in the Chamber--would \nreceive a 21-percent increase as a result of this amendment in their \ntitle I count. It would be targeted. A State such as California would \nreceive a 37-percent increase. It would be targeted to the low-income \npoverty districts and students.\n\n  When we pass the ESEA bill on which we reached agreement in \nconference,\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\nwe will give those low-income districts strong, new tools to help those \nkids in those districts catch up with their peers. But those tools will \nonly work if there are dollars to support them.\n  This amendment goes a long way down the road to accomplishing the \ngoal of getting the dollars where the Federal Government has set the \npriorities, the dollars to the low-income child instead of to some sort \nof grandiose bricks-and-mortar program that may not benefit the low-\nincome child at all.\n  That is the concept of this amendment. It is really pretty simple. It \ntakes $925 million out of a program which has been on two different \noccasions rejected by this Senate, the school construction program, and \nmoves it to the new targeted formula for low-income kids under title I.\n  I hope everybody here will review how their State benefits from this \nin their title I accounts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2056\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 2056.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wonder if the Senator is speaking to my amendment or her \namendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will speak, unfortunately, against the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I presume the Senator is taking her time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take the time from my side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Iowa yield \ntime to the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I yield such time as the Senator desires.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I find myself in an unusual and awkward \nposition because I normally come to the floor to support the amendments \nof the Senator from New Hampshire and to support his great efforts and \nhis leadership in reforming education. He truly has been a clarion \nvoice to lead us in many of the ways we really need to go in this \ncountry. His commitment is really exemplary. I find myself in an \nawkward position to oppose the amendment he has offered on a couple of \nvery valid grounds.\n  One is, while in a bipartisan way we certainly have supported, along \nwith the President, targeting our dollars more carefully so that the \nFederal dollars actually bolster the reform efforts at the State level \nby helping Governors and mayors and school board members who are on the \nfront lines who are trying to reform education, we have attempted this \nyear for the first time --which is a pretty extraordinary victory we \nare about to achieve--to target more of our Federal dollars to reach \nthose Governors, to reach those school boards, and to reach those \nmayors who are struggling to rebuild their systems. So the Senator is \ncorrect when he speaks about the need to target.\n\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Specter have done a magnificent job on \nthis great piece of legislation to accomplish many of these new goals. \nThe underlying bill indeed does that. For the first time, we will be \nlaying down $1 billion through the targeting grants to help close the \ngap between those counties, and parishes in Louisiana, that have \ngreater capacity to fund their schools and those counties and parishes \nthat have less capacity. That is clearly one role where there is \nvirtually no disagreement that the Federal Government should fill: to \nbe actively engaged in leveling the playing field between the richer \nand the poorer districts. That is the American way. That is what the \nunderlying bill does.\n  I understand Senator Gregg is saying: Let's not put any money in \nschool construction; let's take that money and add it to targeting. I \nwould normally be supportive of that because many of us have been \nleading the fight for targeting. But as important as it is for teachers \nto be given new tools, and for us to support these reform efforts, \nchildren cannot learn without the right physical facilities. It is very \nimportant.\n  They do not need palaces such as this one or Taj Mahals, but they do \nneed warmth in the wintertime. They do need to have fresh air in hot \nsummers. They do need to be able to walk in safety in schools and not \nhave inadequate windows or light fixtures or be in buildings that make \nit impossible to learn. They do need to have electrical systems in \ntheir buildings so they can install their computers and get on line and \nhave other high-tech tools of learning.\n  I do not have to explain to the Presiding Officer or to many Members \nin this Chamber how deficient our schools are. So let's not move money \nfrom one very important program, which is school construction, to \ntargeting. That\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\nis why I will have to oppose the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  We can do the school construction funding so that we can help build \nour schools and give our children the kind of physical facilities they \nneed to meet these new goals and standards.\n  This is not the time to stop job creation in America. Let me repeat, \nthis is not the time to stop job creation in America. Millions of \npeople are out of work because of the September 11 attacks and \nsubsequent attacks because of their effect on our economy.\n  One billion dollars under Senator Harkin's and Senator Specter's \namendment--of which there is the attempt to move--will put 24,000 \npeople who live in Georgia, in Louisiana, in Iowa, and in New Hampshire \nto work.\n  One billion dollars spent on school construction will employ 24,000 \npeople. Believe me, there are people in all of our States who want the \nFederal Government to spend money on public investments. What better \nplace could we be spending money than building schools for our future, \ngiving our children a chance for a first-class quality education?\n  Finally, I will say this: I know the Republican leadership has not \nbeen excited about school construction. They have fought it every step \nof the way. There have been some Republicans who have supported it. The \nRepublican leadership is against the idea of the Federal Government \ngetting involved with school construction. And that argument has merit. \nI am not saying it does not.\n  But in light of September 11, I would hope the arguments on the other \nside would weaken because we need to be putting Americans to work. \nThese are good construction jobs. And they do two things. They give a \nman or a woman a job, so he or she can bring home a pay check to feed \ntheir family and pay their mortgage. By doing that, you are also \ninvesting in our children by building schools so they can compete in \nthe challenging world which we all now face.\n  Those are the arguments. Again, I hate to oppose the Senator, but I \nam opposing this amendment on those grounds. And I ask other Members to \njoin with me in that opposition and to support the mark of the chairman \nand the ranking member.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask Senator Gregg to yield me 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator whatever time he needs.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, because we are \ndebating this amendment, that I be able to proceed on my amendment, \nwhich is also pending, for 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2055, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk, a very \nsimple modification. This amendment would be in order when this other \namendment is over, so rather than just wait I thought I would do it and \nget out of everybody's way.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2055), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       After line 7 on page 9, insert the following:\n       ``(6) Protecting the constitutional right of all \n     firefighters, law enforcement officers and public safety \n     employees who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect \n     our property, freedoms and loved ones in exercising their \n     right to follow their conscience in whether or not to join a \n     labor organization or pay dues or fees to a labor \n     organization in connection with their decision to pursue a \n     career dedicated to service and sacrifice in defense of the \n     innocent in order to provide for their own families.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when I offered my amendment yesterday, in \nguaranteeing the right, under the Daschle amendment, for people to join \nor not join a union, I did not include the critical right for them, if \nthey choose not to join a union, to not have to pay union dues. I have \ncorrected this with this modification. It fits the principle we set \nout.\n  The Daschle amendment preempts State law and preempts county \nordinances and city ordinances to set up a structure for unionism in \npolice and fire and sheriff departments. I am opposed to that. But it \nseems to me, if the Federal Government is going to preempt State law \nand preempt counties and cities to set up a structure for unionism, it \nought to also allow people to decide if they do not want to be members \nof the union and they do not want to pay union dues. So through this \nmodification, I have corrected that problem.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2056\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are again. Senator Gregg, my \nfriend from New Hampshire, is trying to say we have no obligation to \nhelp our local schools meet safety and fire codes and to renovate and \nrebuild our schools.\n  I find it kind of an odd argument to say we have no responsibility, \nto say what he said earlier, that this is a State and local \nresponsibility. After all, we use Federal moneys for rural water \nsystems in this country. Should that be a State and local \nresponsibility? His State gets some of that. There are waste water \nprograms, bridges, highways, all kinds of things that the Federal \nGovernment is involved in in terms of construction.\n  As we look around the country, we see our schools are falling down. \nThe average age is 42 years old. Fourteen million kids attend school in \nbuildings that are unsafe or inadequate. So, quite frankly, there is a \ncrying need out there for school construction.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers, in their report card on \nAmerica's infrastructure, listed schools as the worst. They listed \nbridges and roads and highways and sewage disposal systems and \nairports, but the one that got the lowest grade was our public schools \nin America.\n  My friend, with his amendment, basically is going to take the money \nand put it into title I. So I think what he is trying to do is put all \nthe money in title I to send poor kids to poor schools.\n\n  I am not saying we should not be doing more for title I. That is why \nI am going to be supporting the Cochran-Landrieu amendment, which I \nthink is a better formula for title I. But I find it odd that the \nSenator from New Hampshire said we don't need to fix up these schools; \nwe just need to put more funds in for these poor kids. And they will go \nto schools that are unsafe, insecure, with ceilings that are cracked \nand with water leaking in. They do not meet fire and water safety \ncodes. They are not wired for the Internet. That is all right; we will \nsend them there anyway. I find that an odd argument.\n  I believe this is, indeed, a Federal responsibility. The way we have \nconstructed this, I say to my friend from New Hampshire, is that the \nmoney goes to the States. Then the States decide how to allocate this \nmoney out to local school districts. So we are not saying exactly how \nit is spent. This is sort of a State grant. I think my friend from New \nHampshire has been a big supporter of block grants in the past. This \nbasically is what it is. This goes out to the States and lets the \nStates decide where it goes.\n  Quite frankly, I have a chart in the Chamber which shows how much \nmoney goes out to the different States and where this money goes. The \nfact is, we have already seen that in the last year we put in $1.2 \nbillion for school repair and renovation. Forty-one States have already \nasked for and received their grants. That indicates to me there is a \nreal need out there. If there was not a need out there, the States \nwould not have asked for this money.\n  Thirdly, this money is leveraged greatly. From the experience we had \nin my own State of Iowa, $28 million over 3 years went out for school \nconstruction and renovation.\n  That $28 million was leveraged by State and local governments to the \ntune of $311 million, over a 10-to-1 leverage. It seems to me any time \nwe can spend a taxpayer's dollar and we can get a 10-to-1 leverage in \nour local communities and States and we can do something of lasting \nvalue, which is to\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\nrepair schools and build new schools so that our kids have the latest \ntechnologies, that is a pretty good investment of taxpayers' money. \nThat is exactly what is happening. They are leveraging this money in a \nbig way.\n  Here is a chart; it is kind of busy. I will hold it up. This \nindicates all of the renovation funding that went out this last year \nfor different States. I see that some of the States received more than \nothers based upon population and a few other factors. This would be the \nkind of money that would be lost for school construction if, in fact, \nthe amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire prevailed.\n  Lastly, everyone is talking about a stimulus package. We have \nstimulated the economy. This is what Senator Landrieu was discussing. \nWe want to put people to work around this country. What job needs to be \ndone more than repairing and modernizing our schools? We get a lot of \nbang for this buck. We get economic stimulus. We will put people to \nwork immediately. These jobs are ready to go. There are schools all \nover this country that already have their plans in place, that have \nrequests in for modernizing, for fixing up their ceilings, meeting fire \nand safety codes. This is something we can do right away. It stimulates \nthe economy. It puts people to work. We get better schools. We leverage \nthe money all over the country.\n  I don't see why we would want to pull the rug out from underneath \nthis right now. This money goes to the States and from the States to \nthe local school districts. I believe this is an important element for \nus in the Federal Government. People say we haven't done it before, \nthat this is something new. Is that the reason we are here? Just to \ncontinue to plow the same old ground over and over again?\n  I keep asking, where in the Constitution of the United States does it \nsay elementary and secondary education is to be funded only by property \ntaxes? It is nowhere in the Constitution. That is just the way it \nsprung up because in the early days of our country we wanted to have a \nfree public education for everyone--for white males at that time but \nfor everyone later on. There was no taxing base. All they had was \nproperty taxes and a few excise and tariff taxes. It was not until 1914 \nor 1917 that we had the income tax. So there were no other tax bases. \nWe grew up a system in this country based on property taxes.\n  That is all broken down. We provide Pell grants for kids to go to \ncollege. Under elementary and secondary education, we provide teacher \ntraining, funding for special education. We do all of this. Why \nshouldn't we use the power in the Federal Government to help our State \nand local schools repair and modernize, build new facilities for the \nnew century for our kids.\n  In every case where I have seen this work, the money has been \nleveraged 6, 7, as much as 10 to 1 in those State and local \ncommunities.\n  Especially with the economy going down, this is not the time to pull \nthe rug out from underneath school construction.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire for yielding time to me.\n  I will take just a minute or two and suggest that this amendment that \nis offered by the Senator from New Hampshire has great merit because it \nshifts funds into a program that has historically been grossly \nunderfunded. The title I program has about four different categories of \nauthorized funding in it. Over the last several years only two of those \nprograms have been funded by the Congress.\n  I am supporting an effort to increase the funding in the targeted \nassistance so States such as mine, who have high concentrations of poor \nstudents, will have a better chance of providing the quality of \neducation opportunity those students deserve and which is needed so \nmuch by the poor students.\n  Sixty-five percent of the students in my State have been classified \nby our State department of education as poor within the meaning of the \nterm in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that contains this \ntitle I funding.\n  This program was begun in an effort not to supplant the State's \nresponsibilities but to emphasize the importance of reaching out to \nthose who had not been well served by the public education school \nsystem, and those were the poor students. Most of those communities \nhave low tax bases, not much business activity, high rates of \nunemployment. The funding that goes into education in most States comes \nfrom real estate taxes and other taxes at the local level. States \nprovide some of the funds, but most of the money comes from local \nproperty owners. The deck is stacked against those students who live in \nthose poor communities.\n  The Federal Government realized it had a responsibility to try to \nhelp. We are not trying to take over the running of the schools in \ntitle I. We don't want that.\n  Just as recently as this spring, I had hearings in my State and \nmeetings with the State board of education to talk about the title I \nprogram and how we could better design it so it would provide the \nneeded financial resources to deal with these particular problems of \npoor students.\n  Uniformly, I was told that losses in these funds or reductions in \nthese funds would be devastating for our school system in Mississippi. \nSo I am supporting the Gregg amendment because I think it tries to \nemphasize the importance of title I and provides more funds for title \nI. I will also cosponsor and vote for the Landrieu amendment. It is not \nan either/or proposition for the Senate. That is what I am saying. We \ncan vote for both. I think we should.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nmaking that very excellent point. This is not an either/or choice. We \ncan vote for the Landrieu-Cochran amendment, and we can vote for this \nbecause essentially what this amendment does is take the construction \nmoney and move it into the title I targeted formula. What the Landrieu \namendment does is restructure the new money for title I and reallocate \nsome of it to the targeted formula, some of it to the equity formula.\n  As a practical matter, the two are not exclusive. You can support \nboth. If you are interested in getting more money into the title I \naccounts and especially more money into the accounts that benefit low-\nincome kids under the targeted formula, then you should definitely vote \nfor this amendment which takes the money from the school construction \naccounts.\n  Just to cite a couple examples: California, under present law, gets \n$1.15 billion; under this proposal, they would get $1.5 billion. So \nthey pick up about $430 million out of this account which would be \ngoing into the targeted formula.\n  Florida gets $400 million. Under this proposal, they get $558 \nmillion. That is $158 million going to the targeted formula.\n  The State of the presiding Senator from Georgia would get $250 \nmillion under present law; $330 million would go into the title I \nformula.\n  Yes, it means there wouldn't be school construction money going into \nthose States, but what would be happening is that dollars would now be \nflowing directly into the accounts which benefit low-income kids rather \nthan into a general account which, as the Senator from Iowa mentioned, \nis basically where the States make the decision. It can go to a rich \ndistrict or a poor district. It can go to Safe and Drug Free Schools, \nwhich we already fund under another account, or it can go to security, \nwhich we fund under another account, which is duplicative. The purpose \nof the Federal dollar should be to get the money to low-income kids. \nThat is why we need to fund these targeted formulas, especially in \nareas where you have a large concentration of low-income children. That \nis why this amendment makes a lot of sense.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his comments and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Gregg amendment.\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\nThis amendment would entirely eliminate the $925 million in this bill \nthat is intended to help school districts with critical construction \nand renovation needs, and instead divert it to title I. I strongly \nsupport both of these important programs. Title I serves our Nation's \nmost disadvantaged children and helps ensure that they have the same \neducational opportunities as more affluent children. I am pleased that \nthe bill before us includes a nearly $1.5 billion increase in title I \nfor fiscal year 2002. I am committed to working to further increase \ntitle I funding this year and in future years, as it is the cornerstone \nof our Federal commitment to help low-income students succeed.\n  While I appreciate the goals of the Gregg amendment and agree that \ntitle I must be one of our top priorities, I cannot support it at the \nexpense of legitimate and urgent school construction needs. In my home \nState of Wisconsin, nearly 80 percent of schools were built before \n1969. In a recent survey of 881 Wisconsin schools, the total statewide \ncost of all repairs and renovations that are needed to put schools in \ngood overall condition was $1.55 billion. Clearly, we have a serious \nneed to address school construction and renovation.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment presents the Senate with a false and \nunnecessary choice. I agree that we need to do more for low-income \nchildren, and I intend to support the amendment to be offered by \nSenator Landrieu that will put more money into title I and target it to \nthe lowest income students. But we cannot expect a child to learn in an \nold, dilapidated, or unsafe school with no access to the tools and \ntechnology that are so much a part of education today.\n  The Gregg amendment would force us to abandon one critical education \nprogram for another, but I believe we can and must make both a \npriority. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gregg amendment and to \nsupport the Landrieu amendment later on, to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment provides funding for both school construction and assistance \nto low-income students. We can afford to do both.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are debating allocation of Federal \nfunds among quite a number of very worthwhile programs. When you talk \nabout basic State grants, concentration grants, an effort for targeted \nassistance, they are all very meritorious. The difficulty our \nsubcommittee has in making an allocation is in trying to establish \npriorities. We have $925 million allocated for school construction.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has a laudable purpose. The Senator \nfrom Mississippi articulates laudable goals. But we have done the best \nwe can in the appropriations process in making the allocations among \nmany priorities that we think to be appropriate. Title I has in excess \nof $11 billion going to needy children, which is the largest \nallocation. We have been debating the issue of school construction for \na long time. The former Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, \nbrought this forward several years ago, as has Senator Harkin.\n  My conclusion is to support what the subcommittee report has and, \nreluctantly, to oppose what the Senator from New Hampshire wants, and \nwhat the Senator from Mississippi would like to have, because their \ngoals are laudable.\n  I think it is important, as the Senator from Iowa points out, that \nthere was leveraging of these funds. It is never easy to say where a \nFederal responsibility ends and where a State responsibility begins. \nIdeally, the funding perhaps should come from State and local \ngovernment, not the Federal Government at all.\n  We have been in the field, and we have added very substantial \ndollars. There is now in excess of $41 billion. We added $6 billion \nlast year.\n  One of the difficulties with school construction is that the $925 \nmillion allocation is questionable, as to how far that will go on the \nschool needs of America. We had a very tough debate on this issue last \nyear when Republicans controlled the Senate and President Clinton, a \nDemocrat, was in the White House. We ended up with an allocation for \nschool construction of $1.175 billion, but we put in language that if, \nafter due deliberation, the school boards on a local basis decided they \ndid not want the money for school construction, they could use it for \nother educational needs--virtually a block grant. That language and \nthat approach has been maintained here.\n  I am not saying local boards are going to turn down school \nconstruction money. But in the event that does happen, the school \ndistricts will be able to make the allocations as they see fit on a \nlocal basis.\n  Senator Harkin has been a strong advocate for school construction \nbeyond any cap. I was supportive of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun when \nshe advanced this idea several years ago to sort of give it a start. \nAlthough you could allocate these funds in many different directions, \narguably with forceful positions, it is my stance that we have made an \nappropriate allocation and this $925 million is appropriate. So I am \ngoing to support the chairman and the subcommittee report, which we \nhave submitted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself another 3 minutes.\n  I thank my colleague and the ranking member, Senator Specter, for his \nsupport of this amendment. We have worked very closely together over \nthe years, and it was sort of a sign of Senator Specter that allowed \nsome of this money to go out to the States and if in fact they do not \nneed it for construction, they can use it for other purposes. So this \nis a great help to those local school districts.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If my colleague will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we called those the ``Harkin hoops'' last \nyear. They have to survive the Harkin hoops. If not, they go to local.\n  Another comment is worth articulating, and that is, when we sit down \nand go over these accounts, it is no surprise that Tom Harkin and Arlen \nSpecter have a lot of different views. We hammer them out, and we come \nto accommodations.\n  This is a program that is very near and dear to Senator Harkin's \nheart. Again, to repeat, which I don't like to do, I supported it with \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun many years ago. There are many \naccommodations in this bill where Senator Harkin was not so \nenthusiastic and I was more enthusiastic, so that when we come to the \ntime of presenting the arguments and the position on the floor, I am \ngoing to stay with the agreements we reached in the subcommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. We have had a good \nworking relationship. I think this is just another indication of how we \ncan reach bipartisan agreements in committees by working together.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from Rebuild America's Schools. This \nis a consortium of gripes including the National PTA, National \nEducation Association, National School Boards Association, National \nRural Education Association, and a number of others. This letter is \ndated October 30, 2001. It says:\n\n       Rebuild America's School writes in strong support of the \n     $925 million for the Emergency School Repair Program included \n     in the Senate version of H.R. 3061.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The resources provided under last year's legislation \n     combined with the funds included in the FY02 Senate \n     appropriations bill will help fix leaky roofs and repair \n     faulty plumbing, heating, and electrical systems. These \n     resources will also enable districts to address other \n     dangerous health and safety concerns in their schools, such \n     as the presence of lead paint and asbestos in the classroom.\n       The importance of an FY02 school repair program gains even \n     more relevance in the face of revenue shortfalls resulting \n     from the recent downturn in our Nation's economy. These \n     expected losses might force State and local governments to \n     cut or roll back education spending, particularly in the area \n     of capital projects. In addition to providing much-needed \n     fiscal relief to States and local school districts, funds for \n     emergency school repairs will help to create construction \n     jobs on the local level as each billion dollars invested in \n     school construction is estimated to generate approximately \n     24,000 jobs. Also, these expenditures will have a multiplier \n     effect on local economies by benefiting all of the \n     construction-related industries that provide material and \n     other types of support for infrastructure projects.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\n                                    Rebuild America's Schools,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health \n         and Human Services and Education, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Rebuild America's Schools (RAS) writes \n     in strong support of the $925 million for the Emergency \n     School Repair Program included in the Senate version of HR \n     3061, the FY 02 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations \n     bill. RAS is a coalition of national organizations and school \n     districts from across the nation working to increase federal \n     support to assist local communities to build, renovate and \n     modernize school facilities. We strongly oppose any amendment \n     that may be offered that would cut or eliminate funding for \n     this critical program.\n       This appropriation addresses the rapidly growing need to \n     improve our nation's school buildings at a time when \n     communities across the country are struggling to renovate and \n     repair aged school facilities. Students in virtually every \n     state are attending classes in overcrowded buildings with \n     leaky roofs, crumbling ceilings and outdated ventilation and \n     heating systems. In fact, according to the American Institute \n     of Architects, one in every three public schools in America \n     needs major repair. The American Society of Civil Engineers \n     recently reported that school facilities are in worse \n     condition than any other part of our nation's infrastructure. \n     In addition, a June 2000 study report by the National Center \n     for Education Statistics reported that 11 million students--\n     one in every four--attended schools in less than adequate \n     condition, and 3.5 million of these students in school \n     buildings in poor condition.\n       HR 3061 builds on legislation passed in the 106th Congress \n     that provided $1.2 billion in grants to high-need school \n     districts to pay the cost of urgent repairs and renovations. \n     As of the beginning of the 2001 school year, 42 states and 2 \n     outlying areas had submitted applications for their funding \n     grants under this program. The resources provided under last \n     year's legislation combined with the funds included in the FY \n     02 Senate appropriations bill will help to fix leaky roofs \n     and repair faulty plumbing, heating, and electrical systems. \n     These resources will also enable districts to address other \n     dangerous health and safety concerns in their schools, such \n     as the presence of lead paint and asbestos in the classroom.\n       The importance of an FY 02 school repair program gains even \n     more relevance in the face of revenue shortfalls resulting \n     from the recent downturn in our nation's economy. These \n     expected losses might force state and local governments to \n     cut or rollback education spending, particularly in the area \n     of capital projects. In addition to providing much needed \n     fiscal relief to states and local school districts, funds for \n     emergency school repairs will help to create construction \n     jobs on the local level as each billion dollars invested in \n     school construction is estimated to generate approximately \n     24,000 jobs. Also, these expenditures will have a multiplier \n     effect on local economies by benefiting all of the \n     construction-related industries that provide material and \n     other types of support for infrastructure projects\n       Rebuild America's Schools and its membership supports \n     inclusion of a $925 million Emergency School Repair program \n     in HR 3061, and provisions that continue to ensure that the \n     urgent repair needs of our high poverty, rural and Indian \n     schools are all addressed. In addition to these funds in this \n     education appropriations bill, we support providing a larger \n     amount of assistance for school repairs as part of the \n     economic stimulus bill. We believe extending this initiative \n     will go a long way in helping communities across America fix \n     crumbling, unsafe, and unhealthy schools, and ultimately help \n     to create the learning environments our children will need to \n     succeed in the 21st century.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert P. Canavan,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I keep hearing this argument that \nthis money can go to rich as well as poor districts. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire says take this money and put it all into poor districts. \nI find that an odd position for my friend to take since he is a very \nstrong supporter of States rights. This money goes to the States. If \nthe State government in New Hampshire wants to put that money into the \nrichest school districts, I assume they can do that. I don't think \nState governments would do that.\n  Our experience from the last year is that States take this money and \nfocus it on those very districts where they have a low tax base because \nthey have poor housing in low-income areas. That is where they focus \nthe attention for school construction, not in rich areas. So I assume \nthe Senator is saying he doesn't trust the State governments to do \nthis. Well, I think they will do this. They will focus it on the poor \ndistricts.\n  Lastly, I wish to make this point, and I think my friend knows this. \nIn the conference that we are now in on the education bill, the \nreauthorization of elementary and secondary education, there is a \nprovision the Senate adopted unanimously that provides for the full \nfunding, 40 percent funding that the Federal Government should be doing \nfor special education. That is supported strongly on the Senate side. \nThe House is sort of wavering on that, but they may actually come \nacross in support. If that is the case, that will free up a lot of \nmoney which we can then use to help our title I schools. I am making \nthe argument in conference right now that if the House will help us to \nprovide the mandatory funding for special education, that will free up \na lot of money which we can then put into title I programs. We should \nnot sacrifice school construction for that. As I said before, it does \nnot make much sense to put a lot of money in to sending poor kids to \npoor schools. Let us help both. Let us help title I, and let us help \nrebuild our schools.\n\n  Mr. President, there is an article that appears in Education Week \nabout Federal funding for school renovation. The title of it is ``Iowa \nIs Laboratory For Federal Role In Building Schools.'' They went out and \nlooked at a number of schools that received some of the Federal funds \nfor innovation and rebuilding.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Education Week, Oct. 24, 2001]\n\n        Iowa Is Laboratory for Federal Role in Building Schools\n\n                          (By Joetta L. Sack)\n\n       The teachers at Decatur City Elementary School had become \n     accustomed to the eccentricities of their 1915-era building. \n     Despite its sloping concrete floors, its basement room used \n     as both a gym and a cafeteria, and its out-of-the-way \n     location, some admit they'd even grown fond of this little \n     block-shaped, brick schoolhouse.\n       Sentimentality aside, leaders of the Central Decatur \n     schools here on southern Iowa's rolling plains knew the \n     structure was impractical and potentially dangerous. So they \n     raised, local funds to add a wing to the district's secondary \n     school, making room for the elementary school's staff and 115 \n     pupils.\n       To help the cause, the district received a $500,000 federal \n     grant through a program earmarked for Iowa districts that was \n     created in 1997 at the behest of the state's Democratic U.S. \n     senator, Tom Harkin.\n       While Washington lawmakers were debating whether the \n     federal government should wade into school construction aid, \n     the veteran senator used his considerable influence to set up \n     a ``demonstration project'' in his Midwestern state. Now in \n     its fourth year, the program has channeled, $37 million to \n     the state, and the 750-student Central Decatur district and \n     other Iowa school systems are seeing the rewards.\n       The program could be construed as pork, yet another example \n     of a powerful lawmaker feathering his political nest by \n     bringing home the maximum number of federal tax dollars. Iowa \n     after all, does not qualify as the state most in need of \n     school construction help, according to recent data.\n       But Sen. Harkin, who chairs the subcommittee on education, \n     labor, and health of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \n     speaks proudly of the program a success. And with Congress at \n     odds over whether to continue a much larger school renovation \n     program begun in the just-ended 2001 fiscal year, the senator \n     contends that the Iowa program is proof that money for school \n     buildings should remain in the federal government's \n     portfolio.\n       Nobody questions the need for school repairs and \n     renovations nationwide, estimates range from $112 billion to \n     $250 billion or more to bring all school facilities to basic \n     levels, and nearly every district has seen problems with \n     overcrowding or decaying buildings. Mr. Harkin's program in \n     Iowa gives grants for emergency repairs or new construction.\n       ``The most pressing needs are the schools that need to be \n     brought up to fire and safety codes,'' Sen. Harkin said last \n     week. ``And then, we just have a lot of old schools in \n     Iowa, like a lot of states do, that need to be rebuilt or \n     totally refurbished.''\n       In the final days of last year's appropriations process, \n     the senator--then the ranking minority member on the \n     subcommittee he now chairs--helped win approval of the \n     national program, which is based on his Iowa experiment. The \n     fiscal 2001 budget included $1.2 billion for emergency \n     repairs.\n       Now, Congress must decide whether to continue the national \n     program and the Iowa grants. As the fiscal 2002 \n     appropriations bills make their way through the process this \n     year the version passed by the now-Democratic-controlled \n     Senate appropriations committee includes continuation of the \n     funding at about 80 percent of the 2001 level, while the \n     House version eliminates it.\n       President Bush favors eliminating the school renovation \n     funds.\n       ``School construction is an area where the federal \n     government does not have a meaningful role, and never did,'' \n     said Lindsey\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\n     Kozberg, a spokeswoman for Secretary of Education Rod Paige.\n       The administration has, however, proposed a new facilities \n     program for charter schools and wants to drastically increase \n     construction funding for schools under the impact-aid \n     program. Impact aid sends federal grants to school districts \n     whose property-tax bases are directly affected by the \n     presence of nontaxable federal facilities, such as military \n     bases.\n       Appropriators won't decide whether to continue the Iowa \n     program until the two bills reach a House-Senate conference \n     committee. But a Senate Democratic aide said that Sen. \n     Harkin, because of his seniority and influence, is always \n     granted a pot of money to spend as he chooses, and the \n     program likely will continue.\n       ``If he wants it, he'll get it,'' the aide said.\n\n\n                        tending to constituents\n\n       Mr. Harkin, who has named the school construction program \n     the ``Harkin grants,'' often hosts back-home events on \n     concerns such as education, health care, and agriculture.\n       ``The image we see here is that he's involved in education \n     a lot,'' said Joseph S. Drips, the superintendent of the \n     4,700-student Southeast Polk district in the Des Moines \n     suburbs, which also received a Harkin grant.\n       A report released last year by the National Education \n     Association, a strong proponent of federal aid for school \n     construction, ranked Iowa 25th among the states in school \n     modernization needs, with a total estimate of $3.9 billion \n     for infrastructure and technology needs.\n       Iowa has seen an economic downturn and declining population \n     in recent years, which have squeezed its budget. And the \n     state has seen its center of gravity shift from farms to more \n     urban areas, meaning that some urban districts are facing \n     unprecedented growth while some rural districts struggle \n     to stay open.\n       ``The needs generally run across the board,'' said Marcus \n     J. Haack, the associate executive director of School \n     Administrators of Iowa. While the money from the Harkin \n     grants has helped, his group advocates a more comprehensive \n     over-haul of school finance.\n       Now nearing the end of his third term in the Senate, Mr. \n     Harkin has become a fixture as one of the Democrats' more \n     liberal members. But he represents a state almost evenly \n     divided between Democrats and Republicans--Al Gore took the \n     state in the presidential race last year by just 4,144 vote. \n     Mr. Harkin won his last election in 1996, with only 52 \n     percent of the vote.\n       Programs such as the school construction grants could be \n     his lifeline to elected office, said Jack Jennings, the \n     director's of the Center on Education Policy, a research and \n     advocacy organization in Washington. Although some Iowa \n     voters have qualms about his views, they are pleased the \n     Senator brings so much money back to the state, Mr. Jennings \n     said.\n       ``What he has done is balance his liberalism with great \n     attention to constituent needs,'' said Mr. Jennings, who is a \n     former aide to House Democrats.\n       But Sen. Harkin also has consistently pushed for a \n     nationwide school construction program. He first proposed a \n     plan during his unsuccessful 1992 presidential campaign, and \n     since then, has joined other Democrats--and a few \n     Republicans--who have proposed various approaches.\n       While the issue has gained momentum in recent years, with \n     hundreds of educators lobbying for such a plan, there is \n     still plenty of opposition in Washington. Most conservatives \n     say that school construction should remain a state and local \n     responsibility.\n       Some legislators argue that if the federal government steps \n     up its funding, state and local governments will just set \n     aside less for school construction, and nothing additional \n     will get built. Furthermore, bureaucratic red tape and laws \n     requiring that federally financed construction projects pay \n     union-level wages could drive up total costs, critics say.\n\n\n                             matching funds\n\n       Hoping to quell some of those concerns, Sen. Harkin \n     designed his program to require local districts to bring \n     money to the table for new construction projects.\n       The competitive grants require communities to prove they \n     can pay for 75 percent of a project, thus keeping most of the \n     obligation local. Districts can receive up to $500,000 for \n     school construction projects. Another portion of funds is \n     reserved for the most urgent fire-safety repairs, and \n     districts can apply for up to $250,000 without a match.\n       Under the national program the $1.2 billion was given to \n     states with instructions to distribute it to poor \n     districts that could show the greatest need for repairs.\n       Sen. Harkin and other Democrats argue that by requiring \n     districts to provide the bulk of the money, school \n     construction and renovation remain local and state \n     obligations.\n       According to the senator, the initial $28 million dispensed \n     in the Iowa program's first three years leveraged $311 \n     million in local funding for repairs and new construction. \n     And although those funds might have been raised without an \n     incentive, he believes the Harkin grants made the difference \n     in persuading some communities to go forth with a project.\n       ``It's proven that a little bit of money can go a long \n     way.'' Mr. Harkin said. ``When you can get one federal dollar \n     to leverage $10 in state and local funds, that's a pretty \n     good use of federal money.''\n\n\n                            Some left Behind\n\n       Many Iowa districts are still using the traditional three-\n     story red-brick buildings like Decatur City Elementary School \n     that were constructed in nearly every small town in the state \n     at the beginning of the last century. The Southeast Polk \n     district will soon use its $500,000 Harkin grant to replace \n     one of those buildings that engineers unexpectedly deemed to \n     be unsound.\n       ``The final report was, `get out as soon as you can,' '' \n     said Mr. Drips, the superintendent.\n       A new building did not figure into the district's carefully \n     crafted 10-year building plan, but Mr. Drips and school board \n     members realized it would be more economical to build a new \n     facility than try to renovate the old building.\n       Formerly a rural community, Southeast Polk is now seeing \n     its cornfields become middle-class subdivisions, and its \n     enrollment has increased by about 125 students annually in \n     recent years. To help manage that growth, the district's \n     residents passed a 1-cent local sales tax that generates \n     about $4 million a year.\n       Without that revenue, the district would not have been able \n     to meet the grants match requirement. That requirement \n     sometimes leaves behind the neediest schools if they are \n     unable to raise funds locally, Mr. Drips said.\n       Sen. Harkin, though, said the local matching requirement \n     was key to retaining local control, and that cash-poor \n     districts could still apply for the emergency grants. \n     Meanwhile, he said, Iowa districts can count on the federal \n     aid for the near future--and he's going to fight to continue \n     the national program as well.\n       ``It has been such a resounding success on Iowa, and our \n     needs are so great that I intend to keep it,'' he said. \n     ``After 10 years of beating on this, I'm finally getting \n     people to realize that there is a federal role and we can do \n     this while retaining local control''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I \nhave remaining, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gregg amendment, \nand I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Gregg amendment is the solution to the \nproblem presented in the underlying bill. With all respect to the bill \nmanagers, I believe the bill tries to meet new needs before addressing \ncurrent obligations.\n  The bill appropriates $925 million in new funding for school \nconstruction which has never been embraced in the light of open debate \nbecause policymakers, year in and year out, have recognized the danger \nof creating new questionable obligations in the face of our existing \nappropriate obligation to low-income and disadvantaged children.\n  We already said we are going to do that. We are not doing it \nadequately, but now we say: Oh, I have this great idea for an economic \nstimulus; let's jump in on this and build some schools. It is not just \nthe construction industry having a little bit of a problem. In fact, \nthe construction industry is not hit as hard as other industries.\n  The Gregg amendment reflects the pure policy we all espouse. His \namendment would redirect $925 million into the title I Targeted \nAssistance Grant Program. That program disburses money based on a pure \npoverty formula. Again, that is what we all say our policy does. The \nunderlying bill creates a new program with almost $1 billion in new \nspending.\n  The greater concern which I have raised many times is that this bill \nwould violate the prevailing wisdom that school construction is a State \nand local funding obligation.\n  My policy concerns go even further. I offered an amendment to the \nESEA bill when it was considered by the Senate earlier this year which \naddressed my concerns about providing any Federal assistance in the \nabsence of maximized State and local effort and without the strictest \neligibility requirements based on poverty.\n  We somehow, to do the school construction, are going to have to get \ntogether and talk about that, but that is where it gets difficult. I \ncan relate to some of my previous experience. The Wyoming Constitution \nrequires an equal education for all kids. That is very tough to define \nand very tough to do.\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\n  One of the equal education issues determined by our supreme court is \nequal buildings. What is an equal building? We have one school district \nthat has about 800 students with a declining enrollment for a number of \nyears. For a high school, we can determine 8 or 9 years in advance what \nthe population is going to be based on the other schools that are below \nit--that it is going to be a continuing declining population. There is \na requirement that the State build a new school for them. They want the \nschool to be for 1,200 students. There is no justification for 1,200.\n  We are talking about maintenance, too. The State constitution in \nWyoming, interpreted by our supreme court, says there has to be \nequality when you tell people you are going to build school buildings \nor suggest perhaps if they do not do maintenance, they will get a new \nschool building sooner.\n  What is the result of this? The State is having to take over school \nconstruction. We are probably the ultimate State in the belief of local \ncontrol, and we are having to go the other way. We are going to have a \nState organization now that will determine building maintenance. That \nis a pretty basic school board job. But if you are going to build the \nbuilding, you have to have some control over the maintenance. If you \nare going to build the building, you also have to have some minimum \nrequirements and maximum requirements. That has never been the case. \nBefore, communities were able to build the kind of building they wanted \nto build or not build a building at all. That is not going to happen \nanymore.\n\n  Those are issues we have not addressed at the Federal level. I can \ntell my colleagues that with the difficulty the State of Wyoming is \nhaving, it is new ground we do not want to cover without a very basic \ndiscussion.\n  ``Equal school buildings'' is very hard to define, and I can tell my \ncolleagues they are going to be even tougher to fund because an equal \nschool building is going to have absolutely everything, and that means \nthe finest football field, the finest swimming pool, and the finest \ngymnasium. In a lot of communities, that creates some controversy as to \nwhether that is the epitome of education or whether it ought to be the \nfinest chemistry classroom or the finest math facility.\n  We have not had that basic discussion here. We have not been forced \nto have that basic discussion because we have not gotten into this \narea. We are starting to get into that area, and we better have that \ndiscussion before we find out that we have bitten off a bigger spending \nbill than this country would ever be able to afford and freed up local \ngovernments to again let us buy their votes with their dollars.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of the time. I \nask that my colleagues support this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the other side have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The other side has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 4 minutes--and if he needs more time, I will give \nhim more--I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I agree with the goal of dramatically expanding \nand making the best use of title I money. The Cochran-Landrieu \namendment, about which we will hear more later, goes much more in that \ndirection. By the way, I support that goal because I believe with all \nthe mandates that are coming out of Washington, DC, right now--test \nevery child, every grade, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8--we better make sure we \nget the resources to the school districts so they have a chance to do \nthe job.\n  I reject this tradeoff. I cannot believe we are arguing that \nrebuilding crumbling schools and making sure they are inviting places \nis somehow unimportant. I do not believe we are talking so much about \nbrand new swimming pools and brand new gyms. We are talking about many \nschool buildings all across the country that are dilapidated. We are \ntalking about children who know that if they want to see something \ngreat, they can go to a shopping mall or they can go to a brand new \nsports arena or they can go to the latest fanciest movie theater, but \nabout the worst place they can go is their own rundown schools.\n  When our children go to these schools and they are so decrepit and \nrun down, the heating does not work or the air conditioning does not \nwork or the toilets do not work, we are telling our children we do not \nvalue them.\n  I refuse to accept this tradeoff which pits helping children with \ntitle I program funding versus whether or not we are now going to \nabandon a Federal program which has provided some funding for our \nschools for school repair.\n  By the way, in every State, there is a huge backlog of repair work. I \nthank Senator Harkin for his leadership in talking about the importance \nof school renovation.\n  My second point is one of the ways we can get more money for title I \nand distribute that money in the most efficacious manner is to take the \nIDEA program for children with special needs and make it mandatory. \nThat is the language we now have. That is what we are fighting to keep \nin conference committee. We should be getting support from every \nSenator and the administration.\n  As a former Governor, the Presiding Officer knows how strongly our \nStates feel about giving the States the funding the Federal Government \npromised them for children with special needs. Then we can do a much \nbetter job for all the children.\n  That is the direction in which to go. Then finally, actually this \nwhole debate is a little bit of a fantasy debate in that I do not think \nwe are recognizing we are in a recession. These are hard economic \ntimes, and right now what is going on is our States are having to cut \nteachers, cut teacher assistance; they are having to cut counselors. If \nanything, we should get serious about an economic recovery plan.\n  I argue we need an additional $3 billion to go for school \nconstruction, for renovation of schools. It is win, win, win. You do \nnot eliminate this program during a recession. A, the schools are more \ninviting for the children; B, you are creating jobs; C, you are \ncontributing to the community; D, you are doing something about the \nrecession, and you are getting money in the economy, which is all about \nwhat we have to do for economic recovery.\n  I think the amendment of my friend from New Hampshire goes precisely \nin all the wrong directions. I hope Senators will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire has \n8\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not think it is the wrong direction when one is \ntrying to help low-income kids be more competitive in a school \nenvironment where they have been left behind.\n  The goal of the Federal Government has been stated. Our goal as the \nFederal Government under title I is to help low-income kids. The \nproblem is we have not adequately funded the formulas to accomplish \nthat. In fact, we have not even funded the targeted formula which was \npassed in 1996.\n  We funded a formula that was a pre-1996 formula or a 1994 formula, \nwhich has been nothing more than a hold harmless for a bunch of States \nwhich may or may not help the targeted populations in need.\n  Now we create this new program, $925 million of new money being spent \non a capital program for construction of facilities which can go to any \nschool. As the Senator from Iowa said, it can go to the richest school \ndistricts. It can go to any schools. It does not go to the low-income \nchildren. It does not go to the school districts with low-income \nchildren. It can go anywhere in the school system. It can go for \nswimming pools. It can go for squash courts. It can go for whatever the \nschool system decides to build.\n  That is not our responsibility as a Federal legislature. We have been \nvery\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\nspecific as to what our responsibility as a Federal legislature is. We \nhave said our responsibility as a Federal legislature is to, one, take \ncare of special needs kids or be a participant in that exercise and, \ntwo, take care of kids or try to help kids from low-income backgrounds \nbe competitive with their peers. That is what the Federal policy is.\n  In fact, we have rejected as Federal policy in the last two \nCongresses the need to have a construction program. What are we \nfunding? We are funding a construction program at the expense of low-\nincome children who would get money under this targeted proposal.\n  Let us talk about a few States. Under this proposal, Connecticut \nwould go from $83 million targeted on low-income kids to $111 million \ntargeted on low-income kids. Delaware would go from $22 million \ntargeted on low-income kids to $28 million targeted on low-income kids. \nHawaii would go from $25 million targeted on low-income kids to $35 \nmillion targeted on low-income kids. Illinois would go from $357 \nmillion targeted on low-income kids to $477 million targeted on low-\nincome kids. Michigan would go from $349 million targeted on low-income \nkids to $445 million targeted on low-income kids, under the proposal I \nam suggesting. New Jersey would go from $209 million targeted on low-\nincome kids to $272 million targeted on low-income kids. New York would \ngo from $822 million targeted on low-income kids to $1.15 billion \ntargeted on low-income kids. Washington State would go from $118 \nmillion targeted on low-income kids to $149 million targeted on low-\nincome kids. Wisconsin would go from $129 million targeted on low-\nincome kids to $160 million targeted on low-income kids, money which \nwould go directly into the school systems which are trying to serve the \nlow-income child. That is our purpose.\n  As we pass the new ESEA bill, we are going to make it even more \neffective in the way these dollars are used to benefit that low-income \nchild. So it makes no sense to me to create this new program which is \nin the area where the States and communities have traditionally had the \nresponsibility, which is the area of construction of their facilities, \na new program which gives a carte blanche so the money can flow to \nwhatever district wants to get it. The district can be a high-end \ndistrict or it can be a low-end district that happens to spend it on \nsomething that does not impact the low-income kids, instead of putting \nit into the program which we as the Federal Government have said we \nwant to fund.\n  There is a role for block grants in our Federal system, but the \nFederal Government has also said that in the education area there are \ncertain areas which we are going to carve out and in which we are going \nto try to exercise our assistance. We only put 6 percent of the dollars \ninto the local school systems. What we have said is those 6 percent of \ndollars are going to be focused; they are not going to be spread all \nover the map.\n  The construction dollars spread it all over the map, whereas this \namendment puts it into a formula which is extremely focused. It is \ndirected right at the low-income child who today, unfortunately, has \nbeen left behind. That low-income child today simply is not getting a \nfair and competitive education. We are going to try to fix that under \nthe new ESEA bill. In the same process, we need to give the dollars to \nsupport the new initiatives. That is what this amendment does.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand I have about a minute remaining. I respond \nto my friend from New Hampshire, there is a chart that is being passed \nout that has fiscal year 2001, and it has Landrieu, then it has Gregg, \nand it looks as if the Gregg amendment gives a lot more to each of \nthese States the Senator from New Hampshire just mentioned--Connecticut \nand a few others--but you have to add to the Landrieu column the school \nconstruction money, which the Senator from New Hampshire does not do.\n  So if we add that up, we will get----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure. If I made a mistake, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. That speaks to title I.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is the title I dollars. School construction is not a \ntitle I program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. I am saying the amendment funding, the Senator is \ntalking about a funding comparison total. It does not say title I. It \nsays funding comparison. I am saying, under the Landrieu column, all of \nthe money would have to be added that is in the amendment that would go \nto schools or to States for school construction to get a better \ncomparison. That is all I am saying.\n  Lastly, I say why send poor kids to poor schools? Let us help the \npoor kids, but let us rebuild our schools, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time of the Senator from Iowa \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has 3 minutes 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Iowa, of course, raises a valid point, \nwhich is the money is still going back to the States if it goes back to \nschool construction.\n  The point, however, which is the whole essence of this argument or \ndebate--``argument'' is the wrong term. The essence of this debate is \nthat the dollars under the title I program, especially the new formula \nwhich targets those dollars, is used on low-income kids and actually \ngoes to the kids in low-income schools.\n  The school construction money is outside title I. It is not an \nauthorized program. It does not even exist as a Federal program. It \njust exists as an expenditure under the appropriating process, and it \ndoes not flow at all under the title I process.\n  The goal of title I is to benefit the low-income child. School \nconstruction money does not benefit the low-income child. There is no \nstructure to do that. It is money that is spent by the States however \nthey want to spend it on construction. It makes much more sense to take \nthis money and move it into the title I account into the new targeted \nformula so we end up with a child who comes from a low-income \nbackground actually benefiting from these dollars. That is the purpose \nof this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. What is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment was set aside and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, \nis to be recognized to offer an amendment on which there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2058\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the ranking member \nfor their fine work on this appropriations bill that is so important to \nour schools, to our health care infrastructure throughout the Nation at \nthis important time, as well as to our labor community and the work \nthey have done.\n  I send this amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Cochran, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Ensign proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2058.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

I thank my distinguished colleague from Louisiana for \nyielding, at least before she starts her presentation, to my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania for a resolution.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask the two Senators from Pennsylvania a \nquestion, I understand how important this resolution is, but do you \nhave an idea how long it will take? We have to get the votes out of the \nway before 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I might respond, I think we can dispense with it in \nthe course of 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 175, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 175) honoring Penn State football \n     coach Joe Paterno.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is an honor and a pleasure for me and \nSenator Specter, who is cosponsor of the resolution, to be here today \nto pay tribute to a great American, a great Pennsylvanian--although he \nwas born in New York, we consider him a great Pennsylvanian--Coach Joe \nPaterno.\n  This past weekend--and I see my colleague from Ohio here, so I \nmention Penn State defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes on October 27--he \nbecomes the ``winningest'' coach in Division 1-A history, surpassing \nPaul ``Bear'' Bryant.\n  I recognize and celebrate that great accomplishment of Coach Paterno, \nbut the bottom line is, of all the things he has accomplished at Penn \nState, this is one of his lesser accomplishments. This is a man who has \nadded so much to that university, to our Commonwealth, to the country, \nand to sports in general, a man of great integrity.\n  When you think of Joe Paterno, words that come to my mind first and \nforemost are integrity and character. This is a man who really tries to \nhold athletics and everything he does to the highest level of \nintegrity. He teaches that to his children--yes, to his children, and \nto his kids who are on the team, but he also teaches it to the whole \nuniversity community and to us as a nation through his example.\n  He is a man of incredible character. He said: Success without honor \nis an unseasoned dish. It will satisfy your hunger, but it won't taste \ngood.\n  This is a man who understands that there is more to life than just \nwinning. He has won more than anybody, but he understands there is a \nmuch bigger picture, and if you talk to the kids who have graduated \nfrom his program--by the way, he has one of the highest graduation \nrates of any football program in the NCAA, almost double the average \nfor the NCAA--this is a man who understands football is not just about \nwinning but about building character, building a better foundation for \nour country through these kids and the people who touch the program.\n  Finally, I must discuss his humility. Those in public life, in the \neye of the media all the time, understand when you are the \n``winningest'' coach in college football history, it is easy to be full \nof yourself, but this man understands that humility is the key to \nsuccess. It is an important virtue that we have far too little of in \nthis country.\n  I quote again from Joe Paterno: Publicity is like poison; it doesn't \nhurt unless you swallow it.\n  Joe Paterno has never swallowed the poison of media attention, trying \nto push him up. He understands his greatness is in his humility, his \nsimplicity, and his integrity in doing the little things well every \nday.\n  As a Penn State alumnus, I congratulate him. I congratulate Joe's \nwife, Sue, a great partner in Joe's career. I thank him for what he has \ndone for the university, not just on the football field. They have done \na tremendous amount of charitable giving and leadership for the \nuniversity.\n  I thank him and recognize him. As a Senator from Pennsylvania, he is \nsomeone I am very proud to call one of our own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I join my colleague, Senator Santorum, in offering \npraise to Coach Joe Paterno for establishing a new record for being the \n``winningest'' coach in football class 1-A schools.\n  It was a tough first four games of the season this year when Penn \nState was defeated four times. Then his team came back in spectacular \nfashion to beat Northwestern 2 weeks ago and last Saturday to beat Ohio \nState to establish the new record.\n  In the short time we have, I will share a vignette or two. Coach \nPaterno tells a story of his undergraduate days at Brown when he was a \nmember of a fraternity which did not have any Jewish members. A young \nJewish student sought to enter the fraternity. They passed the cup \naround and it turned out to have a blackball. Sometime later, the \nstudent made a second application and they passed the cup around again \nand it turned out to have a blackball. Then he made a third try, and \nagain there was a blackball.\n  At this point Joe Paterno, a student in the fraternity, jumped up and \nsaid: I have to admit, that was my blackball; I withdraw the blackball. \nOf course, it wasn't his blackball. But the blackballer didn't have the \ncourage to stand up and acknowledge it as his blackball. That young \nJewish student gained admission to the fraternity.\n  One other short story. I am not sure how appropriate this is, but I \nwill take a chance. I was campaigning for reelection. I am not sure if \nit was 1986 or 1992. Joe Paterno happened to come by. The newsman said: \nCoach, are you supporting Senator Specter for reelection?\n  And Joe Paterno has a marvelous way of putting his foot down, pawing \nthe ground, and looking down. He said:\n\n       Well, if I had a running back in, and he was making yardage \n     and he wasn't tired, I'd leave him in. I think I'd leave \n     Arlen Specter in.\n\n  I have had a few endorsements in my day, but that is the most \nmemorable one I have had.\n  Coach Paterno visited this Chamber with, I believe, the 1983 Penn \nState team. They filled the visitor's gallery. I made a reference to \nthem, pointing out that the team was in the balcony, and I was later \ncorrected by Senator Byrd who pointed out that I violated the Senate \nrules in pointing to that great national championship team.\n  I point to them again today. I don't think Senator Byrd will admonish \nme because they are not in the balcony today, but there were great \nteams with Coach Paterno, going down in history as No. 1 in so many \nrespects.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator from Louisiana for yielding me \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate resolution \nsubmitted earlier by the Senator from Pennsylvania, S. Res. 175, and \nthe preamble are agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 175), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 175\n\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has served Penn State University as a \n     coach for 52 years, a tenure spanning the administrations of \n     11 United States Presidents;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has served as Penn State's 14th head \n     coach for nearly 36 years, since February 19, 1966;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has been on the coaching staff for more \n     than half of the football games played by the Nittany Lions \n     since the program began in 1887;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno always has placed a very strong \n     emphasis on academic achievement and character building, as \n     evidenced by the selection of 21 first-team Academic All-\n     Americans, 14 Hall of Fame Scholar-Athletes, and 17 NCAA \n     postgraduate scholarship winners so far during his tenure;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno's most recent NCAA 4-year player \n     graduation rate of 76 percent\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n     far exceeds the NCAA-wide average of 48 percent for the same \n     period;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno and his wife, Sue, have personally \n     donated over $4,000,000 to Penn State's student library and \n     academic programs;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has led Penn State teams to 5 \n     undefeated seasons;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has led Penn State teams to 20 bowl \n     game victories in his career as head coach, more than any \n     other coach in college football history;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno was the first college football coach to \n     win all of the 4 major New Year's Day bowl games: the Rose, \n     Sugar, Cotton, and Orange Bowls;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno led 2 teams to National Championship \n     titles, in 1982 and 1986;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno's coaching efforts have yielded over \n     250 National Football League players;\n       Whereas Joe Paterno has been chosen an unprecedented 4 \n     times as American Football Coaches Association Coach of the \n     Year; and\n       Whereas Joe Paterno, on October 27, 2001, broke the \n     longstanding record for NCAA Division I-A victories, reaching \n     the 324-victory mark, by leading his team to a 29-27 win over \n     Ohio State: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRATULATION AND COMMENDATION.\n\n       The Senate recognizes and honors Joe Paterno--\n       (1) for his lifetime emphasis on academic achievement;\n       (2) for his constant integrity, professionalism, and strong \n     focus on character building for amateur athletes;\n       (3) for the example he sets through philanthropic support \n     for academic programs; and\n       (4) for becoming the first NCAA Division I-A football coach \n     to achieve 324 career victories, on October 27, 2001.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am happy to get back to the subject. I \nwas of course happy to yield some time for the Senators from \nPennsylvania, for those fine remarks to honor a person who certainly \ndeserved that recognition.\n  I am offering this amendment today on this underlying bill in behalf \nof myself, Senator Cochran, the Senator from Mississippi, Senator \nDeWine from Ohio, Senator Lieberman, Senator Hatch, Senator Bennett, \nand Senator Ensign--all who have had a pivotal role and a leadership \nrole in helping to bring this particular amendment to the floor at this \ntime.\n  So because of the change in time this morning, and so many Senators \nare here wanting to speak on this amendment, let me yield at this time \nto my distinguished colleague from Ohio for his remarks on this \namendment. Then I will speak following the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for \nher nice comments. I appreciate the fact that she has yielded to me. I \ncongratulate her for not only this amendment but for all the work she \ndoes for all children, and particularly poor children. There is no one \nin this Chamber more dedicated than is she to the children of this \ncountry.\n  I rise today to express my support for Senator Landrieu's amendment \nas well as for Senator Gregg's amendment. These amendments target our \nlimited, finite Federal resources to the school districts and to the \nchildren most in need. I am cosponsoring both because each is an effort \nto get funding to those school districts with high concentrations of \npoor children. Each amendment will put at least $1 billion into the \ntitle I targeted grant formula so impoverished school districts, those \nchildren, get what they need, so the children in those school districts \nget the quality education they deserve.\n  A little history. This grant formula, this targeted grant formula, as \nit is called, was created in 1994. It recognized the great disparity in \nthis country between poor school districts and rich school districts, \nthe great disparity between children who are in poverty and children \nwho are not in poverty.\n  However, unbelievably and tragically, since the creation of these \ngrants in 1994, not a single Federal dollar, not one dollar, has been \nappropriated to fund this grant program--that is until now with these \ntwo amendments. These amendments would fundamentally begin fulfilling \nthe promise and commitment the Federal Government made to the poor \nchildren of this country in 1994. This is unprecedented. It is \nhistoric. So I congratulate both of my colleagues for their amendments.\n\n  Under Senator Gregg's amendment, the districts most in need would not \nonly receive the money they deserve but they also would have the \nflexibility to decide how best to use their title I funds, whether that \nis to hire more teachers, provide professional development, to put \ncomputers in classrooms, or purchase instructional material--whatever \nthey wanted to do. The districts, the local communities, would be able \nto decide for themselves where and how those dollars would do the most \ngood.\n  For example, one school may have a lot of students who are having \nproblems in math. That school district could use their title I dollars \non math instructional materials or to better train their math teachers. \nAnother school might have a small group of students who would need more \nindividualized instruction in reading and the language arts.\n  The point is this funding enables the local school to use this money \nto help the distinct needs of their own students. By funding these \ntargeted grants, we are finally focusing on those kids truly in need. \nThis gets us back to the original intent of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and the title I program, which is to help \naddress the needs of children in low-income areas where the districts \nsimply cannot meet their basic needs on their own.\n  The problem has been that over the course of the last 3\\1/2\\ decades, \nthe Federal Government really has strayed from this point, from its \nintent, with politics often driving education policy needs of these \nlow-income students. As a result, the money intended to reach the most \nimpoverished districts, and the most poor children, has simply not been \ngetting there. These amendments go a long way to begin to rectify that.\n  Because the Federal role in education accounts for only a small \npercentage of school spending--about 8 percent--we must be especially \nprudent and wise in allocating those very limited, finite Federal \nresources. That means we should direct those dollars first and foremost \nto America's most needy children. That means we need to fund the \ntargeted grant program.\n  The tragedy today is that not all children are getting the quality \neducation they deserve because our society is divided along economic \nand educational lines. This division is nothing new. Scholars and \nsociologists warned us really for decades that this was where our \nNation was heading, particularly if we did not properly educate our \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, we did not heed the warnings and, as a result, our \nNation today is a nation split really into two Americas, one where \nchildren get educated and one where, tragically, they do not.\n  This gap in educational knowledge and economic standing is \nentrenching thousands upon thousands of children into an underclass and \ninto futures filled with poverty and little hope, little opportunity, \nand little room for advancement. That is exactly what is happening in \nmy home State of Ohio and across the country.\n  Ohio generally is a microcosm of what we see in the country. When we \nlook at this growing gap, when we see this development of the two \nAmericas, what we see in Ohio is also what we see in our Nation. In \nOhio, growing income and educational disparities are creating our own \nvery permanent underclass.\n  Most of Ohio is still doing pretty well and doing pretty well \neducationally. Children in those areas have a great future. However, \nwhen we look across our State, when we look across the Nation, we see \ntwo areas where that is not taking place, areas where the children are \nnot being educated as well as we would like and where the income level \nshows that disparity. One place is in rural Appalachia, our Appalachian \ncounties, and the other is in our core cities or our inner cities. This \nis where we as a society, we as a people, face our greatest challenge.\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n  The children living in these high-poverty areas are at risk, every \nsingle one of them. The structural conditions of poverty make it very \ndifficult for these children to succeed in life and to move up and out \nof their impoverished circumstances.\n  The fact is that with poverty often come drugs, crime, broken homes, \nunemployment, violence, and lower educational levels. In fact, \naccording to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 1999, \nyoung adults living in families with incomes in the lowest 20 percent \nof all family incomes were five times as likely to drop out of high \nschool as their peers with families in the top 20 percent of the income \ndistribution.\n\n  The point is not that money solves all problems. The point is we have \nan obligation, with the finite dollars we have available to us, to \nspend them wisely and prudently. We need today to fulfill to what we \nhave committed in the past and have not done; that is, help poor \nchildren of this country.\n  In conclusion, because of the cyclical nature of poverty and the \nsystemic problems associated with it, I believe the best way we can get \nto these children before we lose them is through quality education. \nEducation is the ticket out of poverty. It has been throughout the \nhistory of this country.\n  We need to provide all children, regardless of their economic \ncircumstances or family backgrounds or how poor the school district in \nwhich they live, with the tools they need to make it as adults in our \nsociety, with the tools necessary to rise above individual situations \nin poverty and instability and individual situations of hopelessness \nand despair. When education is not working to give our kids the tools \nthey need to move ahead in life, those children suffer.\n  We can't solve all the problems of this country. We can't fix all the \nbroken homes. But we can use Federal dollars in ways that help close \nthe educational gap in America.\n  That is exactly what we are doing with my colleague's amendment and \nwith Senator Gregg's amendment. We are finally putting our money where \nour mouth is. No more lip service. This funding would go to enable \nschools to provide opportunities for low-income and low-achieving \nchildren to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in \nschool and later in life.\n  In doing so, we will help education equalize the environment for our \nchildren. That is the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague, and I again congratulate her \nfor the excellent amendment and for the work she does for children \nevery day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for those \nremarks, and, of course, for his hard work on this amendment. I often \nsay to our other colleagues that any Senator who is a father of eight \nchildren certainly is an expert when it comes to the matters of \nchildren and families. He has demonstrated that over and over again.\n  I see my colleague from Mississippi coming in to also speak on this \namendment. I am mindful of the time and his patience because our \namendment has been rescheduled so many times. I would be happy to yield \nto him at this time or in a few moments if he wants to speak on this \nparticular amendment because he has most certainly been a leader in \nthis regard.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana will yield, I would be happy to speak in support of her \namendment and acknowledge that I am a cosponsor of the amendment. I \nbelieve that it does redirect some of the funding allocated under the \nbill for title I programs so that it goes to the States with the \nhighest percentage of poor students in their student population. These \nare students we decided needed special attention many years ago when \nthe program was first authorized as title I under the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. The Federal Government has the responsibility \nto address that program--not by supplanting the primary responsibility \nof the States to run their education programs and to provide the \nresources for teachers and school districts to educate those students \nin the States.\n  We have decided some States have such serious problems in this \nrespect that the Federal Government ought to step in and provide some \nadditional assistance. When the program was authorized, not all of the \nauthorized activities were funded. This is one example of an unfunded \nbut authorized activity and a program that was designed to help those \nStates with very special needs. Obviously, my State is one of them.\n  Sixty-five percent of the student population in the State of \nMississippi is classified as eligible for title I support. These are \npoor children. Most of those children reside in small towns and rural \ncommunities; some in urban settings, of course. But most of them are in \nareas with high rates of unemployment and low-wage rates where people \ndo have jobs, and with real estate that doesn't generate the kind of \ntaxes that are needed to operate top-of-the-line education programs. \nThey start out with the deck stacked against them because of where they \nlive and the fact that they are poor.\n  This is money that is now going to be targeted and redirected to \nthose areas of special need. I think it is totally justified under the \ncircumstances that we see in our country today, and also to be used in \na program that has been tested and proven to be helpful.\n  We had hearings in our State earlier this year talking to \nadministrators in school districts that are eligible for title I \nfunding; talking to teachers and meeting with the State board of \neducation members to try to assess how effective the program has been \nand what would happen if the funds were cut. For example, we were told \nif the funding under title I was reduced in our State, the effect would \nbe devastating. We were also told the more money they could get into \nthe program, the better job they could do in providing educational \nopportunities to those who are harder to teach and who need special \nassistance in many cases in order to achieve their goals and to be what \nthey could be if they were given the right kinds of educational \nopportunities.\n  One of our witnesses turned out to be a school superintendent in \nYazoo City, MS, who had been a title I student. He talked about his \npersonal background and his history and the fact that there was no \nopportunity for him. But because of additional funds in the school that \nhe attended that added some instructors, that added some teachers who \nconcentrated on those students with special problems because they were \npoor, he benefitted from that. He talked about how he then ended up \ngoing to college. He is now a leader in our State in education, \ndevoting his life to helping others who are in similar situations. He \nwas a very impressive, and as you might understand, a very persuasive \nwitness.\n  I am here today to speak for people like him and others in our State \nwho because of their lives and experiences show that this program \nworks. It has been of great benefit to him. We want it to benefit many \nmore.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring the Landrieu amendment. I hope the \nSenate will vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the remarks of \nmy colleague from Mississippi and my neighbor to the south right across \nthe line because we share a lot of common challenges in Mississippi and \nLouisiana. The Senator spoke about the need for this amendment and \ncalled the attention of the Nation to the fact that about 60 percent of \nthe students in Mississippi--that would be about the same for \nLouisiana, probably about 65 percent--live below the poverty line or \nare so close to it that opportunities are hard to come by. I think it \nis important for us to step back and take a moment to recognize that \ngreat inequity.\n\n  As I refer to my notes, I am reminded that in order for students to \nbe eligible for title I, as the distinguished Senator from Mississippi \nknows, it means a family of four can make no more than $22,000. It is \nhard for an individual to live on $22,000, much less a family, whether \nthey live in rural Mississippi or rural Louisiana or right here in \nWashington, DC. But there are many working families who have incomes at \nthat level, and all they are asking is for their children to get a \nbetter education, so that instead of bringing in that $22,000, they \ncould bring in $45,000 or $65,000 or $100,000, and not only help\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\nthemselves and their families, and the children they will ultimately \nhave, but help this Nation to fulfill its economic promise.\n  One of the great effects of this amendment, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, because you yourself have been supportive and outspoken and \neffective in your advocacy as a former Governor of Delaware and now as \na Senator who speaks so directly about this issue, is it helps us to \nbegin. It is only a modest beginning to help solve a great inequity in \nthis Nation. It is the inequity that the Senator from Mississippi \nbrought up and the inequity that I want to spend a few minutes speaking \nabout again this morning.\n  The fact is that among these 50 States there are some States and some \ncommunities and some districts and some counties and some parishes that \nsimply do not have the resources to make the grade. They have the will. \nThey have the skill. They have the desire. And the children, because of \nthe way God created them, have the brains. They are not sitting down on \nthe job. These are children who want to learn. These are parents who \nwork very hard, who do not have flexible schedules, who wake up early \nin the morning before the Sun comes up, who stay at work until the Sun \ngoes down.\n  These are the children title I tries to reach: first-generation \nimmigrants, families that have been in this country for many years \nstruggling to get ahead, families that work hard and save their hard-\nearned dollars. These are the children title I tries to reach. Yet when \nwe do not provide the funds through the targeted grants, we often miss \nthe opportunity to meet these families halfway.\n  I think we have an obligation, on the Federal level, because of the \ndisparity, because of the great inequity, to do what we can to try to \nlevel this playing field.\n  Let me be the first to say, although I am a sponsor of this \namendment, this amendment does not correct that inequity. We would need \nmany billions of dollars more to correct that inequity. But this is a \nbeginning. That is why it is so important for us to vote overwhelmingly \nfor this particular amendment. It is a beginning. It will be the first \ntime the targeted grant formula has ever been funded in the Senate. It \nwill build on the work of the House. It will support what the President \nwants us to do.\n  As we push our schools to greater heights, as we expect higher \nstandards from our students, from our educators, and from our parents, \nthen we can help them by giving this additional funding, so that even \nschools in the places that are poor, such as Louisiana and Mississippi, \nand places in Delaware that may be disadvantaged, have a chance to meet \nthese higher standards. That is what this amendment does.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan support we have received. And I know it \nis tough because there are some States where funding maybe goes up \nslightly and there are some States where funding decreases.\n\n  I do not see my partner, Senator Lieberman, in this Chamber. He has \nbeen working for hours, for days, for months on this amendment. Senator \nLieberman is a cosponsor. Clearly, as the Senator from Mississippi \nsaid, Mississippi will benefit. He has more poor children in \nMississippi per capita than any State in the Union. My State is a close \nsecond. So to Mississippi and Louisiana, this is serious business. This \nis about whether these children, in homes where parents are working, \ndoing their best, have a chance or not. That is what this amendment \nmeans. It is literally a life-and-death opportunity.\n  There are some States that are wealthier, Connecticut being one of \nthem. Senator Lieberman supports this amendment. I tell you, he is a \ngreat inspirational leader to me. Just to give an example of how great \nhis leadership has been, Connecticut will not benefit as much as \nLouisiana, but Senator Lieberman knows, as do other Senators from \nwealthier States, that it is ultimately in the interest of all the \nbusinesspeople and families in Connecticut if every child in this great \nNation has a chance for an excellent education. The benefits will come \nback to Connecticut in indirect ways, if not directly. That is the kind \nof long-term leadership, the kind of vision that we need more of in the \nSenate.\n  So while in some ways it is easier for Senator Cochran and I to stand \nin this Chamber and argue for it because our State will be a tremendous \nbeneficiary, I recognize the sponsorship of Senators from States that \ndo not immediately do better, but in the long run they know this is \nbest for their State and for the Nation; to them goes tremendous \ncredit.\n  Let me take a moment to speak about the underlying bill. Many of us, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, have been working for many months to \ntry to put forward some of the new principles that are in this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  The appropriations bill that we are discussing today helps to frame \nor give substance to the authorization bill that is in committee. There \nare some principles that I think are important, and I will address \nthose for a moment.\n  First of all, the underlying bill recognizes the importance of \nteachers. We always say teachers are important, but sometimes we do not \nput our money where our mouths are. The underlying bill gives $1 \nbillion more to help improve the quality of teachers.\n  We know that a good teacher instructs but a great teacher inspires. \nWe need to have more great teachers; we need to help them become great \nteachers, taking their great motivation and their enthusiasm, and \nhelping them build their skills to inspire our children in every \nschool, in every district, to become the very best citizens they can be \nfor our Nation and to become the very best leaders in the world. This \nchallenging time certainly calls on us to make those investments. That \nis one of the initiatives in this bill.\n  In addition, it has been important to work on this particular bill at \nthis time because I think there is a sense that while we have a very \ngood public school system, it works pretty well most of the time, and \nwe can be proud of the work we do, I think the Landrieu-Cochran \namendment, and the work that is being done in the underlying bill, to \npush forward on some of these points, demonstrates there is a sense of \nurgency to move our schools to a higher level, expecting performance \nand not concentrating on process, but expecting results, \naccountability, improvements, and working with the local people in a \npartnership to do that.\n  Why is that important? It has always been important. It has always \nbeen important, but I think since September 11 it has become even more \nobvious why it is important to have excellence in our schools and to \ngive every child, regardless of whether they come from a wealthy \ndistrict in Connecticut or the cotton fields of Mississippi and \nLouisiana, the chance to succeed, to carry the flag that we all share \nas Americans, and to do the very best we can to hold up that flag when \nour Nation calls upon us to do so.\n  I have been very impressed with the work of the Business Roundtable \non education. They, along with many corporate executives, have \nsupported some of the educational reform efforts that are being made in \nthis Congress. I commend them for their focus.\n  They issued a poem, written by one of their members, that I will ask \nto print in the Record. I want to share it with my colleagues this \nmorning because it so clarifies where we are today in America and why \nthe underlying bill is important, and why the targeting amendment is \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is entitled ``Pretty Good.'' It reads as follows:\n\n                              Pretty Good\n\n                          (By Charles Osgood)\n\n     There once was a pretty good student,\n     Who sat in a pretty good class\n     And was taught by a pretty good teacher,\n     Who always let pretty good pass.\n     He wasn't terrific at reading,\n     He wasn't a whiz-bang at math;\n     But for him education was leading\n     Straight down a pretty good path.\n     He didn't find school too exciting,\n     But he wanted to do pretty well,\n     And he did have some trouble with writing\n     And nobody taught him to spell.\n     When doing arithmetic problems\n     Pretty good was regarded as fine.\n     Five plus five needn't always add up to be ten,\n     A pretty good answer was nine.\n     The pretty good class that he sat in\n     Was part of a pretty good school,\n     And the student was not an exception,\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\n     On the contrary, he was the rule.\n     The pretty good school that he went to\n     Was in a pretty good town.\n     And nobody seemed to notice\n     He could not tell a verb from a noun.\n     The pretty good student in fact was\n     Part of a pretty good mob.\n     And the first time he knew what he lacked was\n     When he looked for a pretty good job.\n     It was then, when he sought a position,\n     He discovered that life could be tough,\n     And he soon had a sneaky suspicion\n     Pretty good might not be good enough.\n     The pretty good town in our story\n     Was part of a pretty good state,\n     Which had pretty good aspirations,\n     And prayed for a pretty good fate.\n     There once was a pretty good nation,\n     Pretty proud of the greatness it had,\n     Which learned much too late\n     If you want to be great,\n     Pretty good is, in fact, pretty bad.\n\n  We have some pretty good schools. We have some pretty good students. \nWe have some pretty good teachers. We have to have great schools, great \nstudents, and great teachers. We need them in Mississippi. We need them \nin Louisiana. We need them in Connecticut. We need them in \nPennsylvania. Our country depends on educated, well-skilled citizens to \nlift this democracy, to help lift this world, and to become a beacon of \nlight. We can do that. It is not that complicated. It just takes some \nprinciples, some determination and some funding levels, partnerships \nwith local governments, to make it happen.\n  The underlying bill, with this amendment, and the work that has been \ndone in the authorizing committee will get us from pretty good to \ngreat. That is what our Nation needs at this time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted to support, \nenthusiastically, the Landrieu-Cochran amendment. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this amendment. I believe this is a balanced and \nbipartisan amendment. I am especially pleased that this amendment \nrepresents a change in the way the title I formula is funded. My State \nof Utah has been socked by this formula for years. Correcting the title \nI formula has long been a priority of mine and this amendment is a good \nstep in the right direction.\n  This amendment would direct Federal funds to go out to States using \nthe degree to which States equalize resources among their school \ndistricts as a proxy for their commitment to education.\n  This so-called ``equity provision'' of the Education Finance \nIncentive Grant section of the title I formula rewards states that have \na policy of fairly distributing resources among school districts.\n  I have been beating a steady drum relative to this issue for years. \nAs many of my colleagues know, wealthy school districts can afford to \nprovide more resources to their schools than can poorer school \ndistricts. This sends an incredibly bad signal to students in so much \nas it can appear that wealthy students have access to scholastic \nresources such as computers and up-to-date science labs which may be \nunavailable to students from less affluent areas.\n  We should work to eliminate what has been called this ``Savage \nInequality'' between more wealthy and less wealthy school districts. I \nbelieve that support for the equity provision of this formula sends a \nstrong signal to these students that the Congress deems it a priority \nfor States to find a way to eliminate this barrier to academic \nprogress. I am very proud that my State of Utah has had a policy of \nequalizing resources among school districts for decades.\n  A majority of States have either been taken to court or been \nthreatened with lawsuits over the issue of equalized resources among \nschool districts. This amendment would assist States which currently \nare being compelled to address this issue.\n  As a conservative, I am pleased that the equity provision does not \nmandate to States how they should achieve a more equitable school \nfunding strategy, it merely rewards them when they do achieve a more \nequitable school funding strategy.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment would establish an alternative \nproxy for determining a State's commitment to education. Currently, the \nonly measure of a State's commitment to education has been its per-\npupil expenditure. That measure unfairly evaluates a State like Utah's \ncommitment to education. Utah has a relatively low tax-base and the \nhighest percentage of school aged children.\n  This means that based on the per-pupil expenditure, Utah ranks \nrelatively low. But the per-pupil expenditure is only one measure to \njudge a State's commitment to education. It makes sense as a matter of \ngood policy to have a variety of measures to establish a State's \ncommitment to education. This amendment moves us soundly in that \ndirection.\n  Funding for the Education Finance Incentive Grant program is good \npolicy. It just makes sense. I am pleased to support the Landrieu-\nCochran amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nLouisiana makes changes in the formula so that there are more funds \ntargeted to poor areas, and States which have already targeted poor \nareas are going to receive more funding. Pennsylvania is a winner in \nthis formula fight. I tend to support the amendment.\n  Nobody has appeared in opposition to the amendment, and there are a \nnumber of States which are adversely affected.\n  It is my hope that other Senators wishing to protect their interests \nwill come to the floor to present their arguments.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. If we now go to a quorum call, \nthe time can't be charged against the Senator from Louisiana because \nshe has no time remaining. So is the time charged against the opponents \nof the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I realize my time has expired. Since no \none is here to speak against the amendment, would there be any \nobjection to my taking an additional few minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, may I inquire of the \nSenator from Louisiana how much additional time she wants?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would only need 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have no objection.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Then I would be happy to yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be kind enough to yield 1 minute to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts in opposition to the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will accommodate the Senator from Massachusetts on \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, to go into some more detail about the \nimportance to Louisiana, Louisiana is slated to receive approximately \n$212 million in title I funding. Under this amendment, that will be $21 \nmillion more than we received last year. We spend about $600 per title \nI student. This amount will increase by almost a third for the students \nin Louisiana, increasing it by $200.\n  Caddo Parish may receive a 21 percent increase in title I funding. \nEast Baton Rouge, the capital parish, will receive a 16 percent \nincrease. Orleans parish could receive a 24 percent increase. These are \nseveral examples of how beneficial this will be to the parishes in \nLouisiana, and I am sure to counties in Mississippi as well as to the \nState of Delaware.\n  This is an amendment that will help all school districts by trying to \ntarget more of the resources to those school districts that have high \nconcentrations of poor students and limited opportunities to raise \ntheir own funds locally. That, clearly, is a role the Federal \nGovernment should play.\n  I will submit for the Record a more comprehensive list of what it \nwill mean to all of the States, as well as the State of Louisiana, in \nterms of percentages of increase.\n  Again, this is a beginning. I know Senator Kennedy will join me in \nsaying that $1 billion is not really enough. But given the other pulls \non our budget, it is what we can do this year.\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\n  I hope to work with the Presiding Officer and the chairman, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and others to see that this money is \nincreased next year so that it will be beneficial to all of our States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the list to which I \nreferred:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Landrieu/

21\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the time. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2056\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nallowing me a minute. We have been in a markup. Everyone is pressed.\n  I rise in opposition to the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment \ndeals with public school construction but doesn't cut out charter \nschool construction resources. I appreciate the fact that Senator Gregg \nunderstands that we need additional resources in title I. We are only \nreaching about 35 percent of all of the children. Even with the \nincreases that we anticipate this year, with the increasing challenges \nwe are facing economically, we are still only going to reach a \nrelatively small percentage of children that are needy.\n  We understand we need additional resources. The fact is, we shouldn't \nbe robbing Peter to pay Paul. We need to invest in and increase title \nI. We need an effective program of construction, public school \nconstruction and charter school construction.\n  Every day, until relatively recently, in my own city of Boston, when \nthe temperature went below 20 degrees, we had 15 schools that closed, \nwhere there are a number of title I children, because of the fact that \nthey didn't have the heating and because of the construction lapses. We \nwere denying these children the opportunities for learning.\n  This is a carefully targeted program that Senator Harkin has \ndirected. It is a necessary one for needy children. I hope the Gregg \namendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides on the \nLandrieu amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time on the side of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. The opponents have 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania be willing to yield \nback the time? Then we could go to the vote on the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would. I think we should proceed with the business of \nthe Senate. If I might ask my colleague from Nevada, what would happen \nthen to those who want to make arguments in opposition to the Landrieu \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. They would not be able to make any argument.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then it is the suggestion that we proceed to two votes \nnow?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. The order that is now in place would be the \nGregg amendment. As soon as that is completed, we would vote on the \nLandrieu amendment. For 3 days Senators have known what has been taking \nplace on the floor. We announced this vote last night. We structured \nthe debate so there is no reason in the world that someone who opposed \nthe Landrieu amendment would not be here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. With the assistant majority leader's suggestion we \nproceed to two votes, I raise no objection.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the second vote be a \n10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 316 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 2056) was rejected.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2058\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes for debate evenly divided prior to the vote on the Landrieu \namendment No. 2058.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, we only have 1 minute. I yield 30 \nseconds to my colleague from Connecticut and 30 seconds to my colleague \nfrom Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Landrieu-Cochran \namendment. Frankly, I do not see why any Member would vote against this \namendment. It is the most progressive advance in reform in title I \nsince the founding of this program in 1965. It is a program that is not \nworking now. Every State gets more money under this program. Within \nevery State, poor children, who were the focus of ESEA when it was \ncreated in 1965, will get more support for their education.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah may proceed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as the Senator from Connecticut has \nsaid, title I is not working as well as we had anticipated. One of the \nrules of life is that if you want to keep getting the same results, you \nkeep doing the same things.\n  This is the first significant change in title I in its philosophy and \napproach that we have had in many years. It rewards effort and it \nbrings equity. If we want to have true education reform, we vote for \nthe Cochran-Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute in opposition.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \nopposition be yielded back and we begin the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Members should be advised this is a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2058.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 81, nays 19, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 317 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--81\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--19\n\n     Allen\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Carnahan\n     Clinton\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Schumer\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 2058) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I say to Senators that the Chair has \nbeen trying to get order. The Chair has been trying to get order. The \nChair has been trying to get order.\n  I think it is about time that Senators pay some respect, show some \nrespect toward the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  I have sought the floor at this time to urge that we get on with \naction on this bill. I believe today is the beginning of the period \nallotted by the fourth CR.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which extends from November 1 to the 16th. It is not a very \npretty picture when we pause to reflect on the work that remains to be \ndone--remains to be done on appropriations bills. Here we are on \nNovember 1. We have 2 months left in this year, in this calendar year, \nand we are far into the fiscal year: Two conference reports have passed \nthe House and Senate and are pending at the White House, the Interior \nbill and the military construction bill.\n  Three conferences have been completed with floor action pending--the \nHouse will act on these three conference reports and may have already \nacted on them by this time; I am not sure--on Treasury, on energy and \nwater development, and on legislative branch. The Senate could proceed \nquickly to finish those. If the Senate is able to finish those 3 \nconference reports by the end of the day, that will make a total of 5 \nout of 13.\n  There are five conferences that are expected to be completed by \nTuesday, November 6. They are these: VA-HUD, foreign operations, \nTransportation, Agriculture, and Commerce-State-Justice. That will make \na total of 10 if those conferences can be completed.\n  Senator Stevens and I have talked with the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee and urged that we get our conferees together \nand get these conferences going. So there is a lot of effort being \nexpended. A lot of time is being expended that isn't seen on this \nfloor.\n  We do a lot of work off this floor. We are here in the evenings. We \nare here when darkness has fallen over the city. It is not a safe city \nto be in. It has not been for a long time, for that matter. But that is \nan aside.\n  We need to get this work done on the floor. We have a bill here that \nwe ought to move. I urge all Senators who have amendments not to put \nthem off until next week thinking they can do better next week. They \nare not going to do as well next week. I urge Senators to call up their \namendments and let the managers know. Both managers are here. They have \nbeen here. Let's get on with this business.\n  Let me remind Senators how important this bill is. If any Senators \nare here expecting to increase the amounts of money for anything in \nthis bill, or to add moneys, let me tell you what you\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nare doing. If there is any effort here to alter the 302(b) allocation, \nyou had better forget it because I am here ready, as one Senator, to \nmove to table any such amendment. Just as quickly as I can get the \nfloor, I will move to table it.\n  I have discussed this with my counterpart, my distinguished friend, \nMr. Stevens. He is here to speak for himself. But I can tell you one \nthing. You had better forget it if you are thinking about adding money \nto this bill.\n  Let me tell you what you will be doing. You will be creating problems \nfor items that are vital to you and your constituents. You will be \ncreating problems in the House if you do that because the House \nAppropriations Committee and subcommittees have the same allocation \nthat we have over here in the Senate.\n  This bill includes $51 billion for the Department of Education, $4 \nbillion above the President's request. I fought to get that additional \n$4 billion. We wrestled like Jacob with the angel overnight to get that \nadditional $4 billion for education in this bill.\n  Let some Senator come on this floor and try to alter the allocation. \nThey are going to have a fight. You might as well get ready when they \ncome here. I fought to get that additional $4 billion for education. It \nwasn't easy. All of us agreed on it. The four appropriators--the \nchairman of the House committee, the chairman of the Senate committee, \nthe ranking member of the House committee, and the ranking member of \nthe Senate committee--agreed to the $4 billion.\n  I say to all Senators that I don't mean to be mean spirited, but I am \ntrying to be realistic. We have to get this work done. If you are \ncounting on coming here and adding moneys on this bill and calling the \naddition an emergency, forget it, because we included in that agreement \namong the four House and Senate chairmen and with the President that \nthere would be $2.2 billion for emergencies. Please don't come on this \nSenate floor with the idea that you are going to add something and you \nare going to designate it as an emergency. We are going to fight you \nover that, if you do it, because we have fought over this and we have \nworked over there. There is no point in going through the motion just \nso you can get a headline in your papers.\n  It is $4 billion above the President's request and nearly $6.4 \nbillion for education. That is an increase of 15 percent over last \nyear.\n  Also in this bill is $1.549 billion, an increase of $136.4 million \nfor dislocated worker programs. These funds are used by States for \nrapid response assistance to help workers affected by mass layoffs and \nplant closures. These fund are critical now more than ever with layoff \nfigures increasing across the country. That is a very important item in \nthis bill.\n  There is $1.343 billion for community, school, homeless, and migrant \nhealth centers, an increase of $175 million. That is doing pretty well. \nThese centers provide primary health care to over 12 million Americans, \nthe majority without health insurance. By providing access to basic \nhealth care, health centers save the health care system billions of \ndollars in reduced use of costly emergency room, specialty, and \nhospital inpatient care.\n  What an important bill this is. That is important.\n  Senators and staff should not contemplate coming here messing with \nthis bill. If you can really improvement it, we will be for you. But we \nthink this bill is the best that can be done with the limited resources \nwe have. Of course, we would like to spend more money for all of these \nthings--some of us would.\n  There is $4.419 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. That is an increased of $300.6 million, including funds for \nchildhood immunization, HIV prevention activities, epidemic services, \nfunds to strengthen the ability of State and local health departments \nto respond to bioterrorism, and to maintain the pharmaceutical \nstockpile.\n  This deals with bioterrorism. What can be more important to the \nAmerican people? The Centers for Disease Control has played a primary \nrole in responding to the recent anthrax attacks in Washington, New \nYork, and Florida.\n  In addition, there is $23.695 billion for the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  If Senators want to come in here and add moneys for something, what \nare they going to offset the addition with? Who wants to take moneys \nout of the National Institutes of Health?\n  That is an increase of $3.4 billion over last year. This increase is \nthe fourth year of a 5-year effort to double the funding for NIH. Saved \nlives, new cures and treatments, and a thriving biomedical research \nindustry are the result of substantial Federal investment in medical \nresearch.\n  Also in this bill is $2 billion for substance abuse treatment \nprograms.\n  Who wants to take money out of that to offset something else?\n  That is an increase of $80 million. Studies have shown that substance \nabuse treatment is effective at reducing primary drug use by 50 \npercent, criminal activity by 80 percent, and drug- and alcohol-related \nmedical visits by 50 percent.\n  There is $2 billion in here for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  Who wants to take money out that for an offset?\n  This program is more important than ever, given the weak economy and \nthe shortfalls experienced by State programs last year.\n  There is $1.209 billion for aging programs, an increase of $107 \nmillion, including an increase of over $5.5 million for home-delivered \nand congregate meals. Last year, almost one out of every six Americans \nwas over 60 years of age. While the total population of the US \nincreased by 13 percent since 1990, those in the age category 75-84, \nincreased at twice that rate.\n  There is $10.2 billion for Title I grants to local education \nagencies, an increase of $1.4 billion. These grants provide funds to \nschools, especially in high-poverty areas, to help low-income, low-\nachieving students learn to the same high standards as other students.\n  There is $3.039 billion for State grants to improve teacher quality, \nan increase of $440 million. States and local educational agencies use \nthese funds to reduce class size, reform teacher certification \nrequirements, recruit teachers, provide existing teachers with \nprofessional development opportunities, and implement teacher mentoring \nprograms.\n  The Senate bill includes sufficient funds to increase the maximum \nPell Grant to $4,000, the highest ever and an increase of $250 over \nlast year. Pell Grants are the foundation of postsecondary student aid, \nallowing millions of low- and moderate-income students to attend \ncollege and other postsecondary educational programs.\n  That is all I have to say, except, please, let's get on with this \nbill. We are fast approaching Thanksgiving. We ought to be home with \nour families. Let's not be tied up here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this bill, in my judgment, is as \nimportant in this period of time with the war on terrorism as the \nDefense Department bill. It is a bill that must be finished as rapidly \nas possible. It contains money to assist all of the agencies dealing \nwith the problems of chemical and biological warfare, as well as all of \nthe items Senator Byrd has mentioned.\n  I am told we are very near an agreement. That may mean we can finish \nthis bill tonight. I encourage all parties to join in that effort \nbecause this bill is going to take a long time in conference. If I \ncount correctly, we have but 8 days in which we can conference this \nbill within the timeframe of the next continuing resolution. We have a \nholiday on the 12th. I think it is imperative we get this bill to the \nPresident as rapidly as possible.\n  I also want to state to the Senate that I have agreed to join Senator \nByrd on any effort to table an amendment that would violate the \nagreement we have with the House and with the President with regard to \nthe limitation on expenditures and the allocations within that \nlimitation of $686 billion. It is an agreement we made, and we hope the \nSenate will enable us to keep that agreement.\n  Madam President, I do not know where the people are who are going to \nenter into this agreement or take the steps that will be necessary to \nensure we finish this bill today, but I very much hope the Senate will \nagree and follow the suggestion of the chairman of the committee and \nget the bill done as rapidly as possible.\n\n[[Page S11317]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend, the \nformer chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I wonder if we might raise a question here concerning the DC \nappropriations bill. This is another bill that we could act upon, I \nwould think, today. I wonder if we might be able to make some \narrangement that will allow us to complete the DC appropriations bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I understand \nthe negotiations are underway to try to pursue the concept that we \npreviously discussed. That would be a means of trying to report the \nbill from committee with an amendment. That has not been agreed to yet, \nbut I hope it will be soon. I personally will support that concept. It \nwould be a matter of putting one amendment on the bill as it comes out \nof committee; and that amendment would be in conference. It is not an \namendment that is in the House bill.\n  So I would hope we would have an opportunity to take that path.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee will yield, there have been conversations with the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. The only way out of \nthe problem we have is what I talked about with the chairman. If the \ncommittee were limited to one amendment, that could happen very \nquickly. It could come to the floor, and we could finish the bill \nrapidly at that time.\n  I also say to my friend from West Virginia that during the votes, \nsignificant progress has been made on this bill. I think the light at \nthe end of the tunnel will be able to be seen in a little while.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank all Senators who have spoken. I \nparticularly thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens. \nAnd I thank the majority whip. I am available if I can be of assistance \nto him in pursuing this matter. I believe, as he says, we can see the \nlight at the end of the tunnel. There seems to be a willingness on the \npart of Senators who have an interest in the DC appropriations bill to \ncome to some agreement. As chairman of the committee, if I can be \nhelpful in engineering a reporting from the committee of the House bill \nwith an amendment, I will be happy to be of help.\n  I thank all Senators for listening. And I particularly thank the \nmanagers of the bill for the progress that has been made on the bill \nthus far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Iowa, I will \nbe just 2 or 3 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11317-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11317-S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 739\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 191, S. 739, the Homeless Veterans Program \nImprovement Act; that the committee-reported substitute amendment be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I could not hear the \nrequest.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from West Virginia, I am trying \nto move matters along as well.\n  The VA reported that there were 345,000 homeless veterans in 1999. \nThat was 34 percent higher than in 1998. The bill has been reported out \nof committee by Democrats and Republicans alike with unanimous support, \nI say to all my colleagues.\n  It is an annual authorization of $50 million for the Department of \nLabor program called HVRP, which does provide money to nonprofits to \nhelp train homeless veterans.\n  The second part supports community-based organizations which provide \nneeded social service programs for veterans.\n  The last piece sets up comprehensive homeless centers in the \ncountry's major metropolitan areas. That can be substance abuse \ncounseling, job counseling, and assisted housing.\n  This is the same bill that is moving in the House. This is my third \nor fourth time, colleagues, that I have come to this Chamber to ask \nunanimous consent to pass this bill.\n  Veterans Day is in the next week or so. We have men and women in \nharm's way. It is hardly any way to say thanks to veterans not to pass \nthis piece of legislation.\n  My guess is that over a third of the adult males who are homeless in \nthis country are veterans; many of them are Vietnam veterans. I do not \nknow why in the world this bill is being blocked. I do not know who has \nput on an anonymous hold. This is my third or fourth time requesting \nthat we pass this bill.\n  Therefore, one more time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to Calendar No. 191, S. 739, the Homeless Veterans \nProgram Improvement Act, with the support of Secretary Principi as \nwell; that the committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator from Minnesota is a good friend of mine, and I happen to be the \nonly Republican in the Chamber. There is a Republican objection. I do \nnot know who that Republican is, and I can maybe find out for the \nSenator. But I have to object for a Senator on my side, as long as I am \nin this position of being the only Republican Senator in this Chamber. \nSo I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just one more minute.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, I absolutely understand why he has \nto object. He is not speaking for himself. I know he is objecting on \nbehalf of someone who is anonymous. I am positive the Senator from Iowa \nwould be the first to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter, which is signed \nby AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, which \nbasically was addressed to Senator Lott, saying, move this bill, take \nobjections off, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                 October 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the co-authors of The \n     Independent Budget, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars, we are writing to you, as Minority Leader, to urge you \n     to work with your colleagues to remove holds that have been \n     placed on two pieces of legislation that are important to our \n     Nation's veterans.\n       These two measures, S. 1188, the ``Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Nurse Recruitment and Retention Enhancement Act of \n     2001'' and S. 739, the ``Heather French Henry Homeless \n     Veterans Assistance Act,'' are vital pieces of legislation to \n     the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. With \n     American servicemen and women on guard at home and abroad, we \n     find it difficult to believe that some Senators are placing \n     roadblocks and resorting to delaying tactics on passage of \n     legislation of such great benefit to seriously disabled \n     veterans who have also served their country with distinction. \n     These measures have almost universal support. It is time that \n     they be brought up, and voted upon.\n       We thank you, in advance, for your assistance in this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph A.

Let me also say to my colleague from Iowa--and this is \nnot aimed at him--as I have said, this is the third or fourth time I \nhave come to the floor asking unanimous consent that we pass this \nlegislation. I would\n\n[[Page S11318]]\n\nappreciate it if whoever has an anonymous hold on this bill would be \nwilling to step forward. But I want to make it crystal clear to the \nminority leader, and other colleagues, that I have a hold on every \npiece of legislation from the other side of the aisle that is not \nemergency legislation. I have a standing hold on all of your \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak on another subject, I say \nto the Senator from Minnesota, I hope he knows my practice; when I put \na hold on a piece of legislation or an individual, I put a statement in \nthe Record as to why I have put on that hold, so you know that it is \nSenator Grassley who has a hold on that item. I do not approve of \nSenators putting holds on legislation and not doing it that way. But, \non the other hand, I am doing it for whoever that anonymous person is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I know that \nabout him. And I say to the Senator from Iowa, with a twinkle in my \neye, I am not putting any anonymous holds on any other legislation he \nis trying to move. I made it clear on the floor of the Senate, I am \nputting a hold on all of it unless it is absolutely an emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11318-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I come to this Chamber to address an \nissue that was discussed yesterday. I do it because I am the ranking \nRepublican on the Senate Finance Committee. I want to respond to some \nSenators on the other side of the aisle--meaning the majority side of \nthe aisle--who have raised concerns about legislation that I have put \nforth as part of a stimulus package. I put forth this legislation for \nour Republican caucus in my capacity as former chairman and now ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. So I want to respond, first, to the \nmajority leader's and Budget Committee chairman's comments about the \nSenate Republican caucus proposal.\n  From my point of view, these comments were destructive of \nbipartisanship. The attacks came yesterday afternoon on the floor, \nfollowing a news conference that was held on the Capitol grounds. In \ncontrast, while these things were going on yesterday, I spent time \nworking for an agreement that crossed party lines; in other words, for \na bipartisan agreement.\n  In fact, for a number of weeks, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, and I have been meeting in an attempt to \nfind an agreement on a stimulus package.\n  Last week, Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus released a stimulus \nproposal that, as they indicated, clearly reflected the more liberal \npart of the Democratic caucus. Senator Baucus made it clear that it was \nbasically a negotiating position and that he would be willing to move \nto the center.\n  The proposal was released as a position for the Democratic caucus. It \nwas made very clear in statements, well-intentioned on the part of \nSenator Baucus, that it was basically a negotiating position and that \nhe would be willing to move to the center, or saw that as necessary as \npart of the process to get legislation through the Senate.\n  In general, Republicans such as myself reacted constructively to the \nproposal. I was quoted in the press accordingly. I disagreed with the \nproposal Senator Baucus put forward, but I recognized it as an \nessential part of a process of getting a bill through the Senate. I saw \nit as a positive step. Quite frankly, I viewed it as a response to the \nbill that passed the House of Representatives.\n  On Tuesday of this week, we Republicans responded to the Democratic \ncaucus position with one from our own caucus. From our point of view, \nit mirrored the President's stimulus plan. What kind of a reception did \nwe get after we released our plan? In this era of bipartisanship and \ncollegiality, something bad happened. The attack dogs were unleashed \nand with a fury. The same day, Senator Daschle harshly attacked our \nproposal in an extremely partisan, stilted manner.\n  The next afternoon, which was yesterday, Senator Conrad was on the \nfloor with the usual props he has--he uses them well--ferociously \ndenouncing the Senate Republican proposal. Rather than recognizing the \nproposal as part of the process, as we Republicans viewed the \nDemocratic proposal, the Democrats instead have turned up the partisan \nheat and are trying to torch any real plan that will help our economy \nand our country.\n  One has to wonder why we have such a double standard. Why is it that \none side obsessively attacks the other, that fault is not found on that \nside?\n  Senator Daschle, along with Senator Lott, has exercised leadership \nsince September 11. This had been a most important feature of doing \nbusiness in Washington, DC, in these times of anxiety while we are \ntrying to win the war on terrorism. The tone, as much as the substance, \nhas been critical to the success of the process.\n  Senator Daschle himself said we should not be ``strident'' in these \ntimes of trying to win a war. So you can imagine my surprise, even \nanger, and surely disappointment, when I read the tone of Senator \nDaschle's attack on the plan and, frankly, on me in press reports. \nBasically, Senator Daschle accused me of unilaterally stopping the \nstimulus process, particularly as it related to Republicans and \nDemocrats working out a bipartisan agreement.\n  I will read the quote into the Record:\n\n       We've waited in an effort to try and find a way to work in \n     a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, as a result of Grassley's \n     decision yesterday . . . that will not be possible, at least \n     in the short run . . .\n\n  I focus on Senator Daschle's quote because it is a bit ironic. As he \nwas criticizing me, I was preparing for a meeting with Senator Baucus \non the stimulus package. I guess if you ignore the fact that Democrats \nput out a partisan package last week, then Senator Daschle's quote \nwould make some sense. But, of course, that is not true. So Senator \nDaschle seems to be saying that it is fine for Democrats to put out a \ncaucus position and Republicans to be constructive, but if Republicans \nrespond with our own caucus position, then that is partisanship. The \nRepublican response justifies ramping up the content and the tone of \nthe partisan rhetoric.\n  The American people expect better. They know a double standard when \nthey see it. Let's get back to the tone Senator Daschle set earlier. \nThat is what I am asking for; that is a very good tone.\n  Let's not descend to name calling, destructive partisan comments, and \ndouble standards.\n  Now I move to Senator Conrad's attacks which occurred yesterday \nafternoon. Let me say, this is a preliminary response to Senator \nConrad's attack on the Senate Republican caucus plan. I will have a lot \nmore to say on that later, particularly after I get some figures back \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Senator Conrad spent a lot of time yesterday developing charts that \nwere critical of Senate Republican caucus positions which he \npersonalized by calling it the Grassley plan. He personalized his \nattacks, and that should be avoided. He decided to appoint himself as \nthe teacher and accordingly grade everyone's economic stimulus \nproposal. That is fine. He has that right. I don't have a problem with \nthat. If he is going to be the grader, though, I think he needs to be \nobjective. He needs to treat those plans that he opposes the same way \nhe treats those plans he supports. He does not do that.\n  The report card Senator Conrad used yesterday is not the whole set of \nprinciples upon which the budgeteers agreed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the \nbudgeteers' documents.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Principles for Economic Stimulus\n\n       The Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate \n     Budget Committees recognize the extraordinary circumstances \n     resulting from the September 11, 2001 attacks on our country. \n     These terrorist attacks have created a national emergency, \n     instigated a war on terrorism, and exacerbated\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\n     a slowdown in the economy. Clearly, the Congress and the \n     President will provide the resources necessary to respond to \n     these events. The principles articulated below are simply \n     intended to ensure that those resources provided by the \n     Congress and the President be an effective economic stimulus \n     package that does not erode fiscal discipline in the future.\n       Overall principle. An economic stimulus package should be \n     based on the recognition that long-term fiscal discipline is \n     essential to sustained economic growth. Measures to stimulate \n     the economy should be limited in time so that as the economy \n     recovers, the budget regains a surplus that is at least equal \n     to the surplus in Social Security. Any short-term economic \n     stimulus should not result in higher long-term interest \n     rates.\n       Objectives. An economic stimulus package should restore \n     consumer and business confidence, increase employment and \n     investment, and help those most vulnerable in an economic \n     downturn, and do all of the above without converting a \n     cyclical deficit into a structural deficit.\n       Timing. Congress should assemble an economic stimulus \n     package deliberatively but with dispatch, aiming for passage \n     within 3-4 weeks, based on the best economic data available.\n       Rapid impact. A substantial portion of the fiscal impact on \n     the economy should be felt within 6 months.\n       Sunset. All economic stimulus proposals should sunset \n     within 1 year, to the extent practicable.\n       Targets. Economic stimulus should be broad-based rather \n     than industry-specific. Policies should achieve the greatest \n     possible stimulus effect per dollar spent and should be \n     directed to individuals who are most likely to spend the \n     additional after-tax income and businesses most likely to \n     increase investment spending and employment.\n       Size. The economic stimulus package should equal \n     approximately 1 percent of GDP (about $100 billion) but \n     should count the budgetary effects of policies implemented \n     since August, which, at present, total roughly $40 billion.\n       Offsets. To uphold the policy of repaying the greatest \n     amount of national debt feasible between 2002-2011, outyear \n     offsets should make up over time for the cost of near-term \n     economic stimulus.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If you compared the budgeteers' principles with the \nreport card Senator Conrad generated, you will see, when you get a \nchance to read these, interestingly, that Senator Conrad omits four of \nthe nine principles. In other words, Senator Conrad has selected five \nof the nine principles agreed on by budgeteers. Most importantly, \nSenator Conrad didn't use the ``overall principle,'' which reads:\n\n       An economic stimulus package should be based on the \n     recognition that long-term fiscal discipline is essential to \n     economic growth. Measures to stimulate the economy should be \n     limited in time so that as the economy recovers, the budget \n     regains a surplus that is at least equal to the surplus in \n     Social Security. Any short-term economic stimulus should not \n     result in higher long-term interest rates.\n\n  There is nothing in that comment with which I disagree. The point is, \nthis principle is very important, and it ought to be followed. Senator \nConrad spent a lot of time dwelling on the rough 10-year revenue loss \nnumbers of the Senate Republican and Senate Democratic plan. Senator \nConrad, however, left out an important assumption. I will explore the \nassumption Senator Conrad left out.\n  As has been the case with all proposals from the Republican side, \nChairman Conrad has attacked the stimulus plan as, among other things, \n``fiscally irresponsible.'' Of course, I contest those unfounded and \nunfair criticisms. The plan is a straightforward proposal that will \nprovide immediate economic stimulus. It will also give aid to \ndislocated workers, and it will help with their health insurance \nproblems while being laid off, and it is fiscally reasonable. In fact, \nwe have been in discussions with Senator Baucus's staff on these latter \nissues, such as dislocated workers and health insurance issues. So our \nplan follows on the President's four principles that were really the \nstarting point of this debate first of all. That is what we ought to \ngive President Bush credit for. He was presenting to the Congress the \nneed for a stimulus package before many other people in Congress were \neven talking about the need for it.\n  Since his tenure as ranking member, and now chairman, of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad has placed all Republican tax cut proposals \nunder very strict scrutiny. Senator Conrad has assumed that any \ntemporary tax cut, no matter the terms of the proposal, would be made \npermanent. The assumption was then incorporated into his budgetary \nanalysis. Without fail, the conclusion is then used as a basis to argue \nthat long-term budget implications of any temporary tax cut make it \n``fiscally irresponsible.''\n  We have before us a Democratic caucus stimulus proposal that contains \ntwo elements. One element is a combination of tax cuts and new \ntemporary entitlement spending. Another element of the proposal is \nSenator Byrd's $20 billion ``infrastructure package.'' The two elements \nhave been frequently mentioned by Democrat leadership, including \nSenators Daschle and Reid, as the Senate Democratic position. When \nanalyzed, these proposals are described as having a fiscal impact of \n$90 billion in fiscal year 2002 and $60 billion over 10 years.\n  Here is where you get into this double standard of scoring \nRepublicans one way and Democrats another way. The scoring presented by \nthe Democratic caucus, however, fails to employ Senator Conrad's \nconvention regarding permanency. They don't take that into \nconsideration. If we apply Chairman Conrad's convention to the new \nspending and assume permanency, the 10-year cost of the new spending \npackage totals $526 billion.\n  Think about it, Mr. President. In these times, Senator Conrad has \ndetermined that it is fiscally responsible to spend an additional $526 \nbillion over 10 years. As a point of reference, this figure compares \nwith the tax cuts of roughly $175 billion in the Senate Republican \ncaucus position.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the 10-year cost of the \nnew spending in the Democratic caucus stimulus plan be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    ANALYSIS OF SURPLUS IMPACT OF PERMANENT SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS\n                           STIMULUS PROPOSALS\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                FY 2002-\n                                                       FY 2002     11\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Under Chairman Conrad's methodology, one of two \nconclusions is apparent from this exercise. One, if tax cuts and new \nspending are treated similarly, then under Chairman Conrad's \nmethodology, the Democratic caucus package is $350 billion bigger than \nthe Republican caucus package. That is a 2-to-1 ratio in favor of new \nspending. Alternatively, maybe Senator Conrad is arguing that in \nscoring there should be a bias against tax cuts and in favor of new \nspending by assuming that new spending is temporary.\n  Since a key element of the budgeteers' principles was long-term \nbudget effect, you would think Senator Conrad would have more carefully \nconsidered the 10-year cost of new appropriations and new entitlements. \nIt seems to me he graded these plans long before he analyzed them. How \nelse can Senator Conrad explain the laxity of the long-term spending \neffect?\n  Adding new appropriations and new entitlement spending to the budget, \neven if labeled temporary, brings a long-term budget cost. Otherwise, \nwe are trying to kid people. When was the last time we cut the \nappropriations baseline or a new entitlement? It doesn't happen around \nhere.\n  Now keep in mind that I have also asked the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to score the permanent effect of temporary tax cuts in each \nplan, but I do not have that analysis yet. I have had my staff work on \nit. They tell me it might narrow the gap some but would simply add to \nthe total 10-year cost of each plan. Keep in mind that in making this \ncomparison, I did not include the revenue loss of the Democratic caucus \nplan.\n  When former Senator Bradley left this body, he cited many reasons for \nleaving. One of the colorful references was to the deterioration of the \nlevel of floor debate. He referred to Senate debate as deteriorating to \ncompeting partisan cartoon-type characters endlessly talking past one \nanother. Unfortunately, yesterday's attack charts seem to me to \nillustrate the deterioration of the respect to which Senator Bradley \nwas referring.\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\n  A few months ago, the Washington Post reported approvingly of the \nDemocratic leadership's message strategy. The article referred to a \nblackboard with a basic daily or weekly message. Apparently, \nyesterday's message was to attack a good-faith Republican caucus \nposition and to attack me. I guess I say good job, or congratulations \nare in order, because the people who did it pulled off a well-\ncoordinated attack.\n  What did such a harsh attack accomplish? When I go back to my farm \nthis weekend, I imagine some of the folks back home might ask what the \npoint of all that was. That is where I am, Mr. President. What is the \npoint of this excessive partisan gamesmanship? What is the point of \ndumbing down the level of civility around here?\n  I say all these things in a constructive manner--from a person who \njust yesterday met with Senator Baucus to talk about a process of \ngetting a stimulus package--hopefully, a bipartisan stimulus package--\nto the floor of the Senate. Although the transgressors in this case \nwere Democrats, at times even my own Republicans have done the same \nthing. In this case, though, there really seems to be a Democratic rule \nbook that includes a double standard.\n  So as one who practices bipartisanship, I say to those who talk about \nit: Practice what you preach.\n  As I said, I will have more to say in a comprehensive way about some \nof Senator Conrad's attacks on the specific pieces of the Senate \nRepublican stimulus package.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11320-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11320-S11329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH, AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there have been very extensive \ndiscussions on the issue relating to stem cells, which is in the bill, \nrelating to what President Bush did on August 9 using existing stem \ncell lines, in an effort to codify that and give the President \nauthority to move in that direction. The stem cell issue has been very \ncontroversial for reasons which do not have to be amplified at this \ntime.\n  A good bit of the debate on the subject has been between the Senator \nfrom Kansas, Mr. Brownback, and myself. Senator Brownback has posed a \nseries of amendments, which he intends to bring up on this bill, of a \nvery complex nature. The amendments Senator Brownback has proposed to \nbring up involve the questions of the human germ line gene which I will \nnot begin to explain at the moment, issues about therapeutic cloning, \nwhere science has given a name which suggests reproductive cloning, \nwhich it is not, but very complicated as to how it is worked out; \namendments on the prohibition of the mixing of human and animal gametes \nwhere there has been some scientific thought that although very \nrepugnant on its face, there are some important scientific issues \ninvolved.\n\n  One of the matters was submitted to the American Society for \nReproductive Medicine, and they have not even taken a position on it, \nwhich shows the complexity of the issue.\n  Were we to proceed with these amendments, on which we have consulted \nwith the Parliamentarian, who says they are germane because there is \nsome sufficient--it does not require a whole lot to make them \nappropriate, and the Senator from Kansas has every right to bring them. \nI do not know how long it would take to debate them.\n  In the course of the past 2 days, we have talked about second-degree \namendments, and we have talked about many subjects which are \nextraordinarily complicated. I have been trying to get up to speed to \nknow what to say about them.\n  The concerns I have involve the issue of unintended consequences. \nThat is a doctrine well-known in our culture. When one deals with these \nscientific issues, many scientists have told me it would stultify their \nactivities, or at a minimum have a profoundly chilling effect.\n  So after very extensive discussions, what we have decided to do is to \ndefer this matter to another day. The reason we have decided to defer \nthis matter to another day is we have a very important appropriations \nbill funding the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human \nServices, and the completion of this bill at an early date is important \nso we can go to conference.\n  Ten days ago, I had a long discussion with Senator Lott about seeing \nthe need to conclude our work by November 16, which is the week before \nThanksgiving. I have found my constituents in Pennsylvania are more \ninterested in hearing what is going on in Washington now than they have \never been in the 21 years I have been in the Senate. It is obvious, \nwith the war on terrorism going on, with the fighting in Afghanistan \nagainst the Taliban, and the bombing and the complexities there, then \nwith the anthrax, there is an enormous concern across the country about \nbioterrorism. There is a real need, it seems to me, for Senators to be \nin their States and Members of the House to be in their districts to \ntalk to their constituents, to tell them we do have a plan, we do know \nwhat is going on, and we are working constructively on these issues.\n  Ideally we should complete work on these appropriations bills as of \nSeptember 30, but we know from practice we have continuing resolutions \nand the complexities of our work take us beyond that point. What really \nhappens is that among the 535 of us, and add the executive branch, we \ndebate and argue and hassle until we have our backs against the wall \nand really have to conclude our deliberations.\n  I said to Senator Lott about 10 days ago I thought all of us were \ngoing to have to make concessions on some of the issues which we \nthought were of enormous importance and had to be resolved, and I am \nprepared to do that today. Senator Brownback is prepared to do that \ntoday.\n  These issues will be taken up, though, and in the very near future. \nSenator Brownback and I talked to the majority leader, Senator Daschle, \nwho agreed to bring up the stem cell issue with an opportunity for \nSenator Brownback to raise his issues in the February/March timeframe. \nI consulted with Senator Lott, in the event Senator Lott is the \nmajority leader at that time, and got a similar commitment from Senator \nLott to bring up stem cells and Senator Brownback's issues in the \nFebruary/March timeframe.\n\n  Senator Lott had agreed to have a freestanding bill when he was \nmajority leader, where we deferred action on stem cells going back to \nSeptember in the fall of 1999. It was a very different issue, and he \nwanted to await developments as to what would be happening on the \nscientific front.\n  These discussions were held. Senator Reid was a party to them.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nevada to confirm the representations I \nhave made about Senator Daschle's commitment to have a freestanding \nbill in the February/March timeframe.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader understands how important this is to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. I am a member of the subcommittee he \nchaired and of which he is now the ranking member. He has held a number \nof extremely interesting hearings on this subject and has really perked \neveryone's interest in the Senate on this issue.\n  Senator Brownback feels just as fervently, and I think it is \nextremely appropriate, as does the majority leader, that there be a \ndiscussion on this issue, as indicated by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania, with Senator \nHarkin, will hold a number of hearings on this prior to that date. I \nlook forward to the discussion.\n  I think it is really good these two fine Senators worked out this \narrangement because I think everyone needs more knowledge. This is a \nnew area, a new field of science, at least for most of us. I think with \nthe passage of a few months we will be in much better shape to listen \nintelligently, and perhaps a number of us will be able to join in the \ndebate. If we had these votes today, a lot of us would be really in \nuncharted territory. We have not had\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\nhearings on a lot of these issues. There is not a lot of material we \nhave had to go through, and so I applaud and compliment these two \nSenators for allowing us to work this out. I know Senator Harkin feels \nthe same way.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Nevada for those comments. He \nis correct on the issue of holding the hearings.\n  I have conferred with the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nHarkin, who agrees we need to have the hearings. I have discussed it \nwith Senator Brownback. These issues are extraordinarily complicated. \nWe are going to have to have a whole series of hearings with regard to \nthe complicated issues so we can know what we are doing on making \npublic policy, especially in the context where Senator Brownback's \namendments carry penal sanctions, jail terms and fines, so that we can \nknow what we should be doing in the public interest but not stifling \nscience.\n  Senator Brownback and I have worked together over the years on a \ngreat many items, and we have had some lively television discussions. I \nthink when we finally get around to this discussion it will be lively \nas well.\n  I yield to my colleague from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and particularly \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania who has been quite patient and \ndiligent in working with me. I might also note that Bettilou Taylor on \nhis staff has been wonderful to work with, as well as Senator Reid from \nNevada, who has really worked to try to push these issues forward so we \ncan get to some point of resolution on the underlying bill. I am not \nunaware of the need to move this bill through. We need to get the \nappropriations bills moved. We need to get this done so we can get to \nthe economic stimulus package and be able to conclude it. I am pleased \nto see we have some resolution on the overall issue.\n\n  I will point out what I am talking about in the amendments I was \nproposing. We had filed four of these amendments and were willing to \nput them into one amendment, have one vote, and have a moratorium for 1 \nyear on several items. The moratorium would include human cloning. No \nhuman cloning, whether it be reproductive, or so-called their \nfuturistic-type, for 1 year, a 1-year moratorium on germ line \nmanipulation, where you insert a snippet of a genetic code from a cow \nor pig into the egg or sperm of a human, so that once they connect to \neach other they become fertilized. It goes on to future generations. It \nwould ban that for a year's period of time. It would ban for a year's \nperiod of time, embryo ``farming'' where embryos were created just for \nresearch purposes.\n  That was the series of amendments we put forward and were germane to \nthis debate.\n  We have had extensive negotiations and discussions back and forth. \nThe belief is that Members could be more up to speed on these topics \ncome February or March. The majority leader has agreed to a free-\nstanding bill at that point in time in order to get direct votes on \nthese issues. That is the more appropriate way. It is the right way. I \nam appreciative of the majority leader and Senator Reid for agreeing to \nthat taking place so we can take this up at a more prudent time, with \nhearings in between taking place.\n  It is my understanding what we would agree to would be that I not \noffer these amendments at this time; that we will have free-standing \ndebate, discussion and vote come the February-March timeframe on these \ntopics and the topics Senator Specter is putting forward, with direct \nvotes up or down on the topics, and none in the second degree or \ntabled. These are direct votes. And the language Senator Specter \ninserted that was in the appropriations bill, which was beyond what the \nPresident was asking for on stem cell research, would not be in the \nfinal Labor-HHS appropriations bill as it passes out of the Senate.\n  This is good progress on a very difficult issue. By that point in \ntime, we will be on board with the executive branch on the biomedical \nresearch. They are enormously important.\n  I enter one quick note into the record. Scientists say the first \nhuman clone is near--a group says within the end of the year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have several other articles printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of this colloquy, including a story about the \nrhesus monkey which has been cloned. That was announced this week. That \nis the closest model to a human off which we work. If you can do it \nthere, you can probably do it in a human. The technology leap is not \nfar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. For these reasons I think it is an appropriate way to \nproceed. I am pleased Senator Specter has been so kind in working with \nus. Senator Reid and Senator Daschle, the majority leader, have agreed \nto this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the language which will be stricken \nappears on page 91 and reads as follows:\n\n       Subject to the provisions of section 510(a) and (b), \n     Federal dollars are permitted at the discretion of the \n     President solely for the purpose of stem cell research on \n     embryos that have been created in excess of clinical need and \n     will be discarded and donated with the written consent of the \n     progenitors.\n\n  That will be stricken.\n  I have legislation pending which would permit the use of Federal \nfunding to extract stem cells from embryos. The precise format of the \nlegislation which I will propose will be determined, and I will give \nSenator Brownback ample notice as to what I intend to do. We will have \nthe hearings on that, and we will have the hearings on the issue which \nSenator Brownback has raised with Senators.\n  It is worthwhile making one comment on the nature of complexity as to \nconcerns which my staff and I have had. I echo Senator Brownback's \npraise for Bettilou Taylor and also acknowledge the contribution of Dr. \nSudip Parikh, an assistant with us, and also Mr. Rob Wasinger, who is \nwith Senator Brownback. A concern expressed to me by many doctors has \nbeen whether there would be a danger of eliminating therapeutic \ncloning. Regretfully the words ``cloning'' and ``therapeutic cloning'' \nhave given it a very bad name.\n  What it amounts to--and this is an illustration--is taking a cell, \nfor example, from a woman who has Parkinson's; take the nucleus out of \nthe cell and take an egg from a woman donor whose nucleus has been \nremoved, and put the nucleus from the cell of the woman who is the \npatient, put it into the egg where the nucleus has been removed. You \nwait 5 to 7 days, and then you have a blastocystic state of an embryo. \nThe stem cell which is extracted can then be used on the patient, who \nis a woman, to cure Parkinson's.\n  That is a very brief statement, but in the complexities of the \namendments we might not have had that opportunity. We will be going \ninto these issues and a great many others. I think had we debated it on \nthe Senate floor today, as Senator Reid has said, it would have been \nvery difficult to grasp these issues.\n  When Members want to have penal provisions, jail sentences and fines, \nthose are matters which require a lot of deliberation as to what is \nappropriate for deterrence and what is appropriate as a punishment.\n  The arrangement we have worked out today is an important arrangement. \nMost fundamentally, it allows moving forward on this bill, conclude \nthis bill, go to conference, and get it passed. To pick up on the \nconversation with Senator Lott, we show our willingness to make \nconcessions on matters we would like to work on now, but it can wait \nuntil the February-March timeframe.\n  I hope my colleagues in the House and Senate will undertake the same \nkind of consideration to decide what we have to decide now, move ahead \nwith airport security and the stimulus package and the matters of \nabsolute necessity, the appropriations bills. If matters can be \ndeferred, as Senator Brownback and I have deferred until March, that \nshould be the order of the day so we can go back to our States or \ndistricts and explain to people of America what is going on so they \nknow with some confidence we do have a plan, we do have a program, and \nwe are working in a constructive way in the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to make sure from Senator Reid of Nevada \nwe have accurately reflected this\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nin the Record. I hope this is accurately reflected as to when Senator \nReid and the majority leader agreed on bringing up this issue.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kansas, the statement made by you \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania is accurate. I was in on the \nconversation of the majority leader and he, without any hesitation, \nindicated he would hold the hearings within the timeframe you \nindicated, the February-March time period.\n  We all acknowledge it is the right thing to do, and it is something \nwe need to do. The statement made by the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Kansas is absolutely accurate.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                      [From Reuters, Oct. 5, 2001]\n\n                Scientist Says First Human Clone is Near\n\n                          (By Michele Kambas)\n\n       Nicosia (Reuters).--Scientists could create the first \n     cloned human before the end of the year, a doctor with the \n     controversial project said on Friday.

Embryos cloned from a rhesus monkey \n     are being prepared in the United States and could be \n     implanted into a surrogate mother. The first monkey clone \n     could be born within months. The work, by Don Wolf, of the \n     Oregon Regional Primate Research Centre, has successfully \n     combined techniques in the cloning of embryonic cells with \n     somatic cells, which make up adult animal bodies.\n       Prof. Wolf deplores human reproductive cloning and says he \n     wants to produce genetically identical laboratory monkeys to \n     accurately test drugs and therapies. But the research is \n     being closely watched by groups interested in creating the \n     first human clone. Severino Antinori, an Italian fertility \n     specialist, has set up a group of researchers who hope to \n     create the first human clone ``within months''.\n       The new discoveries have been described as ``a significant \n     step in the wrong direction'' by the Pro Life Alliance. Bruno \n     Quintavalle, its spokesman, said: ``Cloning has so far been \n     confined to livestock animals for which there can, arguably, \n     be agricultural reasons for cloning research. ``But what \n     possible reason can there be for replicating a rhesus monkey? \n     There is no reason we can see, other than to formulate and \n     clarify processes which can be used later for cloning \n     humans.'' The alliance will take the Government to the High \n     Court on Wednesday to seek a judicial review of Britain's \n     cloning legislation. The group says the laws are full of \n     loopholes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Sunday Times (London), Oct. 28, 2001]\n\n          Monkey Test Breakthrough Brings Human Clones Closer\n\n                  (By Jonathan Leake, Science Editor)\n\n       Scientists have created the first embryonic clones of an \n     adult primate and are preparing to implant them into \n     surrogate mothers. The work--involving embryos cloned from a \n     rhesus monkey--is a significant development in cloning \n     technology. Until now all the research had suggested that \n     primates would be far more difficult to clone than species \n     such as sheep and goats, which have already been used \n     successfully in experiments. The primate breakthrough is \n     certain to be seen as powerful evidence that it is now \n     possible to clone a human being. The researchers have \n     predicted that they will achieve the live birth of a non-\n     human primate within months.\n       The latest results were achieved in America by Professor \n     Don Wolf, of the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, who \n     is one of the most respected workers in the field. Cloning \n     cells from embryos is known to be relatively easy. This \n     weekend, however, Wolf said the same technique was working \n     well with somatic cells--the kind that make up the bodies \n     of adult animals. He said: ``We have been working with \n     somatic cells and believe that success is just around the \n     corner as the cloned embryos created from them are growing \n     well in vito.''\n       Wolf was unable to say when the embryos might be implanted \n     into surrogate mothers. The females need to be at exactly the \n     right stage of their oestrous cycles, and this is hard to \n     predict.\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\n       Wolf's interest in such work has nothing to do with human \n     reproductive cloning--a concept that he and most other \n     serious researchers deplore. Their aim is to create lines of \n     genetically identical laboratory animals that can be used to \n     test drugs and therapies much more accurately. Additionally, \n     cloning technology holds out the possibility that humans \n     could one day grow replacement tissues for damaged organs.\n       There are, however, a number of other groups that are \n     intensely interested in using the work done by researchers \n     such as Wolf to clone humans. One group of researchers is led \n     by Dr. Severino Antinori, the Italian fertility specialist, \n     who has set up a consortium in an attempt to create the first \n     human clone ``within the next few months''.\n       Some researchers say such a venture is fraught with danger \n     since cloned animals seem to be prone to a number of genetic \n     defects that could also affect a human child. The validity of \n     such fears has been borne out by the latest results from a \n     second team of researchers, which is also working on cloning \n     rhesus monkeys. Its leader, Professor Gerald Schatten, of \n     Pittsburgh University, said that like Wolf he had also \n     recently created embryonic cloned rhesus monkeys--and had \n     already attempted to implant them into females. So far, \n     however, he has been unable to achieve a pregnancy, and last \n     week his analysis suggested that this was because the cloning \n     process had disrupted the organisation of the chromosomes \n     that carry the animals' DNA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From The Sunday Times, Oct. 22, 2001]\n\n                      First Primate Embryos Cloned\n\n                          (By Jonathan Leake)\n\n       Scientists have created the first embryonic clones of an \n     adult primate and are preparing to implant them into \n     surrogate mothers. The project--involving embryos cloned from \n     a rhesus monkey--is a significant development in the \n     technology of cloning. Until now research had suggested \n     primates would be far more difficult to clone than species \n     such as sheep and goats, which have already been successfully \n     duplicated.\n       The primate breakthrough is seen as strong evidence it is \n     possible to clone a human being. The researchers say they \n     will achieve the live birth of a primate within months. The \n     results were achieved in the US by Don Wolf of the Oregon \n     Regional Primate Research Centre. Cloning cells from \n     embryos is relatively easy, and Professor Wolf said the \n     same technique was working well with somatic cells from \n     adult animals.\n       The next step is for the embryos to be implanted into \n     surrogate mothers. This process needs the females to be at \n     exactly the right stage of their oestrous cycles, and this is \n     hard to predict.\n       Professor Wolf's work has nothing to do with human \n     reproductive cloning--a concept he and most other serious \n     researchers deplore. Their aim is to create lines of \n     genetically identical laboratory animals that can be used to \n     test drugs and therapies much more accurately than is now \n     possible. However, a number of groups are keen to use the \n     work done by researchers such as Professor Wolf to clone \n     humans. One body of researchers is led by Severino Antinori, \n     the Italian fertility specialist who has set up a consortium \n     in an attempt to create the first human clone ``within the \n     next few months''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I was unavoidably absent from the \nChamber a few minutes ago, but I want to compliment my distinguished \nranking member, Senator Specter, for working out an agreement on the \nvital issue of stem cell research. I know there are Senators who feel \nstrongly about this one way or the other. I understand that. But I \nbelieve the agreement Senator Specter has worked out is one that will \nserve us well. We will have hearings. We will welcome all to come in \nand testify at these hearings on stem cells. I understand the agreement \nis that prior to the end of March, sometime in either February or March \nof next year, both the majority leader and minority leader have agreed \nthat we will bring a stem cell research bill to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  With that agreement, I think it paves the way for us to have some \nmore in-depth hearings on whether or not we have enough stem cell lines \nto do the kind of research that needs to be done, or whether we do, in \nfact, need some more stem cell lines to conduct this kind of robust \nresearch. We will be having those hearings.\n  Sometimes Senator Specter chairs them and sometimes I do. But we will \ncontinue to have those hearings throughout the next few months. Even \nthough the Senate may not be in session, we will continue to have those \nhearings to try to get a better understanding of what we need to do to \nprovide the ethical guidelines and the kind of monetary support that we \nneed for our science to conduct embryonic stem cell research.\n  Because I was missing from the Chamber when that agreement was worked \nout, I wanted to compliment Senator Specter and other Senators for \nworking out an agreement on that issue.\n  Lastly, we are on the floor. Debate on the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and related agencies appropriations bill is about \nover. There are some amendments to offer. I ask Senators who have \namendments to please come to the floor and offer those amendments. The \nsooner we get to amendments, the sooner we will get out of here.\n  I just had one Senator come up to me asking about catching a flight \nout tonight. I say to my fellow Senators, if you will come over and \noffer the amendments, we can have a legitimate debate and vote on them. \nThen people could get out of here. The longer people stay away from the \nfloor and don't offer their amendments, people can't get out of here.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, this is the \nthird day that the Senator from Iowa and Senator Specter have managed \nthis bill. Significant progress has been made, especially today. But I \nthink enough time has gone by to wait for people to arrive. I hope that \nin a reasonable period of time, if people are not here to offer their \namendments, the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwould move to third reading. It is not fair to keep people waiting \naround. I, as the Senator from Iowa, have been approached several \ntimes. People say they have things to do rather than waiting around \ndoing nothing.\n  What drives people to distraction, and rightfully so, is when we are \nin these endless quorum calls waiting for people to come over with \namendments. They are not doing us a favor by offering the amendment, \nbut it is a right established under the precedents of the Senate.\n  I hope the two managers of the bill, in a reasonable period of time \nif we don't have people offering amendments, will move to third \nreading. We have a lot of other things to do tonight. We have three \nconference reports that have been approved by the House. We have to \ntake care of those today if we want to be out of session tomorrow. The \nleader indicated to me just a short time ago that he would like to not \nhave any votes tomorrow. But he is going to have votes tomorrow if we \ndon't complete this bill.\n  With the progress the Senator from Iowa and Senator Specter have made \nduring the time since the vote expired, I think we can clearly finish \nthe bill tonight. If not, we will drag this bill on. I repeat for the \nthird time that if Members are not coming to offer their amendments, we \nwill go to third reading.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank our assistant majority leader \nfor his great leadership in pulling people together and getting this \nlegislation moving, as he has done on so many other bills. He has been \nstalwart here on the floor to make this place work right and to make it \nwork fairly so people can offer their amendments to make sure we move \nin an expeditious manner. I thank the Senator for his leadership in \ngetting the Senate to do its work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have an amendment I will be offering \nhaving to do with impact aid. That is a very significant issue. One of \nthe best programs Congress put together was way back in the 1950s. That \nwas when\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\nthey made a determination that if the Federal Government came in and \nfederalized land, either for military purposes, Indian schools, or any \nother purpose, and took the land off the tax rolls, they would still \nhave to educate the kids. Slowly over the years, politicians--none in \nthis Chamber, I am sure--have been taking money out of the impact aid \naccount, so it has gone down to about 25 percent of what it really \nshould be.\n  I will be offering that amendment and wanting to discuss it.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Inhofe are located in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2018\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 2018 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2018.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the funding levels for certain activities under the \nImpact Aid program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n                                 1965)\n\n       On page 56, strike lines 5 through 17, and insert the \n     following:\n       For carrying out programs of financial assistance to \n     federally affected schools authorized by title VI of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as \n     redesignated and amended by H.R. 1 of the 107th Congress, as \n     passed by the House of Representatives on May 23, 2001, \n     $1,130,500,000, of which $982,500,000 shall be for basic \n     support payments under section 8003(b), $50,000,000 shall be \n     for payments for children with disabilities under section \n     8003(d) $35,000,000 shall be for construction under section \n     8007, $55,000,000 shall be for Federal property payments \n     under section 8002, and $8,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended, shall be for facilities maintenance under section \n     8008.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is an issue we have addressed many \ntimes. We addressed it first during the budget consideration when we \nwere going to increase impact aid by $300 million. Unfortunately, the \nappropriators have brought it down to an amount a little less than half \nthat.\n  Democrats and Republicans have set a goal so we will have impact aid \nfully funded sometime in the next 4 or 5 years. This will bring the \namount of basic support for impact aid equal to the House figure.\n  That is essentially the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have checked with the manager of the \nbill on this side. He has no objection to the amendment. We are \nconfident there is no objection on the other side.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, if some small chance there is a \nproblem with the minority, we will come back to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be fine. I will accept it.\n  Mr. REID. I ask approval of this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, with that agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2018) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been waiting literally all afternoon \nfor two Senators to offer amendments. I don't really think it is fair \nto the rest of the Senate to wait around here as we have. Calls have \nbeen made. I don't know what more we can do other than move to third \nreading. At the appropriate time this afternoon, that is what we are \ngoing to do. Everyone should be on notice that is going to be done. I \nknow we talk about it all the time. I guess it is like the proverbial \ncrying of wolf all the time. We do everything we can for people to come \nand offer their amendments. I really think it is unfair that everyone \nis waiting.\n  At least 10 Senators are wanting to know what the schedule is and \nwhether they can make certain arrangements for travel tonight or \ntomorrow afternoon or tomorrow morning. We do not know. We are waiting \nfor people to come to offer amendments.\n  I hope Senators will be more considerate of the other 98 Senators, \nplus all the staff and everyone else trying to get this bill completed. \nI think it is really unfair that we have waited as long as we have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, \nhas an amendment dealing with charitable giving. It is one of two \namendments we believe remain on this bill. I have spoken with the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, and he has indicated that his side \nwill agree to 20 minutes, and this side will certainly agree to 20 \nminutes. So it will be 40 minutes equally divided. This will work out \nperfectly so we can have a vote prior to the briefing which is going to \ntake place in S-407. I propound that as a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2074\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson], for himself and \n     Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 2074.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds under the National Labor \n  Relations Act for the finding of unfair labor practices relating to \n              certain no-solicitation or no-access rules)\n\n       On page 22, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds made available under this Act \n     shall be used under the National Labor Relations Act to make \n     a finding of an unfair labor practice relating to a \n     published, written, or posted no-solicitation or no-access \n     rule that permits solicitation or access only for charitable, \n     eleemosynary, or other beneficent purposes.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, my amendment will allow employers to \npermit solicitations by charitable groups without subjecting themselves \nto what I believe is unfair and frivolous union litigation. It may \nsound odd that a law is needed to protect charitable giving, but \ncurrently when an employer permits such solicitations, it is likely to \nbe found by the National Labor Relations Board to have engaged in \nunlawful discrimination unless it provides unions equal access to the \nemployer's property to engage in solicitation or distribution for union \npurposes.\n  In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the need for legislation of \nthis type has never been greater. Currently, the NLRB interprets, I \nthink wrongly, the National Labor Relations Act to require that a \nretailer that regularly allows charities or civic organizations to \nsolicit or distribute material on the retailer's premises must also \ngrant similar access to labor unions who are seeking to organize the \nretailer's employees attempting to communicate a message to the \nretailers' customers.\n  Because of this, many of the Nation's largest retailers have adopted \nblanket no-solicitation rules which, unfortunately, include charitable \norganizations, to avoid being found in violation of unfair labor \npractices.\n  I want to mention a couple of the many examples that can be given of \nretailers that are affected by the current interpretations of the NLRB.\n  Example one: Prior to 1994, Meijer, Inc., located in Grand Rapids, \nMI, exercised its commitment to their communities and use of private \nproperty rights by allowing various charitable, religious, civic, \ncommunity, and government groups for activities such as fundraising \nactivities by groups such as United Way, Salvation Army, VFW, Lions \nClub, Shriners, school groups, and other national and local \norganizations; placement of collection or drop-off boxes by groups such \nas Goodwill, Toys for Tots, Lions eyeglass collection program and \nvarious community recycling programs; community service activities, \nsuch as immunization clinics or other medical screening activities run \nby private or government agencies, drug enforcement agencies, and the \nArmed Forces; and the use of conference rooms for meetings and use of \nparking lots for driver training, skill rodeos for public safety \norganizations and as staging areas for groups assembling for bus or \nother trips.\n  In May of 1994, the Ohio UFCW Local 954 struck Meijer's four Toledo \nstores. Through the course of events that took place during the strike, \nMeijer prohibited the union from striking on their property. The union \nactivity occurred in front of the doors to their stores and blocked the \nentry to the store.\n  After successfully obtaining restraining orders, union picketers were \nrequired to move to the public right-of-way. Prior to the strike \nsettlement, the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the \nNLRB. They claimed that Meijer discriminated against the union by \nprohibiting access to Meijer property while allowing other \norganizations permission, charitable groups that were soliciting. In \nthe union's charge, they specifically pointed to the Salvation Army and \nthe VFW as examples.\n  Before the NLRB could complete its investigation to make a final \ndecision, there was a settlement that was reached and the charges were \ndropped. As a result of this action, Meijer decided the only certain \nway to keep union picketers from their doors in the future was to bar \nall outside groups from access to their property--no more solicitation, \nno more charitable efforts, no more contributions to worthy causes. \nThis was a difficult decision because Meijer had always striven to be a \ngood corporate citizen and wholeheartedly supported the kinds of \ncharitable activities described.\n  Example two: Wawa, Inc., based in Wawa, PA, owns and operates 550 \nconvenience stores in New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and \nVirginia. For years, unions have been trying to unionize their labor \nforce and because of this, Wawa instituted a no-solicitation rule. Last \nyear, Wawa had to turn down hundreds of worthwhile charities, including \ngroups such as the American Veterans of Foreign Wars, because of this \npolicy. Because of the events that took place on September 11, those \ntragic attacks upon our Nation, Wawa decided to open its doors to the \nAmerican Red Cross to assist in the fundraising effort for the victims \nof the terror attacks in New York and in the Nation's Capital. To date, \nWawa has raised over $2 million for this effort. By allowing Wawa to \nopen its doors to several other charities, they would be able to raise \nfunds for not only the American Red Cross but also the Girl Scouts, the \nAmerican Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other worthy causes.\n  Convenience stores are on nearly every street corner and provide an \neasy and reliable dropoff point for charities. Convenience stores have \nnearly 1,000 customers a day and are able to reach out to thousands of \nindividuals a week for their contributions. Wawa, because of the \ncurrent NLRB ruling, is putting the future of the company in jeopardy. \nThis amendment will provide them protection and provide greater \nresources for American charities.\n  When retailers do allow charities to set up shop outside their doors, \nthey often have to do so with extreme caution to shield the company \nfrom unfair litigation. Such is the case for an Arkansas firm that I am \nvery proud of, and that is Wal-Mart Inc., in Bentonville, AR, which \ndoes currently allow charitable organizations on their property. They \nare putting their neck\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\non the line to do so. Because they believe in this, they are doing it. \nThey understand it benefits the community. But we are asking them to \nremain vulnerable until we have an amendment such as this that would \nprovide them protection.\n  The current NLRB solicitation rule has a profound impact on the \nneediest citizens of our country. These solicitation rules deny \ncharitable and civic organizations the opportunity to raise hundreds of \nmillions of dollars a year from retail customers.\n  The magnitude of this loss cannot be overstated. Charitable donations \nraised through Wal-Mart alone are over $127 million annually. Because \nmany retailers are forced to deny access to everyone, there are now \nfewer hot meals for the hungry, fewer toys for poor children, and less \nclothing and shelter for the homeless.\n  This amendment is not meant to target unions. Unions are the largest \ncontributors to the United Way. They are among the leaders in the \ncountry in charitable acts. The amendment simply recognizes private \nproperty rights. There is a distinction between what a union does in \nfront of a store and what local charities and civic groups are there to \ndo. They should not be treated the same.\n  This amendment permits retailers to support their communities' \ncharitable and civic activities without requiring them to open their \nproperty to union activity which could, in fact, drive away customers \nor force themselves to face unfair or even frivolous litigation.\n  In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, we need to do all we \ncan to encourage charitable giving. I have heard from thousands of \npeople since September 11 asking how they can help those directly \naffected by the terrorist attacks. By allowing retailers to open their \ndoors to charitable groups, we make it possible for the American people \nto play an even greater role in this recovery effort.\n  I received a letter from the chief counsel at Wal-Mart, and I want to \nread part of what he said:\n\n       Wal-Mart's solicitation policy provides charities with \n     access to our stores and customers. Each year over $100 \n     million is raised by local grass-roots charitable \n     organizations in front of Wal-Mart Stores and Sam's Clubs. \n     Other retailers have chosen to avoid a controversy over \n     various forms of solicitation by simply adopting a no \n     solicitation policy. It is vitally important that our country \n     have a policy that allows retailers to work with local \n     charities to better serve their communities.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wal-Mart letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Wal-Mart,\n\n\n          Thomas D. Hyde, Executive Vice President and Senior \n                                            Corporate Counsel,\n\n                                                 November 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     133 Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: We appreciate your support of \n     legislation that encourages retailers to allow charitable \n     solicitation at their stores. The Senate amendment you have \n     proposed would enable retailers to open their doors to \n     charitable organizations without being compelled to allow \n     other forms of solicitation.\n       Wal-Mart's solicitation policy provides charities with \n     access to our stores and customers. Each year over $100 \n     million is raised by local grassroots charitable \n     organizations in front of Wal-Mart Stores and Sam's Clubs. \n     Other retailers have chosen to avoid a controversy over \n     various forms of solicitation by simply adopting a no \n     solicitation policy.\n       It is vitally important that our country have a policy that \n     allows retailers to work with local charities to better serve \n     their communities. We are grateful for your leadership on \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas D. Hyde.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I also have a letter from the United States Chamber \nof Commerce, and I would like to read that into the Record.\n\n       I am writing on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \n     world's largest business federation representing over three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector \n     and region, to express the Chamber's support for the Preserve \n     Charitable Giving Act.\n       This bill will provide a much-needed change in the National \n     Labor Relations Act so that it will no longer serve as an \n     impediment to employers that wish to maintain and enforce a \n     valid no-solicitation/no-distribution policy and also wish to \n     allow charitable fund-raising or other beneficent acts on \n     their premises.\n       We appreciate your sponsorship of S. 929 and encourage you \n     to take appropriate steps to assure its prompt passage in the \n     Senate.\n\n  My concern and the reason for this amendment is that retailers \nfearful of extensive litigation will likely err on the side of caution \nand not permit these acts of kindness and generosity to occur. In the \nend, it is the public that suffers. An approach that allows charitable \nsolicitation as an exception to an otherwise valid no-solicitation/no-\ndistribution rule is in the public interest and recognizes the valid \ndistinctions between the kinds of activities engaged in by charitable \ngroups and those of labor unions.\n  I ask my colleagues to untie the hands of retailers and consumers all \nacross America that want to do all they can to help heal this country. \nAllow Americans to stretch out their arms to carry a coat, donate blood \nor reach into their pockets when they travel to their local retail or \nconvenience store so they can help those who have been so deeply \naffected during this time of great need in our Nation's history.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I certainly applaud and support all \nretailers who have joined with charities to permit access to \nsolicitation in light of the events of September 11 and those that were \ndoing it prior to September 11. What my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas, has said is that many retailers have adopted a \nblanket no-solicitation rule to avoid having to create a similar form \nfor labor unions. In effect, that is what he said.\n  There has been an assertion made that this interferes with their \nability to raise charitable donations. Yet his own materials, which \ncertainly are available to anyone, show last year charities raised over \n$100 million at the storefronts of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club alone, just \nthose stores.\n  That is great. I think that is very nice. But it seems to me the \nretailers, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, have done very well without this \namendment.\n  This amendment prohibits funds to the NLRB, the National Labor \nRelations Board, to enforce the laws and rules that require employers \nto provide access to all charitable and civic and labor organizations.\n  If the employer provides selective access, it is prohibited. For \nexample, if Wal-Mart allows Girl Scouts to sell on the property, or \nthey allow the United Way to distribute literature to Wal-Mart \nemployees, technically, they have to allow labor unions to distribute \ntheir literature. That is what this amendment attempts to prevent.\n  Wal-Mart has been doing this; Sam's Club has been doing this. The \nNLRB takes this on a case-by-case basis. They are not looking for \nsomebody to go after. There has to be some case made, and certainly \nthere hasn't been one made of which I am aware.\n  The law prohibits selective access or discrimination in places of \nemployment. That is clearly what it does. Even when discriminatory \naccess is alleged, the National Labor Relations Board examines the \nfacts of the case on a case-by-case basis. It has found in different \ncases in favor of both the employer and the union through the case-by-\ncase method outlined in the National Labor Relations Act. The current \nprocess of permitting the NLRB to examine the facts is appropriate, and \nit is has worked. This has been in existence for many years.\n  There is no need for Congress to arbitrarily discriminate against \nlabor unions. That is what this does. This amendment tips the scales in \nfavor of the employers in labor-management disputes. That is simply \nwrong. This amendment presumes all union solicitations are directed at \ndisrupting employers' businesses. That is not the case.\n  Labor unions are active participants in many charitable activities. \nWe have seen them on Labor Day at a stoplight. They have the boots in \nwhich they ask drivers to put the money. The United Way does a lot of \nwork, as well as many food drives and local community charities. Local \nfirefighters, commercial food workers, and other union\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\nmembers are active in many charities and organizations. I applaud the \nretailers who joined with charities to permit access to solicitation in \nlight of the events of September 11. That is very important.\n  Let's be clear: This amendment is not about increasing charitable \ngiving but about discriminating against American workers. That is what \nit is.\n  The present system is working very well. This amendment is not needed \nto sustain or even increase these charitable efforts. Frankly, it is \ninappropriate to use the events of September 11 as an excuse to pass \nantiworker legislation. It is discriminatory. This amendment would \nessentially allow employers to be engaged in selective discrimination.\n  Current law allows retailers to support charitable and civic \nactivities. This law prohibits discrimination. In this context, it \nprohibits discrimination against verbal communication and distribution \nof literature when companies grant access to outside groups to engage \nin communications or solicitations, including charities.\n  This basic principle of labor and employment law dates back to the \n1930s. This has been going on for almost 70 years. We don't need to \nchange it. In essence, a company cannot prohibit certain types of \nactivities that it permits others to conduct based on race, sex, age, \nor, in this case, on workers trying to exercise their legal rights to \norganize a union, to register voters, or to encourage participation in \ncivic activities.\n  The present system works. Worker organizations should be included in \nthe list of those who legally can communicate within the rules \nestablished by retailers. If a group violates these rules, the National \nLabor Relations Board examines the case and determines if there is \nsomething that should be done. This is done on a factual, case-by-case \nbasis.\n\n  I repeat: The present process has worked. This is an issue of \nfairness. This amendment promotes selective discrimination against \nworkers. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It is simply \nwrong. Most important, it is unnecessary.\n  I appreciate the fact that Wal-Mart is based in Arkansas. I met with \nthe representative of Wal-Mart the other day. They have a million \nemployees--a million employees. They certainly don't need this to \nprotect them. They are a very large corporate giant. They can protect \nthemselves. The problem in America today is that we have a lot of \ncorporate giants and we have very few people speaking out for workers. \nThis law has been in effect for more than 70 years. We don't need to \nchange it now.\n  I repeat, Wal-Mart has done very well. At Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, over \n$100 million in charities was raised within their doors last year. That \nis great. They should continue doing it the way they have and not have \na program that would allow discrimination against workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I pick up on a point the distinguished majority whip \nmade about Wal-Mart's great success in charitable giving. That is one \nthing on which we certainly agree. That is, that Wal-Mart has been \nenormously generous, giving last year over $100 million to charity.\n  The distinguished former majority leader of the Senate just visited \nthe Senate, Senator Bob Dole. Senator Dole said: Tell 'em that Wal-Mart \ngave $17.5 million to the World War II memorial. And they did. And we \nare all immensely proud of that and everything else that Wal-Mart has \ndone.\n  This is the reality: Wal-Mart has been generous. Their customers have \nbeen generous. And their employees have been generous at the risk of \nthe future of the company.\n  To say it is working fine is not the case because the vulnerability \nthat Wal-Mart faces, that Target faces, that every retailer faces, that \nevery convenience store faces--somewhere along the line, a labor union \nmay decide to put pickets out in front, and as the customers try to go \nin the door, they will get the message: This company, we don't like.\n  That company is going to then face the choice, Do we want to continue \nto allow solicitations for charities or are we going to have to adopt \nan absolute ``no solicitation'' policy that will exclude good \ncharities? Right now, we are being forced by a misunderstanding, a \nmisinterpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, to allow these \npickets in front of our door.\n  I don't think it is reasonable to expect that generous companies with \ngenerous employees and generous management should have to subject \nthemselves to that in order to do the right thing. That is what we are \nasking them to do now. That is wrong.\n\n  This has nothing to do with saying we are anti-union; it has \neverything to do with saying you don't treat a union activity in front \nof a store the same as you treat a Salvation Army bell ringer at \nChristmastime in front of that store. That is the issue. Let's unlock \nthat generous spirit of America.\n  We should not require the same kind of treatment for a labor union \nand a charitable organization soliciting in front of a retail \nestablishment. It is not the same. I think we all realize it is not the \nsame. That is all this amendment does.\n  For a year, in the wake of the September 11 attack and the incredible \nneed our Nation has, let's not make it more difficult for the American \npeople to give and give and give, as they so generously want to do.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I acknowledge the great work the Salvation Army does. Bell \nringing time is fast approaching. I hope we are not here when they are \nringing their bells.\n  Anything that happens now under the present rules and laws with the \nNLRB does not prevent a single Salvation Army person from taking their \nbucket and ringing a bell. I know of not a single case that the NLRB \nhas brought against an establishment for having Salvation Army people \ncollecting money there--none. This is a guise, in my opinion, to keep \nunions out of these places.\n  Maybe somebody wants to try to organize Wal-Mart. I don't know of \nanyone who does. Maybe they do. The Salvation Army is entitled to \nfairness. But so are workers.\n\n  We do not need to pick on Wal-Mart. We have talked about Wal-Mart. Of \ncourse this applies to businesses other than Wal-Mart. These businesses \nshould be treated no differently tomorrow than they are today.\n  I think it is totally appropriate that we look; if someone is abusing \nwhat they are doing with charitable donations, then the NLRB can take a \nlook at it. But there are no cases where that has happened. This is \nonly an effort to inflict further punishment on the organized labor \nmovement in this country. No one wanted to prevent, either prior to \nSeptember 11 or after September 11, charitable organizations from being \ncharitable or collecting money.\n  I understand the intentions of my good friend from Arkansas, but I \nbelieve this amendment would do far more harm than it would do good.\n  I am sorry I didn't make my notes more legible, even to me. But this \ndoes not affect picketing, only literature and donations. This has \nnothing to do with picketing.\n  I hope all Members will recognize this amendment as one of simple \nfairness--leave things the way they have been for 70 years. I know of \nno abuses that have taken place. The NLRB, in Republican \nadministrations and Democratic administrations, has approached this on \na case-by-case basis. What are the facts in the particular case? As far \nas I am concerned, they have been pretty fair for 70 years.\n  Madam President, how much time does the Senator from Arkansas and the \nSenator from Nevada have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 6 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Nevada has 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, the Senator raises some questions. \nHe says there is no problem. So perhaps this letter from a retailer I \nmentioned earlier, the Meijer Company, which is headquartered in a \nwonderful State, in Grand Rapids, MI, answers that. Do we have a \nproblem? I think they make it very clear in this correspondence we just \nreceived:\n       As a mid-west based retailer, we care deeply about the \n     communities we serve. As a corporate citizen, we want them to \n     grow and thrive. That is why we are pleased to contribute to \n     so many local programs.\n       However, since 1994, we have been prevented from providing \n     certain support to\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\n     charitable and civic organizations due to language contained \n     in the National Labor Relations Act. The language stipulated \n     that if we provided access to our property to outside groups, \n     then we would also be required to provide access to union \n     organizations for the purposes of organizing, solicitation, \n     distribution, picketing or other union purposes. Clearly, we \n     believe there to be a difference between charitable and civic \n     groups, and union activity.\n       Additionally, while Americans have generously responded to \n     our national crises, we are beginning to learn how local and \n     state-based charities are beginning to suffer. We believe \n     that your amendment is well suited for this present time, and \n     will permit us to work with such worthy causes.\n\n  This is very simple. The issue is simple and clear. Should union \nactivity, including picketing, be treated the same as the Salvation \nArmy bell ringer, the VFW, or the Salvation Army and other good groups \nsoliciting for good causes? Should community-based charities be \nprohibited from soliciting funds in front of a retailer if that \nretailer would like them to, simply because of a decision by the \nNational Labor Relations Board that says if they do one, they have to \nallow picketing and distribution of union material in front of that \nstore? That is the issue.\n  Clearly, they should not be treated the same. They are totally \ndifferent causes. Retailers, while having great incentive to help \ncharities, are not going to have an incentive to do something that is \ngoing to impede their own businesses. We should make that distinction, \nand this amendment would allow that for this year in this \nappropriations bill, and would allow for this year--a year clearly that \nour Nation is in crisis--to encourage that kind of charitable activity \non the part of our Nation's retailers.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the Senator from \nArkansas, and he is going to yield back his time. I will yield back my \ntime. There are a number of Members in the Chamber. We can start the \nvote. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senate will proceed to consideration of \nthe conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of Friday, October 26, 2001.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to talk \nabout the conference report we have now completed with the House of \nRepresentatives. It has been a delight and pleasure to work with \nSenator Campbell. I very much appreciate his work and the work of \nPatricia Raymond and Lula Edwards, and my staff: Chip Walgren and Matt \nKing and Nicole Rutberg. They have been exceedingly helpful in putting \ntogether a very substantial conference report on a lot of subjects.\n  Let me describe some of these issues. Some bills we consider when we \nhave the conference report in front of the Senate consist primarily of \nsalaries and expenses for a number of agencies in the Federal \nGovernment. About 40 percent of the Federal law enforcement functions \nare funded in this appropriations bill: The Customs Service; the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the Secret Service; the Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network; and other law enforcement agencies, \nincluding the IRS criminal investigation division, as well as the \nPostal Inspection Service, which a lot of people don't think much \nabout--they don't spend a lot of time thinking about it,\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\nbut especially in recent weeks they played an important role in law \nenforcement in our Federal Government.\n  These agencies work tirelessly, often below the radar, and work to \nensure our Nation's safety. We appreciate the work they do. We had to \nwork under certain fiscal constraints in this subcommittee, as we do in \nall the appropriations subcommittees. This conference report represents \na compromise on a good number of issues. Let me mention a couple of \nthings on which we worked and in which I especially was interested.\n  We added in this conference report $28.1 million for a new Senate-\ninitiated northern border initiative to hire additional Customs Service \ninspectors, special agents, and canine teams to enforce trade laws at \nour borders. In light of the tragic events of September 11, that is \nmerely a downpayment on a much larger requirement on the northern \nborder. It is quite clear this country will not achieve the kind of \nsecurity it wants and needs unless it is able to provide for secure \nborders. That doesn't mean shutting off our borders, walling up our \nborders. It simply means providing security on our borders in order to \nallow those who are guests of this country to come in, in order to \nallow freight and commerce to move back and forth across the borders \nbut at the same time have the capability to prevent those who are \nterrorists, known or suspected terrorists, from coming into this \ncountry.\n  The northern border has been like Swiss cheese in terms of \nenforcement. We have spent a great deal of time and effort moving \nresources, inspectors, and agents to the southern border. For many \nyears, we have been worried about immigration and drugs coming across \nthe southern border into this country. We have spent very little time, \nunfortunately, on the northern border. There are 128 border crossings, \n24 of which are full time, 24-hour crossings, many of which on this \n4,000-mile northern border are simply a crossing where people are able \nto come across the U.S.-Canadian border; then at 10 o'clock at night, \nwhen the border crossing closes, they put an orange security cone out \nand that becomes the security gate for the next 8 hours. But a cone \ncannot talk, walk, shoot, or tell a terrorist from a tow truck. It is \nnot secure. We must do something to provide for secure borders at all \nof the country's borders, including the northern borders.\n  To those who say there is not much activity on the northern border, \nthey are correct. But at Port Angeles, a port on the northern border, \nsome while ago a terrorist was apprehended. That terrorist was the so-\ncalled millennium bomber who would have caused substantial explosives \nand bombs to be unleashed at the turn of the millennium and would have \nundoubtedly killed many American citizens. Good border work by Customs \nagents and others at Port Angeles averted that terrorist attack. We did \nadd money for northern border initiatives to hire Customs Service \ninspectors, agents, and canine teams. That is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I have also included money in this appropriations bill, $10 million, \nfor the Customs Service to add to their ability to combat child labor \nlaws and combat the child labor practices that occur around the world. \nWhat we are very concerned about is in some parts of the world there \nare people who use young children in virtually forced labor situations \nto produce their products, and they ship those products to this country \nto be put on the shelves of our stores in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles \nand Phoenix and Fargo. But that is not fair trade. Nor is it what we \nwant to happen to children of the world. We do not want forced labor \nwith children being exploited. We don't want the products of forced \nlabor and child labor to be sent to the store shelves in our country. \nSo the investigation of forced child labor in much of the world is \nsomething to which we need to pay a great deal of attention. I added \n$10 million for the Customs Service for that purpose.\n  If I might in a graphic way describe one set of circumstances that \nwas described to us in a hearing some while ago on these issues, they \ntalked about young children, 8, 10, 12 years old making carpets in \nforced labor situations in some parts of the world. In the process of \nmaking carpets, at least according to some testimony, some firms were \ntaking these young children, using gunpowder on the tips of their \nfingers, and lighting the gunpowder to cause it to explode. That \nexplosion and the resulting burns and scarring on the tips of \nchildren's fingers meant those children, when they would stick \nthemselves with needles as they made the rugs, would have no pain \nbecause their fingertips were full of scars.\n  That is the sort of thing that is going on around the world and it is \nthe sort of thing we need to find a way to stop. One way to stop it is \nnot allow the product of that kind of forced child labor and inhumane \ntreatment to come into this country. That is why I put an additional \n$10 million in this conference report to combat this situation.\n  Another small amount of money that we have included in this \nconference report, I included it on the Senate side, is $500,000 \ndesigned to deal with an issue that caused me great concern with \nrespect to the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service \nhad an inspection by the inspector general of its taxpayer assistance \nprogram. The inspector general created questions that were to be asked \nof the Internal Revenue Service taxpayer assistance areas and sent \nFederal employees around with these questions to get help from the IRS. \nGuess what. They went all over the country to many locations to get \nhelp from the IRS. They found that 72 percent of the time the Internal \nRevenue Service gave them either the wrong answer, incomplete, or no \nanswers to the questions they had about how to fulfill their tax \nresponsibilities. Just imagine that 72 percent of the time the \nquestions asked of tax experts elicited the wrong answers.\n  I read the inspector general's report and was so incensed by it I \ncalled the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner and I said: I know you \nare relatively new on the job and trying to do things differently; I \ndeeply admire your work. But I want to tell you what I want to do. I \nwant to have the inspector general do this same thing over and over \nagain. They are going to do it once every second month. They will give \nsix reports to Congress. I want to see improvement in those six \nreports.\n  It is unforgivable that people who show up at the IRS asking for tax \nhelp get the wrong answer or no answer or an incomplete answer 72 \npercent of the time. If the Internal Revenue Service can't do it, how \non Earth can you expect the American people to comply with their tax \nresponsibilities?\n  We are going to get six reports in the next 12 months. I intend to \ncome to the Chamber every time we get a report and disclose where there \nis progress with respect to providing answers and taxpayer assistance \nto the American people.\n  It is a small issue in this bill. It is not a great deal of money, \nbut it is a big issue for me. We cannot have a tax system for which you \ndo not have taxpayer assistance. I want to put the ``service'' back in \nthe words ``Internal Revenue Service.'' I want the American people to \nknow where they can get answers, and get the right answers.\n  Let me mention a couple of additional issues. We direct the General \nServices Administration, GSA, to initiate a pilot project to site what \nare called automatic external defib-\nrillators, AEDs. If anyone has seen them, they look a little like a \nbriefcase, not much bigger than a briefcase. We would put them in \nFederal buildings on a pilot project and provide training in their use \nto more effectively save lives.\n  The defibrillators are to be used when someone suffers a cardiac \narrest. Virtually anyone can use these defibrillators. I was at a \ndemonstration where they showed how to use a defibrillator. \nDefibrillators are briefcase-sized, relatively inexpensive, and they \nsave lives. They do it every day all across this country, and we ought \nto have them in every Federal building. We asked the GSA to do a pilot \nproject that will save lives as we begin to put these in all Federal \nbuildings.\n  I mentioned several items that are in the conference report that we \nwill ultimately consider. We fund the President's request of $180 \nmillion in continued funding for the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy's Youth Antidrug\n\n[[Page S11331]]\n\nMedia Campaign, which has been ongoing now for some years. We add $20 \nmillion to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, for a \ntotal of $226 million. We add $10 million to the Drug Free Communities \nAct, for a total of $50.6 million.\n  I am not going to go down the list with all these issues. I will have \nsome printed in the Record.\n  This is a good report. Senator Campbell and I and our colleagues on \nthe House side worked hard to reach a compromise that makes sense.\n  I want to make a special point of an item that is not in this \nconference report that really should be. It deals with an issue I have \nbeen concerned with for a while. I will explain why it is not in the \nconference report. It is the issue of travel in Cuba.\n  That sounds like a strange subject for an appropriations bill. We \nhave had, as you know, a 40-year embargo with respect to the country of \nCuba, an embargo on trade and travel. It has been my belief for some \nlong while that it is not a moral policy for our country to use food \nand medicine as a weapon and we ought not include that in any embargo.\n  At the very least, we ought to say the embargo against Cuba, which in \nmy judgment has been a failure now for four decades--Fidel Castro has \noutlived all of those Presidents--clearly is a failure. But at the very \nleast, we ought not continue to use food as a weapon. We ought to be \nable to send food and medicine to Cuba or sell food and medicine to \nCuba. The Canadians and Europeans can. Everyone else can. We cannot. I \nhave been pushing to change that.\n  We have been successful twice in the Senate by a vote of 70 votes in \nfavor of changing it. In three separate cases we have been tripped by \nthe House of Representatives, whose leaders in the first instance \nactually just adjourned the conference and never came back together \nbecause they would have lost the vote if they had taken the vote, and \nthat is the way they hijacked this policy. In the second and the third \nyear that we had some progress on this issue, they changed the language \nso in fact they said you could sell food to Cuba but in fact you could \nnot. You could not even get private financing in this country to sell \nfood to Cuba. That is how absurd it was, despite the fact that \nthey boasted of the progress.\n\n  In addition to that, last year they decided not only will we say you \ncan sell food to Cuba but you cannot do it even with private financing, \nwhich is a byzantine bit of logic in my judgment, but we will also \ncodify the regulations which restrict travel in Cuba. They were \npreviously by regulation made effective. Now we will codify them, which \nactually tightens them. In fact, it was moving backward rather than \nforward with respect to our policy.\n  That is a long way of describing something that happened that some \nmonths ago I thought was totally absurd. I read in the paper that the \nU.S. Treasury Department began levying fines against the American \npeople for traveling in Cuba. I admit that current law prohibits travel \nin Cuba.\n  Let me describe to you a fine, because I talked to this woman. She is \na woman from Illinois. I will just describe one.\n  A retired woman from the State of Illinois responded to an \nadvertisement in a cycling magazine that a Canadian cycling group was \ntaking a bicycle tour of Cuba. She thought, well, that sounded like \nfun. She sent a coupon, signed up, went to Cuba, and bicycled for 8 \ndays in Cuba with a bicycle tour group out of Canada.\n  Eighteen months later, this retired American citizen from Illinois \nreceived a fine from the United States Treasury Department of $9,600 \nfor traveling in Cuba.\n  Where did that come from? The Office of Foreign Asset Control--OFAC, \nat the Treasury Department. OFAC is supposed to be chasing terrorists. \nIn early August of this year, well before September 11--in early August \nof this year, I wrote to the Treasury Department to say, in effect: How \ndare you spend your time and resources chasing a little old retired \nlady from Illinois.\n  I can describe others as well. The fines ranged from $9,500 to \n$55,000 for those who traveled in Cuba. How dare you spend your time \ndoing that when we expect you to be using these resources to track \nterrorists and track the money laundering and money movement to \napprehend terrorists.\n  Of course, a month later we discovered what terrorists mean to this \ncountry and the tragic consequences of terrorist acts that are \ncommitted in this country.\n  This conference report I had hoped would deal with something that the \nHouse of Representatives put in their bill. They said no money shall be \nexpended by the Treasury Department for enforcing the travel ban with \nrespect to the country of Cuba. I went to conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, intending to recede to the House provision. But before \nI could do that, the House conferees decided to abandon their own \nposition. So I could not recede to the position they no longer held.\n  It only describes once again that no matter what the circumstances \nare on the issue of policy with respect to Cuba, the absurd proposition \nthat this country ought to use food and drugs as a weapon, yes, even \nwith Cuba in the pursuit of this foolish embargo that has been a 40-\nyear failure--the absurd proposition that we ought to have the Treasury \nDepartment chasing retired schoolteachers from Illinois who join a \nbicycle tour of Cuba and slap a $9,600 fine on them 18 months after \nthey join a Canadian bicycle tour and bike ride 8 days in Cuba--the \nabsurdity of that just leaves me almost speechless. Yet in the \nDepartment of the Treasury, in an office called OFAC, Office of Foreign \nAsset Control, they are spending money tracking people who might have \ntraveled to Cuba.\n  I called and talked to the lady from Illinois. She had no idea she \nwas violating the law. What she was doing was riding a bicycle.\n  She was retired and wanted to take a bicycle trip. And she did, with \na Canadian cycling company, and then was slapped with a fine of $9,600.\n  I didn't mean to go on at great length about it, except to say this \nsubcommittee bill from both the House and Senate should have contained \nlanguage straightening out both of these issues. One is the absurd \nproposition that we continue to use food and drugs as a weapon, which \nin my judgment is not a moral policy. It doesn't matter what country it \nis directed at; food ought not be used as a weapon.\n  Second, we ought not fine American citizens because of restrictions \non travel, as has been enforced here with respect to Cuba. They can \ntravel in China. They can travel in North Korea. They can travel in \nevery part of the world, except somehow, if they join a bicycle tour of \nCuba, something awful is going to happen to them. That is not the best \nof what America has to offer in terms of foreign policy or public \npolicy.\n  As I indicated when I started, this conference report will, I \nbelieve, be called up in a bit. I expect my colleague, Senator \nCampbell, to come to the floor. He has a few things to say. I think \nfollowing that, whenever it is ready, it is going to require a recorded \nvote because it did not have a recorded vote when it left the Senate. \nAs is the case with most of these appropriations bills, it has a \nrecorded vote when it leaves this body, and we have a recorded vote on \nthe conference report. In this case, this conference report is going to \nrequire a recorded vote this afternoon.\n  I encourage my colleagues to be supportive of it. I think it is a \ngood compromise. It makes good, and it is an important investment, \nespecially in the area of law enforcement. Forty percent of law \nenforcement in the Federal Government is funded in this particular \nappropriations conference.\n  I want to make one other point.\n  I want to say to all of those who are involved in Federal law \nenforcement--not just Federal law enforcement, but these comments apply \nto everyone in this country who spends time enforcing our Nation's \nlaws, especially now with respect to terrorist acts--that this country \nis enormously proud of the dedication and commitment of law enforcement \nmen and women all across this country.\n  I walk in the front door of this Capitol in the morning, and I see \nlaw enforcement people standing there. I stop to talk to them. I \nunderstand they have been working in most cases 12 hours a day 6 days a \nweek. And they have been doing that now for 2 months. There is no end \nin sight. It is not just\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\nthese folks who work with us--the wonderful men and women in the \nCapitol Police Force.\n  My colleague from Illinois is on the floor. I think he has the \nsuggestion and idea about a more formal thank you, saying to them that \nwe are really proud of what they do: What you do is critically \nimportant. And we ought to do that every day in every way.\n  Again, it is not just them; it is the law enforcement components of \nthe Secret Service, the Customs Service, postal inspectors, and so many \nother areas of the Federal Government who are also working 12 hours a \nday 6 days a week at this point.\n  I think it is important as we consider this conference report on \nbehalf of the Congress to say to them: Your commitment and your service \nto our country is not unnoticed. We deeply appreciate what you do for \nAmerica during very difficult times.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Treasury-\ngeneral government conference report that Chairman Dorgan has brought \nto this body for final passage. I thank him, once again, for the \nsuccessful completion of the fiscal year 2002 appropriations process. \nLet me briefly mention some of the important parts of this bill.\n  We are probably a month or more late in getting to the floor this \nconference report. But we have worked very hard on it. This bill \nprovides much-needed resources for the law enforcement agencies under \nthe jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury.\n  We have been able to provide $300 million for the Customs' ACE \ncomputer project. While this is more than twice the amount requested, \nit is still not enough to keep this program on the original schedule.\n  The House agreed to provide an additional $20 million for the HIDTA \nProgram--High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program--which has been \nso successful. However, we were unable to maintain any specific \nearmarks which were in the Senate bill. As a result, all the HIDTA \nprograms must provide the necessary justifications for additional \nfunding before growing or opening new ones.\n  The conferees provided $180 million for the antidrug media campaign, \nas Senator Dorgan mentioned, which includes $5 million to target the \nnew drug of choice with some of our young people, unfortunately, called \necstasy. We were also able to fully fund grants for the Gang Resistance \nEducation and Training Program, commonly called the GREAT Program.\n  While we were not able to grant all of our Members' requests, I think \nwe came very close to it. There is a 4.6-percent general salary \nadjustment for Federal employees starting in January of 2002, and we \nprovided the agencies under our jurisdiction with the funding necessary \nfor this additional 1-percent salary adjustment.\n  Funds have been provided for courthouse construction, site \nacquisition, and design projects, as well as needed repairs and \nalterations. Plus we were able to provide funds for a much-needed \nNational Archives southeastern regional facility, which will be of \nvalue to constituents of several of our colleagues.\n  This is a good bill, and I urge colleagues to vote for it on final \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2590, \nthe Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n2002.\n  The conference report provides $17.069 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $12.601 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $16.256 \nbillion in 2002. The conference report is within the subcommittee's \nsection 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. It does not \ninclude any emergency designations.\n  We are already 1 month into the new fiscal year and the Senate is \njust now considering its third appropriations conference report. Ten \nmore remain. It is important, therefore, that the Senate pass this \nreport, which provides important resources to the Department of the \nTreasury, including its law enforcement bureaus, as well as to the \nPostal Service, General Services Administration, Office of Personnel \nManagement and other agencies, as quickly as possible. I commend \nSenators Dorgan and Campbell for their bipartisan work on this bill and \nurge the Congress to expeditiously complete the remaining 10 bills to \nprevent any disruptions for Federal agencies or for the American public \nthat depends on their programs and services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2590, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT\n    APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS-CONFERENCE REPORT\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...............       17,069       15,478       32,547\n  Outlays........................       16,256       15,475       31,731\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............       17,069       15,478       32,547\n  Outlays........................       16,256       15,475       31,731\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............       16,614       15,478       32,092\n  Outlays........................       15,974       15,475       31,449\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       17,022       15,478       32,500\n  Outlays........................       16,261       15,475       31,736\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       17,118       15,478       32,596\n  Outlays........................       16,182       15,475       31,657\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          455            0          455\n  Outlays........................          282            0          282\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............           47            0           47\n  Outlays........................           -5            0           -5\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............          -49            0          -49\n  Outlays........................           74            0           74\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I thank the conferees of this bill for \ntheir hard work in completing the conference report for this \nlegislation. The report provides Federal funding for numerous vital \nprograms in the Treasury Department and the General Government. \nHowever, once again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of \nspeaking before my colleagues about parochial projects in another \nconference report.\n  This conference report spends at a level 6.3 percent higher than the \nlevel enacted in fiscal year 2001. In real dollars, this is $458 \nmillion in additional spending above the amount requested by the \nPresident, and a $1.9 billion increase in spending from last year. I \nmust remind my colleagues that the Administration has urged us to \nmaintain our fiscal discipline to ensure that we will continue to have \nadequate funds to prosecute our war against terrorism, to aid those in \nneed, and to cover other related costs.\n  In this bill, I have identified $217 million in earmarks, which is \nless than the cost of the earmarks in the bill passed last year, which \ntotaled $356 million. Therefore, I applaud the efforts of the conferees \nin keeping parochial spending to a minimum in this bill but more must \nbe done.\n  While the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not \nseem extravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the expense of numerous programs that \nhave undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. It is my \nview that the people who run these programs should be the ones who \ndecide how best to spend the appropriated funds. After all, they know \nwhat their most pressing needs are.\n  For example, under funding for the Department of Treasury, some \nexamples of earmarks include: $2,000,000 as a grant to Florida \nInternational University for transfer pricing research; $3,500,000 for \nretrofitting and upgrades of the National Center Tracing Center \nFacility in Martinsburg, West Virginia; and $750,000 for the Center for \nAgriculture Policy and Trade Studies located at North Dakota State \nUniversity.\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\n  Under funding for the General Government, some of the earmarks \ninclude: $1,000,000 for the Native American Digital Telehealth Project \nand the Upper Great Plains Native American Telehealth Program at the \nUniversity of North Dakota; $3,000,000 to help purchase land and \nfacilitate the moving of the Odd Fellows Hall to provide for \nconstruction of a new courthouse in Salt Lake City, Utah; and \n$1,700,000 for a grant to the Oklahoma Centennial Commission.\n  There are more projects on the list that I have compiled, which will \nbe available on my Senate Website.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. President, I seek recognition to ask the majority leader to \ncommit to working with me on an issue that is very important to many \nStates, and it is important to the high-growth States that also have \nvery tough problems in meeting their welfare needs, States such as \nTexas, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, and Georgia.\n  Many States in the welfare bill were trying to gear up to change \ntheir welfare programs. As you know, the welfare reform bill was a 5-\nyear bill, but the temporary assistance for the supplemental grants for \nhigh-growth States was only authorized for 4 years.\n  The Finance Committee yesterday marked up and passed out the 1-year \nextension that would match the welfare bill to help these States.\n  The budget resolution that we passed accommodated the cost of this \nadded 1-year authorization. I am bringing it up because I wanted to \noffer it as an amendment on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, but it \nwas considered legislation. The Finance Committee has acted, and in one \nof those process things, I just wanted to make sure that we did not get \nlost in the shuffle because my State is certainly counting on it, and \nFlorida is counting on it.\n  It will make a huge budget deficit for many of these States if we do \nnot authorize and appropriate this last year of the supplemental \nrequest for the welfare reform bill.\n\n  My purpose in bringing this up is to say I will not offer my \namendment on the Labor-HHS bill, but I did want to get the commitment \nfrom the majority leader that we will work to fix this technical error \nbefore we go out of session so that the States that have already \nbudgeted, thinking this money was coming, will have the benefit of this \nexpenditure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern and the \ncooperation of the Senator from Texas. She has been a very strong \nadvocate for her State in this regard. I completely appreciate the \nsituation in which she finds herself in this effort.\n  TANF supplemental payments need to be extended for 1 more year. There \nshouldn't be any question about that.\n  The Graham bill to extend these payments, as she noted, was marked up \nin the Finance Committee today. I understand there is a bipartisan \ncommitment to move that bill through the Senate and have it enacted \ninto law. I assure her I will do everything I can to accommodate that \nbill and to see that we are successful in getting it done before the \nend of this session of Congress.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the majority \nleader coming to the floor to give this assurance because as we are \ndividing the money in the last appropriations bills--I know the \nmajority leader has some priorities--I want to make sure this is also a \npriority. It affects so many States that have been impacted by the \nlarge number of needy families because they are higher growth than the \noriginal welfare formula was able to accommodate.\n  I do thank the majority leader. I look forward to working with him in \nevery way I can. I am glad he mentioned the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nGraham, who sponsored the bill in the Finance Committee. It is very \nimportant to our two States that we accomplish this before the end of \nthe year. I certainly know, with the majority leader's support, we will \nbe able to do that.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas again for \nher cooperation and look forward to working with her in the weeks \nahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to be here with my partner, \nSenator Hutchison and the Senate majority leader to join in this \nimportant discussion. Just a few hours ago, the Finance Committee \nreported out the TANF Supplemental Grants Act of 2001. This bill is \ncritical to the ability of 17 States to help their most vulnerable \ncitizens move from welfare to work.\n  If this bill is not passed into law, several states will be forced to \nscale back their welfare reform efforts, which have shifted in recent \nyears to include support services for low-income working families and \nefforts to address the multiple barriers to employment that face a \nsubstantial share of the families that remain on welfare. In these \ndifficult economic times, States will require all available resources \nto provide cash assistance and work support services to low income \nfamilies who have been displaced from their jobs. Our bill will give \nthese States the tools necessary to do just that.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison for her leadership on this issue, Senators \nBaucus and Grassley for making a commitment to the passage of this bill \nby reporting it out of committee today, and Senator Daschle for his \ndedication to ensuring the bill's passage into law this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11333-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11333-S11337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the conference \nreport will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2311) making appropriations for energy and water development \n     for fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 30, 2001.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report to accompany H.R. 2311.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am entitled 10 minutes under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, as is the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, the \ntwo managers of this appropriations conference report. I am not going \nto take that time.\n  When the bill came before the Senate, it passed overwhelmingly. I \nbelieve it was 92-2. Two people voted against it. By the time we got to \nconference, there were two or three open items. We settled those in one \nevening.\n  It is a good bill. As with all pieces of legislation, it is probably \nimperfect, but it is the best we can do.\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\n  I see my friend from Montana in the Chamber. There is a provision in \nthe bill about which he and I have spoken dealing with drilling for oil \nin New York near the Finger Lakes. The Senator is absolutely right that \nthe matter in our bill is under the jurisdiction of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee and not within the jurisdiction of matters \nof the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. That was done in \nthis Chamber.\n  Certainly, we did not try to hide anything. It was in the bill before \nit went to conference.\n  It is for 1 year. Originally the amendment given to us would have \ndone it permanently. It is basically for 1 year during the \nappropriations cycle.\n  So I say to my friend from Montana publicly, as I said privately, I \nam sorry he was not aware of this. It certainly was nothing that was \ndone by either Senator Domenici or me. We would be happy to work with \nhim next year if there is a problem in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in responding to the Democratic whip's \nremarks, I brought this to his attention this afternoon as it was \nbrought to my attention. Section 316 of the Senate bill that was \nincluded in the conference agreement with a slight modification says as \nto prohibition of oil and gas drilling in the Finger Lakes National \nForest of New York: no Federal permit or lease shall be issued for oil \nor gas drilling in Finger Lakes National Forest of New York during \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Basically, that is legislating on an appropriations bill. It was put \ninto a managers' package and, of course, with the jurisdiction being \nover in Interior appropriations, if any action was taken at all. Now, \nthis rider blocks, without further consideration, oil and gas permits \nwithin that national forest. It looks like not only a jurisdictional \nissue, and I respect the desire of the Senators from New York to work \non issues in their State, but in this time of an economic downturn and \ntrying to make some sense of an energy policy in this country, it seems \nludicrous to me that a nongermane amendment would be allowed on this \nlegislation, especially in a time when we are trying to find energy for \nthis country and wean us off this foreign dependence on oil.\n  It is especially questionable to allow a rider at this time when New \nYork is searching for economic opportunities, asking the Congress to \nprovide thousands and millions and billions of dollars in their time of \nneed, and yet take away from the State an economic base, a base from \nwhich to grow. It makes no sense to me at all, especially when there is \nthe potential for jobs and economic growth and then that is taken away \nsort of in a dark-of-the-night rider.\n  I do not presume to change Medicare policy in an Interior bill. I do \nnot attempt to change the nuclear storage policy on an Interior bill \nbecause the jurisdiction lies elsewhere. From my position on the \nInterior Subcommittee, I would like to consult with the leadership of \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee, the Bureau of Reclamation or the \nDepartment of Energy on issues where we have overlapping jurisdiction. \nAnd we do. We exchange that information freely.\n  Now I realize it is too late to change this in this conference \nreport, and I want to pass this conference report with basically the \nchairman of that subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee.\n  The chairman and the ranking member have done a great job of putting \ntogether this bill. I support it wholeheartedly. I thank them for all \nthey put into this, especially those relating to the State of Montana.\n  The inclusion of section 316 is an exception rather than the rule. I \nexpect in the future we will have closer consultation on the matters \nthat cross subcommittee jurisdiction. I also believe the fate of 316 \nmay change as soon as we have better information as to its actual \nimpact on oil and gas operations.\n  I would think the Senators contemplating their economic base in their \nState would know this is ill-advised at this time.\n\n  Again, I applaud the managers of this legislation and wholeheartedly \nsupport it, with the exception of this.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of my friend \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, I say to him we worked very hard \nWednesday night to complete this conference report. I want to \ncompliment the Senator because I have just briefly been chairman of \nthis subcommittee but, as I said at that conference, the way we have \nworked together, it really does not matter who is chairman and who is \nthe ranking member. We understand the jurisdiction in the subcommittee \nand have worked closely together for many years.\n  I would like to send a message to this administration, and I say \n``this administration'' because it does not matter who we have in the \nWhite House. It seems whether it is a Democrat or Republican, we get \ntreated the same. I am speaking about the Corps of Engineers. The Corps \nis always underfunded, recognizing that we in Congress will bail them \nout.\n  It reminds me of when I was chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. They did the same with the Guard and Reserve units at \nhome. The administration simply would not fund those appropriately. As \na result, Congress had to come every year and bail out the \nadministration. That is what we have done in this bill. We have bailed \nout the administration, just as we did the 8 years that Clinton was \nPresident and the 4 years before that when Bush was President. I do not \nknow why they do not recognize the importance of the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the \nCorps has been a salvation to the State of Nevada, not only in rural \nNevada but in urban Nevada. Las Vegas could not have the growth it has \nbut for the Corps of Engineers, which has been magnificent in projects \nto stop flooding and flood control projects.\n  So I say to my friend, I hope somehow we can get the message to this \nadministration that they should look at what the Corps does, and maybe \nthis administration will do the right thing and set an example for \nother administrations to follow because, as I say for the second time, \nI am not going after President George Bush and his administration. I am \ngoing after all administrations for how they neglect and ignore the \nCorps of Engineers and, frankly, the Bureau of Reclamation which does \nsuch good things for our country.\n  Will the Senator from New Mexico agree with my statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I say to my friend, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Nevada, I believe we have a very good \nbill. When one has water projects that everybody in the country \nbelieves they need, they are Members of the Senate and House and they \nindicate that there is a flood protection project, it meets the \nstandard that the Corps has set up, and that means they are going to \npay their portion of it required by law, and it fits every standard. It \nis pretty difficult for us to say we are not going to do it this year \nbecause, once again, the administration has underfunded water \nprojects--that is, the Corps of Engineers--and so the request is going \nto have to be taken somewhere else. There is no somewhere else. If \nthere is a major flood protection project, it meets the standards in \nterms of cost-benefit. Clearly, we have to ask the U.S. Government, as \npart of its Corps of Engineers, to work to fund it. There is a split in \nthe cost. The local unit has to pay its share.\n\n  The Senator asked a good question. I can answer it because I was \nchairman of this subcommittee for almost 6\\1/2\\ years, and the Senator \nfrom Nevada was ranking member. We saw a number of budgets. We only saw \none budget from President Bush. The remaining were from Bill Clinton. \nNever in any year in my 6\\1/2\\ years or the Senator who is wrapping up \nhis first year--never have we had a realistic assessment of the Corps \nof Engineers' work to be done, needed in these United\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\nStates for various water projects. It started back perhaps as far as \nPresident Ronald Reagan, perhaps as far back as Richard Nixon.\n  Think how difficult water projects were. The OMB, which is the \ntechnical group that puts together a budget, always finds it easy to \nrecommend to a President a reduction, a cut, or not enough money for \nthe Corps of Engineers to do its work. The Office of Management and \nBudget is not interested in water projects or flood protection as a \nmajor endeavor of the United States. They think it is secondary. They \ngo through their work and are delighted they are meeting a budget that \nreduces expenditures. An easy item for them to cut includes water \nprojects and the Corps of Engineers. That will save a lot of money.\n  They find in Congress a Senator, a Representative, or a Governor who \nhas requests of the subcommittee and looks seriously at a project not \ntaken care of in that process I just described. That happens every \nyear. Every year we find very good projects, needed by the local \ncommunity, which fit the Corps of Engineers' requirements already \nevaluated in terms of the cost-benefit ratio. If it does not have a \ngood cost-benefit ratio, we are not supposed to pay for it. Even if it \ndoes, somebody decides anyway they will not do it. That usually is the \nOffice of Management and Budget representing the President.\n  We now have a good bill. We had to go over the President and the \nCorps of Engineers, but most Members of Congress think this is a good \ndeal. The Corps, in my opinion, continues to be maligned regardless of \nhow well it does its work. Somebody on some issue puts forth facts and \nsomebody decides it is time to attack the Corps of Engineers.\n  I have been here long enough to see a cycle. In part of my Senate \nlife, the Corps of Engineers was valued; it was very important. The \nrecommendations they made were good and everybody knew they were \ntechnically sound. Then we had a cycle when the White House was joined \nby Senators and Representatives and the Corps of Engineers was to be \nmaligned: It was not a very good institution of our Government. There \nare still people who do not want the projects to be built, who think \nthe Corps of Engineers is not good. Very few will say their projects \nare not well done, well defined and well engineered.\n  The White House, one after another, continued to propose reductions. \nWe get blamed for spending too much because they did not spend enough. \nWhen we do the responsible thing and add funding, we are spending too \nmuch on water projects or funding your favorite or my favorite or some \nSenator's favorite water project.\n  The balance in this bill is pretty good. In the future, water \nprojects will go up, not down. That is how I see it. I hope we can \ncomplete our bill and have a vote tonight. It is a good bill.\n  I am pleased to join Chairman Reid to present the conference report \nfor the fiscal year 2002 energy and water appropriations before the \nSenate today. This has been a tough process and I want to thank all of \nthe members involved for their patience in working through the issues.\n  Chairman Reid has done a good job under very difficult circumstances \nto put together a fair agreement that accommodates, to the extent \npossible, all of the competing desires. The situation was particularly \ndifficult for the Senate, as the conference allocation for defense \nfunding was $550 million below the Senate passed bill.\n  Despite the difficulties involved, we were still able to put together \na conference agreement that funds nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship \nat $5.7 billion. Although that is a $350 million reduction from the \nSenate passed level, it still represents a $700 million (14 percent) \nincrease over last year's conference level, and is $400 million over \nthe budget request. This significant increase will allow us to get many \nprograms back on track, including the pit production effort. It also \nallows us to begin a major infrastructure rebuilding program this year \nwith a $200 million appropriation.\n  The bill is not perfect. In fact, I remain concerned that the Senate \nwas not able to hold all of the increased funding we provided for \nnonproliferation work at the NNSA. In particular, we had provided a \nsignificant increase of $55 million to nonproliferation research and \ndevelopment. Before September 11, I was a strong believer in the \nimportant work our laboratories do in research, development and \ndeployment of technologies we need to detect and respond to the growing \nthreat of chemical, biological and nuclear terrorism. As such, we added \na significant sum of money in the Senate bill.\n  The importance of this work is obvious to everyone today, as we have \nseen the NNSA labs play key roles in our government's response and \nclean-up of the anthrax attacks. Furthermore, the labs are now playing \nmuch greater roles in providing technical advice and technologies to \nmany other government agencies--from advising the postal service on how \nto protect the mail, to developing the most advanced chem/bio detectors \nfor deployment in Washington and other areas. The nonproliferation R \naccount funds these and many other activities. As the Congress moves \nforward this year, we must find other resources in the $20 billion \nsupplemental to fund these needs. In fact, I have suggested to the \nPresident and others, that we should spend an additional $255 million \nspecifically for counter-terrorism R and nuclear nonproliferation \nactivities beyond what the President requested in the supplemental.\n  I look forward to working with all Senators to further address this \nissue before we adjourn this year.\n  As for the water portion of the bill, my colleagues may recall that \nthe administration proposed a $600 million reduction to the Corps of \nEngineers, or a 13 percent reduction from last year's level. Given the \nstate of the country's aging infrastructure, we all felt that this was \nan irresponsible budget to propose. Therefore, the conference worked to \nrestore the majority of the cuts, by restoring $500 million of the \nreduction. It will come as no surprise to my colleagues that the \nrequests for additional projects and funding far outweighed the \nresources of this bill. However, the conference has tried to balance \ncritical needs across the country.\n  Before I end my statement, I would be remiss if I did not mention and \ncommend the outstanding staff involved in this process for the Senate. \nSenator Reid's staff of Drew Willison and Roger Cockerell, for they \nhave been professional and very open with me and my staff throughout \nthis whole process. In addition, I would like to thank my own staff, \nClay Sell, Tammy Perrin, Jim Crum, and Lashawnda Smith. They have all \nserved us well and we appreciate their fine work.\n  Mr. President, I will now briefly state my best analysis of this \nbill. I will talk about two items. First, everybody should know that in \nthe next 30 or 40 minutes we will vote on the bill. The title of the \nbill ``energy and water,'' seems as though it doesn't have anything \nserious in terms of America's future: We are just spending the money \nneeded to pay for things. This doesn't have oil production, utility \nlines. It has nothing to do with enhancing America's production of \nenergy by changing tax laws.\n  It is energy and water tied together. In that piece called ``energy'' \nis all of the money needed and to be appropriated by the Congress for \nthe nuclear weapons safety and maintenance. All the weapons we own are \nunder the control and jurisdiction, by happenstance, of the Department \nof Energy. Money is transferred from the Department of Defense to this \nsubcommittee to pay for all of the activities with reference to nuclear \nweaponry.\n  Part of that is a new concept and a new carve-out with a new boss. \nGeneral Gordon, who used to be with the CIA and was a general in the \nmilitary before that, has accepted a job to head up the agency that has \nbeen carved out. He has jurisdiction over two things. They are \ngigantic. One is the science-based stockpile stewardship. Interesting \nwords. The other is nonproliferation. They are very important programs.\n  The part that has to do with the science-based stockpile stewardship \ncame into being when Congress, the year before last, was filled to the \ngills over the dysfunctional nature of the management of this part of \nthe U.S. Government's business by the Department of Energy. People were \nallegedly stealing important secrets, and the contentions were flying \nas to whether the Department of Energy or the laboratories could keep \nsecrets and keep important items from getting into the hands of our \nenemies.\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\n  It was decided, and I was one who helped write the bill, and was \njoined by a number of other chairmen at that point, and we passed a \nbill; the National Nuclear Security Administration was created. General \nGordon heads it. Ultimately, when it has everything in shape, the \nnuclear activity that has to do with the science-based stockpile \nstewardship and all of the activities regarding nuclear weaponry will \nbe in charge of that carve-out within the Department.\n  While putting that together, some Senators did not think it was a \ngood idea, including my friend, the chairman, who was then the ranking \nmember. He has iterated his position recently, saying he wasn't for it \nthen but he thinks it is a good idea and he supports it wholeheartedly \nnow and, in particular, the general who heads it.\n  The reason it is in existence is that America has made a commitment \nin a very dangerous world. We made a commitment on our own that we \nwould do no more nuclear testing. It was voluntary by the United \nStates. We are still living with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use the time \nallocated to me under the energy and water appropriations conference \nreport at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise at this time to support the \nconference committee on the energy and water appropriations bill. I \nwant to indicate how extremely pleased I am that this bill includes an \nabsolutely critical provision to protect the Great Lakes from oil and \ngas drilling. This provision, which I offered, along with Senator \nFitzgerald and numerous others, including the occupant of the chair, as \nan amendment to the Senate bill, protecting the waters of the Great \nLakes by asking, first, for a complete study of the impact of oil and \ngas drilling in the Great Lakes to be done by the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and it places an immediate 2-year ban on new oil and gas \ndrilling during the process of this study. It is my hope that this is \nthe first step to a permanent ban on any oil and gas drilling in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  I first thank the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water Development of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nReid, for his support of this important Great Lakes amendment. I thank \nhim very much. I thank the ranking member of Energy and Water, Senator \nDomenici, who was equally as supportive. I very much appreciate both \nhaving that amendment adopted in the Senate and their willingness to \nmake sure that it remained in the conference report.\n  I also thank House Chairman Callahan and Ranking Member Visclosky for \ntheir willingness to support this provision and include it in the \nconference report, as well as all of the House and Senate conferees.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that preventing drilling in the Great \nLakes is an issue about which we all care on both sides of the aisle. \nAs I indicated earlier, Senator Peter Fitzgerald was the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of my amendment. I am extremely pleased and \ngrateful to him for stepping forward. He and Senator Durbin of Illinois \nhave both stepped forward in strong leadership to protect the Great \nLakes.\n  I also thank these distinguished Senators who joined me in this \neffort, in lending their name and their leadership: My senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Carl Levin; as I mentioned, Senator Durbin; \nSenator Voinovich; Senator Dayton, who is in the chair; Senator \nFeingold, Senator Schumer, Senator Kohl, Senator Wellstone, Senator \nClinton, Senator Bayh, and Senator DeWine. This was a Great Lakes \neffort of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  Finally, I thank my colleagues in the House, Congressmen Dave Bonior \nand Bart Stupak, and the Michigan House delegation that worked together \non a bipartisan basis to support this effort--particularly Bart Stupak \nwho has been a real pioneer in the effort of protecting the Great \nLakes. When it was time in the conference committee to call on critical \nsupport to explain what we were doing, I am very grateful to \nCongressman Dave Camp for his willingness to be intimately involved in \nthis effort, as well as Congressmen Fred Upton, Pete Hoekstra, and Vern \nEhlers for their wonderful support.\n  In case my colleagues are not aware, this is a particular issue of \nconcern to Michigan, where it was decided they would be interested in \nproviding up to 30 new permits for oil and gas leasing in the Great \nLakes and Lake Huron. At this point in time, this will allow us to \nstaff and reevaluate what was being proposed and what, I might add, has \nbeen overwhelmingly opposed in Michigan, as well as in all of the Great \nLakes States. There has been overwhelming opposition to doing anything \nthat would jeopardize our Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes are one of our Nation's most precious public natural \nresources. And 33 million people rely on the Great Lakes for their \ndrinking water. In fact, 10 million of them rely on Lake Michigan \nalone. Millions of people use the Great Lakes each year to enjoy the \nbeaches, the great fishing, and boating. The latest estimate shows that \nrecreational fishing totals a $1.5 billion boost to Michigan's tourist \neconomy alone.\n  The Great Lakes coastlines are also home to wetlands, dunes, \nendangered species, and plants, including the rare piping plover, \nMichigan monkey flower, Pitcher's thistle, and the dwarf lake iris. \nLake Michigan alone contains over 417 coastal wetlands, the most of any \nGreat Lake.\n  Great Lakes drilling would place the tourism economy, the Great Lakes \necosystem, and a vital source of drinking water at great risk for a \nvery small amount of oil.\n  Last year, Michigan produced about 2 minutes' worth of oil--2 \nminutes' worth of oil--from Great Lakes drilling, which has been \nallowed since 1979. That is 2 minutes of usage in a year. From our \nstandpoint, this amount of oil is certainly not worth any potential \nrisk.\n\n  I can't stress how important tourism is to the Michigan economy and \nhow important it is that we are coming together in this way to address \nour important natural resource.\n  The Great Lakes are interconnected, and they border eight States: \nMinnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, \nand, of course, Michigan.\n  This means that an oil spill in Lake Michigan could wash up on the \nshores of not only Michigan, but Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. That \nis why we joined together to put forward this Federal policy to protect \nthe Great Lakes.\n  The provision in the energy and water appropriations conference \nreport is reasonable, prudent. It is an approach to an issue that makes \nsense. It asks the Army Corps of Engineers to study the safety and the \nenvironmental impact of drilling in the Great Lakes, and it places a 2-\nyear ban on any new drilling.\n  Again, I thank Senator Harry Reid for his outstanding leadership in \nso many ways, as he manages the floor, and certainly in this area of \nenergy and water, where my great State of Michigan is in his debt for \nhis leadership. He and Senator Domenici together have put forward an \nexcellent bill and one that is going to make sure we have put forward a \npolicy to protect our Great Lakes.\n  I might say one other thing. I hope this is the beginning of an \neffort to look for ways, as the Great Lakes Senators, to work together \nto address a number of threats to the Great Lakes. We have now stopped \noil and gas drilling. I hope now we will join together on issues of \ninvasive species, ballast water dumping from ships that come in from \noutside the Great Lakes Basin and are bringing in zebra mussels and sea \nlamphrey and other invasive species wreaking havoc in the lakes. We \nhave a number of threats to this great natural resource, and I think \nthe amendment we were successful in achieving here is a wonderful \nexample of what we can do together on a bipartisan basis, working \ntogether with colleagues in the House.\n  I thank again everybody who was involved in this effort, including, I \nmight add, a wonderful staff of mine, Noushin Jahanian, the person \nworking specifically on this issue; my legislative director, Sander \nLurie; chief of staff, Jean Marie Neal, and all of those who worked \nhard to achieve this very important goal for the Great Lakes. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent when Senator McCain completes his \nstatement, Senator Kyl be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to Senator Kyl. Senator Kyl has asked for 30 \nminutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I have asked that Senator Kyl be recognized when Senator \nMcCain completes his statement, for purposes of offering an amendment \nto the Labor-HHS bill. Everyone should be advised when the Senator \nfinishes his statement, we are going to enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement on the Kyl amendment. In that way, the Senator will not need \nto be interrupted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And when will we vote on the energy and water bill?\n  Mr. REID. We will vote on it--as soon as we finish the statement of \nthe Senator from Arizona, we are going to do the Kyl amendment and then \nwe will have three votes. One will be on the Treasury-Postal Service \nconference report, the energy and water conference report, and then on \nthe Kyl amendment. As we have been advised by our faithful staff, not \nnecessarily in that order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11337-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11337-S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to address two issues \ntonight. One is the last-minute amendments that were made to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill last week, and a statement concerning \nthe conference report for the fiscal year 2002 energy and water \nappropriations. I do not intend to spend too much time because I know \nmy colleagues are inconvenienced.\n  But one of the reasons I am having to give this statement now is \nbecause last Thursday night we sat around. All the Senators were \nsitting around and when I asked what we were waiting for they said: The \nmanagers' package of amendments.\n  Finally the managers' package showed up. Everyone was in line to vote \nso we could get out of here. Guess what. They asked unanimous consent \nfor the adoption of the management package--the manager of the bill, \nthe Senator from Wisconsin. I said: Reserving the right to object, what \nis in it? Does anybody know what is in it?\n  Of course that was met with a resounding silence. So I informed my \ncolleague at that time I was very worried about a managers' package \nthat none of us had seen, and I was worried that there might be \nprovisions in it that I and others might find objectionable.\n  Then I was told there were 35 amendments included in the managers' \npackage. Let's remember that a managers' package is supposed to be \ntechnical corrections to the overall bill. I want to tell my colleagues \nwhat went on last Thursday night and the reason this system has lurched \nout of control. It is a disgrace, I say to my colleagues; it is a \ndisgrace.\n  To reiterate, at the tail end of last week's proceedings, the \nmanagers for the agriculture appropriations bill ``cleared'' a package \nof 35 amendments to be included in the final Senate bill. Again, these \nare 35 amendments that none of the other Senators voting on the bill \nhad received any information about, nor had any opportunity to review.\n\n  While I did not object at the time to approving these amendments by \nunanimous consent, I was very concerned about the nature of these \namendments. As it turns out, I had good reason to be concerned. Of \nthese 35 amendments, about 15 of these amendments included direct \nearmarked spending or objectionable legislative riders. These \nadditional earmarks amount to an extra $8 million in porkbarrel \nspending--on top of the $372 million already included by the \nappropriators in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the managers for a bill have the \nprivilege to add and remove certain provisions to a bill in order to \nmove it along the process, or agree to clarifying technical amendments. \nI am not singling out the managers for the agriculture appropriations \nbill because the negotiation process is a part of any bill under \nconsideration.\n  However, this particular situation involves a direct spending measure \nand should require higher scrutiny in approving federal funds, which \nare normally considered in the committee process to ensure that \nprojects are authorized and approved by the Congress. This should be \ntrue of any of the appropriations or budget bills we consider.\n  Unfortunately, there is no way for us to tell if these last-minute \nearmarks were included because of their national priority or merit. \nThey are simply added on, either in attempts to gain support to move \nthe bill or tack on earmarks that might not pass legislative review.\n  Some of my colleagues may be interested to know what amendments were \nincluded in the last-minute roundup in the manager's package. Let me \ngive you a sample:\n  Relief for sugar growers from paying a required marketing assessment;\n  Special consideration provided to the State of Alaska--that should \nsurprise a lot of my colleagues--for income qualifications for housing \nfor individuals under 18;\n  There is another surprise: an increase in the earmark for West \nVirginia State College by more than $500,000, and including additional \nlanguage for preferential consideration to this same college by \ndesignating it as an 1890 institution;\n\n  Expansion of subsidies for sweet potato producers and horse-breeder \nloans;\n  Earmark of $230,000 to purchase conservation easements in Kentucky \nand $230,000 earmark to the University of Kentucky. There may be a \nlittle bell rung here. A little trip down memory lane. These states, \njust by pure coincidence, are the states which the appropriators \nrepresents;\n  Funding for repairs caused by an avalanche in Valdez, Alaska;\n  Directive language to give special consideration to the Tanana River \nin Alaska;\n  Earmark of $500,000 for Oklahoma State University;\n  Language limiting the import of fish and fish products.\n  I am greatly concerned about this process. I tell the appropriators \nnow I will not allow a vote until I have seen the managers' package of \namendment. If they don't like it, look at what we adopted last night.\n  I am gravely troubled by the managers' insertion into this bill the \nlatter provision that would effectively ban all imports of Vietnamese \ncatfish to the United States. Vietnamese catfish constitute an \nimportant part of our catfish consumption in the United States. \nAmericans like to eat them. Moreover, the guiding principle of the \nrecently ratified, and historic, United States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade \nAgreement was to open our markets to each other's products.\n  To my deep dismay, a midnight amendment inserted by the managers on \nbehalf of several Senators with wealthy catfish growers in their states \nviolates our solemn trade agreement with Vietnam. With a clever trick \nof Latin phraseology and without any mention of Vietnam, these southern \nSenators single-handedly undercut American trade policy in a troubling \nexample of the very parochialism we have urged the Vietnamese \nGovernment to abandon by ratifying the bilateral trade agreement. \nVietnamese catfish are no different than American catfish by \nnutritional and safety standards--but they are different in the eyes of \nthe large, wealthy agribusinesses on whose behalf this provision was \nslipped into the agriculture appropriations bill. After preaching for \nyears to the Vietnamese about the need to get government out of \nmicromanaging the economy, we have sadly implicated ourselves in the \nvery sin our trade policy ostensibly rejects.\n  Sweet potatoes, sugar, catfish, horse-breeders, and dozens of \namendments passed without seeing the light of day.\n  Mr. President, I ask this memo from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                  August 30, 2000.\n     Subject: Acceptable market names for Pangasius spp.\n\n     From: Scott Rippey, Office of Seafood\n     To: Whom it may concern\n       There have been several recent inquiries regarding the \n     acceptable market names for a number of Pangasius spp., and \n     particularly for Pangasius bocourti. The intent of this\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\n     memo is to provide a brief history on the subject as well as \n     to list the currently acceptable market names for several of \n     these species. This memo supercedes all previous FDA \n     correspondence on Pangasius nomenclature.\n       In March 1999, the National Fisheries Institute (NFI) asked \n     for guidance on an appropriate market name for P. bocourti. \n     Since this imported fish was relatively new to interstate \n     commerce, there was no existing acceptable market name (as \n     would generally be described in the FDA Seafood List) for \n     this species. From information provided by NFI (including \n     material on this fish from Vietnamese sources), the FDA \n     Office of Seafood accepted ``basa,'' ``bocourti,'' or \n     ``bocourti fish'' as market names for this freshwater fish. \n     This decision was expressed in a memo, dated March 11, 1999, \n     from FDA to NFI.\n       More recently, there have been a number of requests made to \n     FDA to allow the use of the term ``catfish'' for this \n     species. The Pangasius species are members of the family \n     Schilbidae. According to the American Fisheries Society World \n     Fishes Important to North Americans. AFS Special Publication \n     21, American Fisheries Society, Bethesda, Maryland, p. 63.): \n     ``The schilbids, here taken to include the Pangasiidae, are \n     freshwater catfishes of Africa and southern Asia.'' As such, \n     FDA's Office of Seafood will not object to the use of the \n     name catfish, when used appropriately, to describe these \n     species.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will read a portion.\n\n       More recently there have been a number of requests made to \n     FDA to allow the term ``catfish'' for these species. Species \n     are members of the family--\n\n  Et cetera, saying there is no difference between the catfish that are \nraised in Vietnam and the catfish that the agribusinesses have. The \nagribusinesses, however, have advertised, ``Never trust a catfish with \na foreign accent.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11338-S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--CONFERENCE \n                           REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will move on to the conference report \nfor the fiscal year 2002 energy and water appropriations. Now that one \nof the Members, anyway, of the appropriations bill is here, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, I hope he will note, I will not approve moving forward \nuntil I have seen the managers' amendment on this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no managers' amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If there is one on every appropriations bill, I want to \nsee it. Last Thursday night, in case the Senator from New Mexico missed \nit, he voted for a package of amendments, also for $35 million, without \nseeing it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The managers' amendment is, in fact, the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Good. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the energy and water development appropriations bill \nis important to the nation's energy resources, improving water \ninfrastructure, and ensuring our national security interests.\n  This conference report finalizes funding recommendations for critical \ncleanup activities at various sites across the country and continues \nongoing water infrastructure projects managed by the Army Corp of \nEngineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The bill also increases \nresources for renewable energy research and nuclear energy programs \nthat are critical to ensuring a diverse energy supply for this nation.\n  These are all laudable and important activities, particularly given \nthe need for heightened security around the nation. Such Federal \nfacilities, including Federal weapons infrastructure, deserve the most \nvigilant protection. Unfortunately, my colleagues have determined that \ntheir ability to increase energy spending is just another opportunity \nto increase porkbarrel spending. Millions of dollars are diverted away \nfrom national security interests and doled out to parochial projects.\n  In this conference report, a total of 796 earmarks are included which \nadds up to $1.2 billion in porkbarrel spending. These are earmarks for \nlocale-specific projects that are either unrequested or unauthorized, \nand that have not been considered in the appropriate merit-based review \nprocess.\n  The $1.2 billion in porkbarrel spending in this bill is nearly $500 \nmillion and 441 earmarks more than the amount in the Senate-passed \nbill, and $266 million more than last year's bill.\n  We have increased unauthorized spending by $266 million more than \nlast year's bill.\n  In total, nearly $9 billion in taxpayer dollars will pay for \nporkbarrel spending in appropriations bill passed so far this year.\n  I'm sure that many of my colleagues will assert the need to use these \nFederal dollars for their hometown Army Corps projects or to fund \ndevelopment of biomass or ethanol projects in their respective states. \nIf these projects had been approved through a competitive, merit-based \nprioritization process or if the American public had a greater voice in \ndetermining if these projects are indeed the wisest and best use of \ntheir tax dollars, then I would not object.\n  The reality is that very few people know how billions of dollars are \nspent in the routine cycle of the appropriations process. No doubt, the \ngeneral public would be appalled that many of the funded projects are, \nat best, questionable--or worse, unauthorized, or singled out for \nspecial treatment.\n  Let me share a few examples of what the appropriators are earmarking \nthis year:\n  An earmark of $300,000 for the removal of aquatic weeds in the Lavaca \nand Navidad Rivers in Texas.\n  I am sure there are no other rivers that are beset by aquatic weeds. \nSo we have earmarked $300,000 for removal of the aquatic weeds in those \ntwo rivers.\n  There is an additional $8 million for the Denali Commission, a \nregional commission serving only the needs of Alaska.\n  That is a surprise.\n  There is $200,000 to study individual ditch systems in the State of \nHawaii.\n  I would like to have someone come and study the ditch systems in my \nState. We have a few. But we are going to spend $200,000 to study \nindividual ditch systems in the State of Hawaii.\n  Three hundred thousand dollars for Aunt Lydia's Cove in \nMassachusetts.\n  I don't know what the problem is up in Aunt Lydia's Cove, but I am \nsure it is revered, and it certainly deserves a $300,000 earmark. I am \nsure that Aunt Lydia--wherever she is--is very pleased to know that \n$300,000 is going to her cove;\n  An additional $1 million for the Banta-Carbona Irrigation District's \nfish screen project--$1 million, my friends, which we have not \nscrutinized.\n  I tell my colleagues, I do not know where Banta-Carbona Irrigation \nDistrict is. But we are going to give them $1 million of taxpayers' \nmoney. Does anyone know anything about it? No, I don't think so.\n  Three million dollars for a South Dakota integrated ethanol complex.\n  I was under the impression for a long time that ethanol was developed \nby private enterprise. I didn't know we needed to contribute $3 million \nto develop an ethanol project in South Dakota.\n  Two million dollars for the Seaalaska ethanol project.\n  So far we have $5 million earmarked for specific ethanol projects.\n  Two separate earmarks totaling $4.5 million for gasification of Iowa \nSwitch Grass.\n  I am sure we could have a lot of fun with that one--$4.5 million for \ngasification of Iowa Switch Grass. What could be the problem?\n  An earmark of $1.65 million for a new library center at Spring Hill \nCollege.\n  I again plead ignorance. I do not know where Spring Hill College is. \nBut they certainly deserve a new library center. Unlike other colleges, \nthey don't have to get the money from their alumni, or from other \nsources, as colleges in my State have to do.\n  One million dollars to install exhibits at the Atomic Testing History \nInstitute. I think I know where the Atomic Testing History Institute \nis.\n  And $500,000 for the Rural Montana Project, and $8 million for the \nRural Nevada Project.\n  I respect the work of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. \nI do not believe Congress should have absolute discretion to tell the \nArmy Corps or the Bureau of Reclamation how best to spend millions of \ntaxpayer dollars for purely parochial projects.\n  At this critical time in our history, we should be doing everything \nwe can to instill the confidence of the American people in the Federal \nGovernment. Unfortunately, this increasing dilemma of flagrant \nporkbarrel spending is indefensible.\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\n  I point out that in every single appropriations bill there has been \nan increase in unauthorized projects--many of them put in at the last \nminute. I just discussed how 15 amendments were stuffed into a so-\ncalled managers' amendment which none of us except perhaps the two \nmanagers of the bill had ever seen. This process has to come to a halt \nat some time. It is out of control. It has to be stopped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no mystery about the managers' \namendments. The fact of the matter is these are amendments that are \nreviewed very closely by both sides. A lot of times we simply don't \nhave a vote on them.\n\n\n                          small wind programs\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, thank Chairman Reid for including \nfunding in this bill for small wind programs being developed in the \nState of Vermont.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate Senator Jefford's leadership on the issue of \nrenewable energy resources and his specific initiatives in Congress to \npromote wind energy. I am pleased to confirm that this bill includes \n$500,000 to be set aside for the Vermont Department of Public Service \nfor its wind energy program.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman for his leadership and support of \nthis program. Vermont has been a leader in wind energy development, \nwith some of our Nation's most prominent wind energy manufacturers \nbeing located in my home State. In cooperation with the wind energy \nindustry and the Vermont utilities, the Vermont Department of Public \nService has conducted a statewide inventory of potential wind sites to \ndetermine the best sites in terms of natural wind currents. The results \nare quite impressive and encouraging.\n  As the chairman knows, we have many ski areas operating on the scenic \nmountains of Vermont, and the research confirms that these ski areas, \nwhich are also significant electricity users, also have great potential \nfor wind energy production. Indeed, the Vermont Ski Areas Association, \nin cooperation with several of its member resorts, is determined to be \na national leader in the development of efficient, environmentally \nfriendly alternative energy resources, including wind energy.\n  While there have been discussions for a couple years now of potential \nopportunities for distributed generation at Vermont ski areas, we have \nyet to analyze the full scope of the issues involved. We know, for \nexample, that there are economic thresholds to be identified, but \nspecific profiles of energy use at Vermont ski areas have not been \nestablished. We know there are permitting issues, some procedural and \nsome a matter of policy, and these need further definition. We know \nthat there are energy regulatory issues, such as interconnection and \nmetering rules, and these need to be identified in a full and \ncomprehensive manner.\n  While I am speaking in terms of wind energy projects being considered \nby Vermont ski areas, many of the issues would pertain to other \nalternative energy projects and other distributive generation projects \nin Vermont.\n  If I can indulge the chairman further, is it your intention that a \nportion of these funds be used to help identify potential barriers to \nwind energy development, including but not limited to the economic and \nregulatory issues I have mentioned here?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, yes, that is the committee's \nintention.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chairman. Is it also the committee's \nintention that the Vermont Department of Public Service, as recipient \nof this funding, would work in cooperation with other State agencies, \nsuch as the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is the committee's intention.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Does the chairman envision that the Department will \nwork cooperatively with the Vermont Ski Areas Association to define a \nspecific scope of work supported by a portion of these funds and to \nidentify the most efficient and expedient methods for conducting such \nwork, including the selection of consultants to assist in this process?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, that is the committee's intention.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, I know the Chairman is familiar with other \ninitiatives underway in the State of Vermont with the support of the \nDepartment of Energy. I know the people of Vermont appreciate the \nDepartment's assistance as well as the chairman's leadership in \nencouraging that support.\n  Given the Department's prior experience with related studies, such as \nthe remote generation grant, is it the committee's expectation that the \nfunds appropriated by this act be available to build upon the findings \nand recommendations of previous, related efforts?\n  Moreover, is it the committee's expectation that the work products \ninclude an analysis of the economics of wind and alternative energy \nopportunities at Vermont ski areas, an analysis of the environmental \npermitting issues, and an analysis of the energy regulatory issues?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct in identifying some of the \ncommittee's expectations for this appropriation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman and reiterate my appreciation for \nhis longstanding interests in national energy issues, including his \nsupport of Federal renewable energy programs to increase domestic \nenergy security.\n  Mr. President, I would like to also mention my appreciation for Gov. \nHoward Dean's leadership on Vermont energy initiatives. Governor Dean \nand his agencies have been involved in discussions with the Vermont ski \nareas on the opportunities presented by the initiative outlined here. \nIt is my expectation that these parties, along with other leaders in \nthe wind energy industry and with the Vermont utility companies, are \nprepared to work cooperatively to generate useful results in a prompt \nand efficient manner.\n\n\n  national center for neurogenetic research and computational genomics\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water Development--the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Reid. It is my desire to clarify the intent of the language \nincluded in the conference agreement of the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. I am glad to discuss this matter with my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to clarify that the Human Genome Project at the \nUniversity of Southern California listed in title III Department of \nEnergy, under the science biological and environmental research account \nshould have been noted as the National Center for Neurogenetic Research \nand Computational Genomics at the University of Southern California. \nThis project is clearly worthy of Federal support, and I wanted to \nensure that the intent of Congress with respect to this language is \nclear.\n  Mr. REID. This is an excellent project. I assure the Senator from \nCalifornia that I concur with her remarks and that this correction will \nbe noted in the Record.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a question for the manager of the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill. We will soon need to reprogram \nfunds within the Corps of Engineers to bring the Hopper Dredge ESSAYONS \nto Cook Inlet to remove sediments from the recently completed channel. \nWe performed a similar reprogramming 2 years ago because we did not \nknow how the sedimentation pattern would develop in the area. The \nchannel was completed during the summer of 2000. At that time the corps \nestimated maintenance dredging would have to be performed every 5 to 6 \nyears.\n  Recent surveys show that Knik Arm and the North Point Shoals have \nshifted and a large deposit has settled into the southern approach to \nthe Cook Inlet Navigation Channel. However, the corps believes that \nvast majority of the material is located``outside the project limits.'' \nIt starts just inside the western limit then continues for \napproximately 1000 meters beyond the limit. The authorized limit for \nthe channel is 310 meters wide at a depth of minus 11 meters for \napproximately 2000 meters.\n  The shippers in our area have expressed concern about the condition \nof the navigation channel. I am told the corps will require a post \nauthorization change evaluation report before they can proceed to \naddress this problem.\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\nMy question to the Senator is, when Congress first authorized this \nproject, was the area I just described supposed to be within the scope \nof the original project, thus allowing the corps to proceed with the \nrequired dredging and maintenance?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his question. I \nhave been made aware of the problem in the Cook Inlet Navigation \nChannel, and I am concerned about its current condition. I am also \naware that the channel is the lifeline for products to the State of \nAlaska. The area described by the Senator from Alaska should be \nconsidered within the scope of the original authorization and I urge \nthe corps to address this issue soon as possible.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the senator.\n\n\n                     JENNINGS RANDOLPH LAKE PROJECT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman in a colloquy regarding two provisions in the conference \nreport to accompany the fiscal year 2002 Energy and Water \nAppropriations Act.\n  Mr. REID. I would be pleased to discuss these matters with the senior \nSenator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to clarify that it was the conference \ncommittee's intent that a portion of the additional funding provided in \nthe Army Corps of Engineers operations and maintenance account for the \nJennings Randolph Lake project will be used to develop access to the \nBig Bend Recreation area on the Maryland Side of the Jennings Randolph \nLake immediately downstream from the dam.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The committee has provided an \nadditional $1 million in this account for the Jennings Randolph Lake \nproject to be used for recreational facility improvements as well as \nfor planning and design work for access to the Big Bend Recreation Area \nlocated immediately downstream of the Jennings Randolph Dam.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would also like to clarify that it was the conference \ncommittee's intent that the funding provided for the Chesapeake Bay \nshoreline erosion study will also include an examination of management \nmeasures to address the sediments behind the dams on the lower \nSusquehanna River.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is again correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman for these assurances and commend \nhim and the staff for the terrific work in crafting this conference \nagreement.\n\n\n                          alaska's cook inlet\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished manager of the Energy and Water \nconference report. My question is raised to assure that the managers \nhave provided adequate funding and authority for the Department of \nEnergy to provide grants for research on tidal power as an alternative \nenergy source. As the managers know, this country needs viable \nalternative power sources. One of these could be tidal power.\n  In Alaska, nearly 65 percent of our population resides on the shores \nof Cook Inlet which also has the second highest tides in the world. \nThese tides rise as high as 46 feet, second only to the Bay of Fundy \noff of Nova Scotia. I have been contacted by Anchorage Municipal Light \nand Power, the municipally owned electric utility of the Municipality \nof Anchorage. The utility believe that it can effectively harness the \npower of the tides at Cook Inlet to supply clean, renewable power to \nits customers. However, it needs a grant for research to adapt current \ntechnology in use in other parts of the world to Cook Inlet. That grant \nwould probably require between $200,000 and $300,000.\n  Let me ask the managers if they agree that there is both sufficient \nfunding and authority under the existing statutes to permit such a \nrenewable research grant to be funded under the Renewable Energy \naccounts in this bill. I also want to clarify that this grant can be \nawarded to an applicant such as Anchorage Municipal Light & Power even \nthough past DOE grants have been unsuccessful and DOE has been \nconcentrating more recently on other renewable concepts. Do the \nmanagers agree with me on this?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Alaska and \nranking Republican on the full committee, that I agree completely with \nhis analysis. The DOE is both authorized and adequately funded to \nprovide for such a research grant. I join the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska in exploring and providing such a grant to explore the \ntidal energy protection of Alaska's Cook Inlet.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of the conference report to H.R. 2311, the \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $24.596 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $15.973 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the conference report total $24.77 \nbillion in 2002. Of that total, $14.7 billion in budget authority and \n$14.715 billion in outlays is for defense spending. The conference \nreport is at the appropriations' subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocations for both budget authority and outlays. Further, the \ncommittee has met its target without the use of any emergency \ndesignations.\n  I am relieved that we are moving forward on this and other \nappropriations bills, so that we can meet our obligation to the country \nto enact a spending plan for the government in a reasonably timely \nmanner. I commend subcommittee Chairman Reid, Ranking Member Domenici, \nand their House counterparts for their hard work in forging reasonable \ncompromises between the House and Senate versions of this bill. This \nreport addresses some of our country's most pressing nuclear security \nand water resources needs, as well as important energy issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this report be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 2311, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                                                CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      General\n                                                                      purpose     Defense   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\1\\---------\\1\\-------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority................................................       9,896      14,700          0     24,596\n  Outlays.........................................................      10,055      14,715          0     24,770\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority................................................       9,896      14,700          0     24,596\n  Outlays.........................................................      24,770           0          0     24,770\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority................................................       9,003      13,514          0     22,517\n  Outlays.........................................................       9,389      13,928          0     23,317\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority................................................       9,668      14,037          0     23,705\n  Outlays.........................................................       9,931      14,287          0     24,218\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority................................................       9,709      15,250          0     24,959\n  Outlays.........................................................       9,905      15,073          0     24,978\n \n                  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority................................................           0           0          0          0\n  Outlays.........................................................           0           0          0          0\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority................................................         893       1,186          0      2,079\n  Outlays.........................................................         666         787          0      1,453\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority................................................         228         663          0        891\n  Outalys.........................................................         124         428          0        552\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority................................................         187        -550          0       -363\n  Outlays.........................................................         150        -358          0       -208\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2002 budget resolution includes a ``firewall'' in the Senate between defense and nondefense spending.\n  Because the firewall is for budget authority only, the Senate appropriations committee did not provide a\n  separate allocation for defense outlays.

The Senator from Arizona \nis recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2075\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Domenici, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2075.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no \n     appropriation contained in this Act for the purposes of \n     school repair or renovation of state and local schools shall \n     remain available beyond the current fiscal year unless \n     assistance under such program is provided to meet the \n     renovation or repair needs of Indian schools and schools \n     receiving Impact Aid or under the jurisdiction of the \n     Department of Defense or the Bureau of Indian Affairs prior \n     to making such assistance available to other schools: \n     Provided further, notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Education is not authorized to expend \n     or transfer unexpended balances of prior appropriations \n     appropriated for the purposes of school repair or renovation \n     of state and local schools to accounts corresponding to \n     current appropriations provided in this Act: Provided, \n     however, that such balances may be expended and so \n     transferred if the unexpended balances are used for the \n     purpose of providing assistance to meet the renovation or \n     repair needs of Indian schools and schools receiving Impact \n     Aid or under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense or \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs prior to making such repair or \n     renovation assistance available to other schools.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note that this amendment is cosponsored by \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico, my colleague from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, and the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. It is an \namendment which we have debated before but which I now present as the \nappropriate time for getting this done.\n  This amendment would make it very clear that the Federal Government \nfrom now on must give absolute priority to Indian military and impact \naid schools when it allocates funds for school renovation or repair. \nThe amendment establishes this priority by directing the Secretary of \nEducation to direct any school construction funds not expended in a \ngiven fiscal year only to those categories of schools that fall within \nthe exclusive responsibility of the Federal Government; namely, the \nimpact aid schools, Department of Defense schools, and Bureau of Indian \nAffairs schools.\n  This priority would apply to unexpended funds from fiscal years 2001 \nand 2002.\n  As I said, this debate is not a new one. The question before us is, \nshould the Federal Government concentrate on meeting its fundamental \nexisting obligations or should we define our mission as finding new \nthings for the Federal Government to do first?\n  Most aspects of primary and secondary education have traditionally \nbeen, and remain, the responsibility of States and local school \ndistricts. But there are certain facets of elementary and secondary \neducation in this country that are the clear and only responsibility of \nthe Federal Government. Those are the education of our Indian children, \nthe children on reservations, and the so-called impact aid schools.\n  Yet proponents of finding new things to do with Federal education \ndollars propose branching out into new areas and ignoring this \nfundamental Federal obligation to, first of all, take care of these \nkids' educational needs.\n  So under this bill, the way it is written right now, without my \namendment, for the first time the Federal Government begins building \nschools, which is a State responsibility, while ignoring the obligation \nto the Indian children and the children on American military bases.\n  The Federal Government has a huge unmet obligation to address the \ninfrastructure needs of schools administered under the auspices of the \nBIA, as well as those schools impacted by the presence, within their \ntaxing jurisdictions, of Federal installations through the program \nknown as impact aid.\n  Yet by extending this unauthorized school construction program--and I \nnote ``unauthorized''--the money in this Labor-HHS bill has never been \nendorsed by the Senate on a recorded vote. The language in the bill \nwould entangle the Federal Government in the business of building and \nrepairing local schools, while leaving the existing needs on the \nFederal reservations unmet.\n  Impact aid provides funds for school facility repair and renovation, \nespecially on, as I said, the schools that are largely on Indian lands. \nAll told, impact aid assists 1,600 schools serving 1.2 million \nfederally connected children. In addition, the Department of Defense \noperates 70 schools nationwide.\n  Impact aid construction has not been fully funded since 1967. The \nresult is a huge backlog of projects estimated to exceed $2 billion. \nThese numbers only hint at the grim reality faced by students and \nteachers in these impacted districts.\n  A school board member in a military impact aid district told \nEducation Week that some districts conducted so much of their business \nin portable classrooms and aging buildings that they ``more closely \nresemble prison camps than schools.''\n  He went on to say: ``Our troops are in Bosnia and those are the kinds \nof schools their kids''--that is, the children of war-torn Bosnia--\n``are in.''\n  The Military Impacted Schools Association has estimated it would take \n$310 million to meet facilities needs in their members' districts.\n  The situation for Indian impacted schools is even more dire. \nAccording to a 1996 study by the National Indian Impacted Schools \nAssociation, a typical district of this type had more than $7 million \nin facilities needs.\n  It is important to reiterate that these federally impacted districts \ncannot rely on the local property tax base to fund repairs and \nconstruction, unlike nearly all of the districts that would receive the \nfunds appropriated under this bill.\n  The superintendent of one district in my State, for example, reports \nthat his jurisdiction contains exactly four taxpayers. I know in one of \nthe counties in my State, where I had to help because of the large \namounts of Federal land, only 1 percent of the land--and most of the \ntaxing comes from property taxes--was non-Federal land in this \ncommunity; in fact, only 3 percent in the entire county. Most States do \nnot have that problem.\n\n  But since the Federal Government has the obligation of educating \nthese kids, then it is important for us to ensure that the priority for \nconstruction be given to these districts. The facilities, as I said, \nare in dire straits on our Indian reservations, which educate about \n50,000 Indian students. The education of Indian children, which \nincludes the provision of safe and adequate facilities, is a specific \ntrust responsibility of the United States and is codified in numerous \ntreaties and acts of Congress.\n  Nobody who believes in keeping our treaty obligations to Native \nAmericans can vote against this amendment because its purpose is to \nensure that we meet the obligations of these treaties.\n  According to testimony from the Director of the Office of Indian \nEducation Programs, half of the schools within the jurisdiction of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs have exceeded their useful lives of 50 years \nand more than 20 percent are over 50 years old.\n  No fewer than 96 schools need to be entirely replaced. Many students \nlack access to computer and science labs, gym facilities, and other \nbasic resources.\n  At least one school in my State lacks even a library and basic dining \nfacilities.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs estimates it would take $2.1 billion \nto address these schools' current repair and renovation needs.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has made it a priority to address \nthe construction needs of Indian and impact aid schools. But that will \nonly occur if we can adopt the amendment that I have proposed.\n  The President's fiscal year 2002 budget proposal provided for a \nsignificant increase in impact aid construction. This is the first step \ntoward keeping the promise that we made to our Native Americans.\n  By passing my amendment, the Senate will make it clear that Congress\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\nshares this commitment and will put existing Federal obligations ahead \nof proposals to involve the Federal Government in areas that can and \nshould be addressed by States and local governments.\n  For those colleagues who want to know where the major impact of this \nis, I will candidly tell you, my State of Arizona is one of the States \nof major impact because of the large number of Indian students we have \nin Arizona and the large number of students being educated in \naffiliation with military bases.\n  Other States, however, that are also very heavily impacted and that \nwould be benefited significantly by this amendment are the States of \nNew Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Missouri, and \nNebraska. Those are, candidly, the States that receive the most \nbenefit. But almost every State would, in some respect, benefit by the \nallocation of these funds on this priority basis.\n  Mr. President, I am going the reserve the remainder of my time to see \nif there is any response to my amendment. I will be happy to reply to \nany points that any of my colleagues may have if there is any objection \nto it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am beginning to wonder where my friend \nfrom Arizona was a couple hours ago. I ask him, where was he? Senator \nInhofe of Oklahoma just came to this Chamber 3 hours ago and offered an \namendment which was approved by the Senate. The Senator from Arizona \nraised no objection, none. None of his staff came to me to raise an \nobjection.\n  And what did the Inhofe amendment do? It reduced the funding for \nimpact aid construction. It transferred the money to basic support \npayments.\n  Three hours ago we voted unanimously, as a Senate, to reduce impact \naid construction. Now the Senator from Arizona comes to this Chamber \nand wants to increase impact aid construction. I ask, where was he 3 \nhours ago? Why didn't he oppose the Inhofe amendment?\n  I think what that shows is really what the Senator from Arizona is \nafter: They want to undo what the Senate did earlier by a vote of 54-\n45; that is, to provide renovation and construction money for schools \nall over America.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not have much time, but I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask my colleague, does it seem odd--and I speak as \nsomeone who has been very committed to impact aid schools in my State--\nthat some people would have voted earlier to spend billions of dollars \nin tax relief that went into the hands of people already millionaires, \nand then to come to us today to tell us the only way we can help repair \nand build impact aid schools is to take it from other schools that are \nin desperate need of school construction and repair? Does it seem to \nthe Senator that the goal here is an ideological issue to make sure \nthat somehow the Federal Government does not get into the business of \nassisting school districts with school construction and that is what \nseems to be the end product of this amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from South Dakota for pointing that \nout. I am glad I yielded to him. I had not thought of it that way.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. This is an attempt by my friend from \nArizona to try to undo what we did earlier and then, as the Senator \npointed out, to take money from some poor schools and put it into \ncertain poor schools. That is what he is trying to do.\n  I don't know. I cannot believe the Senator is really serious about \nthis. First of all, last year, Congress approved $12.8 million for \nimpact aid construction.\n  This year, with the leadership of my good friend from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, and I and others on our committee, we raised that from \n$12.8 million to $68 million. Last year, impact aid construction was \n$12.8 million. We raised it to $68 million in our bill. The Inhofe \namendment earlier knocked it down to $35 million. That is still three \ntimes more than what we spent last year. I am proud of that increase. \nWe fought hard for it.\n  But I ask the Senator from Arizona, where was he 3 hours ago, to come \nover here and fight against the Inhofe amendment?\n  I am proud that we stuck up for impact aid schools and school \nconstruction. Again, last year, Senator Specter and I, in conference--I \nsay this to all Senators who are here or may be watching on their \nsets--carved out of our construction money $75 million for impact aid \nconstruction. We will be happy to do that again in conference to make \nsure our Indian schools and impact aid schools can get some of this \nmoney. I wish now that maybe we had opposed the Inhofe amendment and \nmaybe the Senator from Arizona would have helped us round up some \nvotes. That was $68 million.\n  Under the wording of the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, there \nare 10 States that have applied for school renovation and repair money. \nThe money has not gone out yet. His amendment would say: You are not \ngoing to get it. That is money we appropriated last year. Those States \nare Alaska, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Georgia, New \nHampshire, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, and Utah. All those \nStates would have the money taken away. I hope Senators understand that \nwhen they come over here to vote.\n  Again, this is nothing more than a bald face attempt to undo what the \nSenate did earlier today when we said, I thought very loudly, 54 votes \nto 45 votes, that we wanted to provide school construction money. I \ncan't speak for my friend from Pennsylvania, but we did carve out the \nmoney last time. When we get into conference, we will try to undo what \nSenator Inhofe did earlier and try to get that money back up to the \nlevel at which we initially agreed upon in our committee on a \nbipartisan basis, which was $68 million.\n  I am certain we could at least carve out that much more for Indian \nschools. We did it last year, and I am sure we can do it again this \nyear.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains for Senator Harkin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator to yield me 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I join the chairman of the subcommittee in opposing \nthe amendment by the Senator from Arizona. I believe that impact aid is \nvery important, beyond any question.\n  We have the responsibility, as proponents of this bill, to make a lot \nof allocations. We try to do it as fairly as we can, recognizing all of \nthe priorities which are present.\n  Senator Harkin pointed out that we raised impact aid from $12.5 \nmillion last year to $68 million. It is difficult to follow all the \nmatters. Another Senator approached us and has raised a concern. I made \na statement that there would be an effort made in conference--that is \nalways uncertain--to put back some of the money which was transferred \nby the amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe.\n  As Senator Harkin has already noted, last year we did make an \nallocation from school construction money. Basically, this is a dispute \nabout the role of the Federal Government in school construction.\n  We had a very spirited debate on the amendment by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, earlier today. A margin of 54-45 on a hotly \ncontested issue is a fairly decisive margin.\n  It is my view that we will try to improve the position of impact aid \nwhich the Senator from Arizona wants once in conference, but the \nallocations which we have made here, taking the bill as a whole, \nrepresent a fair allocation.\n  In dealing with a budget of this size, we have had relatively few \namendments offered signifying relatively little opposition to the \npriorities which were established first by the chairman and the ranking \nmember and then by the full subcommittee and then by the full \ncommittee.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes, 45 seconds.\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if no one is speaking, this might be a \ngood time for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a matter of courtesy, I was trying to \nenable those in opposition to the amendment to continue to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allard be added as a cosponsor \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond to the two questions the \nSenator from Iowa asked. The first question was where was I during the \nInhofe amendment. He presumes, I gather, that I opposed the Inhofe \namendment. I didn't oppose the Inhofe amendment. I don't. I guess I \nwould ask where he was. It was approved on a voice vote unanimously, as \nI understand it.\n  Second, he characterizes my amendment as an attempt to undo what we \nalready did today. I want to make clear that I will characterize my \namendment as I did in my opening presentation. What we did earlier \ntoday is not what this amendment is all about.\n  The amendment I presume the Senator from Iowa is referring to is the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. That is an \namendment which would have transferred the funds from the program the \nSenator from Iowa supports to title I programs. My amendment doesn't \nhave anything to do with title I programs. My amendment says merely \nthat the priority in the expenditure of school construction funds--that \nis what they are used for: construction, repair, renovation, and so \non--that the priority for that funding be first to the Federal area of \nresponsibility, the Indian kids, the kids on the military bases, the \nimpact aid districts; in other words, those children who are the \nresponsibility for being educated by the Federal Government should have \nthe first priority in the school construction funds.\n  I am not trying to undo what we did earlier today. I supported the \nGregg amendment. But what I would prefer to see us do is to say that \nthe funds that we are going to put forth for construction of schools be \nprioritized, and that the first priority be the responsibility of the \nFederal Government.\n  That is for two reasons: No. 1, the States and local school districts \nhave the ability to fund the construction of the schools that they have \na tax base to fund. As I pointed out, in some of these reservation \nareas, be it military reservation or other Federal reservation, there \nis not the tax base to support it.\n  Second, we have a huge unmet obligation. We as Federal legislators \nshould be ashamed that there is an over $2 billion shortfall in the \nfunding of Indian school construction. That is our obligation. It is a \ntreaty obligation.\n  All I am saying is, we take the Federal obligation, put that at the \ntop, and then the other schools can be funded. Those are the State and \nlocal schools' responsibilities. Up until last year, the Federal \nGovernment had never paid a dollar for construction of those schools. \nLet's keep the priority we should have had in the first place to fund \nour obligation first, the Federal schools, and then the rest of the \nmoney could go to the funding of the State and local schools.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I still didn't hear the answer to the \nquestion, where he was, and if he opposed the Inhofe amendment or not. \nI didn't hear about that. Nonetheless, we do have an obligation to our \nIndian schools and our places where we have military bases, that kind \nof thing, for impact aid. There is no doubt about that.\n  Obviously, under the wording of his amendment, there would be no \nmoney left for any other States that don't get any impact aid \nwhatsoever. Again, we are trying to be fair about this and to answer \nthe needs of construction all over America.\n  Let's face it, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that \nthe repair needs of our schools in America are about $187 billion.\n  And so we are trying to get a billion out nationally. But as I \npointed out and Senator Specter pointed out earlier today, that money \nis leveraged. We have experience in knowing how that money is \nleveraged. So we might get maybe 7 to 10 times leverage on that. So $1 \nbillion might equal $7 billion to $10 billion in construction in \nschools. So it helps, but it is nowhere near what needs to be done all \nover this country.\n  Under the amendment by the Senator from Arizona, there would not be \nany money left for anyone. All of the money would go to Indian schools \nand to the impact area aid schools, where there are military bases. I \ndon't think that is what we want to do here.\n  As I said, we carved out money last time. I have talked to a lot of \nmy friends who are Native Americans in Indian territory. They were very \nappreciative of that money. We carved out $75 million. Quite frankly, \nwe accepted the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. However, it is \nmy intention, along with the ranking member, to make sure we meet our \nobligations again this year in carving it out again in the conference \ncommittee when we go to conference.\n  The last thing I will mention is that the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona is also retrospective. It goes back last year and \ntakes money from last year that States have already applied for; it \ntakes that money away from them, too. I hardly think we want to do \nthat.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On this point, I have looked at the Kyl amendment, and \nhis language affects a different section. Mine is just found in the \nsection dealing with impact aid under ``basic support.'' Now, the \nchange in funding came from the construction portion of that section, \nwhich is a different section. That is my understanding, and it would \nnot make the conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Also, the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma reduced \nimpact aid construction. I don't care what you say. It puts it into the \nbasic impact aid.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct. So this Senator from Arizona wants to \nboost up impact aid construction. This is really to take away school \nconstruction money. I don't think we need to talk anymore about it. We \nall know what this is about.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will set the record straight. The Senator \nsaid he didn't get an answer to my question. I was in a briefing during \nthe Inhofe amendment in S-407 as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on some other matters. I didn't object to the Inhofe \namendment. Like the Senator from Iowa, I was willing to have it \napproved on a unanimous vote. The Senator from Oklahoma has explained \nthat it deals with a different section of the bill. That is irrelevant.\n\n  There is one central question before us. I ask my colleagues to focus \non this carefully. Until last year, there had never been a thought that \nthe Federal Government would begin building schools that had always \nbeen the responsibility of our States and the local school districts. \nThere was never a thought that we would do that. Our school \nconstruction effort was always targeted to our one area of \nresponsibility--the kids on the military reservations, Indian \nreservations, and the other Federal impact aid areas. That was our \nresponsibility, and it remains our responsibility now.\n  But what we are now proposing to do is to take the school \nconstruction money and distribute it all around the country to States \nand local school districts. I am sure there is a lot of good politics \nin that, Mr. President, but it is the wrong policy for those of us at \nthe Federal Government level who have a responsibility to these other \nchildren. We are not meeting that responsibility.\n  If we were building the schools on the Indian reservations or taking \ncare of these military children, that would be one thing. I have \npointed out that we were failing miserably in that responsibility. I \nask colleagues, how can we sit here and blithely spend over $900 \nmillion on schools around the country that could just as easily be \nbuilt by the\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\ntaxpayers of those jurisdictions, while ignoring our responsibility to \nthe very kids who are our responsibility and whom the States and local \ngovernments can't take care of.\n  What sense does that make? How does that make us feel at night when \nwe go to bed and say we have done a good thing today--violating \ntreaties with our Native Americans and denying the kids of the people \nwe put in harm's way serving in the military the kind of education \nother kids get because we want to sprinkle that money around the \ncountry rather than putting it in the area of responsibility that we in \nthe Federal Government have.\n  That is horrible public policy. The only way to set it right is to \nreorder the priorities and put back as the first priority our \nresponsibility of funding the schools in the military and for the \nIndian reservations, and that would remain our top priority for school \nconstruction. To do that, we need to vote yes on the Kyl amendment. I \nurge colleagues to do that.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                       Order of Procedure--votes\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2072, previously agreed to, be modified with the technical \ncorrections I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2072), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 54, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. 224. It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services should establish a program to \n     improve the blood lead screening rates of States for children \n     under the age of 3 enrolled in the medicaid program under \n     which, using State-specific blood lead screening data, the \n     Secretary would annually pay a State an amount to be \n     determined.\n       (1) For each 2-year-old child enrolled in the medicaid \n     program in the State who has received the minimum required \n     (for that age) screening blood lead level tests (capillary or \n     venous samples) to determine the presence of elevated blood \n     lead levels, as established by the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention.\n       (2) For each such child who has received such minimum \n     required tests.\n\n\n                            Safe Motherhood\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Chairman for his ongoing \nleadership on women's health and would like him to join me in \ncongratulating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its \nground-breaking National Summit on Safe Motherhood. The summit \nsucceeded in expanding our understanding of safe motherhood as a \ncritical woman's health issue and identified the troubling lack of \nresearch and data on pregnancy-related issues that impact the short and \nlong-term health of women.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased to join the Senator in recognizing the \nsummit. I, too, am increasingly concerned that despite major advances \nin public health and obstetrics, a safe and healthy pregnancy is still \nnot the experience for all women. More than 2,000 women each day have a \nmajor medical complication during pregnancy, such as severe bleeding, \nectopic pregnancy, postpartum depression or infection. Some groups, \nincluding African American, Hispanic, and older women, have a \nsignificantly increased risk of illness or death. For example, African-\nAmerican women are four more times likely to die from pregnancy-related \ncomplications as white women; Hispanic, Asian and American Indian women \nare twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications as \ntheir non-Hispanic, non-Asian, and non-American Indian counterparts; \nand women aged 35-39 are 2 to 3 times as likely to experience a \npregnancy-related death compared to women aged 20-24.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the chairman knows, if we are to eliminate these \nracial and ethnic disparities, we must gain a greater understanding of \nwhat causes pregnancy-related illness and death. I find it very \ntroubling that even though more women in the United States are getting \nprenatal care now than ever before, the number of maternal deaths and \npreterm deliveries has not declined in the past 25 years.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The lack of progress in reducing maternal morbidity and \nmortality is unacceptable. This committee strongly supports the goals \nidentified at the summit, including expanding the CDC's safe motherhood \ninitiatives. We must look at the public health importance of pregnancy \nto women's health in the 21st century, the magnitude and impact of \nshort-term and long-term pregnancy-related complications, and national \nstrategies to close the gaps in research, data collection and quality \ncare. CDC has taken an important lead in this area.\n  In addition, I look forward to working with the Senator and the \nGeneral Accounting Office to document the existing state of research \nand knowledge about the impact of pregnancy on women's health so that \nwe can have a blueprint for closing the gaps in women's health.\n\n\n                         Healthy Start Program\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I commend the chairman and Senator \nSpecter for drafting the fiscal year 2002 Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education Appropriations bill. Assembling this legislation, \nwith important priorities such as the National Institutes of Health, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of \nEducation, is a daunting task and one for which you should be \ncommended.\n  As the chairman knows, the Healthy Start initiative was started in \n1991 to reduce the rate of infant mortality in expectant mothers. The \nlegislation we are now considering provides nearly $90 million for \nHealthy Start. While this is a generous allocation, it has come to my \nattention that at this funding level, several Healthy Start programs \nwhich have been approved by the Department will no longer receive their \nFederal funding. I know of one such program that stands to lose \nfunding, Voices of Appalachia (VOA) Healthy Start. VOA in Whitley \nCounty, KY has done a remarkable job of reducing the infant mortality \nrate and continues to provide invaluable services to the families of \nSoutheastern Kentucky.\n  I understand that the House of Representatives has appropriated $102 \nmillion for the Healthy Start Program. Keeping in mind that resources \nare scarce, I would inquire of the chairman whether he would be willing \nto agree in conference to the level appropriated by the House.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As the Senator mentioned, this is a very tightly drafted \nbill and there are many important areas in which the Senate bill \nprovides greater resources than the House. Like you, I realize the \nimportance of the Healthy Start Program, and while I cannot make any \npromises, I will work with Senator Specter and the House to provide \nsufficient resources for this worthwhile program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I echo the comments of Chairman Harkin. Programs such as \nVOA deserve the full support of Congress, and I am committed to working \nwith Chairman Harkin to provide adequate funding for Healthy Start \nprograms.\n\n\n              hispanic serving institutions grants program\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, my colleague, Senator Bingaman, and \nI would like to clarify with our colleague, the distinguished chairman \nof the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, his \nintent with respect to fiscal year 2002 funding of the Title V \nHispanic-serving Institutions Grants program.\n  As the chairman is well aware, this program provides critical funding \nto generally smaller, community-oriented four- and two-year \ninstitutions of higher education that serve at least 25 percent \nHispanic students. These approximately 200 institutions are an \nincreasingly important avenue to success for this important and growing \nsegment of our nation, and the HSI program is integral to the ability \nof these institutions to open the doors of higher education to \nHispanics.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague and fellow chair of the Senate \nHispanic-serving Institutions Coalition for her leadership on this \nimportant issue. As she knows, Hispanics, and particularly Hispanic \nyouth, are the fastest growing group of Americans. Yet despite the fact \nthat Hispanic Americans represent 13 percent of the population aged 18 \nto 24, they comprise\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\nonly 5.5 percent of the students enrolled in four-year institutions of \nhigher education. Moreover the number of Hispanics who never complete \nhigh schools stands at an alarming 30 percent. As a nation we simply \ncannot afford to have such a large and growing segment of our \npopulation go unprepared to face the economic challenges of the next \ncentury.\n  Key to greater Hispanic American enrollment in both higher and \nsecondary education are Hispanic-serving institutions. Despite the fact \nthat they represent only three percent of all colleges and universities \nnationwide, HSIs educate over 600,000, or 42 percent, of the Hispanics \nenrolled in postsecondary education today. However, many HSIs remain \ncritically underfunded and lack the resources and infrastructure \nnecessary to meet the growing demands of the communities they serve.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the senator will yield, I want to thank him for \nhis comments and his resolute support of this program and of a variety \nof other education programs and issues of importance to Hispanics. I \nalso want to thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Harkin, as well as the ranking member, Senator Specter, for \nworking with Senator Bingaman and myself to achieve significant \nincreases in this program in recent years. I have seen first hand how \nmuch of an impact HSI grants can have to a small, struggling junior or \ncommunity college. It can very often make the difference between being \nable to offer a degree or degree program for the institution's \nstudents.\n  Madam President, I thank and commend the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor his and for Senator Specter's always exceptional efforts at \ncrafting a bill that makes the difficult choices we must make each \nyear, while managing to maintain significant increases in overall \nfunding levels for key areas of national need, including education and \nhealth funding. However, I understand the Senate committee-reported \nbill now on the floor contains a funding level that represents a slight \nincrease over the 2001 fiscal year appropriation amount for the Title V \nHSI program, but one that is below the House committee-reported funding \nlevel of $81.5 million. I further understand it is the chairman's \nintent to recede to this higher House funding level during conference \nproceedings with the House. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The senator is correct. I certainly understand and share \nher and Senator Bingaman's commitment to the important Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions program. These colleges and universities are very \nimportant to the academic and economic success of Hispanics in our \nnation, and I do intend to seek the higher House funding level in \nconference in order to further expand the ability of these institutions \nto serve their students and their communities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I too, share the chairman's commitment to the higher \nfunding level for the Title V program. Considering the need \ndemonstrated by Hispanic-serving institutions, their collective \ncontribution to their communities and to the nation, as well as the \neffective use to which they put these funds, I believe the funding \nincrease is necessary and appropriate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman and ranking member for that \ncommitment, as well as my colleague from New Mexico, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I, too, thank the chairman, ranking member, and Senator \nHutchison, and I look forward to continuing to work with all of them \nand others, including the members of our bipartisan Senate Hispanic-\nserving Institution Coalition, to continue to grow the ability of this \nprogram to serve communities across our country. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             TRIO Programs\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today along with my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins, to express support for the TRIO Programs \nthat are funded in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. Before \nI discuss the specifics of these important programs and the legislation \nbefore the Senate today, I would like to commend Senator Harkin for his \nlifelong commitment to making quality education available to every \nstudent through TRIO and other federal programs. I am grateful for his \nleadership in this arena. I look forward to working with him in the \nmonths and years ahead to continue the progress that is represented in \nthe bill we are debating today.\n  I also thank Senator Specter for his bipartisan approach over many \nyears as both chairman and ranking member on this subcommittee. The \nwillingness he has demonstrated to work with Members of both parties to \nmeet our Nation's most pressing needs in education and health care \nfunding is impressive and demonstrates a level of understanding and \nforesight we should all strive to achieve.\n  I know there are many vital initiatives funded in this bill and I \nwant to briefly highlight one that is particularly important to my \nstate of Arkansas. As many of my colleagues know, the TRIO Programs \nwere authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nsupport our Nation's commitment to providing educational opportunities \nfor all Americans. The TRIO programs are designed to help low-income, \nfirst-generation college students prepare for, enter, and graduate from \ncollege. While student financial aid programs help students overcome \nfinancial barriers to higher education, TRIO Programs help students \novercome class, social and cultural barriers. Considering Arkansas has \none of the lowest percentages of citizens with a 4-year college degree, \nthe 52 TRIO programs currently serving participants in my State provide \na critical source of encouragement and support to thousands of students \nwho might otherwise never receive their college degree.\n  To demonstrate our support for these programs, Senator Collins and I \nare leading a campaign in the Senate that would expand the population \nserved under these programs from 6 percent to 10 percent of eligible \nstudents over the next 5 years. As an important step toward this goal, \nwe circulated a letter earlier this year that gained the support of 35 \nSenators to increase funding for TRIO by $190 million each year over \nthe next 5 years.\n  Even though the Senate bill did not meet the level of funding we \nrequested in our letter, I understand that the chairman and ranking \nmember received more than 1,000 requests for funding from Senators this \nyear. So I know I speak for all TRIO participants in my State in \nexpressing appreciation for the healthy $75 million increase over last \nyear's level that is provided for in the Senate bill. This additional \nfunding is an important step in the right direction and will expand \naccess to TRIO services to thousands of students in my State and \nthroughout the Nation.\n  As appropriators work to iron out differences between the House and \nSenate versions of this bill in conference, I want to work with the \nchairman and ranking member to fight for the higher level of funding \nincluded in the Senate bill. Also, I want to encourage the \nappropriations committee to provide an even larger increase for TRIO \nshould additional funding be made available in the budget and \nappropriations process this year.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Collins for joining me in this effort. It \nhas been a pleasure working with her and I look forward to joining \nforces with my colleague from Maine in the future on this and many \nother important initiatives.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking \nSenator Lincoln for her kind words and for her commitment to TRIO. Just \nas in Arkansas, many of the students in Maine grow up in families that \nhave not had experience with higher education. The TRIO programs are \nvital in raising the aspirations of these students. Senator Lincoln has \nconsistently fought to raise the aspirations of high school students, \ninspiring kids to strive for their full potential. It has been my \npleasure to work with her, and I look forward to continued cooperation \non behalf of TRIO.\n  I would also thank Senators Specter and Harkin for their commitment \nto education funding. Under their leadership, the committee has \nproduced a Labor-HHS-Education bill that provides a $6.3 billion \nincrease in education spending for next year, including substantial \ninvestments in Reading First, Title I, Pell Grants, and rural \neducation. The investments outlined in this bill will build upon the \nprogress of\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\nthe last few years and help us ensure that all students have an \nopportunity to achieve.\n  Although the bill does not provide the amount we had hoped for to \nfund TRIO, it does appropriate a considerable increase of $75 million, \nwhich will be very helpful.\n  The five TRIO Programs--Educational Opportunity Centers, the Ronald \nE. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, Student Support \nServices, Talent Search and Upward Bound--work with young people and \nadults, from the sixth grade through college graduation. Over 1,200 \ncolleges, universities and agencies offer almost 2,500 TRIO Programs, \nserving over 740,000 students throughout the United States, Puerto \nRico, and the Pacific Islands. These programs have enjoyed broad-based \nsupport on both sides of the aisle and in local communities for over 30 \nyears.\n  Father James Nadeau, a native of my hometown in Aroostook County, is \na graduate of the Bowdoin College Upward Bound program. His story tells \nwhy the TRIO programs are so important. His parents did not have the \nopportunity to pursue an education beyond the eighth grade. Father \nJim's participation in Upward Bound changed his life and opened up a \nworld of opportunity to him.\n  Beginning in 1977, Father Jim spent three summers enrolled in Upward \nBound and then attended Dartmouth College and studied in France and \nScotland. Subsequently, he studied for 5 years at the Gregorian \nUniversity in Rome and received two graduate degrees in theology. His \nministry has spanned from Mother Teresa in Calcutta to school children \nin Portland, Maine and continues to affect lives all over the world. He \nis an excellent role model for the youth of Maine and remains a \nterrific example of the success of the TRIO programs. There are many \nsimilar stories of TRIO graduates in all professions and walks of life. \nThese are stories of successful, educated individuals who were \nintroduced by a TRIO program to the endless possibilities that become \nattainable through education.\n  Nationally, the current funding level for TRIO only allows \napproximately 6 percent of the eligible population to be served. Many \nstudents in my own state would not go to college without these \nimportant federal programs. In Maine, 15 TRIO programs serve 5,509 \nyoung people and adults and I have been very impressed by the impact \nthese programs have on aspirations. Many Maine students have told me \nthat the TRIO programs gave them the confidence and encouragement they \nneeded to succeed in higher education.\n  As we complete the appropriations process, I would ask that we place \na continued emphasis on the important federal responsibility to expand \naccess to postsecondary education. It is critical that we reach our \ntarget of serving at least 10 percent of the eligible population over \nthe next 5 years. I urge the chairman and ranking member to continue \ntheir support of TRIO by protecting the proposed appropriation in \nconference committee. I also ask that TRIO receive an increased \nappropriation, should discretionary funds become available. For \nexample, if IDEA is funded with mandatory funds during the ESEA \nreauthorization process, I hope that TRIO will be one of the programs \nthat benefits. On a related note, I should point out that Chairman \nHarkin has been a leader in the effort to secure mandatory funding for \nIDEA and I commend his commitment to that crucial issue.\n  In closing, the TRIO programs promote opportunity to education and \nthe possibility of upward mobility in this Nation, and they must be \nstrengthened.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleagues for their kind words of support. As \nthey know, I have fought to increase funding for education programs, \nincluding TRIO, in the past and I will continue to do so in the future. \nI am well aware of the broad bipartisan support TRIO has in the Senate \nand I can assure my colleagues that I will fight to retain the level of \nfunding for TRIO that we included in the Senate bill. Also, should \nadditional funding be made available in fiscal year 2002 for education \nprograms, I will work with my fellow appropriators to provide \nadditional resources for TRIO this year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I too thank my colleagues for their comments. I \ncertainly join the chairman in expressing support for the TRIO programs \nand will work in conference to maintain the level of funding contained \nin the Senate bill.\n\n\n               substance Abuse Treatment for the Homeless\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, Senator Reed and I would like to engage \nthe distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education in a \ncolloquy on the important issue of substance abuse treatment for the \nhomeless. Our goal, which I know the chairman and ranking member share, \nis to ensure that homeless individuals have access to substance abuse \ntreatment. While their most apparent need is decent shelter, homeless \nmen and women often require treatment for the underlying problem that \nhas kept them on the street, which in many cases is drug and alcohol \nabuse. Compounding the problem is the reality that homeless people \noften have difficulty accessing mainstream treatment services. What is \nneeded are treatment programs specifically tailored to our homeless \npopulation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Maine is correct. Programs that link \ntreatment to other health, housing, social and maintenance services \noften provide the best opportunity for the homeless to adhere to \ntreatment programs, and ultimately achieve stability in their lives.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator. Last year, Senator Reed and I \noffered an amendment set aside of $10 million in Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), funds to provide grants \nto assist communities in providing treatment services that will serve \nthe needs of their homeless populations. With the help of the \ndistinguished Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa, who have done so \nmuch through the years to help the homeless, our amendment was adopted. \nThis year, we are seeking to ensure that $16 million in SAMHSA funds \nare set aside to serve the needs of homeless individuals. We respect \nthe chairman's wishes that SAMHSA earmarks not be made specifically in \nbill language, and, accordingly, we will not offer my amendment on the \nfloor. We would ask, however, whether the chairman and ranking member \nwill advocate for the $16 million set-aside in the conference report to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. REED. I share my distinguished colleagues' interest in assuring \nthat this issue is addressed. Targeted treatment services for homeless \npopulations has been successful in providing the assistance and support \nmany homeless need to return to secure and stable lives. I commend the \nchairman and ranking member for their continued support for substance \nabuse and mental health treatment services for the homeless.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senators from Maine and Rhode Island may be assured \nthat I will seek conference language to ensure that $16 million in \nSAMHSA funds are earmarked for substance abuse treatment for the \nhomeless, and I congratulate them for their leadership on this \nimportant issue\n  Mr. SPECTER. I, too, would like to assure our good friends from Maine \nand Rhode Island that I will work in conference to support their \nrequest. I admire the Senators' efforts on behalf of the homeless and \nshare their compassion for this group in need.\n\n\n                     indian employment and training\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye, has submitted language to the committee regarding \ncompliance by the Department of Health and Human Services with the \nprovisions of the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services \nDemonstration Act, Public Law 102-477. On behalf of my colleague \nSenator Specter and myself, I would ask Senator Inouye to clarify the \nintent of this language.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am informed that HHS has recently released funds to the \ntribes operating their Native Employment Works, NEW, and Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, programs outside the long-standing \ninteragency fund transfer mechanism used in the Public Law 102-477 \ndemonstration. HHS has told the tribes that they must comply with all \nHHS requirements for these programs, without any reference to the \napplicability of the provisions of Public Law 102-477.\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\nThe language is intended to ensure that HHS respect all the provisions \nof Public Law 102-477, including the provisions with respect to the \nsingle planning, single budgeting and single reporting requirements, \nwhich apply to all funds under the programs covered by that law. The \nlanguage is also intended to make certain that HHS engages in a \ndialogue with the affected tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as \nlead agency for 477, and resolves any concerns which it has within the \nframework of inter-Departmental-tribal partnership which is central to \nthe Public Law 102-477 demonstration initiative.\n  I would also note that there is an existing inter-departmental \nmemorandum of understanding between the Departments of Interior, HHS \nand Labor which provides for a mechanism to continue the existing \npractice of transferring funds from HHS and Labor to Interior for \nobligation to the tribes in agreements specifically crafted for the \nPublic Law 102-477 demonstration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I may add to the remarks of my colleague from Hawaii, \nthe Alaska Native organizations in my State have been \ndisproportionately affected by the unilateral actions recently taken by \nHHS in releasing NEW and TANF funds outside the established Public Law \n102-477 process. Alaska Native groups have made important strides in \nimproving and streamlining their employment and related services \nthrough the Public Law 102-477 demonstration. These organizations face \nthe suspension of services to thousands of Alaska Native people because \nof the actions taken by HHS, placing NEW and TANF money outside the \nstandard 477 process. To avoid any further damage to the services to \nNative people, particularly those most vulnerable who are in the public \nassistance system, HHS must immediately comply with the requirements in \nPublic Law 102-477 and inform the tribes that these requirements, \nincluding the single reporting requirement, will be honored by the \nDepartment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On behalf of myself and Senator Specter, I thank the \nSenators from Hawaii and Alaska for this clarification. The committee \nwill do everything it can to ensure that HHS participates in the \ninnovative inter-Departmental-tribal partnership, consistent with all \nthe provisions of Public Law 102-477.\n\n\n                           HISPANIC PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank \nChairman Harkin and Senator Specter for including in the managers' \npackage an amendment that I sponsored with Senators Daschle, Kennedy, \nKerry, and Murray related to education programs particularly important \nto Hispanics in my State and to the Hispanic community nationally. This \namendment will increase funding for Bilingual education programs by \n$100 million, provide an additional $3 million for the High School \nEquivalency Program, $5 million for the College Assistance Migrant \nProgram, $58 million for GEARUP, $5 million for dropout prevention, $4 \nmillion for Hispanic Serving Institutions, and $25 million for the \nMigrant Education Program.\n  Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the United States \nand they are projected to contribute two-thirds to the growth in the \nsize of the high-school-age population over the next decade. \nUnfortunately, Hispanic students as a group lag far behind their peers \non many academic indictors. For example, in 1998 thirty percent of all \nLatino 16-24 year olds were dropouts--1.5 million, more than double the \ndropout rate for Black (14 percent) and more than three times the rate \nfor Whites (8 percent). Overall, Hispanic students consistently perform \nbelow the national average in the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress--NAEP. The latest NAEP results--2000 show that the percentage \nof 4th graders scoring above the proficient level nationwide was 16 \npercent for Hispanics and 40 percent for non-Hispanic whites in reading \nand 10 percent for Hispanics and 34 percent for whites in math. \nDisparities begin as early as kindergarten and remain through age 17. \nBy age nine, Hispanic students lag behind their non-Hispanic peers in \nreading, mathematics and science proficiency. The increased funding \nincluded in this amendment will have a tremendous impact on addressing \nthese serious gaps.\n  I appreciate the efforts made by our chairman, Senator Harkin, on \nthis bill overall. Due to his efforts and the efforts of his ranking \nmember, Senator Specter, the bill includes significant increases for \nmany education programs crucial to the Hispanic students and to all \nchildren. I want to thank both Senators for helping us to provide \nadditional funds for these programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator's efforts on this amendment. I \nstrongly support these programs and agree we must make sure Hispanic \nstudents have the opportunity to succeed. That's why Senator Specter \nand I were pleased to include substantial increases for these programs. \nUnfortunately, because we chose to honor our commitment to stay on \ntrack to double the funding for NIH, and because we preserved funding \nfor renovation which is also important to schools serving Hispanic \nstudents, we had less to spend on education than our House \ncounterparts.\n  I am pleased that, by adopting this amendment, we will be able to \nincrease HEP by $3 million--a 15 percent increase, CAMP by $5 million--\na 50 percent increase, the HSI program by million for HSIs, $405 \nmillion for Migrant Education, and $600 million for Bilingual \nEducation. Our amendment also includes $285 million for GEARUP and $805 \nmillion for TRIO; both programs prepare disadvantaged students to \npursue and attend postsecondary education.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I join my colleagues in supporting this amendment. \nSenator Harkin and I have always tried to work together to make sure \nfederal resources are directed toward helping children who otherwise \nmight not have access to a high quality education. This amendment \nclearly furthers that objective and I am pleased to accept it as part \nof the managers' package.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to join the Senator from New Mexico in \nthanking the chairman and ranking member for their help on this \namendment, and for their hard work on this bill. I know they do their \nbest to accommodate the myriad requests they have received to fund many \nvery worthwhile programs, and to try to address the many crucial \nchallenges facing our public education system. I do agree with my \ncolleagues that we must make sure that our schools do a much better job \nin serving our growing population of Hispanic children. As the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has pointed out, too many have not had access to the \nstrong schools and well-trained teachers who can help them succeed \nacademically for the sake of their own futures and for the benefit of \nour nation as a whole. I would strongly urge the chairman and ranking \nmember to do their best to provide further increases for these \nimportant programs, particularly for bilingual education, migrant \neducation, and GEARUP, during the conference on this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If my colleagues will allow me to discuss this a little \nfurther, Senator Kennedy and I would like to ask a few more questions. \nIt is my understanding that, at the request of Senator Hutchison, the \nSenators have agreed to work with their colleagues in the House during \nconference negotiations to further increase funding for Hispanic \nServing Institutions to $81.5 million?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the House bill allocates $81.5 million for that \nprogram and we hope to recede to the House during conference \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I greatly appreciate this commitment. These are almost \n20 HSIs in my home state and these schools desperately need additional \nfunds to assist in the provision of a high quality education to the \nfastest-growing minority population. I yield to my colleague Senator \nKennedy who has shown tremendous leadership on issues related to \neducation generally and has led the fight for improved services for \ndisadvantaged students in our country. I thank him for his support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend Senator Bingaman and Senator Daschle for their \nleadership on this amendment. I also commend Senator Harkin and Senator \nSpecter for their assistance on the amendment and for their impressive \nwork on the entire bill.\n  All of the programs supported by this amendment deserve significant \nincreases. The Senate bill will include an impressive 34 percent \nincrease for Bilingual Education programs, which leverage state and \nlocal funds for instructional program improvement, and\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\nhelp school districts implement curricula that help children with \nlimited English proficiency learn English and succeed academically. \nThere are more than 4 million LEP students attending our nation's \nschools and the number is increasing. Although the number of such \nstudents has grown dramatically in the last two decades, funding for \nfederal bilingual education has not been increased accordingly. In \nfact, the Congressional Research Service found that funding for \nbilingual education after adjusting for inflation declined by 39 \npercent from fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year 1998.\n\n  I understand that our Chair, Senate Harkin, has agreed to work with \nSenate Specter and the other members of the conference on this bill to \nprovide further increases for this program during the conference \nnegotiations. We hope to secure at least $700 million for the program, \nand more if at all possible. Does the Senator share that goal?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, that is our goal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Also, as our colleagues know, the Senate bill \nreauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provided that \nbilingual funds would be allocated under the current competitive \nprogram structure until the appropriation reaches $700 million. Even \nthe authorized trigger of $700 million is not sufficient, however, to \nprovide adequate level of support and services for all students with \nlimited English proficiency. Over the past decade, the enrollment of \nthese children in the nation's schools has grown at a dramatic rate--by \n104 percent since 1989. More than half of all school teachers have LEP \nstudents in their classroom, and yet only one-third of these teachers \nhave received sufficient training to serve these students.\n  For these reasons, the Senate passed the Lincoln-Kennedy amendment to \nthe Senate version of H.R. 1, placing Title III on a path toward full \nfunding over 7 years by authorizing $2.8 billion to adequately serve \nall students. We should work to increase funding for bilingual \neducation to at least $700 million for 2002 to provide 1.1 million \nlimited English proficient students with good instruction, quality \nprograms, and well-qualified teachers. A minimum of $700 million is a \nneeded start toward ensuring that schools can provide high quality \ninstruction for these students, and the support that teachers need to \ndo well to meet this goal.\n  Under the funding level included in the Senate bill, we intend the \nfunds to be allocated under the current competitive program structure, \nas provided for in the Senate version of H.R. 1.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me assure the distinguished chairman of the HELP \nCommittee that it is our intend to follow the direction of the \nauthorizing committee on this point. As I have indicated, it is \ncertainly my hope and intention to provide sufficient funds so that, if \nthey are distributed under a formula, schools would be able to provide \nmeaningful services to these children. I would like to clarify that, \nunder the funds provided by this amendment, if we were ultimately \nunable to exceed this level of funding, my intention would be to \ndistribute the funds on a competitive basis. We would support \ndistributing the funds at this level as follows: $150 million for the \nEmergency Immigrant Education program, $16 for Foreign Language \nAssistance, $300 for the instructional services for limited English \nproficient students subpart 1, $21 million for support services subpart \n2, and $129 million for professional development subpart 3.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman. A substantial increase for \nbilingual education is particularly important for my home State and \nyour willingness to continue to work on increasing funds for this \nprogram is appreciated. In New Mexico, there are almost 70,000 LEP \nstudents--over 20 percent of our total student population the national \naverage is 7.8 percent and only California has a larger percentage of \nLEP students--24 percent. I should note that this program also is \nessential to our Native American population. For many Native Americans, \nEnglish is a second language. These students need educational programs \nthat help preserve their native language while helping them to gain \ngreater proficiency in English and to achieve in core academic \nsubjects.\n  I also am pleased that we will be able to triple funding for the \ndropout prevention program that I sponsored in the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. In my home State, the annual Hispanic dropout \nrate was more than twice that of non-Hispanic whites in 1999. This \nprogram will provide funds to implement proven, research-based dropout \nprevention strategies and will help provide greater national \ncoordination in our dropout prevention efforts.\n  I again express my thanks to Senators Harkin and Specter for their \nsupport on this amendment and for their tremendous efforts on this \nbill. I am also grateful to the Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, and \nto Senator Kennedy for their support with respect to this amendment.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today both to applaud the chair \nand minority ranking member of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations \nCommittee for supporting needed investments in school construction--\n$925 million for States to make emergency renovations and repairs--and \nto raise my concerns about the two amendments currently being debated.\n  I applaud the Senators from New Hampshire and Louisiana for focusing \nthe education debate on targeting title I funds to the highest poverty \nstates and school districts. I, however, cannot support my colleagues' \namendments.\n  Senator Gregg's amendment is a false choice. It takes needed money \naway from school construction, adds these funds to the new funds \nallocated to title I and ensures that they are distributed through the \ntargeted formula. I agree that new title I funds should be distributed \nto states and school districts through the title I targeted formula, \nwhich provides more funding to those States and school districts with \nthe highest child poverty rates and highest number of poor school-age \nchildren. But, we cannot support targeting at the expense of repairing \nour schools in the most urgent need of renovation.\n  You may have heard me tell the story of a fourth grade teacher at the \n82-year-old Mechanicville Elementary School, just north of Albany, who \nwas struck in the head by concrete from the ceiling as she was teaching \nbecause the school was in such disrepair. In New York, children are \nattending schools in New York City built 100 years ago, and many \nstudents in Upstate New York are attending schools that were built 50 \nor 60 years ago. As Senator Harkin so simply, yet so aptly, phrased it \nin this debate in opposition to Senator Gregg's amendment: ``It is \nunfair to put poor kids in poor schools.''\n  It is imperative that as a body we place a national priority on \nmaking the most urgent repairs to our school and that we target as much \nof the education funding as possible to our highest-need school \ndistricts. We cannot choose one over the other. We must do both.\n  Senator Landrieu's effort amendment focuses on the second issue: How \nwe can best target title I funds to our highest poverty schools? I \napplaud her for her effort to try to both send more money to States \nthrough the targeted formula and to reward States for their effort and \nequity of targeting funding within States. I cannot support Senator \nLandrieu, however, as it would result in New York State receiving $17 \nmillion less than what is currently in the chairman's mark.\n  I would like to take a moment to explain to this body the situation \nthat New York schools and school children face in the wake of the \nSeptember 11th terrorist attacks and a suffering economy. It has been \nestimated that as a result of the economic situation in New York the \nState will face a $10 billion shortfall in State revenues over the next \n18 months. In addition, Comptroller Carl McCall has identified $940 \nmillion in potential State and local government costs due to the \ncurrent confluence of negative events. Local governments outside of New \nYork City could experience reductions in tax revenues of up to $300 \nmillion. Already, the comptroller lists 36 units of local government \nthat are experiencing some level of fiscal distress. It is expected \nthat the uncertainty of State assistance and the declining economy will \nonly add to the current distress of these communities and will add more \ncommunities to this list.\n  This shortfall and the weakening economy are already adversely \nimpacting our largest schools districts. In a\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\nrecent survey conducted by the New York State School Boards \nAssociation, 31 percent of school districts indicated that they will be \nforced to borrow and incur additional costs if more aid is not \nforthcoming and 70 percent of school districts revealed that they had \ntapped reserve funds that they will need to replenish. In Buffalo, the \nschools have a $28.3 million shortfall, which could mean 400-500 \nteachers and other school personnel cut at a time when the district is \nalready struggling to find certified teachers to teach students. In New \nYork City, the school board is short $400 million; they are already \ncutting afterschool programs and guidance counselors at a time when \nstudents in the city most need extra attention and assistance. In \nRochester, they are short $21.7 million; in Yonkers, they are short $57 \nmillion; and, in Syracuse, they are short $8 million. And I could go on \nand on.\n  This adverse impact on our schools is happening at a time when we are \ndebating an education bill that would put new Federal mandates on \nschools--and, I would argue, needed accountability. But how can we ask \nour schools to incur new costs to implement testing for all students in \ngrades 3 through 8? How can we expect our schools to hire only \ncertified teachers when they are laying off teachers left and right and \nraising class sizes because they don't have resources to support new \nteachers?\n  This appropriations bill begins to make a difference. It invests in \nemergency school repairs and renovations for our schools that are most \nurgently in need of repair; it significantly increase funding for \nteacher quality and teacher recruitment; and it invests an additional \n$1 billion in special education. But it is just not enough.\n  I believe that there are three things that we need to do.\n  We need to fully fund IDEA. This body passed the Harkin-Hagel \namendment on ESEA, which would move special education funding to the \nmandatory side and would increase special education funding by $2.5 \nbillion each year for the next 10 years. Why will this make a \ndifference in towns across New York, in the Buffalos and New York \nCities, but also in the smaller cities and towns from Oswego, to Utica, \nto Massena to Roosevelt? Due to the failure of the Federal Government \nto live up to its promise of funding 40 percent of special education \nfunding and the decrease in State shares of special education over \ntime, the burden on local communities has increased from 39 to 45 \npercent of the share of special education funding.\n  If we fully fund IDEA, New York's share of special education funding \nwould rise from $430.2 million, which we received in fiscal year 2001, \nto $595.4 million in fiscal year 2002--a $165.2 million increase in the \nfirst year. This increase would begin to make good on the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to fully fund IDEA and, most importantly, it \nwould help our communities by freeing up local funds for other \nnecessary education investments.\n  I will fight my heart out to ensure that this amendment is part of \nthe final education bill that Congress will consider in the weeks \nahead.\n  We need to better target title I funding. To date, the Congress has \nnever appropriated funds through the title I targeted formula. This \nformula provides needed money for States with the highest percentage of \nchildren in poverty and the highest number of poor school age children. \nNew York is a State that would benefit tremendously from distributing \nnew title I funds through this formula. In fact, if we distributed all \ntitle I funds above the fiscal year 2001 level through the targeted \nformula, New York would receive approximately 39 percent more in title \nI funding than it received last year. I will be fighting hard in the \neducation conference to ensure that we do more to distribute funds \nthrough the targeted formula to help those states with the highest \npercentage and highest number of poor school age children.\n  And I believe that we need to provide a bail-out for schools across \nthe country that are suffering as a result of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks and economic downturn. We cannot turn a blind eye to \nour schools and allow them to take the hit of a downturned economy that \nhas resulted from the terrorist attacks of September 11th. I will be \nworking with my colleagues to develop an education assistance package \nas part of the economic stimulus bill that this body will soon \nconsider.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senators from Arizona and California are \nin the Chamber. It is my understanding they wish to introduce some \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Iowa has not completed his work on the \nbill. He is waiting for some things to happen in the next few minutes.\n  Can the Senators indicate how much time they want to take?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I say to Senator Reid, thank you very much. We could \nprobably do it within 5 to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senators Kyl and \nFeinstein allowed to speak for up to 6 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kyl, and Ms. Snowe pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 1627 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday and the day before, there were \nsome statements made in Washington that I would like to reflect on for \na moment.\n  Yesterday, the President of the United States came before a group--I \nam not sure of the name of the group--and said to them at one point, in \nreflection on the economic stimulus package, that it was time for \n``Congress to get to work.\n  I understand the President is prodding us to do our best and to work \nhard, and we should. But I would say to the President and to any who \nfollow this that Congress has been working, and working hard, with this \nPresident since September 11, and before. Since September 11, we have \nbeen diligent every time the President has asked us for important \nlegislation, whether it was the money he needed to execute\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\nthis war against terrorism or the new authority he needed to execute \nthat war or aviation security. The Senate passed that bill almost 3 \nweeks ago now by a vote of 100-0.\n  That was antiterrorism legislation which the President needed so that \nour law enforcement can ferret out the sources of terrorism in the \nUnited States. We moved to that quickly and sent it to the his desk. \nThe Senate and the House have responded and have been working with the \nPresident in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I found his remarks about the economic stimulus package a little \npuzzling because we have been doing our business. It is true that we \nhave not reported out an economic stimulus bill in the Senate yet. My \nguess is we will do that as soon as next week.\n  The House of Representatives has presented a bill called an economic \nstimulus package.\n  What did the Secretary of the Treasury, a member of President Bush's \nCabinet, say about the House economic stimulus bill? In the words of \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, he called it ``show business.''\n  Across the United States, in publications as conservative as the Wall \nStreet Journal and others of a more moderate and liberal bent, the \nHouse effort at an economic stimulus has been roundly criticized.\n  All of us understand that the American economy is in a sorry state. \nThe report back just recently suggests that in the third quarter of \nthis year the U.S. economy contracted by .4 percent. After we have \nenjoyed in the last several years 2 and 3-percent growth, it is \ntroubling to see that we are moving backward. Many believe that the \nactual contraction of the economy and movement toward recession will \ncontinue in the fourth quarter. It is almost inevitable when you \nconsider all of the layoffs, the overcapacity of our economy, and the \ncurrent state of our economic indicators.\n  That is why it was equally troubling when the same Treasury \nSecretary, Paul O'Neill, came before the cameras yesterday here in \nWashington and made a pronouncement. He said if Congress could pass an \neconomic stimulus package, we might be able to avoid a recession.\n  I think Harry Truman made it very clear when he was President. He put \nthe sign on his desk that said in many respects the buck stops at the \nWhite House; the buck stops with the administration. If this is an \neffort by a Cabinet member of this administration suggesting the \nrecession is a product of congressional inactivity, I think that \nsimplifies and perhaps overstates their position.\n  So I hope we can reflect for a moment on what this economy needs and \nwhat has been proposed. We ought to put it in this perspective: Since \nSeptember 11, the money we have been spending to execute the war \nagainst terrorism, to rebuild the damage caused by terrorists on that \nday, and the money that we are proposing to spend on an economic \nstimulus to get America's economy moving forward is money that is being \ntaken out of the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  Those of us who voted for it understood full well that in time of war \nwe need to give the men and women in uniform the resources they need in \norder to protect themselves and defend America. I voted for it, \nunderstanding that money was coming out of the Social Security trust \nfund. It is to be repaid, but the money is coming out of that trust \nfund as we spend it on this war and on rebuilding the damage caused by \nterrorism. Similarly, the money being spent on the economic stimulus is \nalso coming from that Social Security trust fund.\n  The reason I raise that point is this: How does money get into the \nSocial Security trust fund? Every worker in America, rich or poor, pays \npayroll taxes, known as FICA taxes, every single pay period into the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds. So the money that is building \nup in those funds comes from the working people of America. Their \npayroll taxes are financing our war effort overseas as well as all the \nother efforts to protect America.\n  The working people of America and their payroll taxes are paying for \nthe rebuilding of New York and that which was damaged on September 11. \nThe working people of America and their payroll taxes will pay for any \neconomic stimulus package which Congress enacts.\n  The reason why that is significant is twofold. First, as every \neconomist worth his salt has told us, to get this economy moving again, \nyou have to put spending power back in the hands of consumers. \nConsumers have lost confidence. In losing confidence, they are not \nmaking key purchases. So there is an overcapacity of production, and \npeople are not buying enough. They are holding back.\n  The reasons are many. They are uncertain about the economy. They are \nuncertain about their jobs. They are uncertain about America's \nsecurity. They are holding back. And this reticence on the part of \nAmericans has led to the slowdown in the economy.\n  The same economists say, if you want to turn this economy around, you \nhave to give the resources back to the people who will spend it: the \nconsumers who need the money in hand to make the purchases to get the \neconomy fired up and moving forward. I have not heard a credible \neconomist yet not reach that conclusion.\n  I pulled a group of business leaders together in Chicago several \nweeks ago. We had representatives of labor and business, small and \nlarge, and we sat down. I said, open ended, what do we need to do to \nget America moving again? They all came to that conclusion: Give the \nconsumer more spending power.\n  Second, they said: Do it in a timely fashion. If Congress should \ndecide not to do it, or put it off, then, frankly, we are going to be \nin a position where it does not make much difference.\n  Third, they said: Make certain it is temporary, that whatever you do \nis focused on resuscitating this economy, and it isn't a long-term \ncommitment. I thought those were pretty sound principles.\n\n  We should consider not just what is most efficient and efficacious in \nterms of moving the economy forward, but, secondly, what is fair? If \nthe money we are spending on an economic stimulus is coming from the \nworking families in America, out of their payroll taxes, isn't it fair, \nin light of that first observation about what is needed for the \neconomy, that the money be at least returned to working families across \nAmerica?\n  I think that is eminently sensible. But look at what the House of \nRepresentatives comes up with by way of an economic stimulus. They come \nup with a proposal that takes the payroll taxes paid into the Social \nSecurity trust fund and redistributes them to whom? The wealthiest \npeople in America. Forty percent of the economic stimulus coming out of \nthe Republican-controlled House of Representatives goes to the top 1 \npercent of wage earners.\n  Think about ``Reverse Robin Hood.'' Here we have the average person \nworking hard, paying 7.5 or 8 percent in payroll taxes out of every \nsingle paycheck sent to Washington so that the Ways and Means Committee \nin the House of Representatives can take that money and give it to \nwhom? Not back to the same workers--no--but to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  What is even worse is a proposal coming out of the House of \nRepresentatives in the name of economic stimulus which would, in fact, \nliterally give back billions of dollars to corporations for taxes they \npaid as long as 15 years ago. That, to me, is an outrage.\n  That money coming out of the Social Security trust fund will go to \nwealthy, prosperous, and profitable corporations to reimburse them for \ntaxes that were paid as long as 15 years ago. That does not make sense. \nIt does not make sense from an economic viewpoint if we accept the \npremise that we need to give consumers spending power to get this \neconomy moving forward, and it certainly does not make sense in the \nname of justice that we would take payroll taxes and give them back to \nwealthy people in America and profitable corporations. That is exactly \nwhat the House of Representatives has proposed. And it is exactly what \nTreasury Secretary Paul O'Neill called ``show business.'' I think he \nwas too kind. I could come up with a few other ways to describe it.\n  It is far more important for us, as part of an economic stimulus, to \nget to the root cause of our economic problem, to address it in a \ntimely fashion,\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\nto avoid, as much as possible, long-term deficits, and to make certain \nthis is a temporary fix that really resuscitates the economy, as it \nneeds to be.\n  Currently, the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of \nSenator Max Baucus, is considering a stimulus package. This package is \ngood in many respects. All the tax and spending proposals are temporary \nin nature. More than 100 percent of the 10-year cost occurs in the year \n2002--immediately.\n  The bill costs $70 billion this year and $40 billion more over 10 \nyears. It includes a $14 billion rebate and $33 billion in worker \nrelief, targeted to low and middle-income Americans who are more likely \nto spend it. And it has virtually no effect on the surplus after this \nnext fiscal year.\n  Contrast that with the proposal that we now have from the Senate \nRepublicans, from Senator Grassley of Iowa. Senator Grassley's proposal \nhas $143 billion in tax cuts that are permanent, not temporary but \npermanent, representing 82 percent of the total net cost of the \nRepublican economic stimulus package. Nearly 48 percent of the 10-year \ncost of the package occurs after the first year. So it is not a \nstimulus package. Almost half of it does not occur until a year from \nnow.\n\n  The bill costs $78 billion in fiscal year 2003 and $60 billion in \nfiscal year 2004. The bill costs $91 billion in this next fiscal year \nand $175 billion over 10 years--$175 billion in comparison to the $70 \nbillion cost of the bill that is coming out of the Democratic side.\n  Listen to this part. Remember, the money we are talking about comes \nout of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds from payroll taxes \npaid by working families across America. That is what is providing the \nmoney. That is the source of the money.\n  What would the Republican Senators have us do with that money from \nthese workers? Forty-four percent of the Republican tax cuts would go \nto the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. Only 18 percent of the total \namount of economic stimulus goes to the bottom 60 percent of employees \nand taxpayers across America.\n  From where I am standing, this does not make any sense at all. This, \nby any standard, is a failing proposal on the Republican side. For the \nPresident to say to us, it is time for Congress to get to work, it is \nalso time for this administration to stand up behind sound economic \nprinciples that really will move this economy forward, and do it in a \nfashion that is fair--fair to every American.\n  We had a meeting yesterday with some friends and representatives of \nworking people across America, and a point was made very effectively: \nWhen it comes to waging wars in America, the working families are \nusually the first in line, not just with their tax payments but with \ntheir sons and daughters who serve our Nation so well, so valiantly. \nIsn't it nothing short of amazing that when it comes to stimulating the \neconomy of this country that we forget that lesson?\n  Since September 11, everywhere you turn, you see the phrase ``United \nwe stand.'' And thank God for it, that this country has come together \nin a spirit of patriotism and community and togetherness in a way I \nhave never seen in my natural life. But when you look at these bills \nthat have been proposed on the Republican side of the House and Senate \nfor stimulating the economy, it is not motivated by the motto ``United \nwe stand.''\n  It is motivated by the motto ``divided we stimulate.'' When it comes \nto putting money back in the economy, these proposals turn their back \non the same people paying the payroll taxes, the very same people \nmaking the sacrifice over and over again, day in and day out in \nAmerica.\n  Senator Tom Daschle is majority leader. He has said, as part of our \neconomic stimulus, there are several things we should do. I will refer \nto a couple of them.\n  One of the actions needed, and I certainly agree with this, is to \nextend the unemployment insurance available to workers across America. \nThis temporary extension and expansion of unemployment insurance is not \nunprecedented. In fact, former President George Bush, at a time of \nrecession in America, called for the extension of unemployment \ninsurance benefits. Unfortunately, his son, now President of the United \nStates, has not made the same commitment in terms of the number of \npeople to be helped, how much they would be helped, and how quickly the \nassistance would be available.\n  By allowing 13 weeks of extended benefits to anyone with benefits \nexpiring after September 11, we are saying to families: We are going to \ngive you the safety net, the helping hand. What is unemployment \ninsurance worth if you have lost your job? About $230 a week. That is \nthe average. It is not enough for a person to live in the lap of \nluxury. It is enough for some families to squeak by using their \nsavings, cutting corners, and trying to get by.\n  There is also a proposal that we help these same families who have \nlost their jobs and are on unemployment insurance to pay for health \ninsurance. Imagine that you have lost a job you have held for a number \nof years--and that has happened to hundreds of thousands of Americans \nin the last year--that you are now trying to keep your family together \nwith unemployment checks of about $230 a week, and when you try to buy \nthe health insurance your family now needs in the private marketplace, \nit costs you $500 to $700 a month. Those figures are not outlandish; \nthey represent the average.\n  So it is not a surprise to many that the unemployed people drop their \nhealth insurance, which, of course, causes a great deal of worry over \nthe coverage of the family and, in the worst-case scenario, pushes \nthese uninsured, unemployed Americans into a health care system which \nis forced to absorb them in charity payments.\n  We believe, on the Democratic side, that in addition to extending \nunemployment insurance, we should also extend coverage for health care \nbenefits for those unemployed workers. That is sensible. It gives them \nthe peace of mind and protection they need for their families.\n  Senator Daschle has said that will be an essential part of any \neconomic stimulus package that comes out of the Democratic side of the \nSenate.\n  These are reasonable and responsible things to do. We have \ntraditionally committed ourselves to small business, and that \ncommitment could be realized as part of the economic stimulus package \nin terms of allowing some bonus depreciation, some expensing, so that \nthere can be purchases made that help businesses and that will help \nthose who supply them. That is sensible.\n  This small business approach costs a great deal less than what has \nbeen proposed in the House of Representatives, which rewards some of \nthe largest corporations in America.\n  That is what we face in terms of an economic stimulus package on the \ntax side. Our colleague in the Senate, Mr. Robert Byrd, has suggested \nthat in addition to the $70 billion as part of our tax package, that we \nalso put in about $20 billion in spending. Some will say: There they go \nagain. At a time of national emergency, they are making proposals to \nspend more Federal money.\n\n  Before you reach that conclusion, take a look at what Senator Byrd \nhas proposed, cosponsored by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The proposal \nis to provide additional funds to Federal, State, and local \nantiterrorism law enforcement. We just had a meeting of our homeland \ndefense coordinator for the State of Illinois, Matt Battenhausen, and \nour bipartisan delegation to talk about the urgent need to create a \ncommunications system in our State of Illinois and many other States so \nthat police departments and fire departments can be in communication in \ntime of need. That seems very basic to me.\n  Senators Byrd and Reid, in this spending proposal for homeland \ndefense, would provide resources for that opportunity. The FEMA \nfirefighters grant program is another program that has provided for an \nupdate in the equipment and resources and materials at fire stations \nall across America. It has been an extremely popular program. They have \ncalled for $600 million on that. I am certain that could be used very \neffectively, if for no other reason than to give local firefighters \nsome familiarity with dealing with hazardous materials and the threat \nof bioterrorism. That is something that is absolutely essential.\n  When it comes to infrastructure security, highway security, and clean \nand safe drinking water, if you think\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\nabout this, we have made it clear that we not only should focus on \naviation security and airport security but on all transportation. \nInvesting money now to protect those resources is going to thwart any \nefforts by terrorists to turn them against us.\n  There is money included as well for bioterrorism prevention and \nresponse and food safety. This is an issue about which I feel strongly. \nWe need to put the resources into bioterrorism.\n  Today, we had a presentation to many Democratic Senators from Dr. \nAnthony Fauci, who is with the National Institutes of Health. He talked \nto us about anthrax, with which we have become increasingly familiar on \nCapitol Hill because of the threats against our Senators, as well as \nthe many people who work and visit here.\n  It is clear to me there are things we absolutely essentially have to \ndo to protect America. How will they get done? How can we make this \ndifference? We certainly can't make the difference unless we are \nprepared to provide money to those units of government and others that \nneed it to protect us against bioterrorism. Border security, $1.6 \nbillion: Would anyone argue against the idea of putting more people on \nthe borders to make certain that those who have a suspicious background \nor involvement in terrorism cannot get into the United States?\n  Mass transit, Amtrak, and airport security: all of these are easily \ndefensible and suggest that there will be money spent for good purposes \nto protect and defend America and at the same time to invigorate this \neconomy.\n  It is a very positive combination to take the tax benefits being \noffered by Senator Baucus's bill as well as the homeland defense \nspending that has been suggested by Senator Byrd. Coming together, it \nwill not only help the economy; it will make America a safer place.\n  We can say to the working families across America who pay the payroll \ntaxes that are being spent through the Social Security trust fund that \nthe money is being spent for their purposes to help them, to help this \neconomy, to turn America around.\n  The President has said it is time for Congress to get to work. I \naccept the challenge. I think it is also time for the administration to \nget to work, for them to reject the show business, as Secretary O'Neill \nhas called the Republican bill that is before us, and to come forward \nwith a more sensible and responsible and manageable approach. If the \nPresident will step up and with his leadership create a bipartisan \ncoalition for an economic stimulus that is truly in the best interest \nof America, I guarantee him this: The same spirit of bipartisanship we \nhave seen in Washington for the last 7 weeks will continue in this \nimportant chapter of America's history as well, as we respond to this \nrecession with a positive program, a program that will truly help \nAmerica get back on its feet.\n  That is the challenge before us. I certainly hope as the Senate \nFinance Committee brings its bill to the floor and searches out 60 \nSenators in support of it, it will be a bipartisan bill. If we are \ngoing to be asked to accept without change, take it or leave it, the \nproposal on the Republican side to provide most of the benefits for the \nwealthiest people in this country and for the wealthiest corporations, \nit should be summarily rejected.\n  As Secretary of the Treasury O'Neil said: The Republican version \ncoming out of the House is a bad idea. It would be a bad idea coming \nout of the Senate as well.\n  I could not in good conscience support a bill in the name of economic \nstimulus which takes money from the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds and spends it; instead of creating an economic incentive, it \nspends it instead on benefits for those who are frankly very well off \nand not very pained in today's economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone).

A few weeks ago my colleague, who is now presiding, the \nSenator from Minnesota, introduced a resolution in the Senate \nacknowledging the hard work of the Capitol Police and all the security \nforces around Capitol Hill. I was happy to join with him and all the \nother Senators in that resolution.\n  A few days ago, with the assistance of Jeri Thomson, who serves as \nthe Secretary of the Senate, we prepared these buttons which are small \nand probably cannot be seen by anyone following this debate. But the \nword on them is ``heartfelt'' thank you to the Capitol Police. Most of \nthese men and women have been working 12-hour shifts at least 6 days a \nweek since September 11.\n  I just had a few words with one of the officers at the Dirksen \nBuilding. She told me that while she is working 6 days a week 12 hours \na day, her husband is working for the Red Cross 7 days a week and 12 \nhours a day. They have two children--3 years old and 5 years old. I \nsaid: Did you have any chance to go trick or treating with the kids? \nShe said, she didn't get home until 8:30; they would just have to wait \nuntil next year.\n  That is part of the sacrifice by so many people who don't receive \nrecognition in the Congress but deserve it.\n  For those men and women who are standing out there protecting this \nHouse that belongs to the American people and this building that \nsymbolizes so much in our democracy, I want them to know that from all \nthe Members of the Senate this expression of gratitude is heartfelt.\n  Thank you so much for all you do every single. I hope we can find a \nway to bring some relief to your life soon. I hope as well that we can \nsee some relief in the lives of all Americans who have been troubled \nand worried over the events since September 11.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11354-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11354-S11355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LOOKING PAST DOHA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the upcoming WTO \nmeeting in Doha. I want to express my very serious concerns about the \ndirection I believe these negotiations are heading.\n  Let me start with the area with which I have the most serious \nconcern; that is, protecting U.S. trade laws. Enforcement of our trade \nlaws is one area where the administration and the Congress have \nrecently worked very closely together.\n  On issues such as softwood lumber and steel, Congress and the \nadministration have worked together to ensure that our companies and \nworkers are protected from unfair trade practices. It has been working \nwell.\n  Recent lumber decisions by the National Trade Commission and by the \nDepartment of Commerce, as well as the free trade decision on steel \ndumping onto U.S. markets, are areas where the administration and the \nCongress worked together on enforcing our trade laws against unfair \nforeign trade practices.\n  These cases demonstrate why our trade laws are critical, and also why \nthe case for defending trade laws is one that has always been \nbipartisan. Indeed, earlier this year I was joined by 62 of my \ncolleagues in a letter urging this administration not to weaken our \ntrade laws.\n  I again urge the administration to accept the inescapable fact that \nour trade laws are part of the political bargain on trade. Without \nassurances that America has the laws to protect itself against unfair \nforeign trade practices, future trade agreements will be very tough to \nsell.\n  Americans are not wanting to buy into a trade agreement if they are \nnot assured the trade laws are protected and upheld so we can protect \nourselves against other countries' foreign trade practices.\n  Recent history demonstrates why we should be concerned. Both NAFTA \nand the recent GATT and WTO negotiations have significantly undermined \nenforcement of America's trade laws.\n  There have been suggestions that we use WTO negotiations as an \nopportunity to address due process and transparency concerns in the \napplication of other countries' trade laws.\n  These are problems of compliance with existing WTO rules and not \nproblems requiring us to revisit the rules themselves.\n  Indeed, our existing international rules are constantly under attack. \nCountries are now trying to achieve through litigation what they failed \nto achieve in previous negotiations.\n  Remember that our trade laws are WTO legal. They conform with and are\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\nconsistent with the principles and the rulings of WTO. We are not \ntrying to do anything unfair. We are just trying to be fair and make \nsure we are protected.\n  Realizing that many of our trading partners want to weaken our trade \nlaws, I was quite surprised to read that the draft declaration \nindicated a willingness to renegotiate these rules. This is the draft \ndeclaration looking toward Doha.\n  Why should we do this? What do we gain? Where is the affirmative \nagenda?\n  At a minimum, the United States should be seeking to address the \nunderlying market distortions that cause dumping and that cause other \ncountries to subsidize. We should be trying to correct the erroneous \nWTO decisions that have been handed down for the last several years. \nYet all the draft declaration indicates is that we will engage in a \nwholesale renegotiation of these rules.\n  I find that very disturbing. I hope our trading partners realize that \nwhen it comes to weakening our trade laws through further negotiation \nthey will face stiff, unyielding, and bipartisan opposition in the \nCongress.\n  I am also concerned about the declaration's environment and labor \nprovisions.\n  I was happy to see the reaffirmation of our commitment to the \nsustainable development, and that the WTO will increase its focus on \nthe relationship between multilateral environmental agreements and \ntrade rules. Both these issues deserve even more attention.\n  I am concerned, however, about the comments from our negotiators that \nthese are ``Europe's issues.''\n  Sustainable development is not a concern of Europe alone. I hope the \nlessons of Seattle have not somehow been lost on us. These are American \nconcerns--more so now than ever.\n  So too is the issue of labor and trade. The declaration makes the \nmistake of suggesting that labor standards are--and I quote--``social \nissues,'' appropriately handled by the ILO.\n  I want to be clear on this point. We have now turned the corner on \nthese issues. As the overwhelming support for the recent United States-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement makes clear, environment and labor \nstandards are now a part of the trade dialog. They are here. We passed \nit; that is, we passed legislation which affirms it.\n  Finally, I want to express my strong support for Taiwan's accession \ninto the WTO--as a full member of the WTO. This includes the right to \nchallenge the trade practices of China--or any other country--just as \nother members have the right to challenge Taiwan.\n  I am concerned about some of the recent reports that China is \nadvocating some kind of lesser status for Taiwan. As an independent \nmember of the WTO, Taiwan should have, and will have, the same rights \nas every other member. I hope the administration will take a strong \nstand in this regard.\n  As we look toward and beyond Doha, I look forward to working with the \nadministration. But I also urge our negotiators not to give up the \nstore. The goal of launching a new round of negotiations is not an end \nin itself. We must be vigilant in ensuring that we get the best deal \nfor our farmers, our workers, and our companies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11355-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11355-S11356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to address the problems we are \nhaving getting energy legislation to the Senate floor.\n  I strongly believe we need to have a comprehensive energy package \nbrought to the Chamber.\n  My colleagues may remember that a short while ago, I offered an \namendment on the Defense authorization bill that would have included a \ncomprehensive energy policy--H.R. 4, the House-passed bill, the bill \nthe administration wants, the bill the majority of people in this \nChamber want to pass--in the legislation. I was criticized for that. \nYet there is no stronger supporter of the military than I.\n  Having been chairman of the defense authorization readiness \nsubcommittee for some 5 years, I see energy as a major national \nsecurity issue. Frankly, it was a wrong decision for the \nParliamentarian to say it was not germane.\n  Let's look at where we are today. Today we are 56.6 percent dependent \nupon foreign countries for our oil supply. That means we are 56 percent \ndependent upon foreign countries for our ability to fight a war. What \nis alarming is that 50 percent of what we have to import is coming from \nthe Middle East. The fastest growing contributor to that amount upon \nwhich we are dependent is none other than Iraq. You can say in one-\nsentence form: It is ludicrous that we should be considered to be \ndependent upon Iraq for our ability to fight a war against Iraq.\n  We have a new figure I would like to share with the Senate. In the \nyear 2000 alone, the United States bought $5 billion worth of oil from \nIraq.\n  Let's look at where we are today. For all practical purposes, not \nonly are we at war in Afghanistan, but also in Iraq. They have shot \ndown three of our Predators. We have no-fly zones. We have our troops \nwho should be better trained when they arrive in the Persian Gulf. Yet \nwe are dependent upon Iraq and the Middle East for our ability to carry \nout a war. If something should happen, an accident of a tanker coming \nin, any number of things, it would be an absolute disaster.\n  I will cite for my colleagues some recent statements that I didn't \nhave at the time to share when I brought up my amendment.\n  One is from Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense. In response \nto my question, he said:\n\n       [It] is a serious strategic issue. . . . My sense is that \n     [our] dependency is projected to grow, not to decline. . . . \n     I think you're right to point out that it's not only that we \n     would, in a sense, be dependent upon Iraqi oil, but the oil \n     as a weapon. The possibility of taking that oil off the \n     market and doing enormous economic damage with it is a very \n     serious problem.\n\n  Senator Carper, the other day, was in a colloquy and statements were \ngoing back and forth, and quoting Mr. Greenspan responding to one of \nSenator Carper's questions--this is Greenspan, and we are getting ready \nfor an economic stimulus:\n\n       At the moment, the demand for power is pretty soft because \n     the economy is soft. That is going to change. And when it \n     changes, unless we have a long-term focus on how we put our \n     infrastructure together, how we set incentives and rules to, \n     one, maintain energy security while protecting the \n     environment, we are going to run into trouble. And I think \n     unless we give it very considerable thought now--projecting \n     five, six, seven years out in the future--we are going to get \n     sub-optimal solutions.\n\n  This is not a new issue. I started on this issue back in the Reagan \nadministration. Nor is this a partisan issue because the Reagan \nadministration, while he was President, refused to have a comprehensive \nenergy policy. Then along came George ``the first.'' He came out of the \noil patch, so we thought surely this man would be able to successfully \nhave a national energy policy. And he would not do it. This was at a \ntime when we were nearing a war. This is a national security issue, not \nan energy issue. During the Clinton administration, he would not do it \neither.\n  Now we have an agreement where the leadership on both sides says we \nneed a comprehensive energy policy. We need to have a vote this year to \naccomplish two things: One, our national security, to get out of this \nquagmire in the Middle East and to be able to fight a war; two, an \neconomic stimulus. I can't think of anything that would be more \npositive to stimulate the economy than a national energy policy. It \ninvolves some controversial things, yes. ANWR is one small part of \nthis. People keep saying this is an ANWR bill. It is not. We are \ntalking about H.R. 4 over in the House. It has 300 pages. Only 2 pages \nare ANWR. It includes a comprehensive approach, including nuclear; some \nof our marginal production in this country that is virtually cut off \nbecause of the unpredictability of prices. If you get a marginal \noperator drilling a well for 15 barrels or less and he is not going to \nbe able to know the price of oil 15 months down the road, he is not \ngoing to do it. Consequently, we are not doing it. If we had all of the \nmarginal production that we have ceased to have over the last 10 years \nin production today, it would equal the total amount we are importing \nfrom Saudi Arabia. Consequently, I see this as a critical issue that \nhas to be dealt with this year.\n  Just recently, I notice almost on a daily basis President Bush \nexpresses the administration's position. This is from the 17th in \nSacramento:\n\n\n[[Page S11356]]\n\n\n       I ask Congress to now act on an energy bill that the House \n     of Representatives passed back in August. . . . Too much of \n     our energy comes from the Middle East. The plan I sent up to \n     Congress promotes conservation, expands energy supplies, and \n     improves the efficiency of our energy network. Our country \n     needs greater energy independence. The issue is a matter of \n     national security, and I hope the Senate acts quickly.\n\n  We have many other quotes. I will mention a last one from the \nSecretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, the other day:\n\n       The President has said very clearly this is a priority. \n     This situation--\n\n  Referring to September 11--\n\n     has made it more urgent, and we need to begin moving the \n     process. We have always said that national security is part \n     of the reason we need to get the energy program in place, and \n     we certainly have not backed away from that position now that \n     September 11 has occurred.\n\n  So I think there is nothing more important to deal with between now \nand the end of the session than a comprehensive energy bill. Let's at \nleast bring it up for a vote. That is what this is supposed to be \nabout, so we can debate this issue. We can't really debate this issue, \nother than the way I am doing it now, in anticipation of a vote, unless \nwe have an opportunity to have a vote. So I think you are going to see \nthis offered again as an amendment. The logical place should be on the \neconomic stimulus package, because this is an economic stimulus issue, \nas well as a national security issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11356-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred Jan. 28, \n2000, in Boston, MA. A group of high school teenagers sexually \nassaulted and attacked a 16-year-old Boston High School student on the \nsubway because she was holding hands with another young girl, a common \ncustom from her native African country. Thinking the victim was a \nlesbian, the group began groping the girl, ripping her clothes, and \npointing at their own genitals. Officials said a teenage boy who was \nwith the group allegedly pulled a knife on the girl, held it to her \nthroat and threatened to slash her. The girl later passed out from \nbeing beaten. Three high school students were arrested in the attack \nand charged with civil rights violations, assault with a dangerous \nweapon, assault and battery, and indecent assault and battery.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11356-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ASKING SAVES KIDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

To help parents with \nwhat is a difficult question, the ASK campaign has developed a \n``Parent's Help Kit''.

NGUYEN\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, yesterday, we received tragic news: \nKathy Nguyen, a 61-year old Bronx woman who worked at the Manhattan \nEye, Ear and Throat Hospital on East 64th Street, passed away from \ninhalation anthrax. Her death, she is the fourth person in our country \nto die from anthrax, has saddened New York, and our entire country. Ms. \nNguyen, who worked at the hospital since 1991, was a clerk in the \nstockroom in the basement of the hospital.\n  Ms. Nguyen came to America from Vietnam in 1977 with the help of a \nNew York City police officer. Like many refugees from Vietnam, she left \nwithout any money, and started a new life for herself in America. She \nsettled in the Bronx' Crotona Park East area near the Bronx River. She \nmarried an American, but later divorced. They had a son, who tragically \ndied in a car accident years ago.\n  Ms. Nguyen's friends and neighbors have spoken kindly about the tiny, \ngenerous woman who had no family of her own, but always inquired about \ntheir families. She enjoyed cooking meals for her neighbors and their \nfamilies, even sharing Thanksgiving dinner, and was known for her \nfondness for offering coworkers food.\n  Working afternoons and evenings at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat \nHospital, Ms. Nguyen was responsible for stocking the emergency room \nand operating rooms with medicine and instruments. She sometimes \nreturned home as late as 11pm. Her neighbors noted her late working \nhours and said that she was planning on retiring. Although she did not \nhandle mail, it has been reported that the supply room where she worked \nwas adjacent to the hospital's mailroom.\n  Last Thursday night, Ms. Nguyen complained to her neighbors that she \nwas feeling ill, but she brushed it off as a cold. She went to work as \nusual on Friday, but by Sunday night, she felt worse and the \nsuperintendent of her building brought her to the emergency room at the \nLennox Hill Hospital. She was in critical condition in the intensive \ncare unit with pneumonia and was placed on a respirator. Initial tests \nshowed anthrax and additional tests confirmed the diagnosis on Tuesday \nafternoon. Although she fought hard to battle this terrible infection, \nshe passed away.\n  Ms. Nguyen was too ill to aid investigators who sought to retrace her \nmovements before she became sick to determine the source of the anthrax \nand it remains a mystery. Federal and local health officials are \nvigorously pursuing all avenues to uncover the source of the anthrax \nthat sickened Ms. Nguyen.\n  I know that Ms. Nguyen's friends and neighbors will miss her greatly. \nHer kindness and concern for her neighbors were a special part of the \nBronx neighborhood where she lived. Her everyday courtesies, in a city \nthat is known for its anonymity and incredible size, made the world a \nlittle smaller, and a little nicer, for her neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11356-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11356-S11359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been seven weeks since the \nhorrifying attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the \ncrash of the plane in Pennsylvania.\n  We have all struggled with a flood of thoughts and emotions about the \nfrightening and tragic loss of life, the national response to this \ncruel, mindless assault on innocent people, and where we go from here.\n  My wife Marcelle and I have received hundreds of phone calls, letters \nand e-mails from people who have offered thoughtful suggestions, and I \nhave read many articles, opinion pieces, and heartfelt letters to the \neditor of the national and local newspapers.\n  I do not pretend to have all the answers. No one does. The United \nStates military is carrying out bombing missions against the Taliban \nand terrorist sites in Afghanistan. The situation is unpredictable, and \nwe are learning more each day. But I do want to express some of my \nthoughts at this time.\n  First and foremost, my thoughts are with the victims' families. It \nhas been hard, very hard, to see the images of the families as they try \nto come to terms with the loss of loved ones.\n  I also share the pride in how our firefighters, police and other \nemergency\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\nworkers rushed to the scene intent on rescue without thought for their \nown safety. We are in awe of the bravery of those on the United \nAirlines flight who struggled with the hijackers and prevented that \naircraft from striking its target in Washington.\n  I am proud of the skill and courage of our Air Force pilots, who fly \nthousands of miles, often in the darkness of night, into hostile \nterritory. They are constantly in our thoughts, and we pray that each \nof them returns safely.\n  Amid all the sadness and anger, I have been tremendously heartened by \nthe way Americans of all races, religions and backgrounds rallied \ntogether to help each other. It should not be surprising that we would \nrespond this way, but it is enormously uplifting and reassuring.\n  And I was also encouraged when millions of people in cities around \nthe world gathered to express their sympathy and support for the United \nStates. There were 200,000 in Berlin alone.\n  It was a vivid and moving reminder of how many people in so many \ncountries respect what our country stands for, and look to us for \nleadership in solving the world's problems. It is that leadership, in \ncombating terrorism but also in addressing other pressing global \nissues, that we must show today and in the future.\n  I have been impressed by the leadership shown by President Bush and \nothers in the Cabinet. I commend the President for voicing our common \ngoal to seek justice for the victims and for our country, our \ncondemnation of the despicable acts of harassment and intimidation of \nMuslims in the United States, and our resolve to protect our country \nfrom future terrorist acts.\n  It has been said over and over that ``the world has changed.'' In one \nsense that is true. Our country has suffered its greatest loss of life \non American soil, in a single day, since the Civil War. Our response to \nthis tragedy is causing changes throughout our society. However, in \nanother sense, it has a lot more to do with our perceptions of the \nworld than with the world itself. The world was changing long before \nSeptember 11, and threats that existed before that infamous day are no \nless present today.\n  These attacks destroyed not only thousands of innocent lives, but \nthey destroyed mistaken assumptions about our safety in isolation. They \nalso, let us hope, erased our complacency. We are now beginning a \nstruggle that may take decades, shake foreign governments, and cause \ngreat disruption in our daily lives.\n  We are responding decisively. The American people want to feel secure \nand they want justice. If the Taliban continue to shelter bin Laden and \nother terrorists they will pay a heavy price. They have already lost \nthe support of virtually every country in the world, and our military \nhas destroyed many of their military assets. Others who knowingly \nharbor terrorists face similar consequences.\n  Yet as we seek justice and security, let us not be blinded by anger \nor zealotry. We want a world without terrorists, but we owe it to \nourselves to calmly ask constructive questions, as we commit to this \ncause thousands of American lives, billions of dollars, and the \ncredibility of our nation.\n  Our response must single out those individuals, organizations, or \nnations that are responsible for these atrocities. The terrorists want \nus to overreact. They want us to strike back blindly and cause the \ndeaths of innocent civilians. They want to draw us into a so-called \n``holy war,'' and they will use these images against us, alienating \nothers in the Muslim world whose support we need to combat this threat, \nand among whom there are many who already resent our involvement in the \nMiddle East.\n  We need to understand the fact that the civilian casualties caused by \nour bombs in Afghanistan despite the efforts made to prevent them are \nnot only tragic but also exacerbate the hatred of America by Muslims in \nmany parts of the world, a hatred which has been building over many \nyears.\n  We are seeing this among Muslims in Pakistan, in Indonesia, in the \nWest Bank, even in Africa. Despite President Bush's, Secretary \nPowell's, and Secretary Rumsfeld's clear statements to the contrary, \nthey see our actions as attacks on their religion.\n  We also know what happened to the Soviet army, and to the British \nbefore them, in Afghanistan. Two of the world's most powerful \nmilitaries suffered terrible losses and were forced to withdraw in \nhumiliation. And we should remember our own disastrous experience in \nSomalia.\n  We need to recognize that there are parts of the world, dominated by \nfierce warlords and clans, that we do not understand and probably \ncannot understand. We should be very, very careful not to repeat past \nmistakes.\n  Our campaign against terrorism has no direct precedent, and we are \nstill feeling our way forward. At this stage of the military dimensions \nof this effort, neither the President nor the Pentagon have yet \nexplained, except in the most general way, what they expect to \naccomplish militarily in Afghanistan within the next month, 6 months, \nor year, and how they expect to accomplish it. Nor have they yet \nexplained the risks to our Armed Forces, except to say that there will \nbe casualties.\n  Meanwhile, the American people have been asked to be patient, and \nthey have been. Members of Congress have been asked to give the \nPresident and the Pentagon great latitude, and they have done so. But \nwe are all in this together, and the time for clearer goals and more \ndirect answers about our strategy is approaching.\n  The fact that 2 weeks ago the Pentagon told us that they had \neviscerated the Taliban's military capabilities, and a week later \nexpressed surprise that the Taliban has proved to be a determined foe, \nalready has raised troubling questions.\n  No one wants to see an end to the Taliban more than I, and I have no \ndoubt that we can force them from power. But there is no evidence it \ncan be done by bombing alone, at least not without many civilian \ncasualties. How many ground troops would it take, over what period of \ntime? And then what? Surely the Taliban would regroup and fight from \nsomewhere else.\n  The American people will deserve and need answers to these and other \nquestions.\n  There is no doubt that we will need help from others to fight \nterrorism, which exists in every corner of the globe. To his credit, \nthe President showed admirable patience in building a coalition to \ntrack down terrorists and their sources of income. The President must \nalso continue to show an understanding of the particular situation of \neach country in the coalition, and of how much we can reasonably demand \nof them given their circumstances, their capabilities, their history.\n  The situation we are in is unlike any that we have seen before. It is \ndifficult always to know who the enemy is or where they may be hiding. \nThey may be right among us, or they may be in the mountains of Central \nAsia. Secretary Powell and others have been clear that we are preparing \nfor a long, sustained, comprehensive campaign, using all the means at \nour disposal--diplomacy, intelligence, law enforcement, financial, \neconomic, and military.\n  We must confront the entire superstructure of terrorism--the states \nthat knowingly provide terrorists with support and safe haven, the \nsystem of financial support, and sources of recruits, and the hatreds \nthat spawn them.\n  In doing this, we must heed the lessons from other so-called wars \nthat we have fought against other deeply rooted, complex problems--the \nwar on poverty and the war on drugs. These ``wars'' have been fought \nwith many weapons. They also depend on foreign cooperation. Yet we are \nnowhere near to winning either of those wars, despite the fact that we \nhave spent tens of billions of dollars, and even, in the war on drugs, \nimprisoned thousands of people and deployed our forces in foreign \ncountries.\n  We must be resolute but realistic. We can no more completely \neliminate terrorism from the face of the Earth than we can eliminate \npoverty. But there is a great deal we can do to protect ourselves.\n  The President has waived sanctions against Pakistan so we can assist \nthem in this effort. I have heard proposals that we should set aside \nother laws which affirm our commitment to the protection of human \nrights in our international relations. Others speak of waiving \nlimitations on our support\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\nfor dictatorial regimes in Central Asia, or countries that have engaged \nin proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n  I will listen to what the Administration proposes, but I am also \nmindful of the lessons of history. We supported the fighters who became \nthe Taliban, when they sought to expel the Soviets. Today the Taliban, \nled by religious fanatics, systematically terrorize and brutalize their \nown people. The country has been turned into a virtual prison, where \nits inhabitants, many too weak from hunger and disease to flee, suffer \nthe daily cruelty of the Taliban's tyrannical rule.\n  We gave weapons to Iraq, and to the Shah of Iran, whose secret police \ntortured Iranian citizens who spoke out for democracy. We have \nsupported other regimes that committed atrocities, which to the victims \nwere no different from acts of terrorism. We must not repeat those \nmistakes.\n  We must reaffirm the principles that make this country a beacon of \nhope around the world, and which reflect the most deeply held ideals of \nour people--ideals which the terrorists hate--our civil liberties, our \nindividual and religious freedoms. These ideals, far more than our \nmilitary power, are our country's greatest strength. Let us not lose \nsight of the fact that acts of terrorism are human rights atrocities. \nAs we go forward, we must continue to show the world what sets us apart \nfrom the terrorists. Defense of human rights is one of these cherished \nprinciples.\n\n  There can be no excuse, no justification whatsoever, for attacks \nagainst unarmed civilians--whether it is the suicide bomber or the \nsuicide highjacker, or a government that commits acts of terrorism \nagainst its own citizens.\n  But to reduce the threat of terrorism, of whatever form, over the \nlong run, we must work to resolve the issues that foster deep and \nlasting hatreds the terrorists feed on, that produces their funding, \nand their recruits.\n  Recently, the House of Representatives approved, after minimal debate \nand without a dissenting vote, payment of $582 million in arrears to \nthe United Nations. That was both noteworthy and encouraging, since \nthose funds had been held hostage by the House for years over unrelated \nissues like international family planning. How shortsighted that was.\n  Many of those same Members took pride in cutting our foreign aid \nbudget. Foreign aid, a meager one percent of the Federal budget--far, \nfar less than most people believe it is-- is used, in part, to help \nalleviate the pervasive poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia \nthat leads to despair, instability, violence, and hatred--conditions \nthat breed recruits for terrorist organizations.\n  Instead of one percent, we should increase five-fold the amount we \nspend to combat poverty, especially in parts of the world where there \nis such resentment toward the United States.\n  We are surrounded by a sea of desperate people. Two billion people--a \nthird of the world's inhabitants, live on the edge of starvation. They \nbarely survive on what scraps they can scavenge, and many children die \nbefore the age of five.\n  Refugees and people displaced from their homes, number in the many \ntens of millions.\n  The world is on fire is too many places to count, and at most of \nthose flash points poverty, and the injustice that perpetuates it, are \nat the root of the instability.\n  Our foreign assistance programs provide economic support to poor \ncountries, health care to the world's neediest women and children, food \nand shelter for refugees and victims of natural and man made disasters, \nand technical expertise to promote democracy, free markets, human \nrights and the rule of law.\n  But as important as this aid is, the amount we give is a pittance, \nwhen considered in terms of our wealth and the seriousness of the \nthreats we face. The approximately $10 billion that we provide in this \ntype of assistance--whether through our State Department and the Agency \nfor International Development, or as contributions to the World Bank, \nthe United Nations Development Program, the World Food Program, and \nother organizations, amounts to less than $40 for each American each \nyear.\n  Forty dollars. It is embarrassing. We are failing the American \npeople, and we are failing future generations.\n  Our economy is suffering, and people are hurting in this country. We \nare trying to help them, and we need to do more. But we cannot continue \nto bury our heads in the sand. We cannot protect our national interests \nin today's complex, dangerous world on a foreign assistance budget that \nin real terms is less than what it was 15 years ago. We cannot.\n  Our world is not simply our towns, our states, our country. It is the \nwhole world. We live in a global economy. The Ebola virus is like a \nterrorist--an airplane's flight away. We can try our best to control \nour borders, but we cannot hide behind an impenetrable wall.\n  We have to go to the source of the problem, and that is to countries \nthat are failing--from AIDS, from ignorance, from poverty, from \ninjustice.\n  We need a better understanding of the world we live in, and how to \nprotect our security. Almost 60 percent of the world's people live in \nAsia, and that number is growing. Seventy percent of the world's people \nare non-White, and 70 percent are non-Christian. About 5 percent own \nmore than half the world's wealth. Half the world's people suffer from \nmalnutrition. Seventy percent are illiterate.\n\n  How can we justify spending so little to address these needs? We \ncannot, any more than we can justify failing to anticipate and prevent \nthe attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The Pentagon \nwould be the first to say that they cannot solve these problems.\n  I would hope that one of the positive things that comes from this \ntime of national soul searching and recovery, is that we begin to think \ndifferently about what the future holds, and our role in the world.\n  Let us act like a superpower. Let us lead the world in combating \npoverty, in supporting the development of democracy. Let us start \npaying our share. As the world's wealthiest nation we have a moral \nresponsibility. But we also, because of who we are, have the most at \nstake. Like the Congress, the White House also needs to change its \nthinking. For the past six months, it took a hands-off approach to \nsolving complex global problems, turning its back on half a dozen \ntreaties and international agreements, ranging from arms control to \nprotecting the environment. The unmistakable message is that we are so \npowerful that we do not need the rest of the world, that somehow we are \nimmune from the world's problems.\n  That notion was arrogant, dangerous and naive then, as it is today. \nWe must move beyond the tired battles over foreign aid and the United \nNations, and forge common approaches to global threats. It is clear \nthat this is what is necessary to fight terrorism, and the same is true \nof AIDS, global warming, and so many other problems.\n  This brings me to the difficult question of the Middle East conflict. \nNo one who is familiar with the history of the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict believes it will be resolved without the active, sustained \ninvolvement of the United States. And never has that involvement been \nso urgently needed, because to maintain strong Arab participation in \nthe coalition we are organizing against terrorism, there must be \nvisible progress toward peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\n  Frankly, I have been dismayed as our credibility in the Middle East \nhas badly eroded, and as resentment toward the United States has \nintensified and spread among Muslims throughout that region. We have to \nconfront this problem earnestly and honestly, and recognize its \nhistorical and cultural roots. It is clearly in our security interests, \nas well as those of Israel, that we take actions to reestablish \ncredibility with the Palestinians and their Arab supporters, while \ncontinuing to keep faith with Israel and its people--a valued ally and \na leading democracy.\n  We must get both Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating \ntable, working seriously toward a viable peace agreement that addresses \ntheir long term needs and aspirations--a viable, Palestinian state, and \nlasting security for Israel.\n  I do not count myself among those who believe that the deranged, \nhate-filled perpetrators of the September 11th terrorist attacks would \nnot have carried out their heinous crimes if Israel and the \nPalestinians had already made peace. It may be that sympathy\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\nfor the Palestinians had nothing to do with it.\n  Nor do I believe that a solution to the Middle East conflict will \nsolve the problem of international terrorism. But I am convinced that, \nas difficult a problem as it is, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict must \nbe solved if we are to make tangible progress against some of the \nbreeding grounds of terrorism.\n  The same goes for our relations with the rest of the Arab world. In \nour single-minded zeal to secure a steady supply of Middle East oil to \nfuel our insatiable and growing demand for cheap gasoline, we have \nturned a blind eye to widespread repression by governments whose \npolicies, including the systematic abuse of women, vary sharply from \nour own. We must take dramatic measures to reduce our wasteful \nconsumption of oil and our dependence on these regimes.\n  At the same time that we combat terrorism around the world, we must \nalso get our domestic house in order.\n  Over the last decade this country has put an enormous effort into \ncounter-terrorism. It has been a top priority of the FBI, the CIA and \nother agencies. Yet, all those resources and all that concentrated work \nfailed to prevent this enormous tragedy. It is astounding how \nunprepared we were, how even the simplest safeguards were ignored, how \nmany weaknesses were waiting for the terrorists to exploit. It was a \nmassive failure of our defenses.\n\n  Let us look hard and honestly at where our defenses failed, and work \nto correct those weaknesses. We need to strengthen our intelligence \nagencies, law enforcement, border control, emergency response and all \nthe manifold capabilities we will need to defend ourselves. That \nincludes taking steps to eliminate the destructive competition between \nthese agencies, which has impeded coordination and undermined their \neffectiveness.\n  We have worked with the Administration on legislation to support law \nenforcement and our intelligence community, while at the same time \nprotecting our constitutional freedoms. As Benjamin Franklin said, ``a \npeople who would trade their liberty for security deserve neither.'' As \nwe work to become more secure, we must also protect our liberty.\n  I am concerned about press reports of people held in custody for \nweeks, who have not been charged with any crime, being denied \nmeaningful access to counsel. This, if true, may be a common practice \nin some countries, but it should not be the practice in ours.\n  I am also concerned about the erroneous assertion that the Congress \nhas tied the CIA's hands by limiting its ability to recruit informants \nwith unsavory backgrounds. There is no such law. In fact, the only \nconstraint is the CIA's own internal guidelines, which require prior \napproval of senior management before recruiting such an asset. There \nare sound reasons for those guidelines, and the CIA leadership has said \nrepeatedly that this is not a problem.\n  Even more disturbing are claims that we need to change the ``law'' \nprohibiting assassinations of individuals involved in terrorism. Again, \nthere is no such law. There is an Executive Order, first signed by \nPresident Ford and reaffirmed each year since then by every succeeding \nAdministration that prohibits assassinations. No law, or executive \norder for that matter, protects Osama bin Laden or any other terrorist \nfrom the exercise of our legitimate right of self-defense, including \nuse of lethal force.\n  A policy of pre-emptive assassinations would be morally repugnant, a \nviolation of international law, and fraught with dangers for our own \ngovernment, as well as for our allies. It is also ineffective, because \nit creates martyrs whose deaths become a terrorist's rallying cry for \nvengeance. And we have seen how easily foreign identities can be \nmistaken or stolen, with potentially irreversible, tragic consequences.\n  Our country has suffered a grievous loss. We have had to face our own \nvulnerability as never before. As we support the victims' families and \nset about to prevent future terrorist attacks, we should also \nrededicate ourselves to upholding the principles which set our nation \napart: freedom, tolerance, diversity, respect for the rule of law, and \nthe unique value of every individual. If our leaders appeal to these \nvalues--to the better angels of our human nature, not to the instincts \nof hate or fear or revenge--then this trial by fire will refine us, \ninstead of coarsen us.\n  And let us go forward from this experience, which has shown in such a \ntragic way how connected we are to the rest of the world and how much \nwe need the support of other countries, to provide stronger leadership \nnot only to combat the scourge of international terrorism but other \nurgent global problems, and make this world a better and safer place \nfor all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11359-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11359-S11360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UTAH TASK FORCE ONE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the Salt \nLake Urban Search and Rescue Team, also called Utah Task Force One, \nUTTF-1 . The outstanding men and women of the Task Force were called \nupon to serve their nation when 62 members made the grim trip to New \nYork City on September 18, 2001, to search for survivors and bodies in \nthe World Trade Center rubble. The Salt Lake County Fire Department, \nthe Salt Lake City Fire Department, and the Rocky Mountain Rescue Dogs \nmade up this response force. UTTF-1 is one of only 28 task force teams \nnationwide participating in the National USAR, Urban Search and Rescue, \nResponse System.\n  UTTF-1 deployed to New York with specialized firefighters, search \ndogs and handlers, two physicians and structural engineers. The team \nspent 9 days working 12-hour shifts in intolerable conditions and under \ntremendous strain. They experienced things that would turn lesser men \nand women to despair. Yet these brave individuals soldiered on without \ncomplaint or regard for themselves. In essence, they got the job done.\n  We cannot even begin to imagine the tasks they were asked to perform, \nbut we can give our humble thanks for their determination and courage. \nThe frustration they shared in finding no one alive and the grief they \nfelt as they recovered the bodies of many victims of the terrorist \nattack--including a New York City firefighter--are beyond words. They \nfaced the incredible devastation and unspeakable smell with the \ncharacter and composure of real heroes.\n  And we must not forget the families and friends of the task force \nmembers. They carried the burden of seeing their loved ones go into a \nsituation that was not only physically dangerous but also emotionally \nunsettling. These families and friends were also the ones to welcome \nhome the team and comfort them in the aftermath of what was a horrific \nand heartbreaking experience.\n  Lastly, we give thanks to the rescue dogs who worked so hard and \nshared the same dangers and frustrations as their handlers. I believe a \nsign at a U.S. Public Health Service veterinary clinic serving the \nrescue dogs during the New York disaster said it best, ``For man's best \nfriend, who is fighting men's worst enemy. God bless you.''\n  The members of Utah Task Force One reflect all that is great about \nAmerica. They are strong; they are brave; and they are resilient. I \ntake exceptional pride in submitting each one of their names to be \nrecorded in the Congressional Record for posterity.

Mr. President, Bessie Anderson Stanley once wrote:\n\n       He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often \n     and loved much; who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the \n     respect of intelligent men and the love of little children; \n     who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; who has \n     left the world better than he found it, whether an improved \n     poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul; who has always \n     looked for the best in others and given them the best he had; \n     whose life was an inspiration; whose memory a benediction.\n\n  These words aptly describe our friend, John Erickson, former \nadministrative assistant to the late Senator J. William Fulbright of \nArkansas and Director of Governmental Affairs for Ford Motor Company's \nSoutheast Region. John died a few weeks ago at the age of 81, leaving \nbehind a legacy that will long be remembered by those of us who knew \nhim.\n  I first met John in 1975 at the beginning of my first of four terms \nas Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. John came by to see me and I \nimmediately knew that he was a special person. Our friendship carried \nover to my terms as Governor and until his death in Winter Park, FL, on \nSeptember 3.\n  John was a native of Roger, AR, where he began a political career \nthat endeared him to U.S. Senators, Congressmen, and Presidents, and to \neveryone who knew him.\n  His first experience in politics and public service began when he was \na student at the University of Arkansas as Secretary to the late \nCongressman Clyde Ellis, who represented Arkansas' Third Congressional \nDistrict. When Congressman John McClellan defeated Ellis for a seat in \nthe U.S. Senate, John was asked to become secretary to Ellis' \nsuccessor, J. William Fulbright.\n  When John accepted Fulbright's offer, it began a partnership that \nlasted for more than two decades. John Erickson engineered Fulbright's \nelection to the U.S. Senate in a highly contested race that included \nformer Senator and the first woman elected to serve in the Senate, \nHattie Carraway. Also in the race was Arkansas' sitting Governor, Homer \nAtkins. Fulbright won the race, bringing national attention to both the \nnew Senator and to the skills of John Erickson.\n  He served Senator Fulbright well and while building a reputation \namong his peers as a hard-working, politically savvy staff member whose \ndevotion to his boss was exceeded only by his love for, and dedication \nto, his wife and family.\n  John had a wonderful family. He married his childhood sweetheart, \nSara Louise Glenn, with whom he enjoyed 53 years of companionship \nbefore her death in 1998.

In the \nnational elections of 1952 and 1956, John took leave from Senator \nFulbright's staff to work in the campaigns of Illinois Governor Adlai \nStevenson, the Democratic nominee for President.

While there, he served on the committee \nthat planned the funeral services for former President Harry Truman. He \nmoved to Atlanta in 1970 from where he worked with State and national \nofficials on such issues as seat belt laws, highway safety and other \nlegislative matters.\n  John Erickson's life and his death touched the lives of all of those \nwith whom he was associated.\n  The poet Longfellow expressed it well when he wrote:\n\n     Lives of great men all remind us,\n     We can make our lives sublime,\n     And departing, leave behind us,\n     Footprints in the sands of time.\n\n     Footprints, that perhaps another,\n     Sailing o'er life's solemn main,\n     A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\n     Seeing, shall take heart again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11361-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SHELDON PARKER\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Sudan emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond November 3, 2001, to the Federal Register for \npublication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on November 2, 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. \n66163).\n  The crisis between the United States and Sudan constituted by the \nactions and policies of the Government of Sudan, including continuing \nconcern about its record on terrorism and the prevalence of human \nrights violations, including slavery, restrictions on religious \nfreedom, and restrictions on political freedom, that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on November 3, 1997, has not been \nresolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and \npose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared with respect to Sudan and maintain in force the comprehensive \nsanctions against Sudan to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility of \ndesig-\nnating the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail extending through \nwestern Massachusetts and central Connecticut as a national historic \ntrail; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill along with \nmy senior Senator, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, to amend the \nNational Trails System Act to conduct a study on the feasibility of \ndesignating the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail extending through \nwestern Massachusetts and central Connecticut as a national historic \ntrail.\n  The National Trails System was created in 1968 to provide outdoor \nrecreation and to conserve the scenic, historic, natural, and cultural \nqualities of the areas through which trails more than 100 miles long \npass. Trails provide opportunities for outdoor recreation to citizens \nin Massachusetts and around the country. People enjoy bicycling, cross-\ncountry skiing, day hiking, jogging, camping, and long-distance \nbackpacking. In addition, National Scenic Trails promote tourism and \nfoster economic development. National trails\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\ncan only be authorized and designated by Acts of Congress.\n  The Metacomet-Monadnock-Matta-\nbesett Trail plays an important role in land protection and wildlife \nhabitat preservation. It is a system of trails and potential trails \nextending southward approximately 180 miles from the Metacomet-\nMonadnock Trail in western Massachusetts, across central Connecticut on \nthe Metacomet Trail and the Mattabesett Trail, and ending at Long \nIsland Sound. Dozens of waterfalls, natural areas, and wildlife viewing \nspots can be found along the route. There are dramatic traprock ledges \nand summits that provide tremendous views of the Connecticut River \nValley. At a time when the Northeast corridor is faced with \noverdevelopment, designating the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett as a \nnational trail would help protect it, facilitate better planning for \npower lines, pipelines, and roads, and help maintain natural habitats \nthrough the financial and technological assistance of the National Park \nService, nonprofit organizations, and local volunteers.\n  I would like to share a few of the comments from organizations in \nMassachusetts and Connecticut that support this legislation. Peter \nWestover, the conservation director for the town of Amherst, wrote to \nexpress strong support for the trail. He is confident that there will \nbe widespread support among trail managers and trail users throughout \nthe region. Both Durand, the Massachusetts Secretary of Environmental \nAffairs, wrote that the Metacomet-Monadnock portion of the trail is an \nimportant recreational, scenic, and historic resource that could be \nsignificantly enhanced by this project. The Massachusetts director of \nthe Nature Conservancy, Wayne Klockner, expressed his strong support \nfor the trail, writing that he supports the benefits that designation \ncan bring to a fragile area and that he looks forward to increased land \nprotection, funding and technical expertise. From Connecticut, Leslie \nKane, chairman of the Guilford Land Acquisition Committee, supports the \ntrail because it will preserve Connecticut's natural heritage for all \npeople to enjoy. These comments represent only a handful of the letters \nof support that my colleagues and I have received.\n  Establishing a new national scenic trail is typically a four-step \nprocess, which, on average, can take 10 years to complete. In 10 years, \ngiven the rapid development in the Northeast, entire landscapes and \nhabitats can change and become endangered. The first step in the \nprocess to establish a new national trail is amending the National \nTrails System Act to allow for a feasibility study. Senator Kennedy and \nI are asking today that we take that first step and get started \nprotecting the natural heritage of this small part of New England.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1611. A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of \nintellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court issued \na pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with respect to \nintellectual property. I am referring to the Florida Prepaid and \nCollege Savings Bank cases. The Court ruled in these cases that States \nand their institutions cannot be held liable for patent infringement \nand other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even \nthough they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for \nthemselves.\n  About 4 months after the Court ruled in these cases, I introduced a \nbill that responded to the Court's decisions. The Intellectual Property \nRestoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore Federal remedies for \nviolations of intellectual property rights by States.\n  I regret that the Senate Judiciary Committee did not consider my \nlegislation during the last Congress, and that the Senate has yet to \ngive any attention to the nearly 2-year-old Supreme Court decisions \nthat opened such a troubling loophole in our Federal intellectual \nproperty laws. We should delay no further.\n  Today, I am introducing the Intellectual Property Protection \nRestoration Act of 2001, IPPRA. This legislation builds on my earlier \nproposal and on the helpful comments I received on that proposal from \nlegal experts across the country. In particular, I would like to thank \nJustin Hughes, David Carson, Steve Tepp, Michael Kirk, Michael Klipper, \nand John Kent for their assistance in improving and refining this \nlegislation. I also want to thank the House sponsors of the counterpart \nbill, Howard Coble and Howard Berman, who are the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual \nProperty.\n  The IPPRA has two essential components. First, it places States on an \nequal footing with private parties by eliminating any damages remedy \nfor infringement of State-owned intellectual property unless the State \nhas waived its immunity in Federal suits for infringement of privately \nowned intellectual property. Second, it improves the limited remedies \nthat are available to enforce a nonwaiving State's obligations under \nFederal law and the United States Constitution. I will discuss both \nprovisions in more detail later in these remarks.\n  Innovation and creativity have been the fuel of our national economic \nboom over the past decade. The United States now leads the world in \ncomputing, communications and biotechnologies, and American authors and \nbrand names are recognized across the globe.\n  Our national prosperity is, first and foremost, a tribute to American \ningenuity. But it is also a tribute to the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers, who made the promotion of what they called ``Science and the \nUseful Arts'' a national project, which they constitutionally assigned \nto Congress. And it is no less of a tribute to the successive \nCongresses and administrations of both parties who have striven to \nprovide real incentives and rewards for innovation and creativity by \nproviding strong and even-handed protection to intellectual property \nrights. Congress passed the first Federal patent law in 1790, and the \nU.S. Government issued its first patent the same year, to Samuel \nHopkins of my home State of Vermont. The first Federal copyright law \nwas also enacted in 1790, and the first Federal trademark laws date \nback to the 1870s.\n  The Supreme Court has long recognized that intellectual property \nrights bear the hallmark of true constitutional property rights, the \nright of exclusion against the world, and are therefore protection \nagainst appropriation both by individuals and by government. Consistent \nwith this understanding of intellectual property, Congress has long \nensured that the rights secured by the Federal intellectual property \nlaws were enforceable against the Federal Government by waiving the \ngovernment's immunity in suits alleging infringements of those rights.\n  No doubt Congress would have legislated similarly with respect to \ninfringements by State entities and bureaucrats had there been any \ndoubt that they were already fully subject to Federal intellectual \nproperty laws. But there was no doubt. States had long enjoyed the \nbenefits of the intellectual property laws on an equal footing with \nprivate parties.\n  By the same token, and in accordance with the fundamental principles \nof equity on which our intellectual property laws are founded, the \nStates bore the burdens of the intellectual property laws, being liable \nfor infringements just like private parties. States were free to join \nintellectual property markets as participants, or to hold back from \ncommerce and limit themselves to a narrower governmental role. The \nintellectual property right of exclusion meant what it said and was \nenforced even-handedly for public and private entities alike.\n  This harmonious state of affairs ended in 1985, with the Supreme \nCourt's announcement of the so-called ``clear statement'' rule in \nAtascadero State Hospital versus Scanlon. The Court in Atascadero held \nthat Congress must express its intention to abrogate the States' 11th \nAmendment immunity ``in unmistakable language in the statute itself.'' \nA few years later in Pennsylvania versus Union Gas Co., the Supreme \nCourt assured us that if the intent to abrogate were expressed clearly \nenough, it would be honored.\n  Following Atascadero, some courts held that States and State entities \nand\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\nofficials could escape liability for patent, copyright and trademark \ninfringement because the patent, copyright and trademark laws lacked \nthe clear statement of congressional intent that was now necessary to \nabrogate State sovereign immunity.\n\n  To close this new loophole in the law, Congress promptly did \nprecisely what the Supreme Court had told us was necessary. In 1990 and \n1992, Congress passed three laws--the Patent and Plant Variety \nProtection Remedy Clarification Act, the Copyright Remedy Clarification \nAct, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Acts. The sole purpose of \nthe Clarification Acts was to make it absolutely, unambiguously, 100 \npercent clear that Congress intended the patent, copyright and \ntrademark laws to apply to everyone, including the States, and that \nCongress did not intend the States to be immune from liability for \nmoney damages. Each of the three Clarification Acts passed unanimously.\n  In 1996, however, by a five-to-four-vote, the Supreme Court in \nSeminole Tribe of Florida versus Florida reversed its earlier decision \nin Union Gas and held that Congress lacked authority under article I of \nthe Constitution to abrogate the States' 11th amendment immunity from \nsuit in Federal court.\n  Then, on June 23, 1999, by the same bare majority, the Supreme Court \nin Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board versus College \nSavings Bank told us that it did not really mean what it said in \nAtascadero and invalidated the Patent and Plant Variety Protection \nRemedy Clarification Act. In the companion case decided on the same \nday, College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid Postsecondary \nEducation Expense Board, the same five Justices held that the Trademark \nRemedy Clarification Act also failed to abrogate State sovereign \nimmunity.\n  The Florida Prepaid decisions have been the subject of bipartisan \ncriticism. In a floor statement on July 1, 1999, I highlighted the \nanti-democratic implications of the approach of the activist majority \nof the Supreme Court, who have left constitutional text behind, ripped \nup precedent, and treated Congress with less respect than that due to \nan administrative agency in their haste to impose their natural law \nnotions of sovereignty as a barrier to democratic regulation. I also \nnoted that ``the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences \nabout how * * * intellectual property rights may be protected against \neven egregious infringements and violations by the states.''\n  One of my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSpecter, expressed similar concerns in a floor statement on August 5, \n1999. He noted that the Court decisions ``leave us with an absurd and \nuntenable state of affairs,'' where ``states will enjoy an enormous \nadvantage over their private sector competitors.''\n  Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor \nGeneral during the Reagan administration, has called the Florida \nPrepaid decisions ``truly bizarre.'' He observed in an op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times:\n\n       [The Court's decisions] did not question that states are \n     subject to the patent and trademark laws of the United \n     States. It's just that when a state violates those laws--as \n     when it uses a patented invention without permission and \n     without paying for it--the patent holder cannot sue the state \n     for infringement. So a state hospital can manufacture \n     medicines patented by others and sell or use them, and state \n     schools and universities can pirate textbooks and software, \n     and the victims cannot sue for infringement.\n       It is hard to see what sense this makes, and the claim that \n     ``the Constitution made me do it'' is particularly \n     unconvincing. The 11th Amendment does protect states from \n     suits in Federal courts by residents of other states--a \n     provision almost certainly not intended to protect states \n     from suits based on Federal law.\n\n  Not surprisingly, alarm has also been expressed in the business \ncommunity about the potential of the Court's recent decisions to harm \nintellectual property owners in a wide variety of ways. A commentary in \nBusiness Week offered these cautions:\n\n       Watch out if you publish software that someone at a state \n     university wants to copy for free . . . Watch out if you own \n     a patent on a medical procedure that some doctor in a state \n     medical school wants to use. Watch out if you've invested \n     heavily in a great trademark, like Nike's Swoosh, and a \n     bureaucrat decides his state program would be wildly promoted \n     if it used the same mark.\n\n  I believe that these concerns are real. As Congress acknowledged when \nit waived Federal sovereign immunity in this area, it would be naive to \nimagine that reliance on the commercial decency of the government and \nits myriad agencies and officials would provide the security needed to \npromote investment in research and development and to facilitate \nnegotiation in the exclusive licensing arrangements that are often \nnecessary to bring valuable products and creations to market. Indeed, \nthe good intentions of government may be beside the point, if \nbusinesses are unwilling to enter into agreements because one side \ncannot be bound by the law.\n  Since the Court issued its decisions in June 1999, intellectual \nproperty scholars and practitioners across the country have come \ntogether to explore ways for Congress to restore protection for federal \nintellectual property rights as against the States. The Patent and \nTrademark Office hosted a particularly enlightening conference in March \n2000, in cooperation with the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation and the Intellectual Property Section of the American Bar \nAssociation. I commend the PTO for taking the initiative on this \nimportant issue.\n  More recently, in September 2001, the General Accounting Office \nreleased a report requested by Senator Orrin Hatch on State Immunity in \nInfringement Actions. The GAO's research confirmed that, after Florida \nPrepaid, owners of intellectual property have few alternatives or \nremedies available against State infringements. A State cannot be sued \nin Federal court for damages except in the unlikely event that it \nwaives its sovereign immunity. As for the State courts, there is little \nchance of success with infringement-type a actions for patents and \ncopyrights because of Federal judicial preemption and an absence of \nState-recognized causes of action. Furthermore, even if infringement \nsuits can be brought in State court, it may not be possible to bring \nthem against States that have governmental immunity shielding them from \nsuit in their own courts.\n\n  What I have just described is a series of dead ends for intellectual \nproperty owners. That is why the two Federal agencies with expertise in \nintellectual property matters, the U.S. Copyright Office and the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office, have expressed their support for \ncorrective legislation by Congress. As the Copyrights Office told the \nGAO, ``Only in this way can the proper balance, and basic fairness, be \nrestored.''\n  I hope we can all agree on the need for congressional action on this \nissue. We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our \nforeign trading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual \nproperty becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. \nintellectual property rights are backed by legal remedies.\n  This is important as a matter of economics: Our national economy \ndepends on real and effective intellectual property rights. It is also \nimportant as a matter of justice: In conceding that the States are \nconstitutionally bound to respect Federal intellectual property rights \nbut invalidating the remedies Congress has created to enforce those \nrights, the Court has jeopardized one of the basic principles that \ndistinguishes our Constitution from the constitution of the old Soviet \nUnion, the principle that where there is a right, there must also be a \nremedy.\n  It is also important as a matter of foreign relations: American \ntrading interests have been well served by our strong and consistent \nadvocacy of effective intellectual property protections in treaty \nnegotiations and other international fora, and those efforts could be \njeopardized by the loophole in U.S. intellectual property enforcement \nthat the Supreme Court has created.\n  Like most of the constitutional experts who have examined the issue, \nI have no doubt that several constitutional mechanisms remain open to \nCongress to restore substantial protection for patents, copyrights and \ntrademarks. The Supreme Court's hypertechnical constitutional \ninterpretations require us to jump through some technical hoops of our \nown, but that the exercise is now not merely worthwhile, but essential \nto safeguard both U.S. prosperity and the continued authority of \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\n  My bill is based on a simple premise: That there is no inherent, \n``natural law'' entitlement to Federal intellectual property rights and \nremedies. In discussing the policies underlying the intellectual \nproperty laws, the Supreme Court has emphasized that intellectual \nproperty is not a right but a privilege, and that it is conditioned by \na public purpose. For example, the Court wrote in Mercoid Corp. versus \nMid-Continent Invest Co., a 1944 case, that ``The grant of a patent is \nthe grant of a special privilege `to promote the Progress of Science \nand useful Arts,' '' and that ``It is the public interest which is \ndominant in the patent system.'' Similarly, in discussing the copyright \nlaws in Fogerty versus Fantasy, Inc, the Court underscored that ``the \nmonopoly privileges that Congress has authorized, while intended to \nmotivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the \nprovision of a special reward, are limited in nature and must \nultimately serve the public good.''\n\n  The Constitution empowers but does not require Congress to make \nintellectual property rights and remedies available, and Congress \nshould do so in a manner that encourages and protects innovation in the \npublic and private sector alike.\n  States and their institutions, especially State Universities, benefit \nhugely from the Federal intellectual property laws. All 50 States own \nor have obtained patents, some hold many hundreds of patents. States \nalso hold other intellectual property rights secured by Federal law, \nand the trend is toward increased participation by the States in \ncommerce involving intellectual property.\n  Principles of State sovereignty tell us that States and their \ninstrumentalities are entitled to a free and informed choice of whether \nor not to participate in the Federal intellectual property system, \nsubject only to their constitutional obligations.\n  Equity and common sense tell us that one who chooses to enjoy the \nbenefits of a law, whether it be a Federal research grant or the \nmultimillion-dollar benefits of Federal intellectual property \nprotections, should also bear its burdens.\n  Sound economics and traditional notions of federalism tell us that it \nis appropriate for the Federal Government to assist and encourage the \nsovereign States in their sponsorship of whatever innovation and \ncreation they freely choose to sponsor by giving them intellectual \nproperty protection and, on occasion, funding, so long as the States \nhold up their end of the bargain by honoring the exclusive rights of \nother intellectual property owners.\n  The IPPRA builds on these principles. In order to promote cooperative \nfederalism in the intellectual property arena, it provides reasonable \nincentives for states to waive their immunity in intellectual property \ncases and participate in our national intellectual property project on \nequal terms with private parties. States that choose not to waive their \nimmunity within 2 years after enactment of the IPPRA would continue to \nenjoy many of the benefits of the Federal intellectual property system; \nhowever, like private parties that sue non-waiving states for \ninfringement, nonwaiving States that sue private parties for \ninfringement could not recover any money damages that would otherwise \nbe available under Federal law. That is because Federal intellectual \nproperty that has been owned by a nonwaiving State would be short one \n``stick'' from the usual bundle of rights accorded by Federal law: The \nability to sue for damages under Federal law when the intellectual \nproperty has been infringed.\n  This scheme is plainly authorized by the letter of the Constitution. \nArticle I empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress of Science and \nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \nexclusive right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' \nIncident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt \nof exclusive intellectual property rights. Indeed, we have always \nattached certain conditions, such as the requirement of public \ndisclosure of an invention at the Patent and Trademark Office in order \nto obtain a patent.\n  My proposal is also consistent with the spirit of federalism, as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, because it gives State entities a \nfree, informed and meaningful choice to waive or not to waive immunity \nat any time. The condition imposed on receipt of federal benefits by \nthe IPPRA, submitting to suit under laws that are already binding on \nthe States, is not onerous, nor does it co-opt any state resources to \nthe service of Federal policy. It simply levels the intellectual \nproperty playing field.\n  Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of Federal \nintellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual \nproperty power just as Congress may attach conditions on a State's \nreceipt of Federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either \nway, the power to attach conditions to the Federal benefit is an \nintegral part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. \nEither way, the State has a choice, to forgo the Federal benefit and \nexercise its sovereign power however it wishes subject to the \nConstitution, or to take the benefit and exercise its sovereign power \nin the manner requested by Congress.\n  Three Federal appeals courts have applied similar reasoning in \nconnection with the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Courts of Appeals \nfor the Fifth, Seventh, Tenth Circuits have reasoned that, because \nCongress was under no obligation to allow States to participate in the \nregulatory scheme established by the 1996 Act, Congress could validly \ncondition a state commission's decision to exercise regulatory \nauthority under the Act on its waiving sovereign immunity.\n  This seems like plain common sense to me. It would be a truly bizarre \nreading of the Constitution to say that it is up to Congress whether or \nnot to let States participate in telecom regulation or in the \nintellectual property regime, but that if we choose to let them \nparticipate, we cannot hold them accountable for their actions.\n  Given the choice between opting in to the intellectual property laws \nand forging some intellectual property protection under the Federal \nlaws, States and their institutions will, I hope, choose to opt in. The \nbenefit--being able to recover damages for an infringement--is \nsignificant, while the burden--consenting to be sued for future State \ninfringements--is slight. Most States already respect intellectual \nproperty rights and will seldom find themselves in infringement suits.\n  However, some State entities and officials have violated intellectual \nproperty rights in the past, and the massive growth of both \nintellectual property and state participation in the \nintellectual property marketplace that we are seeing in the new economy \ngive ample cause for concern that such violations will continue. Now \nthat the Supreme Court has seemingly given the States carte blanche to \nviolate intellectual property rights free from any adverse financial \nconsequences so long as they stand on their newly augmented sovereign \nimmunity, the prospect of States violating Federal law and then \nasserting immunity is too serious to ignore.\n\n  The IPPRA therefore also provides for the limited set of remedies \nthat the Supreme Court's new jurisprudence leaves available to Congress \nto enforce a nonwaiving State's obligations under Federal law and the \nUnited States Constitution. The key point here is that, while the Court \nstruck down our prior effort to enforce the intellectual property laws \nthemselves by authorizing actions for damages against the states, it \nnonetheless acknowledged Congress' power to authorize actions for \ninjunctions and actions to enforce constitutional rights related to \nintellectual property.\n  First, for the avoidance of doubt, the IPPRA ensures the full \navailability of prospective equitable relief to prevent States from \nviolating or exceeding their rights under Federal intellectual property \nlaws. As the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in its Seminole Tribe \ndecision in 1996, such relief is available, notwithstanding any \nassertion of State sovereign immunity, under what is generally known as \nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young.\n  Second, to address the harm done to the rights of intellectual \nproperty owners before they can secure an injunction, the IPPRA also \nprovides a damages remedy to the full extent of Congress' power to \nenforce the constitutional rights of intellectual property owners. \nUnder the Supreme Court's recent decisions, this remedy is necessarily \nlimited to the redress of constitutional violations, not violations of\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\nthe Federal intellectual property laws themselves. However, the Supreme \nCourt has reaffirmed on may occasions that the intellectual property \nowner's right of exclusion is a property right fully protected from \ngovernmental violation under the Fifth amendment's takings clause and \nunder the 14th amendment's due process clause.\n  The constitutional remedy provided by the IPPRA closely resembles the \nremedy that Congress provided decades ago for deprivations of Federal \nrights by persons acting under color of State law. The bill does not \nexpand the property rights secured by the Federal intellectual property \nlaws--these laws are already binding on the States' nor does the bill \ninterfere with any governmental authority to regulate businesses that \nown such rights. It simply restores the ability of private persons to \nenforce such rights against the States.\n  I view this bill as an exercise in cooperative federalism. Clear, \ncertain, and uniform national rules protecting Federal intellectual \nproperty rights benefit everyone: Consumers, businesses, the Federal \nGovernment and the States. The IPPRA preserves States' rights, and \ngives States a free choice. At the same time, it ensures effective \nprotection for individual constitutional rights closing the loophole \ncreated by the Supreme Court of Federal rights unsupported by effective \nremedies. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation in the early \n1990s, but were thwarted by Supreme Court's shifting jurisprudence. The \nIPPRA is designed to restore the benefits we sought to provide \nintellectual property owners while meeting the Court's new \njurisprudential requirements.\n\n  There are to be sure, other approaches that Congress could take to \naddress the problems created by the Court's decisions. In consultation \nwith experts in intellectual property law and constitutional law, I \nreviewed several alternatives before settling on the IPPRA's approach. \nIn the end, I concluded that the approach I have outlined is the best \nway to achieve a solution that meets any constitutional concerns, \nfosters State-Federal cooperation, and encourages American innovation \nand creativity to providing certain and effective intellectual property \nprotection.\n  when I first introduced the IPPRA in 1999, it prompted a flurry of \nconstructive comments and suggestions on how the legislation could be \nimproved. I look forward to considering further refinements to the bill \nas the legislative process moves forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     Court's decisions give states an unfair advantage in the \n     intellectual property marketplace by shielding them from \n     money damages when they infringe the rights of private \n     parties, while leaving them free to obtain money damages when \n     their own rights are infringed. These decisions also have the \n     potential to impair the rights of private intellectual \n     property owners, discourage technological innovation and \n     artistic creation, and compromise the ability of the United \n     States to fulfill its obligations under a variety of \n     international treaties. The Intellectual Property Protection \n     Restoration Act of 2001 creates reasonable incentives for \n     states to waive their immunity in intellectual property cases \n     and participate in the intellectual property marketplace on \n     equal terms with private parties. The bill also provides new \n     remedies for state infringements that rise to the level of \n     constitutional violations.\n       Sec. 1.

Intellectual property remedies equalization.--\n     Places states on an equal footing with private parties by \n     eliminating any damages remedy for infringement of state-\n     owned intellectual property unless the state has waived its \n     immunity from any damages remedy for infringement of \n     privately-owned intellectual property. Intellectual property \n     that the state owned before the enactment of this Act is not \n     affected.\n       Sec. 4. Clarification of remedies available for statutory \n     violations by state officers and employees.--Affirms the \n     availability of injunctive relief against state officials who \n     violate the federal intellectual property laws. Such relief \n     is authorized under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. \n     123 (1908), which held that an individual may sue a state \n     official for prospective relief requiring the state official \n     to cease violating federal law, even if the state itself is \n     immune from suit under the eleventh amendment. This section \n     also affirms that state officials may be personally liable \n     for violations of the intellectual property laws.\n       Sec. 5. Liability of states for constitutional violations \n     involving intellectual property.--Establishes a right to \n     compensation for state infringements of intellectual property \n     that rise to the level of constitutional violations. \n     Compensation shall be measured by the statutory remedies \n     available under the federal intellectual property laws, but \n     may not include treble damages.\n       Sec. 6.

A bill to provide Federal managers with tools and \nflexibility in areas such as personnel, budgeting, property management \nand disposal, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON:\n  S. 1613. A bill to provide for expedited congressional consideration \nof ``Freedom to Manage'' legislative proposals transmitted by the \nPresident to Congress to eliminate or reduce barriers to efficient \ngovernment operations that are posed by laws that apply to one or more \nagencies, including government-wide laws; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwas referred to Congress by President Bush. The legislation seeks to \nextensively reform management of the Federal Government. I applaud the \nAdministration's attention to the issue of government reform, and I \nwill work with my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee and \nin Congress to enact this important package, because it includes \ncomprehensive reforms that will make government work better.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has documented the problems \naffecting Executive Branch operations for some time, and I am impressed \nwith the President's attention to these issues at this critical time in \nour Nation's history. The President's package of management reform \nproposals will allow government managers to carry out their critical \nresponsibilities for the American public more effectively. It's obvious \nthe Administration understands how very important government\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\nreform is to ensuring that the government can accomplish its varied \nmissions.\n  The legislation, which includes the Freedom to Manage Act and the \nManagerial Flexibility Act, makes it easier for Executive Branch \nmanagement to increase accountability, reduce unnecessary costs, and \nmanage for results. The Managerial Flexibility Act will help the \ngovernment recruit and retain people with needed skills, increase the \nflexibility of federal property management, and allow agencies to \nbudget for results. The Freedom to Manage Act would allow other reform \nproposals, submitted to the Congress by the Administration, to be \nconsidered expeditiously by the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this important legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Freedom to Manage Reform Package--A Summary\n\n     Freedom to Manage Act of 2001\n       This legislation establishes a procedure under which heads \n     of departments and agencies can identify statutory barriers \n     to good management. Congress, in turn, would quickly consider \n     those obstacles and act to remove them.\n     Managerial Flexibility Act of 2001\n       This legislation provides federal managers with increased \n     flexibility in managing personnel; assigns agencies the \n     responsibility for funding the full government share of the \n     accruing cost of all retirement and retiree health care \n     benefits for Federal employees; and gives agencies greater \n     flexibility in managing property.\n       Reform Personnel Management. This proposal gives Federal \n     agencies and managers increased discretion and flexibility in \n     attracting, managing, and retaining a high quality workforce. \n     It empowers Federal agencies to determine when, if, and how \n     they might offer new employee incentives, and it enhances the \n     agencies' authority to use recruitment, retention, and \n     relocation bonuses to compete better with the private sector. \n     The bill permits agencies to develop alternative personnel \n     systems to attract and hire employees that best fit the \n     position, and it will enable managers to offer early \n     retirement packages. By enacting important changes to the \n     Senior Executive Service, this proposal also permits high-\n     level Federal managers to be treated more like their private \n     sector counterparts, by results-based performance standards \n     that hold them accountable.\n       Budgeting and Managing for Results.--Full Funding for \n     Federal Retiree Costs: This proposal charges Federal agencies \n     the full accruing cost of all retirement and retiree health \n     care benefits for Federal employees. This proposal is the \n     first government-wide step in linking the full cost of \n     resources used with the results achieved, which will make \n     management in the Executive Branch more performance-oriented. \n     This proposal will not change any of the benefits provided by \n     these programs, and will not change the level of employee \n     contributions.\n       Reform Federal Property Management.--The Federal Government \n     owns or controls more than 24 million acres of land and \n     facilities, but existing rules restrict the government's \n     ability to consolidate or release underperforming property. \n     In many instances, Federal agencies lack the incentives and \n     authority to renovate the property or tap its equity. This \n     proposal facilitates a total asset management approach to \n     Federal property issues by: improving life cycle planning and \n     management; allowing greater flexibility to optimize asset \n     performance; and providing incentives for better property \n     management. Modernizing these processes enhances government-\n     wide property management, bringing the practices federal \n     agencies use to manage their assets into the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n        Shelby, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lott, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Helms, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1614. A bill to provide for the preservation and restoration of \nhistoric buildings at historically women's public colleges or \nuniversities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I rise to re-introduce legislation \nto help preserve the heritage of eight historic women's colleges and \nuniversities. The legislation would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to provide restoration and preservation grants for historic \nbuildings and structures at eight historically women's colleges or \nuniversities. The bill directs the Secretary to award $16 million \nannually from fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to the eight institutions. \nFunds would be awarded from the National Historic Preservation Fund and \nare subject to a 50 percent matching requirement from non-federal \nsources.\n  The sweeping changes of the industrial revolution prompted Congress \nin 1862, with further action in 1887 and 1890, to provide Federal \nsupport for the establishment of agricultural and mechanical colleges \nwith growing emphasis on industrial and technical education. \nUnfortunately, these ``land-grant'' schools were only for men, leaving \nwomen untrained as they entered the expanded work force. Women's \nadvocates, such as Miss Julia Tutwiler in Alabama, immediately \nrecognized the need for institutions where women could receive an equal \neducation. Beginning in 1836, eight institutions in seven separate \nStates were established as industrial schools for women. These \ninstitutions include the Mississippi University for Women, in Alabama \nthe University of Montevallo, Georgia College and State University, \nWesleyan College also in Georgia, Winthrop University in South \nCarolina, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Texas Women's \nUniversity, and the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. These \neight institutions remain open, providing a liberal arts education for \nboth men and women, but retain significant historical and academic \nfeatures of those pioneering efforts to educate women. Despite their \ncontinued use, many of the structures located on these campuses are \nfacing destruction or closure because preservation funds are not \navailable. My legislation would enable these buildings to be preserved \nand maintained by providing funding for the historic buildings located \nat the colleges and universities that I have identified. Funding would \noriginate from the National Historic Preservation Fund. No more than \n$16 million would be available and would be distributed in equal \namounts to the eight institutions. My bill also provides that a 50 \npercent matching contribution from non-federal sources and assures that \nalterations in properties using the funds are subject to approval from \nthe Secretary of the Interior and reasonable public access for \ninterpretive and educational purposes.\n  These historically women's colleges and universities have contributed \nsignificantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through \npostsecondary education for women, low income individuals, and \neducationally disadvantaged Americans. I believe it is our duty to do \nall we can to preserve these historic institutions and I ask my \ncolleagues for their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1616. A bill to provide for interest on late payments of health \ncare claims; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Prompt \nPayment Bill''. This legislation addresses the need for the managed \ncare industry to not only take responsibility for their payments on \ntime, but to face specific penalties if they do not do so.\n  HMOs are one of the few entities that continue to be shielded from \nlawsuits. It is shocking that under current federal and most state \nlaws, there are no consequences when HMOs fail to pay their bills in a \ntimely manner. HMOs even have the right to drop out of Medicare simply \nbecause they are unsatisfied with the rate, let alone the timeliness, \nof what the government is paying them. It is time that this lack of \naccountability is addressed and significantly increased.\n  In my State of New Jersey, there is in fact a ``prompt pay'' law that \nrequires HMOs to pay their bills in thirty days from receiving a claim \nfrom a beneficiary, hospital or health care provider. However, a 1998 \nsurvey of twenty-four New Jersey hospitals found that more than $150 \nmillion in HMO payments were held up for sixty days or longer. That \nsame year, sixty percent of New Jersey hospitals lost money, over $172 \nmillion in statewide losses. HMOs simply face no consequences from \nstate regulatory agencies and the enforcement mechanisms currently in \nplace are too weak. If we let this continue, we will jeopardize the \ncare that people receive from their health care providers.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing the ``Prompt Payment Bill''. This \namendment will move HMOs considerably closer to assuming the financial \nresponsibilities for the health care coverage they are being paid to \nprovide.\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\nSpecifically, it will call for a ten-percent interest penalty per year \non any payment not made within 45 days. If the HMO continues to be \ndelinquent, beneficiaries or health care providers can bring the HMO to \ncourt to make them pay their bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in my efforts in making the managed \ncare industry significantly more accountable to their beneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1617. A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nincrease the hiring of firefighters, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nWarner, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Schumer, Senator Murray, Senator \nCleland, and Senator Corzine to introduce legislation to ensure that \nAmerica's firefighters have the staffing they need to safely do their \njobs.\n  It has been nearly seven weeks since the terrorist attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon. We are still assessing the damage \ndone by those attacks, but one thing is already absolutely certain, the \nworld has changed. And as we begin to figure out all of the ways in \nwhich the world has changed, we are starting to reassess our national \npriorities. We, as a Nation, are taking stock of our strengths and \nvulnerabilities, and we're identifying ways to improve our capacity to \ndeal with the threats that became so apparent on September 11.\n   One of the fundamental new realities that we find ourselves facing \nis that America needs to be better prepared to respond to deliberate \nacts of mass destruction. We need to be better prepared to deal with \nacts of bioterrorism and we need to be prepared to help save people \neven if they are deliberately attacked with toxic chemical weapons. In \nshort, we need to be prepared for what seemed unthinkable.\n  The legislation that we are proposing will help ensure that America's \nlocal fire agencies have the human resources that they need to meet the \nchallenges which they will address as America faces the challenge of an \nextended war against terrorism.\n  Just as we have called up the National Guard to meet the increased \nneed for more manpower in the military, we need to make a national \ncommitment to hire the firefighters necessary to protect the American \npeople here on the home front. The legislation that we are proposing \nwill put 75,000 new firefighters on America's streets over the next \nseven years.\n  Many of us in Congress have long understood that America's \nfirefighters make extraordinary contributions to their communities \neveryday. But on September 11, we got a glimpse of a larger role that \nthe men and women of the fire service, not to mention police forces \nplay. The national role of our firefighters has become apparent. They \nhave made the nation proud.\n  Despite the increasingly important role firefighters play both in our \nlocal communities and as part of our national homeland defense system, \ncommunities over the years have not maintained the level of staffing \nnecessary to ensure the safety of the public or even of the \nfirefighters themselves.\n  Since 1970, the number of firefighters as a percentage of the U.S. \nworkforce has steadily declined. Today in America there is only one \nfirefighter for every 280 citizens. We have fewer firefighters per \ncapita than nurses and police officers. We need to turn this trend \naround, now more than ever.\n  Understaffing is dangerous for the public and for firefighters. \nChronic understaffing means that many firefighters do not have the \nbackup and on-the-ground support they need to do their jobs safely. The \nsad consequence is that about every three days we lose a firefighter in \nthe line of duty. And on some days, the losses are unimaginably high.\n  We learned on September 11 that the American homeland is not immune \nfrom unthinkable acts of violence. Knowing that, we have an obligation \nto take every reasonable step to mitigate the potential damage that may \nbe caused by future attacks.\n  Again, just as we have called up the National Guard to meet the \nincreased need for more manpower in the military, we need to make a \nnational commitment to hire firefighters to protect the American \npeople. In these difficult times, it is both necessary and proper for \nus to send for reinforcements for our domestic defenders. The SAFER Act \nwill make that commitment.\n  This legislation honors America's firefighters. It acknowledges the \nmen and women who charge up the stairs while everybody else is running \ndown them. But it is more than that. This legislation is an investment \nin America's security, an investment that will rebuild public \nconfidence and help reassure Americans that their homes and businesses \nare as well protected as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STAFFING FOR ADEQUATE FIRE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE.\n\n       Title III of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-220; 112 Stat. 1080) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n    ``Subtitle E--Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response\n\n     ``SEC. 351.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, in introducing legislation that will address \na pressing issue for many States and localities which do not have the \nnecessary funding to hire additional firefighters. The SAFER Act \nestablishes a new grant program that will provide direct funding to \nfire and rescue departments to cover some of the costs associated with \nhiring and training new firefighters.\n  The brave women and men serving in our nation's fire service are on \nthe front lines in America's new war on terrorism. They have a critical \nrole in our homeland defense initiatives.\n  The SAFER Act would help ensure adequate staffing for fire and \nemergency response. Earlier this year the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, a nonprofit organization which develops and promotes \nscientifically based consensus codes and standards, adopted\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\na standard on response operational and deployment issues pertaining to \nfire and rescue departments. Based upon that standard, almost two \nthirds of fire companies across the country operate with inadequate \nstaffing. The cost for many municipalities to meet these new safety \nstandards, however, would be significant.\n  Many Americans are not aware of the staffing shortages we may face in \nour fire and rescue departments. The role of firefighter in our \ncommunities is far greater than most realize. They are first to respond \nto hazardous materials calls, chemicals emergencies, biohazard \nincidents, and water rescues. These are dangers which our fire rescue \npersonnel deal with on a daily basis.\n  Well over 300 firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty in \nresponding to the World Trade Center terrorist attacks. We need to \nrecognize our firefighters and emergency personnel around the country \nwho continue to make sacrifices in their service to the public. We must \nprovide our fire and rescue departments with sufficient funding to hire \nthe necessary personnel in order to ensure that our nation's \ncommunities are adequately protect.\n  I am honored to be an original cosponsor of the important \nlegislation. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and \naddress this critical need of our fire and rescue services throughout \nthe country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 1618. A bill to enhance the border security of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senators \nBrownback, Cantwell, Collins, Edwards, Hagel, Reid, and Ensign in \nintroducing legislation to strengthen the security of our borders and \nenhance our ability to deter potential terrorists. There is an urgent \nneed to improve intelligence and technology capabilities, enhance the \nability to screen individuals before they arrive at our borders, and \nimprove the monitoring of foreign nationals already within the United \nStates.\n  In strengthening the security of our borders, we must also safeguard \nthe unobstructed entry of the more than 31 million persons who enter \nthe U.S. legally each year as visitors, students, and temporary \nworkers. Many of them cross the Canadian and Mexican borders to conduct \ndaily business or visit close family members.\n  We must also live up to our history and heritage as a Nation of \nimmigrants. Immigration is essential to who we are as Americans. \nContinued immigration is part of our national well-being, our identity \nas a Nation, and our strength in today's world. In defending the \nNation, we are also defending the fundamental constitutional principles \nthat have made America strong in the past and will make us even \nstronger in the future.\n  Our action must strike a careful balance between protecting civil \nliberties and providing the means for law enforcement to identify, \napprehend and detain potential terrorist. It makes no sense to enact \nreforms that severely limit immigration into the United States. \n``Fortress America,'' even if it could be achieved, is an inadequate \nand ineffective response to the terrorist threat.\n  A major goal of this legislation is to improve coordination and \ninformation-sharing by the Department of State, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and law enforcement and intelligence agencies. \nIt will require the Department of State and the INS to work with the \nOffice of Homeland Security and the recently formed Foreign Terrorist \nTracking Task Force to submit and implement a plan to improve their \naccess to critical security information. It will give those responsible \nfor screening visa applicants and persons entering the U.S. the tools \nthey need to make informed decisions.\n  We must provide enforcement personnel at our ports of entry with \ngreater resources and technology. These men and women are a primary \ndefense in the battle against terrorism. This legislation will see that \nthey receive adequate pay, can hire necessary support staff, and are \nwell-trained to identify individuals who pose a security threat.\n  The anti-terrorism bill recently passed by the Senate addressed the \nneed for machine-readable passports, but it did not focus on machine-\nreadable visas, a necessary part of our efforts to improve border \nsecurity. This legislation allows the Department of State to raise fees \nthrough the use of machine-readable visas and use the funds collected \nfrom those fees to improve technology at our ports of entry.\n  We must do more to improve our ability to screen individuals along \nour entire North American perimeter. This legislation directs the \nDepartment of State and the INS to work with the Office of Homeland \nSecurity and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force to strengthen \nour ability to screen individuals at the Perimeter before they reach \nour continent. We can work with Canada and Mexico to coordinate these \nefforts.\n  We must also strengthen our ability to monitor foreign nationals in \nthe United States. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation mandating the \ndevelopment of an automated entry/exit control system to record the \nentry of every non-citizen arriving in the U.S., and to match it with \nthe record of departure. Although technology is currently available for \nsuch a system, it has not been implemented because of the high costs \ninvolved. Our legislation builds on the anti-terrorism bill and \nprovides greater direction to the INS for implementing the entry/exit \nsystem.\n\n  We must improve the ability of foreign service officers to detect and \nintercept potential terrorists before they arrive in the U.S. Most \nforeign nationals who travel here must apply for visas at American \nconsulates overseas. Traditionally, consular officers have focused on \ninterviewing applicants to determine whether they are likely to violate \ntheir visa status. Although this review is important, consular officers \nmust also be trained specifically to screen for security threats.\n  We must require all airlines to electronically transmit passenger \nlists to destination airports in the United States, so that once the \nplanes have landed, law enforcement authorities can intercept \npassengers who are on federal lookout lists. United States airlines \nalready do this, but some foreign airlines do not. Our legislation \nrequires all airlines to transmit passenger manifest information prior \nto the arrival of flight in the U.S.\n  In 1996, Congress established a program to collect information on \nnon-immigrant foreign students and participants in exchange programs. \nAlthough a pilot phase of this program ended in 1999, a permanent \nsystem has not yet been implemented. Congress passed provisions in the \nanti-terrorism bill for the quick and effective implementation of this \nsystem by 2003, but gaps still exist. This legislation will increase \nthe data collected by the monitoring to include the date of entry, the \nport of entry, the date of school enrollment, and the date the student \nleaves the school. It requires the Department of State and INS to \nmonitor students who have been given visas, and to notify schools of \ntheir entry. It also requires a school to notify the INS if a student \ndoes not actually report to the school. If institutions fail to comply \nwith these and other requirements, they should lose their ability to \nadmit foreign students.\n  INS regulations provide for regular reviews of over 26,000 \neducational institutions that are authorized to enroll foreign \nstudents. However, inspections have been sporadic in recent years. This \nlegislation will require INS to monitor institutions on a regular \nbasis.\n  As we work to implement stronger tracking systems, we must also \nremember that the vast majority of foreign visitors, students, and \nworkers who overstay their visas are not criminals or terrorists. It \nwould be wrong and unfair, without additional information, to \nstigmatize them.\n  This legislation will also help restrict visas to foreign nationals \nfrom countries that the Department of State has determined are sponsors \nof terrorism. It precludes visas to individuals from countries that \nsponsor terrorism, unless specific steps are taken to ensure the person \nis not a security threat.\n  We must be able to retain highly skilled immigration inspectors. Our \nlegislation will provide incentives to immigration inspectors by \nproviding\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\nthem with the same benefits as other law enforcement personnel.\n  We must fully implement the use of biometric border crossing cards \nand allow sufficient time for individuals to obtain these cards. Many \nof these cards are already in use, but INS does not have the necessary \nequipment to read the cards. This legislation appropriates needed funds \nto enable the INS to purchase the machines, and it extends the deadline \nfor individuals crossing the border to acquire the cards.\n  When planes land at our airports, inspectors are under significant \ntime constraints to clear the planes and ensure the safety of all \ndeparting passengers. Our legislation removes the existing 45 minute \ndeadline, providing inspectors with adequate time to clear and secure \naircraft.\n  The Senate took significant steps last week to improve immigration \nsecurity by passing the anti-terrorism bill, but further action is \nneeded. This legislation will strengthen the security of our borders \nand enhance our ability to prevent future terrorist attacks, while also \nreaffirming our tradition as a Nation of immigrants. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the terrorist attacks of September 11th \nhave unsettled the public's confidence in our Nation's security and \nhave raised concerns about whether our institutions are up to the task \nof intercepting and thwarting would-be terrorists. Given that the \npersons responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon came from abroad, our citizens understandably ask how these \npeople entered the United States and what can be done to prevent their \nkind from doing so again. Clearly, our immigration laws and policies \nare instrumental to the war on terrorism. While the battle may be waged \non several fronts, for the man or woman on the street, immigration is \nin many ways the front line of our defense.\n  The immigration provisions in the anti-terrorist bill passed by this \nbody last week, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, represent an excellent \nfirst step toward improving our border security, but we must not stop \nthere. Our Nation receives millions of visitors each year, foreign \nnationals who come to the United States to visit family, to do \nbusiness, to tour our sites, to study and learn. Most of these people \nenter lawfully and mean well; they are good for our economy and are \npotential ambassadors of good will to their home countries. However, \nthere is a small minority who intend us harm, and we must take \nintelligent measures to keep these people out.\n  For that reason, I am pleased to introduce today, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Kennedy, Senator Collins, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nHagel, Senator Edwards, Senator Ensign, and Senator Reid, legislation \nthat looks specifically toward strengthening our borders and better \nequipping the agencies that protect them. The Enhanced Border Security \nAct of 2001 represents an earnest, thoughtful, and bipartisan effort to \nrefine our immigration laws and institutions to better combat the evil \nthat threatens our Nation.\n  The legislation recognizes that the war on terrorism is, in large \npart, a war of information. To be successful, we must improve our \nability to collect, compile, and utilize information critical to our \nsafety and national security. This bill provides that the agencies \ntasked with screening visa applicants and applicants for admission, \nnamely the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, must be provided with law enforcement and intelligence \ninformation that will enable these agencies to identify alien \nterrorists. By directing better coordination and access, this \nlegislation will bring together the agencies that have the information \nand those that need it. With input from the Office of Homeland Security \nand the President's Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, this bill \nwill make prompt and effective information-sharing between these \nagencies a reality.\n  In complement to last week's anti-terrorist act, this legislation \nprovides for necessary improvements in the technologies used by the \nState Department and the Service. It provides funding for the State \nDepartment to better interface with foreign intelligence information \nand to better staff its infrastructure. It also provides the Service \nwith guidance on the implementation of the Integrated Entry and Exit \nData System, pointing the Service to such tools as biometric \nidentifiers in immigration documents, machine readable visas and \npassports, and arrival-departure and security databases. In fact, this \nlegislation expressly enables the Service to take immediate advantage \nof biometric technology by authorizing the funding to purchase \nequipment for reading border-crossing cards that are already available \nfor use.\n\n  To the degree that we can reasonably and realistically do so, we \nshould attempt to intercept terrorists before they reach our borders. \nAccordingly, we must consider security measures not only at domestic \nports of entry but also at foreign ports of departure. To that end, \nthis legislation directs the State Department and the Service, in \nconsultation with Office of Homeland Security, to examine, expand, and \nenhance screening procedures to take place outside the United States, \nas preinspection and preclearance. It also requires international air \ncarriers to transmit, in advance of their arrival, passenger manifests \nfor review by the Service. Further, it eliminates the 45-minute \nstatutory limit on airport inspections, which many feel compromises the \nService's ability to screen arriving flights properly. Finally, since \nwe should ultimately look to expand our security perimeter to include \nCanada and Mexico, this bill requires these agencies to work with our \nneighbors to create a collaborative North American Security Perimeter.\n  While this legislation mandates certain technological improvements, \nit does not ignore the human element in the security equation. It \nprovides special training to border patrol agents, inspectors, and \nforeign service officers to better identify terrorists and security \nthreats to the United States. Moreover, to help the Service retain its \nmost experienced people on the borders, this bill provides the Service \nwith increased flexibility in pay, certain benefit incentives, and the \nability to hire necessary support staff.\n  Finally, this legislation considers certain classes of aliens that \nraise security concerns for our country: nationals from states that \nsponsor terrorism and foreign students. With respect to the former, \nthis bill expressly prohibits the State Department from issuing a \nnonimmigrant visa to any alien from a country that sponsors terrorism \nuntil it has been determined that the alien does not pose a threat to \nthe safety or national security of the United States. With respect to \nthe latter, this legislation would fill data and reporting gaps in our \nforeign student programs by requiring the Service to electronically \nmonitor the student at every stage in the student visa process. It \nwould also require the educational institution to report a foreign \nstudent's failure to enroll and the Service to monitor schools' \ncompliance with this reporting requirement.\n  While we must be careful not to compromise our values or our economy, \nwe must take intelligent, immediate steps to enhance the security of \nour borders. This legislation, consonant with both the USA Patriot Act \nand President Bush's recent directive on immigration, would implement \nmany changes that are vital to our war on terrorism. I therefore urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President I rise today for two purposes. First, I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his tireless work on \nimmigration issues and to offer my support for a bill he and Senator \nBrownback are introducing today, the Enhanced Border Security Act of \n2001. Also, I want to discuss legislation I will be introducing that \nbuilds upon the visa technology standards provisions of the USA Patriot \nAct of 2001 and fits within the construct of what Senators Kennedy and \nBrownback seek to accomplish. Several of the provisions I have proposed \nhave already been incorporated by Senators Kennedy and Brownback, and I \nwill continue to work with them and my other colleagues to move other \nprovisions of my bill.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been honored to work \nclosely with Senator Kennedy to find ways to better protect our borders \nand provide necessary support to the men\n\n[[Page S11374]]\n\nand women who work for the State Department, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Agency.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues, am currently pressing for \nfunding to triple the number of Immigration and Naturalization Service \nand U.S. personnel on our northern border and improve border \ntechnology, the authorization for which was included in the USA Patriot \nAct. In the past, a severe lack of resources at our northern border has \ncompromised the ability of border control officials to execute their \nduties. I am pleased that Congress made the tripling of these resources \na priority for national security, and I will continue to fight for full \nfunding of this measure. Senators Kennedy and Brownback have also \naddressed these needs by improving INS pay standards, providing \nadditional training for Border Patrol and Customs agents, and \nincreasing information technology funding.\n  Let me commend Senators Kennedy and Brownback on the bill they are \nintroducing today. It reflects a thoughtful response to the current \nsituation at our borders, and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor. \nI am aware that others have proposals to address border issues as well, \nand I look forward to working with them.\n  The Enhanced Border Security Act of 2001 addresses several critical \nissues. In hearings in recent weeks before the Immigration Subcommittee \nand the Technology and, Terrorism Subcommittee, we heard repeated calls \nfor better sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information as \nit relates to admitting aliens into the United States. The bill \naddresses this problem by mandating INS and Department of State access \nto relevant FBI information within one year. I am pleased that the \nauthors of this bill have included provisions to protect the privacy \nand security of this information, and require limitations on the use \nand repeated dissemination of the information.\n  Sharing U.S. law enforcement and intelligence information with the \nState Department and INS is important, but it is also critical to build \nupon our relationships with Canada and Mexico. We share a mutual \ninterest in protecting our respective borders. The U.S., Canada and \nMexico must also improve the sharing of information by our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities. We need to develop a \nperimeter national security program with our partners to our north and \nsouth, and the Enhanced Border Security Act does just that.\n  The Enhanced Border Security Act requires airlines to provide \npassenger manifests to the INS and Customs in advance of a flight's \narrival. This will be one more source of data, that will help INS \nscreen for those who should not be allowed to enter. It also tightens \ncontrols on student visas, and restricts the issuance of visas to \naliens who are citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism. This is a \nthoughtful bill and I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Last week with the enactment of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the \nFederal Government committed to developing a visa technology standard \nthat would facilitate the sharing of information related to the \nadmissibility of aliens into the United States. I proposed this \nlanguage recognizing that for many years, the U.S. law enforcement and \nintelligence communities have maintained numerous, but separate, non-\ninteroperable databases. These databases are not easily or readily \naccessible to front-line Federal agents responsible for making the \ncritical decisions of whether to issue a visa or to admit an alien into \nthe United States.\n  To build on and fulfill the goals of establishing this standard, my \nbill will do three things. First, it will require technology be \nimplemented to track the initial entry and exit of aliens traveling on \na U.S. visa. We know now that several of the terrorists who attacked \nAmerica on September 11 were traveling on expired visas. We have had \nthe law in place for several years now, but due to concerns about \nmaintaining the flow of trade and tourism across our borders, concerns \nI share, the provisions of Section 110 have not been fully implemented. \nTechnology will address those concerns, allowing electronic recordation \nand verification of entry and exit data in an instant.\n  Second, I believe it is necessary to require the Departments of State \nand Justice to work with the Office of Homeland Security to build a \ncohesive electronic data sharing system. The system must incorporate \ninteroperability and compatibility within and between the databases of \nthe various agencies that maintain information relevant to determining \nwhether a visa should be issued or whether an alien should be admitted \ninto the United States. My legislation will require interoperable real-\ntime sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information relevant \nto the issuance of a visa or an alien's admissibility to the U.S. The \nprovision will require that information is made available, although \nwith the appropriate safeguards for privacy and the protection of \nintelligence sources, to the front line government agents making the \ndecisions to issue visas or to admit visa holding aliens to the United \nStates. I am pleased that Senators Kennedy and Brownback have adopted \nthese provisions into their legislation.\n  Finally, building on the provisions of the Kennedy-Brownback bill for \na Perimeter National Security Program, and on the technology standard \nrequired under the USA Patriot Act, my legislation will require the \nDepartment of State and the Attorney General to study and report to \nCongress within 90 days on how best to facilitate sharing of \ninformation that may be relevant to determining whether to issue a U.S. \nvisa. Our borders are only as secure as the borders of those countries \nwith whom we have agreements that visas are not required. We need to \nbuild on our relationships with these international partners to secure \nour respective borders through better information sharing.\n  Keeping terrorists out of the U.S. in the first place will reduce the \nrisks of terrorism within the U.S. in the future. Aliens known to be \naffiliated with terrorists have been admitted to the U.S. on valid \nvisas simply because one agency in government did not share important \ninformation with another department in a timely fashion. We must make \nsure that this does not happen again.\n  Until now, we had hoped that agencies would voluntarily share this \ninformation on a real-time and regular basis. This has not happened, \nand although I know that the events of September 11 have led to serious \nrethinking of our information-sharing processes and procedures, I think \nit is time to mandate the sharing of fundamental information.\n  Advancements in technology have provided us with additional tools to \nverify the identify of individuals entering our country without \nimpairing the flow of legitimate trade, tourism, workers and students. \nIt is time we put these tools to use.\n  Improving our national security is vitally important, but I will not \nsupport measures that compromise America's civil liberties. Both the \nbill being introduced today and the bill I will be introducing include \nseveral safeguards to protect individuals' rights to privacy. The bills \nprovide that where databases are created or shared, there must be \nprotection of privacy and adequate security measures in place, \nlimitations on the use and re-dissemination of information, and \nmechanisms for removing obsolete or erroneous information. Even in \ntimes of urgent action, we must protect the freedoms that make our \ncountry great.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Lincoln, and \n        Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 1619. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of substitute adult day care services under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Mr. \nRockefeller, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. McConnell to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation aimed at improving long-term care health and rehabilitation \noptions for Medicare beneficiaries, and also assisting family \ncaregivers.\n  We all recognize that our Nation needs to address sooner rather than \nlater challenges of financing long-term care services for our growing \naging population. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that \nnational expenditures for long-term care services for the elderly will \nincrease each year through 2040. But it is in just over a decade when \nwe will see these challenges become even more pronounced\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\nwhen the 76 million baby boomers begin to turn 65. Baby boomers are \nexpected to live longer and greater numbers will reach 85 and older.\n  Given the expected growing costs of long-term care services, and \ncombined with the fact that today so many American families are already \nserving as caregivers for aging or ailing seniors and providing such a \nlarge portion of long-term care services, it is more important than \never that we have in place quality options in how to best care for our \nsenior population about to dramatically increase.\n  This is why we are introducing the Medicare Adult Day Services \nAlternative Act, legislation to offer home health beneficiaries more \noptions for receiving care in a setting of their own choosing, rather \nthan confining the provision of those benefits solely to the home.\n  This legislation would give beneficiaries the option to receive some \nor all of their Medicare home health services in an adult day setting. \nThis would be a substitution, not an expansion, of services. The bill \nwould not make new people eligible for Medicare home health benefits or \nexpand the list of services paid for. In fact, this legislation may be \ndesigned to produce net savings for the Medicare program.\n  Permitting homebound patients to receive their home health care in a \nclinically-based senior day center, as an alternative to receiving it \nat home, could result in significant benefits to the Medicare program, \nsuch as reduced cost-per-episode, reduced numbers of episodes, as well \nas mental and physical stimulation for patients.\n  Moreover, the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act could well \nhave a positive impact on our economy, as it would enable caregivers to \nattend to other things in today's fast-paced family life, such as \nworking a full- or part-time job and caring for children, knowing their \nloved ones are well cared for. It is unfortunate that today many \ncaregivers have to choose between working or caring for a family \nmember. It is estimated that the average loss of income to these \ncaregivers is more than $600,000 in wages, pension, and Social Security \nbenefits. And by extension, the loss in productivity in United States \nbusinesses is pegged at more than $10 billion annually.\n  But it does not have to be an either-or proposition. The Medicare \nAdult Day Services Alternative Act is a creative solution to health \ncare delivery, which would adequately reimburse providers in a fiscally \nresponsible way. Located in every state in the United States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, adult day centers generally offer transportation, \nmeals, personal care, and counseling in addition to the medical \nservices and socialization benefits offered.\n  We can and should offer both our Medicare beneficiaries and family \ncaregivers more and better options for health care delivery, and that \nis exactly what the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act is \ndesigned to do. This legislation is bipartisan, and is supported by \nmore than 20 national non-profit organizations concerned with the well-\nbeing of America's older population and committed to representing their \ninterests.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in this cause. I again thank \nSenators Rockefeller, Lincoln and McConnell for working with me in this \neffort, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join my good friend \nfrom Pennsylvania as an original cosponsor of the ``Medicare Adult Day \nServices Alternative Act.''\n  Adult day health care is a vital component of good long-term care, \nfor patients and for their caregivers. I am hopeful that as a result of \nthis bill, adult day health care will play an increasingly larger role \nin how we care for the elderly in this country.\n  To be clear, this bill would simply give beneficiaries of the \nMedicare home health benefit the option of choosing to receive their \ncare partially in an adult day care setting. This bill would not expand \nthe list of who is eligible for home care, it simply changes the \nlocation where services may be provided. The benefits of this \nlegislation, are that beneficiaries gain increased social interaction \nwith peers, while simultaneously giving caregivers a measure of \nrespite.\n  I am a strong supporter of adult day health care, because I've seen \nthe tremendous benefits of it in the VA health care system. The \nfederally funded VA health care system, because of the very substantial \nWorld War II veteran population, has developed some of the most \ninnovative ways to care for older people especially in non-\ninstitutional settings. As a result of this demand, VA has led the \nNation in developing adult day health care programs. The Adult Day \nHealth Care Program at VA was established in the late 1970s at five \nfacilities. At this time, there are 15 in-house VA Adult Day Health \nCare programs. All other VA medical centers provide this program to \nveterans through a contractual basis with community-based programs.\n  In 1999, I introduced legislation to further expand on VA adult day \nby making adult day health care, and other non-institutional long-term \ncare services, part of the standard benefits package in the VA. I am \nthrilled that my legislation was passed later that year and that all \nveterans who enroll for VA care will have access to these services.\n  I look forward to working with members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to advance the cause of long-term care. It is my view that \nproviding long-term care to all Americans is a priority. Let us delay \nno longer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1620. A bill to authorize the Government National Mortgage \nAssociation to guarantee conventional mortgage-backed securities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Home \nOwnership Expansion Act of 2001. This legislation is designed to expand \nhome ownership by increasing the supply of affordable mortgages \navailable for home buyers. The legislation establishes a private-public \npartnership between mortgage providers and insurers and the Government \nNational Mortgage Association, GNMA or Ginnie Mae.\n  GNMA is a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nand its current business is limited to home loans that are insured only \nby government agencies. GNMA provides a guarantee to investors who \npurchase FHA and VA home loans that are bundled into securities. These \nsecurities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. \ngovernment.\n  The Home Ownership Expansion Act of 2001 would authorize a new \nprogram that permits GNMA to guarantee securities that consist of \nmortgages insured by private mortgage insurance. Private insurance \nresults in reduced risk to taxpayers which will in turn make more \ncapital available for home mortgages.\n  This new GNMA program would be targeted at first-time and middle \nincome home buyers. The program would be limited to mortgages up to \n$275,000 and tailored to borrowers who have less than 20 percent down \npayments to put into homes. GNMA would benefit from the ability to \ncompete for privately insured mortgage business. GNMA's income would \nincrease through the program and GNMA would be strengthened by its \nability to offer a greater variety of products to investors.\n  By permitting GNMA to enter the secondary market for privately \ninsured mortgages, the legislation would increase competition. Mortgage \nlenders would have a new entity to which they could sell their \nmortgages, and the number and variety of loan-approval systems at use \nin the low down payment mortgage market would increase. The \nbeneficiaries of this increase in competition would be consumers who \nwish to purchase a home.\n  Mr. President, the current rate of home ownership in the United \nStates is 67 percent of households. This rate has risen steadily in \nrecent decades and is great achievement for our nation. However, the \nrate of home ownership among minority families, entry level workers, \nand younger Americans remains much lower. This legislation is designed \nto further increase the home ownership rate by increasing the \navailability of affordable mortgages.\n  The Home Ownership Expansion Act of 2001 would strengthen the \nGovernment National Mortgage Association. It would protect taxpayers by \nincreasing private sector risk sharing on GNMA products. It would \nincrease competition in the secondary mortgage market, helping to lower \ncosts to consumers. And by increasing the use of varying underwriting \nsystems it would help to qualify more first-time, middle income and \nminority home buyers. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Ownership Expansion Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GNMA GUARANTEE OF SECURITIES BACKED BY CONVENTIONAL \n                   MORTGAGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) expanding home ownership is a national goal, and that \n     increasing the principal secondary market outlets for \n     conventional home mortgages will serve that goal by improving \n     the liquidity of investments in those mortgages; and\n       (2) risk-sharing between the public sector and the private \n     mortgage insurance industry will provide consumers with \n     greater access to mortgage credit opportunities.\n       (b) Authority to Guarantee Conventional Mortgage-Backed \n     Securities.--Section 306 of the National Housing Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1721) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) GNMA Guarantee of Securities Backed by Conventional \n     Mortgages.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Association may guarantee the timely \n     payment of principal and interest on conventional mortgage-\n     backed securities that are backed by qualifying privately \n     insured mortgages that are\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\n     insured with primary mortgage insurance, extended mortgage \n     insurance, and supplemental mortgage insurance.\n       ``(2) Premiums.--The issuer of securities guaranteed by the \n     Association under this subsection that are backed by \n     qualifying privately insured mortgages shall--\n       ``(A) for primary mortgage insurance, collect from the \n     mortgagor, and remit to the qualified mortgage insurer, the \n     premium or premiums as may be established by the qualified \n     mortgage insurer in accordance with applicable Federal or \n     State law;

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto approve up to 4 State waivers to allow a State to use its allotment \nunder the State children's health insurance program under title XXI of \nthe Social Security Act to increase the enrollment of children eligible \nfor medical assistance under the Medicaid Program under title XIX of \nsuch Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Jeffords, Leahy, and Murray entitled the ``Children's \nHealth Equity Act of 2001'' addresses an inequity that was created \nduring the establishment of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, CHIP, that unfairly penalized certain States that had done the \nright thing and had expanded Medicaid coverage to children prior to the \nenactment of the bill.\n  While the Congress recognized this fact for some States and \n``grandfathered'' in their expansions so those States could use the new \nCHIP funding for the children of their respective states, the \nlegislation failed to do so for others, including New Mexico. This had \nthe effect of penalizing a certain group of states for having done the \nright thing.\n  As a result, the ``Children's Health Equity Act of 2001'' addresses \nthis inequity by allowing four States, including New Mexico, Vermont, \nWashington, and Rhode Island, to be allowed to also utilize their CHIP \nallotments for coverage of children covered by Medicaid above their \n1996 levels, putting them on a more level field with all other States \nin the country.\n  Mr. President, as you know, in 1997 Congress and President Clinton \nagreed to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nCHIP, and provide $48 billion over 10 years as an incentive to States \nto provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children up \n200 percent of poverty or beyond.\n  During the negotiations of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, \nCongress and the Administration properly recognized that certain states \nwere already undertaking Medicaid or separate state-run expansions of \ncoverage to children up to 185 percent of poverty or above and that \nthey would be allowed to use the new CHIP funding for those purposes. \nThe final bill specifically allowed the States of Florida, New York, \nand Pennsylvania to convert their separate state-run programs into CHIP \nexpansions and States that had expanded coverage to children through \nMedicaid after March 31, 1997, were also allowed to use CHIP funding \nfor their expansions.\n  Unfortunately, New Mexico and other States that had enacted similar \nexpansions prior to March 1997 were denied the use of CHIP funding for \ntheir expansions. This created an inequity among the states where some \nwere allowed to have their prior programs ``grandfathered'' into CHIP \nand others were denied. Again, our bill addresses this inequity.\n  New Mexico has a strong record of attempting to expand coverage to \nchildren through the Medicaid program. In 1995, prior to the enactment \nof CHIP, New Mexico expanded coverage to for all children through age \n18 through the Medicaid program up to 185 percent of poverty. After \nCHIP was passed, New Mexico further expanded its coverage up to 235 \npercent of poverty, above the level of the vast majority of states \nacross the country.\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\n  Due to the inequity caused by CHIP, New Mexico has been allocated \n$182 million from CHIP between fiscal years 1998 and 2000, and yet, has \nonly been able to spend slightly over $5 million as of the end of last \nfiscal year. In other words, New Mexico has been allowed to spend only \n3 percent of its Federal CHIP allocations.\n  New Mexico is unable to spend its funding because it had enacted its \nexpansion of coverage to children up to 185 percent of poverty prior to \nthe enactment of CHIP and our State was not ``grandfathered'' into CHIP \nas other comparable States were.\n  The consequences for the children of New Mexico are enormous. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, New Mexico has an estimated 129,000 \nuninsured children. In other words, almost 22 percent of all the \nchildren in New Mexico are uninsured, despite the fact the State has \nexpanded coverage up to 235 percent of poverty. This is the fourth \nhighest rate of uninsured children in the country.\n  This is a result of the fact that an estimated 103,000 of the 129,000 \nuninsured children in New Mexico are below 200 percent of poverty. \nThese children are, consequently, eligible for Medicaid but currently \nunenrolled. With the exception of those few children between 185 and \n200 percent of poverty who are eligible for CHIP funding, all of the \nremaining uninsured children below 185 percent of poverty in New Mexico \nare denied CHIP funding despite their need.\n  Exacerbating this inequity is the fact that many states are accessing \ntheir CHIP allotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below New \nMexico's current or past eligibility levels. The children in those \nstates are certainly no more worthy of health insurance coverage than \nthe children of New Mexico.\n  As the most recent policy statement by the National Governors' \nAssociation reads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that \ninnovative States not be penalized for having expanded coverage to \nchildren before the enactment of S-CHIP, which provides enhanced \nfunding to meet these goals. To this end, the Governors support \nproviding additional funding flexibility to states that had already \nsignificantly expanded coverage to the majority of uninsured children \nin their States.''\n  Consequently, the bill I am introducing today corrects this inequity. \nThe bill reflects a carefully-crated response to the unintended \nconsequences of CHIP and brings much needed assistance to children \ncurrently uninsured in my State and other similarly situated States, \nincluding Washington, Vermont, and Rhode Island.\n  Rather than simply changing the effective date included in the BBA \nthat helped a smaller subset of States, this initiative includes strong \nmaintenance of effort language as well as incentives for our State to \nconduct outreach and enrollment efforts and program simplification to \nfind and enroll uninsured kids because we feel strongly that they \nreceive the health coverage for which they are eligible.\n  The bill does not take money from other States' CHIP allotments. It \nsimply allows our States to spend our States' specific CHIP allotments \nfrom the Federal Government on our uninsured children, just as other \nStates across the country are doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide disadvantaged children with access to \ndental services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Cochran, Daschle, Lincoln, Collins, Carnahan, Hutchinson \nof Arkansas, and Corzine entitled the ``Children's Dental Health \nImprovement Act of 2001'' is designed to improve the access and \ndelivery of dental health services to our Nation's children through \nMedicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, the \nIndian Health Service, IHS, and our Nation's safety net of community \nhealth centers.\n  The oral health problems facing children are highlighted in a \nlandmark report issued by the Surgeon General and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, last year entitled Oral Health in \nAmerica: A Report of the Surgeon General in which he observed that our \nNation is facing what amounts to ``a `silent epidemic' of dental and \noral diseases.''\n  In fact, dental caries, which refers to both decayed teeth or filled \ncavities, is the most common childhood disease. According to the \nSurgeon General, ``Among 5- to 17-year olds, dental caries is more than \n5 times as common as a reported history of asthma and 7 times as common \nas hay fever.'' In short, dental care is, as the Surgeon General adds, \n``the most prevalent unmet health need among American children.''\n  The severity of this problem is even greater among children is \npoverty. Poor children aged 2 to 9 have twice the levels of untreated \ndecayed teeth as nonpoor children. Moreover, the Surgeon General has \nfound that poor Mexican American children have rates of untreated \ndecayed teeth that exceed 70 percent, a rate of true epidemic \nproportions.\n  For these children, their personal suffering is real. Many of the \noral diseases and disorders can cause severe pain, undermine self-\nesteem and self-image, discourage normal social interaction, cause \nother health problems, compromise nutritional status, and lead to \nchronic stress and depression as well as incur great financial cost. \nLack of treatment is estimated to result in a loss of 1.6 million \nschool days annually, according to the National Center for Health \nStatistics.\n  The General Accounting Office, GAO, in its April 2000 report, \nentitled ``Oral Health: Dental Disease is a Chronic Problem Among Low-\nIncome Populations,'' adds, ``Poor children suffer nearly 12 times more \nrestricted-activity days, such as missed school, than higher-income \nchildren as a result of dental problems.''\n  Incredibly, this could all be prevented. As the Surgeon General's \nreport notes, prevention programs in oral health that have been \ndesigned and evaluated for children using a variety of fluoride and \ndental sealant strategies has the ``potential of virtually eliminating \ndental caries in all children.''\n  Unfortunately, children do not get the dental services they need. \nAccording to the Surgeon General,'' Although over 14 percent of \nchildren under 18 have no form of private or public medical insurance, \nmore than twice that many, 23 million children, have no dental \ninsurance.'' The report adds, ``There are at least 2.6 children without \ndental insurance for each child without medical insurance.''\n  One important provision in the bill would grant States flexibility to \nprovide dental coverage to low-income children through the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, just as States currently are able \nto do through Medicaid.\n  Unfortunately, SCHIP law prohibits coverage of children for services \nunless they are completely uninsured. As authors Ruth Almeida, Ian \nHill, and Genevieve Kenney of an Urban Institute report entitled Does \nSCHIP Spell Better Dental Care for Children? An Early Look at New \nInitiatives write, ``. . . many low-income children are covered by \nemployer-based or other private health insurance for their medical \ncare, but do not have a comprehensive dental benefit. Because these \nchildren are privately insured, they are not eligible for SCHIP and \ncannot avail themselves of dental coverage under SCHIP. Expanding SCHIP \nto furnish dental services on a wraparound basis to privately covered \nlow-income children without dental coverage could help achieve broader \nimprovements in children's oral health.''\n  For low-income children with medical coverage but no dental insurance \nthrough the private sector, their only option would be to completely \ndump their private coverage for their children in order to access SCHIP \ncoverage.\n  Instead, the ``Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2001'' \nwould create an option for states to provide low-income families with \nthe ability to receive wrap-around dental coverage through SCHIP \nwithout having to completely drop their private insurance. This reduces \nthe crowd-out of private insurance, which was a priority of the \nCongress during passage of SCHIP, and it provides low-income children \nwith dental services that other children in the same economic \ncircumstance are already receiving through SCHIP.\n  In implementing such a change, I want to make it clear that I am in \nstrong support of providing additional funding to SCHIP to ensure that \nthese services are provided without reducing current levels of SCHIP \nfunding. I am concerned about SCHIP funding in forthcoming years, \nparticularly in those years referred to as the ``CHIP dip'' when \nfunding levels drop from over $4 billion annually to around $3 billion. \nI have other legislation entitled, S. 1016, the ``Start Healthy, Stay \nHealthy Act of 2001,'' that addresses this very problem.\n  With those additional funds, I strongly believe that SCHIP, just as \nMedicaid, should provide services to low-income children who are both \nuninsured and underinsured. Children need a comprehensive set of child \nhealth services, including dental services, to ensure their appropriate \nhealth and development.\n  However, coverage for these services is often not enough. Even when \nchildren do have dental coverage, the access to care is often sorely \nlacking. Medicaid is the largest insurer of dental coverage to \nchildren. Yet, despite the design of the Medicaid program to ensure \naccess to comprehensive services for children, including dental care, \nthe Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid \nreceived even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows \nthat no State provides preventive services to more than 50 percent of \neligible children. The factors are complex but the primary one is due \nto limited dentist participation in Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\n  According to GAO, in its September 2000 report entitled Oral Health: \nFactors Contributing to Low Use of Dental Services by Low-Income \nPopulations, ``Of 39 states that provided information about dentists' \nparticipation in Medicaid, 23 reported that fewer than half of the \nstates' dentists saw at least one Medicaid patient during 1999.'' Even \nworse, a 1998 survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures \nindicates that fewer than 20 percent of dentists participate in the \nMedicaid program nationwide.\n  The GAO concludes poor participation rates by dentists is due in \nlarge part to poor reimbursement rates in Medicaid. As the GAO points \nout, ``Our analysis showed that Medicaid payment rates are often well \nbelow dentists' normal fees. Only 13 states had Medicaid rates that \nexceeded two-thirds of the average regional fees dentists charged. . . \n.''\n  Clearly, Medicaid is chronically underfunded with respect to dental \ncare. The Surgeon General's report notes, ``On average, state Medicaid \nagencies contribute only 2.3 percent of their child health expenditures \nto dental care, whereas nationally, the percentage of all child health \nexpenditures dedicated to dental care is more than 10 times that rate, \nalmost 30 percent.''\n  The good news is that many States, including New Mexico, are taking \nactions to improve the participation of dentists in the Medicaid \nprogram by raising low payment rates and reducing administrative \nrequirements. These efforts were highlighted by the GAO in its \nSeptember 2000 report. To further encourage such efforts, the \n``Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2001'' provides $50 \nmillion annually as financial incentives and planning grants to states \nto undertake additional improvements in their Medicaid programs \ndelivery of dental health services to children.\n  In addition to Medicaid and SCHIP, the federal government administers \nother health care programs providing dental services or providers for \nlow-income children and their families, including services administered \nby community health centers and the Indian Health Service, IHS. \nUnfortunately, both of these programs are underfunded and, as the GAO \nfound, ``report difficulty in meeting the dental needs of their target \npopulations.''\n  For example, the GAO found that ``HHS and health center officials \nreport that the demand for dental services significantly exceeds the, \nurban and rural health, centers' capacity to deliver it. In 1998 . . ., \na little more than half of the nearly 700 health center grantees funded \nunder this program had active dental programs.'' This is also true for \npublic health departments across the country.\n  To assist the health centers and public health departments with this \nneed, the ``Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2001'' provides \n$40 million to community health centers and public health departments \nto expand dental health services through the hiring of additional \ndental health professionals to serve low-income populations.\n  This is particularly a problem that needs to be addressed in areas \nwith severe dental health professional shortages, such as New Mexico. \nFor example, New Mexico ranked next to last in the Nation with just \n32.1 dentists per 100,000 population in 1998, according to HHS. This \ncompares to the national average of 48.4 per 100,000. Moreover, the \nnumber of dentists in New Mexico declined by 7 percent between 1991 and \n1998 while the State's population grew 12 percent. The result was a 17 \npercent decline in dentists per capita during the period.\n  With regard to American Indian and Alaska Native populations, the \nneed is so great and the funding so little that a comprehensive \nsolution is requiring throughout the IHS system. With respect to the \nunmet need, the GAO notes that ``American Indian and Alaska Native \nchildren aged 2 to 4 years old have five times the rate of dental decay \nthat all children have.''\n  Unfortunately, the GAO adds, ``. . . about one-fourth of IHS' dentist \npositions at 269 HIS and tribal facilities were vacant in April 2000. \nVacancies have been chronic at IHS facilities, in the past 5 years, at \nleast 67 facilities have had one or more dentist position vacant for at \nleast a year. According to IHS officials, the primary reason for these \nvacancies is that IHS is unable to provide a competitive salary for new \ndentists. . .''\n  The GAO continues, ``The IHS' dental personnel shortages translate \ninto a large unmet need for dental services among American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. IHS reports that only 24 percent of the eligible \npopulation had a dental visit in 1998. The personnel shortages have \nalso reduced the scope of services that facilities are able to provide. \nAccording to IHS officials, available services have concentrated more \non acute and emergency care, while routine and restorative care have \ndropped as a percentage of workload. Emergency services increased from \none-fifth of the workload in 1990 to more than one-third of the \nworkload in 1999.'\n  To help alleviate this workforce shortage, the ``Children's Dental \nHealth Improvement Act of 2001'' provides IHS with the authority to \noffer multi-year retention bonuses to dental providers offering \nservices through the IHS and tribal programs.\n  The bill also provides for some technical amendments to ensure that \ntribal organizations and community health centers are allowed to apply \nfor school-based dental sealant funding from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC.\n  And finally, to help address this ``silent epidemic,'' HHS \nimplemented what is referred to as the Oral Health Initiative, OHI, to \ncoordinate dental health services in both the Health Resources and \nServices Administration, HRSA, and the Center for Medicaid and Medicare \nServices, CMS, formerly known as the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. Despite the progress of the Initiative, it has no legal \nauthority unlike other programs that target specific health needs of \nchildren, such as Emergency Medical Services for Children or the \nTraumatic Brain Injury Program. Because it lacks formal status and \nprogram control, the OHI is susceptible to future disruptions or \ndispanding.\n\n  To ensure the continuation of the OHI, the ``Children's Health \nImprovement Act of 2001'' provides statutory authority for the OHI and \nauthorized funding of $25 million to improve the oral health of low-\nincome populations served by both the public and private sector.\n  The bipartisan legislation I am introducing today would improve the \naccess and delivery of dental health services to our Nation's children \nthrough Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, \nthe Indian Health Service, IHS, and our Nation's safety net of \ncommunity health centers. These problems are well-documented and call \nout for congressional action as soon as possible.\n  I would like to thank the American Dental Association, the American \nDental Education Association, the American Academy of Pediatric \nDentistry, the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc., \nthe National Association of Children's Hospitals, the American Dental \nHygienists' Association, and the Children's Dental Health Project for \ntheir outstanding support and/or their technical advice on this \nlegislation.

The legislation seeks to \n     improve the access and delivery of dental care to children \n     across the country.\n\n\n                         problems and solutions\n\n                     Lack of Coverage for Children\n\n       According to the Surgeon General's report, Oral Health in \n     America: A Report of the Surgeon General, that was issued in \n     2000, ``Although over 14 percent of children under 18 have no \n     form of private or public medical insurance, more than twice \n     that many, 23 million children, have no dental insurance.'' \n     The report adds, ``There are at least 2.6 children without \n     dental insurance for each child without medical insurance.''\n       Moreover, according to the General Accounting Office in a \n     report entitled Factors Contributing to Low Use of Dental \n     Services by Low-Income Populations (Sept. 2000), AHHS and \n     health center officials report that the demand for dental \n     services significantly exceeds the [urban and rural health] \n     centers' capacity to delivery it. In 1998 . . ., a little \n     more than half of the nearly 700 health center grantees \n     funded under this program had active dental programs.''\n       Legislative Proposal: The legislation would improve the \n     dental health of uninsured children by: Allowing states the \n     flexibility to utilize the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) to provide dental coverage to low-income \n     children below 200 percent of poverty that may have private \n     insurance for medical care but not dental services; and \n     providing $40 million to community health centers and public \n     health departments to expand dental health services through \n     the hiring of additional dentist health professionals to \n     serve low-income children.\n\n                         Lack of Access to Care\n\n       According to the GAO, ``While several factors influence the \n     access low-income groups have to dental care, the primary one \n     is limited dentist participation in Medicaid . . . Of 39 \n     states that provided information about dentists' \n     participation in Medicaid, 23 reported that fewer than half \n     of the states' dentists saw at least one Medicaid patient \n     during 1999.''\n       The GAO concludes this is due in large part to poor \n     reimbursement rates in Medicaid. As the GAO adds, ``Our \n     analysis showed that Medicaid payment rates are often well \n     below dentists' normal fees. Only 13 states had Medicaid \n     rates that exceeded two-thirds of the average regional fees \n     dentists charged. . ..''\n       Legislative Proposal: The legislation seeks to improve \n     access to dental services for low-income children in the \n     Medicaid program by providing $50 million as financial \n     incentives and planning grants to states to improve their \n     Medicaid programs in terms of adequate payment rates, \n     access to care, and improved service delivery.\n\n             Lack of Providers in Federally Funded Programs\n\n       With respect to community health centers, the GAO notes, \n     ``HHS and health center officials report that the demand for \n     dental services significantly exceeds the [urban and rural \n     health] centers' capacity to delivery it. In 1998 . . ., a \n     little more than half of the nearly 700 health center \n     grantees funded under this program had active dental \n     programs.''\n       With respect to the Indian Health Service (IHS) the GAO \n     adds, ``. . . about one-fourth of IHS'' dentist positions at \n     269 IHS and tribal facilities were vacant in April 2000. \n     Vacancies have been chronic at IHS facilities--in the past 5 \n     years, at least 67 facilities have had one or more dentist \n     positions vacant for at least a year. According to IHS \n     officials, the primary reason for these vacancies is that IHS \n     is unable to provide a competitive salary for new dentists.''\n       Legislative Proposal: The legislation seeks to improve \n     access to dental services for children served by community \n     health centers and the Indian Health Service by: Again, \n     providing $40 million to community health centers and public \n     health departments to expand dental health services through \n     the hiring of additional dental health professionals to serve \n     low-income children; and providing the Indian Health Service \n     with the authority to offer multi-year retention bonuses to \n     dental providers offering service through the IHS and tribal \n     programs.\n\n            Need for Improved Coordination and Collaboration\n\n       Despite Medicaid and SCHIP, dental care is the least \n     utilized core pediatric health service for low-income \n     children. There are 2.6 times more children lacking dental \n     coverage than health coverage and over a hundred million \n     Americans without dental insurance. Dental care is the most \n     frequently cited unmet health need of children, according to \n     their parents. In fact, the Health Interview Survey reveals \n     that the unmet need is three times greater than unmet need \n     for medical care, four times greater than unmet need for \n     prescription drugs, and five times greater than unmet need \n     for vision care. The third National Health and Nutrition \n     Interview Survey showed that dental caries [or dental decay] \n     is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood.\n       To help address this ``hidden epidemic,'' the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) enacted the Oral Health \n     Initiative (OHI) to coordinate dental health services in both \n     the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and \n     the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly \n     known as the Health Care Financing Administration).\n       Despite the progress of the initiative, it has no legal \n     authority unlike other programs\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n     that target specific health needs of children (e.g., \n     Emergency Medical Services for Children and the Traumatic \n     Brain Injury Program). Because it lacks formal status and \n     program control, the OHI is susceptible to future disruptions \n     or disbanding.\n       Legislative Proposal: The legislation provides statutory \n     authority for the OHI and authorized funding of $25 million \n     to improve the oral health of low-income populations served \n     by both the public and private sector.\n\n                            Other Provisions\n\n       In addition, the legislation contains the following \n     technical provisions:\n       Dental Health Professional Shortage Area Designation: The \n     bill streamlines the process for the designation of dental \n     health professional shortage areas.\n       Technical School-Based Sealant Provisions: The bill \n     includes technical provisions ensuring that entities eligible \n     for funding include both ``school-linked'' as well as school-\n     based organizations, clarifies that an eligible entitle can \n     be a public or non-profit health organization or tribal \n     organization.\n       Demonstration: The bill creates authority for HHS to \n     establish demonstration projects to increase access to dental \n     services for children in underserved areas.\n\n\n                        endorsing organizations\n\n       American Dental Association, American Dental Education \n     Association, American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, \n     National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc., \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals, American Dental \n     Hygienists' Association, Academy of General Dentistry, \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American \n     Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, American Academy \n     of Periodontology, American Association of Dental Examiners, \n     American Association of Dental Research, American Association \n     of Endodontists, American Association of Public Health \n     Dentistry, American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial \n     Surgeons, American Association of Orthodontists, American \n     Association of Women Dentists, American College of Dentists, \n     American College of Preventive Medicine, American Dental \n     Trade Association, American Public Health Association, \n     American Society of Dentistry for Children, American Student \n     Dental Association, Association of Clinicians of the \n     Underserved, Association of Maternal and Child Health \n     Programs, Association of State and Territorial Dental \n     Directors, Dental Dealers of America, Dental Manufacturers of \n     America, Inc., Family Voices, Hispanic Dental Association, \n     International College of Dentists USA, March of Dimes, \n     National Association of City and County Health Officers, \n     National Association of Local Boards of Health, National \n     Dental Association, National Health Law Program, New Mexico \n     Department of Health, Partnership for Prevention, Society of \n     American Indian Dentists, Special Care Dentistry, and United \n     Cerebral Palsy Associations.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I would like to bring your attention to \na hidden epidemic. This epidemic affects the overall health of \nchildren, especially children in low-income families. It has been \ncalled a ``hidden epidemic'' because it can be difficult to detect at a \nglance, and because it receives relatively little attention as a threat \nto children's health. But while this epidemic is ``hidden,'' it \nmanifests itself every day in the smiles of America's children.\n  The epidemic I am referring to is that of poor dental health. Dental \ndecay, a major cause of tooth loss, is the most prevalent chronic \ndisease of childhood. Each year, dental conditions cause children in \nthe U.S. to miss more than 750,000 days of school. One in ten children \nbetween the ages of five and eleven has never visited a dentist. This \nis a shocking and distressing statistic. The unfortunate trend cannot \nbe allowed to continue.\n  States are working hard to offer dental health services through their \nMedicaid programs and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nbut they need our help in meeting the challenge. The General Accounting \nOffice reported that the biggest reason low-income people lack dental \ncare is that not enough dentists participate in Medicaid. In Missouri, \nas in other states, some dentists simply choose not to accept Medicaid \npatients, while others cannot afford to accept them because Medicaid \nreimbursement is not sufficient to cover the costs of providing care. \nIn Missouri, there are more than 1,000 children on Medicaid for every \ndentist willing to serve them.\n  As a result, Medicaid patients must search far and wide to find a \ndentist and then face another challenge in traveling long distances to \nsee that dentist. Often, this requires hours of planning to arrange for \npublic or Medicaid-provided transportation, and several more hours of \nwaiting after the visit to be picked up and returned home. For many \nlower-income parents, these hours away from work will severely cut into \nthe family's income. Is it any wonder why so many children do not get \nthe preventive dental care they need, and are not seen by a dentist \nuntil they are in intense pain or have infections so severe that their \neyes have swelled shut? We cannot let this continue to happen to \nchildren in the United States.\n  There are many reasons for protecting children's oral health. For \ninstance, we know that when children have healthy smiles:\n  They chew more easily and gain more nutrients from the foods they \neat.\n  They learn to speak more quickly and clearly.\n  They look and feel more attractive improving self-confidence and \nwillingness to communicate with others.\n  They have better school attendance and pay more attention in class.\n  They avoid extensive and costly treatment of dental disease.\n  And they begin a lifetime of good dental habits.\n  For all of these reasons, I am proud to join with Senators Bingaman, \nCochran, Corzine, Collins, Daschle, Hutchison, and Lincoln in \nintroducing the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act. This \nbipartisan bill would improve dental care for low-income children. I \nappreciate Senator Bingaman's leadership on this bill, and I am honored \nfor the opportunity to work with him on this important issue. In order \nto make real improvements in our current situation, this legislation \ntakes a multi-faceted approach that addresses each component of the \nproblem.\n  First, this bill would give States the option to provide dental \ncoverage through the State Children's Health Insurance Program to low-\nincome children who may have private insurance for medical care but not \nfor dental services. Part of the reason for the epidemic in dental \nhealth is a lack of insurance for dental services. For every child \nwithout health insurance, there are nearly three children who are \nuninsured for dental care. By providing more of these children with \ninsurance, we can reduce their dental care costs--one of the many \nbarriers that low-income families face in getting dental care for their \nchildren. Although the bill does not call for additional SCHIP funding, \nI support a separate funding increase for this program. This increase \nis essential to giving States the ability to expand coverage to dental \nservices, especially States like Missouri, whose SCHIP programs are \ndoing an excellent job and as a result spend all of their existing \nfunding.\n  Second, this bill would invest $25 million in and provide statutory \nauthority to the Federal Oral Health Initiative. The Department of \nHealth and Human Services initiated the Oral Health Initiative to \ncoordinate its dental health services. These funds would be used to \npromote public-private partnerships and cooperation among Federal \nagencies in order to reduce the profound disparities in oral health \namong vulnerable populations. Low-income people are the hardest hit \nwhen it comes to dental disease. Compared to their counterparts in \nhigher-income families, poor children have five times more untreated \ndental disease and poor teens are half as likely to visit a dentist \nannually. Giving legal authority to this Initiative will allow it to \nwork on improving access to dental health without fear of future \ndisruptions or disbanding and the increased funding will allow for the \nOral Health Initiative's much-needed expansion.\n  Third, this bill would offer States the opportunity to apply for $50 \nmillion in Federal grants to assist them in improving dental coverage \nfor children through Medicaid. The financial incentives and planning \ngrants included in the bill would enable states to improve payment \nrates, access to care, and service delivery. It also includes an \ninvestment of $40 million for community health centers and public \nhealth departments to increase the number of dental health \nprofessionals who serve low-income children. With these funds, we can \nincrease access to dental care for low-income children, shorten travel \ntimes and the wait for a dental appointment. This is especially \nimportant in rural areas, which generally face a greater shortage of \nproviders.\n  The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act has gained the support \nof over twenty dental health organizations, including the American \nAcademy of Pediatric Dentistry and the\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\nAmerican Dental Association. Other supporters include the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, and the National Association of Community Health Centers. \nWith their support, and the leadership of my fellow cosponsors of this \nbill, I hope that we can have a profound impact on dental health and \nensure that America's low-income children will have healthy, beautiful \nsmiles.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1627. A bill to enhance the security of the international borders \nof the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join with the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, who is my ranking member on the Technology and \nTerrorism Subcommittee of Judiciary, to introduce a piece of \nlegislation.\n  On October 12, the committee held a hearing on what could be done to \ntechnologically improve our visa entry system. It has become very \nclear, now that we know all 19 of the terrorists essentially had, at \nsome time, valid visas, that our system is such that it really cannot \ncountermand or alert our Government to any possible terrorist entering \nthis country legally through our visa system.\n  We have about 7 million nonimmigrants entering the U.S. a year. About \n4 million of them disappear and are unaccounted for. We have 23 million \npeople coming in on visa waivers from 29 different countries. We have \nan unregulated student visa program. And we also have about 300 million \npeople coming across borders back and forth. We have about 5 million \ncontainers a year that come in through the ports of entry, fewer than 2 \npercent of them searched.\n  The ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, and I \nhave been very concerned about this. As a product of the hearing, we \nbelieved that the most important thing we could do was create a \ncentralized data base, using cutting-edge technology, and also enabling \nthat data base to interface between our intelligence agencies, our law \nenforcement agencies, and our State Department, to create a kind of \nlookout data base so that the situation that happened--whereby in Saudi \nArabia 15 terrorists came in to the State Department consul's office \nand got visas, and we were told there was no intelligence to alert the \nsystem--would not, in fact, happen in the future. This legislation \nwould create that kind of centralized, integrated data base.\n  Additionally, we provide for a biometric visa smart card. We provide \nthat all Federal identity permit and license documents be fraud-\nresistant and tamper-resistant. We provide for passenger manifests of \nall commercial transportation vehicles to go into that data base, \nagain, so that it can alert the proper authorities about who is about \nto come into the U.S. Law enforcement information, intelligence \ninformation all combine to send certain signals.\n  We also provide regulation and school responsibility for the student \nvisa program. I am very pleased to indicate that Senator Kyl and I are \njoined by Senators Kohl, Snowe, Hatch, Thurmond, and Bond.\n  I would like to now defer to my colleague from Arizona, the ranking \nmember of our Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein, the chairman of \nthe Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, \nfor her leadership both in the holding of the hearing that she \nmentioned, as well as putting together the legislation we introduce \nthis evening.\n  Something happened on September 11 that, with one exception, really \nhad not happened since the War of 1812 when British soldiers came into \nthe United States and literally attacked Americans on our own soil. \nExcept for the first attack on the World Trade Center, that did not \nhappen again until September 11, when over 6,000 people were killed by \nforeigners who were here and attacked Americans in our country.\n  At that point, we began to realize that we had to begin to close the \nloopholes in our immigration system that, frankly, were allowing just \nabout anybody and everybody to come into this country and, as we have \nlearned, to do some very bad things to Americans here in our own \ncountry.\n  So this legislation would do a variety of things, as Senator \nFeinstein has said, beginning with the creation of a data base that \nwould enable us to know what the FBI knows, what the CIA knows, what \nthe INS knows, what the State Department knows.\n  Today, these different computers do not talk to each other, so that \nwhen a consular officer is asked to grant a visa to someone, he may \nhave no information indicating this person should be denied the visa, \nyet it is quite possible that person is not someone we would want to \nhave come into the United States.\n  In our hearing, the representative from the State Department said the \nState Department personnel who granted visas to these 19 terrorists \nwere heartbroken.\n  She said it is like when a person hits the little kid who runs out \nfrom between the parked cars. It obviously is not the driver's fault, \nbut you feel horrible about it. It is obviously not the fault of the \npeople in the State Department who granted these visas, but they felt \nhorrible about it because they didn't have the information to tell them \nthat those visas should have been denied.\n  This bill will enable us to put all of that information into one \nsimple database so that our consular offices will know to whom to grant \nthe visas and who should not receive them. It will make a lot of other \nchanges, as Senator Feinstein said, all of which are designed to gain \nbetter for the process of admitting people into the country, for \nknowing when they exit the country, for ensuring that people who come \nhere to study in fact come here and study and don't come on a pretext, \nas at least one of these terrorists did, and a variety of other things \nthat take advantage of the technology we have today.\n  The great thing about this bill, as verified by the hearing and some \nother very hard work Senator Feinstein has done on her own, is to \ndetermine that the technology is here. We can apply technology to this \nproblem. The other piece of good news is that it doesn't cost that \nmuch, relatively speaking. In fact, we are going to have to employ \ntechnology to save money. We can't possibly hire enough people or take \nall of the time it would take to do this if we don't employ technology.\n  We are very excited about the prospect of applying technology to a \nnew challenge here in America to close the loopholes in our immigration \nlaw, to ensure or at least be a lot more sure that we are not letting \nterrorists come into this country or stay in this country when they \nshouldn't be here. I am proud to join my colleague Senator Feinstein in \nthe introduction of this legislation. I hope we can find a way very \nearly on to see that it gets considered in the proper fora so that the \nfull Senate will have an opportunity to support the legislation and \nsupport the President, who has called for exactly this kind of \napproach.\n  Mr. President, today, Senators Feinstein and I, joined by Senators \nSnowe, Hatch, Thurmond, Bond, and Kohl, introduce the Visa Entry Reform \nAct, legislation that will strengthen our U.S. visa system, and allow \nbetter tracking and monitoring of foreign nationals in the United \nStates who present national security risks to our country.\n  Last week the President signed into law anti-terrorism legislation \nthat will provide many of the tools necessary to keep terrorists out of \nthe United States, and to detain those terrorists who have entered our \ncountry. That law provides new, better definitions of what a terrorist \norganization is, and provides the Attorney General greater authority to \ndetain members of such organizations. It clarifies that individuals who \nhave contributed to such organizations, even if such support went to \nnonterrorist activities of the organizations, are inadmissible and \ndeportable. The new law also authorizes the tripling of Border Patrol, \nCustoms inspectors, and INS inspectors at the northern border, a \nminimal addition, given the expected high rates of attrition for these \nagencies over the next\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\nfive years, and the continued and growing need for personnel along the \nsouthwest border.\n  Yesterday, the President announced three initiatives in our fight to \ntrack down terrorists: a task force, headed by the deputy assistant \ndirector of the FBI for intelligence, to work toward greater \ncoordination of intelligence and law enforcement information on \nterrorists; a comprehensive study of our never-implemented foreign \nstudent tracking system; and an initiative to provide much-needed \ncoordination among Customs and INS officials in the United States, \nCanada, and Mexico.\n  These are all important tools, and will be instrumental in our \noverall efforts to track down terrorists. The legislation that we \nintroduce today will complement our recent efforts. Under the Visa \nEntry Reform Act of 2001, law enforcement, the Departments of \nTransportation and State, and all of our intelligence agencies will be \nconnected by a comprehensive database, headed by the Director of \nHomeland Defense, with necessary shared law enforcement and \nintelligence information to thwart attempts to enter the country and to \nfind terrorists who have made their way into the United States.\n  Under our bill, terrorists will be deprived of the ability to present \nfake or altered international documents in order to gain entrance, or \nstay here. Foreign nationals will be provided with a new fraud-proof \n``SmartVisa'' card, using new technology that would include a person's \nfingerprints or other forms of ``biometric'' identification. These \ncards would be used by visitors upon exit and entry into the United \nStates, and would alert authorities immediately if a visa has expired \nor a red flag is raised by a Federal agency. Our bill would also \nstrengthen other Federal identification documents such as pilots' \nlicenses, visas, immigration work authorization cards, and others by \nrequiring that they be fraud- and tamper-resistant, contain biometric \ndata, and, if applicable, include the visa's expiration date.\n  Another provision of the bill would require that the 29 nations that \nparticipate in the government's visa waiver program be required, after \n1 year, to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports. In \naddition, our bill would require that, after 2 years, all countries \nthat participate include biometric data on their passports. INS \ninspectors would have to check passport numbers and, where available, \nbiometric information with the new, centralized information database. \nCountries that participate in the program would be required to report \nstolen passport numbers to the State Department in order to continue to \nparticipate in the program.\n  Another section of our bill will make a significant difference in our \nefforts to stop terrorists from ever entering our country. Section six \nof the bill will require that passenger manifests on all flights \nscheduled to come to the United States be forwarded in real-time, and \nthen cleared, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. All cruise \nand cargo lines and cross-border bus lines would also have to submit \nsuch lists to the INS. Our bill also removes a current U.S. requirement \nthat all passengers on flights to the United States be cleared by the \nINS within 45 minutes of arrival. Clearly, in some circumstances, the \nINS will need more time to clear all prospective entrants to the United \nStates. These simple steps would give law enforcement advance notice of \nforeigners coming into the country, particularly visitors or immigrants \nwho pose security threats to the United States.\n  The Visa Entry Reform Act will also provide much needed reforms and \nrequirements in our U.S. foreign student visa program, which has \nallowed numerous foreigners to enter the country without ever attending \nclasses and with lax oversight by the Federal Government. The system is \nrife with abuse, with numerous examples of fraud and bribery by persons \nseeking student visas.\n  Just as alarming, in the past decade, more than 16,000 people have \nentered the United States on student visas from states included on the \ngovernment's list of terrorist sponsors. Notwithstanding that Syria is \none of the countries on the list, the State Department recently issued \nvisas to 14 Syrian nationals so that they could attend flight schools \nin Fort Worth, TX.\n  Our legislation would prevent most persons from obtaining student \nvisas if they come from terrorist-supporting states such as Iran, Iraq, \nSudan, Libya, and Syria, with the authority of the Secretary of State \nto waive the bar. Additionally, our bill would require the INS to \nconduct background checks before the State Department issues the visas. \nU.S. educational institutions would also be required to immediately \nnotify the INS when a foreign student violates the term of the visa by \nfailing to show up for class or leaving school early.\n  For the first time since the War of 1812, the United States has faced \na massive attack from foreigners on our own soil. Every one of the \nterrorists who committed the September 11 atrocities were foreign \nnationals who had entered the United States legally through our visa \nsystem. None of them should have been allowed entry due to their ties \nto terrorist organizations, and yet even those whose visas had expired \nwere not expelled.\n  Mohamed Atta, for example, the suspected ringleader of the attacks, \nwas allowed into the United States on a tourist visa, even though he \nmade clear his intentions to go to flight school while in the United \nStates. Clearly, at the very least, he should have been queried about \nwhy he was using his tourist visa to attend flight school.\n  We also know that two of the terrorists were on watch lists that \nshould have been provided to the State Department and the INS, in order \nto prevent their entry to the United States.\n  Another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, was here on a student visa that had \nexpired as of September 11. Hani Hanjour never attended class. In \naddition, at least two other visitor visa-holders overstayed their \nvisa. In testimony before my own Senate subcommittee, U.S. officials \nhave told us that they possess little information about foreigners who \ncome into this country, how many there are, and even whether they leave \nwhen required by their visas. America is a nation that welcomes \ninternational visitors--and should remain so. But terrorists have taken \nadvantage of our system and its openness. Now that we face new threats \nto our homeland, it is time we restore some balance to our immigration \npolicy.\n\n  As former chairman and now ranking Republican of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Terrorism Subcommittee, I have long suggested, and strongly \nsupported, many of the anti-terrorism and immigration initiatives now \nbeing advocated by Republicans and Democrats alike. In my sadness about \nthe overwhelming and tragic events that took thousands of precious \nlives, I am resolved to push forward on all fronts to fight against \nterrorism. That means delivering justice to those who are responsible \nfor the lives lost on September 11, and reorganizing the institutions \nof government so that the law-abiding can continue to live their lives \nin freedom. I hope that we will soon pass, the Congress will pass, the \nVisa Entry Reform Act. It will make a difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Arizona for those comments. He is very hard working, and it has \nbeen a great pleasure for me to be able to work with him. He and I hope \nto sit down with Senators Kennedy and Brownback next week. I think all \nfour of us believe that if it is possible to have one bill, we would \nlike to have one bill. We have taken on the technology aspect of our \nbill. But bottom line, the Senator from Arizona is correct, our Nation \nhas essentially been laid back when it comes to matters of really \nscrupulously trying to set up a system that can provide a measure of \nprotection for our national security.\n  It has become very clear now, post September 11, that we must take \nsteps to do so. Otherwise, we are derelict in our duty to protect \nAmerican citizens. This bill does it.\n  Because the student visa part of it has been somewhat controversial, \nthis morning I was visited by the chancellor of the California State \nUniversity system. This is the largest system in the United States, \nwith about 380,000 students. He came in to indicate his support for our \nbill, for the acknowledgment that he knows that schools across America \nalso have to assume more responsibility to see that there is a system \nwhere there is some regulation.\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\nRight now, a student can apply to a number of schools, get accepted to \na number, and show up at none. And there is no reporting.\n  We would change this. The university association will be supportive \nof these changes.\n  I am very optimistic that we have an opportunity, in meeting with \nSenators Kennedy and Brownback, to put together one bill that could \nprovide some reform to a porous visa entry system.\n  As I said, I sit as the chair of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information. Last \nmonth, we held a hearing into the need for new technologies to assist \nour government agencies in keeping terrorists out of the United States.\n  The testimony at that hearing was very illuminating. We were given a \npicture of an immigration system in chaos, and a border control system \nthat acts like a sieve. Agencies don't communicate with each other. \nComputers are incompatible. And even in instances where technological \nleaps have been made--like the issuance of more than 4.5 million \n``smart'' border crossing cards with biometric data--the technology is \nnot even used.\n  Let me give some specific examples of the testimony we heard before \nour subcommittee:\n  There are 29 countries that now participate in a ``visa waiver'' \nprogram that invites 23 million visitors a year to our country. \nTravelers from these countries do not have to get a visa before \nentering the United States, so nobody knows when they arrive, and \nnobody knows whether they leave. Passports don't have to be machine-\nreadable or tamper-proof, and the result is millions of people coming \nand going with no accountability, and no way to find them if they \nchoose to stay and do mischief.\n  We also heard in our subcommittee that the student visa program is \nunregulated and subject to abuse and fraud. Schools don't keep track of \nstudents, the INS does not find out when the students leave or whether \nthey even show up for classes, and many students overstay their visas \nby years. Furthermore, students who apply to many schools can receive \nmultiple documents--called ``I-20'' forms--giving them the right to \nentry. Because they only need one of these forms, the possibility for \nfraud is enormous. Additional forms are sold, and many enter the \ncountry with no real plans to go to school here at all.\n  In our hearing, Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary of State for \nConsular Affairs, said that the lack of information sharing is a \n``colossal intelligence failure'' and that the State Department ``had \nno information on the terrorists from law enforcement.'' Personally, I \nam amazed that a person can apply for a visa, be granted a visa, and \nthat there is no mechanism by which the FBI or CIA can enter a code \ninto the system to raise a red flag on individuals known to have links \nto terrorist groups and pose a national threat. In the wake of \nSeptember 11th, it is hard for me to fathom how a terrorist might be \npermitted to enter the U.S. because our government agencies aren't \nsharing information.\n\n  This was one, sobering hearing. It made it clear to all who were \npresent that our borders act only as a sieve, essentially allowing easy \naccess to all who would do us harm. Something must be done, and \nsomething must be done now.\n  When I arrived in the Senate in 1992, I brought with me the concerns \nof millions of Californians about the porous nature of the Southwest \nborder. When I tried to address the problems there, I met with the same \nresponse over and over again--``nothing can be done.''\n  But something was done, and our Southwest border is now far more \ndifficult to transit.\n  Here, too, I am now told that ``nothing can be done'' to keep \nterrorists from entering the country on student visas, or through the \nvisa waiver program, or through some other program. I am told that \ncommerce and trade are too important. Or that the technology simply \ndoes not exist. Or that the agencies involved are incapable of \ncooperating in a way that would keep our country safe from those who \ntry to enter.\n  Well, I did not accept those arguments then, and I do not accept them \nnow. There are things we can do to solve some of these problems, and \nthis issue is too important to wait.\n  Let me talk about how this legislation would address these problems.\n  First, the most important piece of this solution is the creation of \none, central database containing all the information our government has \nabout foreign nationals who cross the border into the United States. \nPrivate industry can help in this effort--in fact, I recently met with \nLarry Ellison, Chairman of Oracle, who wrote me a letter offering the \nservices of his company, free of charge, in the creation of the \nnecessary software.\n  Right now, our government agencies use different systems, with \ndifferent information, in different formats. And they often refuse to \nshare that information with other agencies within our own government. \nThis is not acceptable.\n  When a terrorist presents himself at a consular office asking for a \nvisa, or at a border crossing with a passport, we need to make sure \nthat his name and identifying information is checked against an \naccurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive database. Period.\n\n  My legislation will require the creation of this central database, \nand will require the cooperation of all U.S. government agencies in \nproviding accurate and compatible information to that system.\n  Incidentally, this legislation also contains strict privacy \nprovisions, limiting access to this database to authorized federal \nofficials. And the bill contains severe penalties for wrongful access \nor misuse of information contained in the database.\n  Second, the legislation I will introduce will include concrete steps \nto restore the integrity to the immigration and visa process, including \nthe following:\n  First, the legislation requires all foreign nationals to be \nfingerprinted, and, when appropriate, submit other biometric data, to \nthe State Department when applying for a visa. This provision should \nhelp eliminate fraud, as well as identify potential threats to the \ncountry before they gain access.\n  Second, we include reforms of the visa waiver program, so that any \ncountry wishing to participate in that program must quickly provide its \ncitizens with tamper-proof, machine-readable passports, eventually with \nbiometric data to help verify identity at ports of entry.\n  Third, we establish a robust ``SmartVisa'' program. Newly issued \nvisas must contain biometric data and other identifying information--\nlike more than 4 million already do on the Southwest border--and, just \nas importantly, our own officials at the border and other ports of \nentry must have the equipment necessary to read those new smart cards.\n  Next, we worked closely with the university community in crafting \nnew, strict requirements for the student visa program, to crack down on \nfraud, make sure that students really are attending classes, and give \nthe government the ability to track any foreign national who arrives on \na student visa but fails to enroll in school.\n  The legislation prohibits the issuance of a student visa to any \ncitizen of a country identified by the State Department as a terrorist-\nsupporting nation. There is a waiver provision to this prohibition, \nhowever, allowing the State Department to allow students even from \nthese countries after review and evaluation.\n  We require that airlines, cruiselines, buslines, and other \ntransportation services provide passenger and crew manifests to law \nenforcement before arrival, so that any potential terrorists or other \nwrongdoers can be singled out before they arrive in this country and \ndisappear into the general populace.\n  The bill contains a number of other related provisions as well, but \nthe gist of this legislation is this:\n  Where we can provide law enforcement more information about \npotentially dangerous foreign nationals, we do so;\n  Where we can reform our border-crossing system to weed out or deter \nterrorists or others who would do us harm, we do so;\n  And where we can update technology to meet the demands of the modern \nwar against terror, we do that as well.\n  As we prepare to modify our immigration system, we must be sure to \nenact changes that are realistic and\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\nfeasible. We must also provide the necessary tools to implement them.\n  Our Nation will be no more secure tomorrow if we create new top of \nthe line databases and no not see to it that government agencies share \ncritical information.\n  We will be no safer tomorrow if we do not create a workable entry-\nexit tracking system to ensure that terrorists do not enter the U.S. \nand blend into our communities without detection.\n  And we will be no safer if we simply authorize new programs and \ninformation sharing, but do not provide the resources necessary to put \nthe new technology at the border, train agents appropriately, and \nrequire our various government agencies to cooperate in this effort.\n  We have a lot to do and I am confident that we will move swiftly and \nwith great care to address these important issues. The legislation I \nintroduce today is an important, and strong, first step. But this is \nonly the beginning of a long, difficult process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support us on this legislation. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join with Senators Feinstein \nand Kyl in introducing the Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001.\n  Both of these leaders have worked feverishly to bring this bipartisan \nbill to fruition and I have very much appreciated the opportunity to \nwork with them in assembling a strong and meaningful package to help \nsecure our homeland.\n  The bottom line is, at this extraordinary time, in the wake of \nhorrific attacks from without against innocent lives within our \nborders, we must take every conceivable step with regard to those \nvariables we can control in securing our Nation. How can we do anything \nless when it has become so abundantly and tragically apparent that \nadmittance into this country cannot and must not be the ``X-Factor'' in \nprotecting our homeland?\n  Entry into this country is a privilege, not a right, and it's a \nprivilege that's clearly been violated by evildoers who were well aware \nof inherent weaknesses in the system. Just look at the story of Mohamed \nAtta, coming into Miami, he told the INS that he was returning to the \nU.S. to continue flight training, despite the fact that he presented \nthem with a tourist visa, not the student required visa for his \npurposes, and they let him in. INS has since said that Atta had filed \nmonths earlier to change his status from tourist to student so they let \nhim in, despite long-standing policy that once you leave the country, \nyou're considered to have abandoned your change of status request.\n  What this bill is about is stopping dangerous aliens from entering \nour country at their point-of-origin and their point of entry by giving \nthose Federal agencies charged with that responsibility the tools \nnecessary to do the job. Now, some say the tools we need are better \ntechnologies, some say better information, some say better \ncoordination. The beauty of this bill is that it stands on all three \nlegs, because I can tell you if there's one thing I learned from my \nexperience in working on these issues on the House Foreign Affairs \nInternational Operations Subcommittee it's that we're only going to get \nto the root of the problem with a comprehensive approach.\n  This was clear from the aftermath of our investigation of the comings \nand goings of the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, \nthe radical Egyptian cleric Sheikh Rahman. We found that the Sheikh had \nentered and exited the country five times totally unimpeded, even after \nthe State Department formally revoked his visa and even after the INS \ngranted him permanent resident status. In fact, in March of 1992, the \nINS rescinded that status which was granted in Newark, New Jersey about \na year before.\n  But then, unbelievably, the Sheikh requested asylum in a hearing \nbefore an immigration judge in the very same city, got a second \nhearing, and continued to remain in the country even after the bombing, \nwith the Justice Department rejecting holding Rahman in custody pending \nthe outcome of deportation proceedings and the asylum application, \nstating that ``in the absence of concrete evidence that Rahman is \nparticipating in or involved in planning acts of terrorism, the \nassumption of that burden, upon the U.S. Government, is considered \nunwarranted.''\n  To address the trail of errors, I introduced legislation to modernize \nthe State Department's antiquated microfiche lookout system, but as \nwe've painfully learned in the interim, such a system is only as good \nas the information they can access. That's why we fought tooth and nail \nto require information sharing between the FBI and the State \nDepartment, but even then it was only a watered-down provision that \neventually passed into law in 1994, with even that sunsetting in 1997 \nwith a brief extension lapsing in 1998.\n  So I'm pleased that the terrorism bill we just passed does require \ninformation sharing between the State Department and the FBI, but we \ncan and must do more, we must also require information sharing among \nall agencies like the CIA, DEA, INS, and Customs.\n  And that's what this bill does, along with my measure that's included \nto establish ``Terrorist Lookout Committees'' at every embassy, which \nare required to meet on a monthly basis and report on their knowledge \nor lack of knowledge of anyone who should be excluded from the U.S. \nUltimately, each Deputy Chief of Mission would be responsible for this \ninformation, because to paraphrase Admiral Rickover, unless you can \nidentify the person who's responsible when something goes wrong, then \nyou have never had anyone really responsible.\n  We should also know who and what is in our waters and be pro-active \nin preventing potential threats from reaching our shores. As I \nmentioned at a recent Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee hearing, a \nterrorist act involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear \nweapons at one of our seaports could result in the extensive loss of \nlives. In that light, I'm pleased this bill also includes a measure I \ndeveloped that requires incoming vessels to submit to the Coast Guard \ncrew and passenger manifests as background on the vessel 96 hours \nbefore arrival.\n  And finally, we ought to ensure that the person standing in front of \nthe INS agent at the border is the same person who applied for that \nvisa. It does no good to do every background check in the world \noverseas, only to have someone else actually show up at our doorstep. \nThe fact is, we have the so-called ``biometric technology'' available \nto close this gap, and I'm pleased that my measure requiring \nfingerprinting for visa applicants both abroad and at the border has \nbeen included.\n  As the President said just the other day, ``We're going to start \nasking a lot of questions that heretofore have not been asked.'' By \ngiving the Director of Homeland Security the responsibility of \ndeveloping a centralized ``lookout'' database for all of this \ninformation, along with instituting tighter application and screening \nprocedures and increased oversight for student visas, we will close the \nloopholes and help bring all our Nation's resources to bear in securing \nour nation.\n  This is a crucial bill in our war on terrorism and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/01/senate-section/article/S11389-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11389-S11390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 176--RELATING TO EXPENDITURES FOR OFFICIAL OFFICE \n                                EXPENSES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Human Germline Gene \n     Modification Prohibition Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC.  02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human Germline gene modification is not needed to save \n     lives, or alleviate suffering, of existing people. Its target \n     population is ``prospective people'' who have not been \n     conceived.\n       (2) The cultural impact of treating humans as biologically \n     perfectible artifacts would be entirely negative. People who \n     fall short of some technically achievable ideal would be seen \n     as ``damaged goods'', while the standards for what is \n     genetically desirable will be those of the society's \n     economically and politically dominant groups. This will only \n     increase prejudices and discrimination in a society where too \n     many such prejudices already exist.\n       (3) There is no way to be accountable to those in future \n     generations who are harmed or stigmatized by wrongful or \n     unsuccessful human germline modifications of themselves or \n     their ancestors.\n       (4) The negative effects of human germline manipulation \n     would not be fully known for generations, if ever, meaning \n     that countless people will have been exposed to harm probably \n     often fatal as the result of only a few instances of germline \n     manipulations.\n       (5) All people have the right to have been conceived, \n     gestated, and born without genetic manipulation.\n\n     SEC.  03. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n                ``CHAPTER 16--GERMLINE GENE MODIFICATION\n\n``Sec.\n``301. Definitions\n``302. Prohibition on germline gene modification.\n\n     ``Sec. 301. Definitions\n\n       ``In this chapter:\n       (1) Human germline gene modification.--The term `human \n     germline gene modification' means the intentional \n     modification of DNA in any human cell (including human eggs, \n     sperm, fertilized eggs, zygotes, blastocysts, embryos, or any \n     precursor cells that will differentiate into gametes or can \n     be manipulated to so do) for the purpose of producing a \n     genetic change which can be passed on to future individuals, \n     including inserting, deleting or altering DNA from any \n     source, and in any form, such as nuclei, chromosomes, \n     nuclear, mitochondrial, and synthetic DNA. The term does not \n     include any modification of cells that are not a part of and \n     will not be used to create human embryos. Nor does it include \n     the change of DNA involved in the normal process of sexual \n     reproduction.\n       ``(2) Human haploid cell.--The term `haploid cell' means a \n     cell that contains only a single copy of each of the human \n     chromosomes, such as eggs, sperm, and their precursors.\n       ``(3) Somatic cell.--The term `somatic cell' means a \n     diploid cell (having two sets of the chromosomes of almost \n     all body cells) obtained or derived from a living or deceased \n     human body at any stage of development. Somatic cells are \n     diploid cells that are not precursors of either eggs or \n     sperm. A genetic modification of somatic cells is therefore \n     not germline genetic modification.\n       Rule of Construction: Nothing in this Act is intended to \n     limit somatic cell gene therapy, or to effect research \n     involving human pluripotent stem cells.\n\n     ``Sec. 302.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2647), making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and fair conference, have \n     agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to certain \n     amendments of the Senate, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, signed by all of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 30, 2001.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee, I bring to the attention of the Senate the highlights of \nthe conference report on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2002, H.R. 2647.\n  The conference report totals $2.97 billion, and parallels closely the \nbill which passed the Senate in July with very broad support. Total \nfunding is $10 million below the amount requested by the Legislative \nBranch.\n  Funding included in this bill includes $607 million for the Senate, \nand $878 million for the House of Representatives.\n  Funding for the rest of the legislative branch totals $1.49 billion. \nThese agencies perform critical functions enabling Congress to operate \neffectively and safely--particularly the Capitol Police.\n  For the Library of Congress and the Congressional Research Service, \nthe bill includes $452 million. The decrease of $60 million below the \nenacted level is attributable to last year's one-time appropriation for \nthe digital preservation project.\n  The recommendation for the Library will enable the Congressional \nResearch Service to hire staff in some critical areas, particularly \ntechnology policy.\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\n Also in the Library's budget is additional funding to reduce the Law \nLibrary arrearage, funding for the newly-authorized Veterans Oral \nHistory Project, and funds to support the preservation of and access to \nthe American Folklife Center's collection.\n  For the General Accounting Office, a total of $422 million is \nincluded. This level will enable GAO to hire staff in some critical \nareas.\n  A total of $126 million is included for the U.S. Capitol Police, who \nhave been performing heroically these past several weeks and to whom we \nall owe a debt of gratitude. The amount provided represents an increase \nof $3.9 million over the budget request, which will provide for 79 \nadditional officers, the highest number the Capitol Police believe they \ncan recruit and train next year. It will also provide comparability for \nthe Capitol Police in the pay scales of the Park Police and the Secret \nService--Uniformed Division so the Capitol Police are able to retain \ntheir officers.\n  For the Architect of the Capitol, funding would total $320 million. \nThis includes $70 million for the Capitol Visitor Center expansion \nspace which is absolutely critical for heightened security needs. It \nalso includes sufficient funding to hire necessary worker safety-\nrelated and security-related positions.\n  For the Government Printing Office, a total of $110 million is \nincluded, of which $81 million is for Congressional printing and \nbinding. The amount recommended will provide for normal pay and \ninflation-related increases.\n  The conference report includes a provision that I feel very strongly \nabout--a Senate employee transit subsidy increase to $65 per month. \nThis increase puts the Senate on par with the House and the Executive \nBranch. I can think of no better way to encourage the use of mass \ntransit than through raising this benefit. Fewer cars on the Senate \nside of the Capitol means less traffic congestion, a cleaner \nenvironment, and a more secure campus.\n  I thank the full committee chairman, Senator Byrd, for his support \nand the high priority he has placed on this bill. In addition, I wish \nto thank the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Stevens, who \nhas been actively involved in and very supportive of this bill.\n  Finally, I am grateful to the subcommittee ranking member, Senator \nBennett, for his critical role in bringing this conference report \ntogether. I have enjoyed working with him and am thankful for his \nleadership on these matters.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2647, \nthe Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $2.974 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $2.509 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $2.941 billion in 2002. \nThe conference report is at the appropriations subcommittee's Section \n302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. The conference \nreport does not include any emergency designations.\n  I commend Senators Byrd and Stevens, as well as Senators Durbin and \nBennett, for their bipartisan effort in moving the conference report to \nthe Legislative Branch bill so quickly. It is important that the Senate \nact as expeditiously in completing the remaining appropriations bills.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 2647, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS\n                                ACT, 2002\n    [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in million of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority.....................     2,974          99     3,073\n  Outlays..............................     2,941          99     3,040\nSenate 302(b) allocation:*\n  Budget Authority.....................     2,974          99     3,073\n  Outlays..............................     2,941          99     3,040\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.....................     2,987          99     3,086\n  Outlays..............................     2,964          99     3,063\nHouse-passed**:\n  Budget Authority.....................     2,240          99     2,339\n  Outlays..............................     2,369          99     2,468\nSenate-passed**:\n  Budget Authority.....................     1,944          99     2,043\n  Outlays..............................     2,063          99     2,162\n \n     CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:*\n  Budget Authority.....................\n  Outlays..............................\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.....................
