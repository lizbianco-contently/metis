The Senate is very pleased today to have as \nour guest Chaplain Mrs. Anne Graham Lotz, AnGeL Ministries, Raleigh, \nNC, who will lead the Senate in prayer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                                 Prayer\n\n  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:\n  Would you pray with me, please.\n  Our father, we bow before You and we acknowledge You as the one true \nliving God. In the darkness, You are our light. In a time of despair, \nYou are our hope. And in time of grief, You are our comfort. At this \ntime of war, You are our peace.\n  In the words of the prophet Daniel: We come to You as the great and \nawesome God, one who keeps His covenant of love with generations, with \nthose who love Him and obey Him. And we come to You, O God, and we \nacknowledge that You are righteous, but we are wrong. We have done so \nmany wrong things because we are sinners. And yet You are merciful and \nforgiving. We have been wicked. We have turned away from Your laws and \ndecrees. We have not listened to Your prophets who spoke in Your name.\n  Yet, Lord, we come to You now pleading for Your mercy. We ask that \nYou hear the prayers and petitions of Your servants, not because we are \nrighteous but because You are merciful and forgiving. We plead for Your \nmercy.\n  Dear God, please hear our prayer. As we pray, forgive us our sin. We \npray, God, bless America. And we ask this claiming the promise in II \nChronicles, chapter 7, when You have said that a Nation who is \nidentified with You, whether they are shaken economically or \nfinancially or personally or nationally or militarily, that if that \nNation that is identified with You would humble themselves and pray and \nseek Your face and turn from their wicked ways, You would hear our \nprayer; that You would forgive our sin; that You would heal our land.\n  So, sovereign Lord, we ask, please, God of the universe, God of \nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Father of Jesus Christ, we humbly ask that \nas we repent of our sin, You would hear our prayer; that You would \nforgive; that You would heal our land. We pray this for the glory of \nYour name. And we ask these things in the name of Your son and our \nsaviour, Jesus Christ, who, through his own shed blood on the cross, \noffers us forgiveness of our sin and reconciliation with You.\n  It is in the name of Jesus Christ that we pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8871-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8871-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, during my almost 30 years in the Senate, \nI have been honored to welcome dozens of remarkably gifted guest \nChaplains. Today's guest Chaplain, Anne Graham Lotz, of Raleigh, NC, my \nhometown, is\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\none of North Carolina's most distinguished citizens and one of \nAmerica's most beloved evangelists who, for more than 25 years, has \nbeen taking the good news of Jesus Christ across the United States and \nto many foreign countries.\n  Of course, she is the daughter of the remarkable two people, Billy \nand Ruth Graham. And this remarkable lady has preached the gospel to \nhundreds of thousands of Americans, filling up large civic arenas in \ncountless major U.S. cities as well.\n  Anne Graham Lotz has addressed the United Nations General Assembly in \nNew York. She represented her distinguished father at Amsterdam 2000, \nthe largest gathering of evangelists in history.\n  Anne Graham Lotz is a leader of Just Give Me Jesus, which is making a \nnationwide tour to spark a spiritual revival. This past April, Anne's \ntour came to Raleigh where more than 26,000 people packed our city's \nlargest arena for 2 days of singing and praying and teaching, led by--\nwho else?--Anne Graham Lotz.\n  Anne is the final guest Chaplain whom Dot Helms and I will have the \nprivilege of hosting. That is appropriate because Dot's and my family \nhave known and loved her and her great family for a long time.\n  The first time I heard Anne's blessed father, Billy Graham, was in \n1951. At that time, I was administrative assistant to a distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina, the late Willis Smith. Billy preached just \nsteps from this Chamber on the East Front of the Capitol, and I had \nread in the Washington Sunday morning paper that he was to be here. And \nI said: Mercy, I don't believe he will have anybody here. I am going \nover there and make sure that one North Carolinian joins him. Well, \nMadam President, there was standing room only from the doors of the \nCapitol all the way to the Supreme Court.\n  Anne is joined today by her husband, Dr. Danny Lotz, who was a star \nbasketball player during his years at the University of North Carolina \nat Chapel Hill.\n  Their two daughters, Rachel-Ruth and Morrow, are with us this morning \nalong with their husbands, Steven Wright and Traynor Reitmeier, and \nAnne's granddaughter, Bell.\n  So, Madam President, Anne Graham Lotz is herself an integral part of \nBilly Graham's remarkable legacy, and it is my honor to have presented \nher to the United States Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to welcome our guest Chaplain \ntoday, along with Senator Helms. I am very proud that she would be our \nguest Chaplain. Her father is a friend of all of ours and received the \nwell deserved congressional gold medal. It is obvious by listening to \nAnne Graham Lotz that she possesses that same great character, \ninspiration, and leadership as a preacher as well. I welcome her to the \nSenate and compliment and congratulate Senator Helms for inviting her \nto be our guest Chaplain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8872-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the first \n15 minutes shall be under the control of the Senator from Nevada or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today to speak to the issue of \nfire suppression in our beautiful national forests, an issue that \nconcerns every American because those are our forests, and the policy \nthat we follow must be a balanced and good policy to make sure we \npreserve that incredible God-given resource. Many people heard the \nprayer today, and we think about the spiritual needs and we think about \nour obligations. I believe one spiritual obligation we have is to \npreserve in this country the wonder and beauty that God gave us.\n  Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I have watched with \nfrustration and anger and sorrow as millions of acres of forests have \nbeen destroyed each year by catastrophic wildfires. This year the fire \nseason has been particularly severe in my State of California, as well \nas in a number of Western States, such as Arizona and New Mexico.\n  After an extremely destructive fire season in 2000, the Departments \nof Agriculture and Interior took the promising step of developing what \nis now referred to as a National Forest Plan. Among other things, the \nfire plan clearly indicates that priorities should be given to the \nclearance of brush, undergrowth, near communities and homes. The fire \nplan clearly says the most important way to stop the damage to the \npeople and to their property is to clear the undergrowth near \ncommunities and homes.\n  Consensus emerged around the idea that, yes, there would have to be \nsome thinning of trees and clearing of brush but not clearing of the \nold-growth trees, which actually take a very long time to burn and are \nimportant to keep in our forests.\n  We thought we had an agreement with this administration. Yet recent \nGAO reports indicate the USDA and the Department of the Interior have \nbeen ineffective and inefficient in implementing that fire plan.\n  So what has happened? We have an ineffective and inefficient \nsituation happening in the Department of the Interior and the USDA, and \nwe have out-of-control fires. Well, Senators Craig and Domenici have \ncome forward with what they say is a solution. What is it? Let's be \nclear.\n  Their amendment proposes to waive the National Environmental Planning \nAct, known as NEPA, which is a critical law in the Nation, and they \nwould limit the public's ability to challenge agency decisions and \nrestrict what we call judicial review. In other words, a judge would no \nlonger be able to take a look at what is happening and intervene, which \nis a very important part of our balance of powers. If Senator Byrd were \nhere, he would no doubt hold up the Constitution. The judicial branch \nis very important and the Craig-Domenici amendment would essentially \nweaken that leg of our Government in order to allow for the cutting of \nprecious old-growth trees.\n\n  So the approach of the Craig-Domenici amendment, and the reason I am \nhere--and I see my colleague from Washington and I assume she is here \nto speak on the same issue, so I will be brief. The approach gives the \nagencies complete discretion to engage in thinning and salvage logging \nat will. To me, this is a recipe for disaster. The waiver of \nenvironmental safeguards and elimination of judicial review are not \nsteps to be taken lightly, and I believe there is no justification for \nit because they are not the source of the problem.\n  There is actually evidence to the contrary. In a recent letter to \nSenator Craig, the GAO determined that only 1 percent of hazardous fuel \nreduction projects were appealed in 2001 and none had been litigated. \nGAO found that the list of appellants not only included conservation \ngroups, which have been attacked here as being radical in some way for \nexercising the rights that citizens have, but GAO found that the other \nappellants were recreation groups, industry interests, and individuals.\n  If you see a project is destroying our forests, that road should not \nbe closed\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\noff to our citizens. The GAO finding confirmed for me that our \nenvironmental laws, the appeals process, public participation, and \njudicial review are not the source of the problem, nor can we blame our \nforest woes on environmentalists. That isn't the point. The \nenvironmentalists are trying to do the right thing.\n  I want to show you two charts of the burned forest area in Oregon \nthat President Bush recently visited. The President tried to simplify \nthe issue and suggest that areas that are thinned will not burn, and \nareas that are left alone will be subject to catastrophic fire. But \nthat is simply not the case.\n  Here is a chart showing a thinned area. Notice, there are no large \ntrees left. This forest was burned to cinders. There were no large \ntrees there when the fire erupted. See how it looks.\n  Here is a second chart showing an adjacent area that wasn't thinned, \nleft in its natural state, and it did not burn at all. It did not burn \nat all because these large trees are very slow to burn.\n  Madam President, I don't suggest there is a simple answer to this \ncomplex problem, but we need to do a lot more than just trash our \nenvironmental laws and say people can no longer go to the courts to \nprotect this God-given resource.\n  In California, the Forest Service took the time to do the necessary \nenvironmental reviews. They produced a plan referred to as the Sierra \nNevada Framework. We just received a letter from someone I believe you \nknow, Madam President. Our secretary for Natural Resources in \nCalifornia, Mary Nichols, recently wrote in a letter to Secretary \nVeneman, the Secretary of Agriculture:\n\n       The framework--\n\n  Meaning our framework in California--\n     is the first landscape scale national forest management plan \n     that balances the need for fire risk reduction through fuel \n     treatment with environmental protection.\n\n  The fuel reduction plan in that framework has been agreed to by most \nof the mainstream environmental groups. Why? Because it was done \nthoughtfully and with full consideration of the environmental \nimplication.\n  Secretary Nichols of California goes on to explain that the \nPresident's proposal and efforts to undermine existing environmental \nlaws, which is exactly what I believe the Craig amendment does, will \nonly serve to polarize the debate, she says, and it will unravel the \ngood work that has happened in places such as California.\n  There are many people on the other side of the aisle who talk a lot \nabout States rights. Here is a State, my home State, that reveres its \nnational forests and wants to protect them. The State of California \nwill be undercut by this amendment because the amendment would say to \nour people in California: If you do not like what is happening, if you \nbelieve the forests are being destroyed, you are limited in your \njudicial access.\n  There is a great deal of scientific evidence that thinning and \nclearing activities should be concentrated in the areas immediately \nadjacent to communities to protect those communities.\n  A recent study completed by the U.S. Forest Service's Fire Sciences \nLaboratory in Montana found that the only thinning that is needed to \nprotect homes was within the ``red zone'' of 150 to 200 feet around a \nbuilding.\n  I wish to quote from the person who is an expert in fire suppression, \nJack Cohen. He said:\n\n       Regardless of how intense the fire is, the principal \n     determinant is based on the home and the exterior \n     characteristics.\n\n  In terms of protecting houses and other community structures, the \nimmediate vicinity is what is relevant.\n  We need to have buffer zones around communities so those communities \nare safe, and we need to protect the old-growth forests. Yes, we can \nthin the underbrush. We must. We should. But we should not cut down the \nold-growth trees.\n  Yet the Forest Service continues to direct thinning activities to \nremote areas of our forests where the risk to people and property is \nminimal. Less than 40 percent of the forest areas that have been \nthinned are in the so-called wildland-urban interface, which is the \nbuffer zone between communities and forests.\n  There is also abundant scientific evidence that thinning should \ntarget small diameter trees and underbrush to most effectively reduce \nfire risk.\n  Aggressive logging of big fire-resistant trees, while appealing to \nthe timber industry, actually increases the risk of fire. The L.A. \nTimes published a story yesterday, which I will submit for the Record, \nthat explains this well. In general, logging leaves behind highly \nflammable brush materials; it leads to dense new growth that poses a \nfire hazard; and the removal of large trees cause soils to dry out, \nleading to increased fire severity.\n  A scientific assessment completed in the Sierra Nevada in 1996, for \ninstance, found that, ``Timber harvest, through its effects on forest \nstructure, local microclimate and fuel accumulation, has increased fire \nseverity more than any other human activity.''\n  Yet the Forest Service continues to give high priority to thinning \nprojects that involve large valuable trees. These large trees are fire \nresistant--and therefore should be the last ones to be removed. But \nrepeatedly they are removed because they are economically valuable in \ncommercial timber sales.\n  In November 2001, the Inspector General at USDA completed an audit of \nthe Forest Service's implementation of the National Fire Plan. The USDA \naudit ``questioned the propriety of using approximately $2.5 million of \nNational Fire Plan Rehabilitation and Restoration Program funds to \nprepare and administer projects involving commercial timber sales.''\n  I want to show a picture of a Forest Service ``thinning.'' What's \nleft is a few trees and absolutely nothing on the ground. The area \nlooks like a tree orchard. While this may be good for the promotion of \nnew timber stands, it hardly preserves any of the ecological values \nnormally associated with a natural forest.\n  The reality is that we have Federal agencies implementing fire \nprojects that make sense if the primary goal is increasing timber \nvolume, but make no sense if the primary goal is reducing the risk of \nfire while preserving the ecological integrity of our forests.\n  Given the agencies' apparent inability to overcome their timber bias, \nwe would be guaranteeing a future filled with fires if we gave them the \nbroad discretion the Republican amendment would allow.\n  What is needed is language that provides the agencies with specific \nguidelines and priorities about where thinning and salvage activities \nshould take place.\n  While we have been unable to reach agreement with our Republican \ncolleagues on this matter, I am pleased that I have been able to work \nconstructively with my colleagues Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Reid, and \nCantwell to craft an alternative proposal.\n  This alternative will encourage aggressive and focused forest \nmanagement in the buffer zone areas between communities and forests. \nThis buffer zone, which is defined in the amendment to be within one \nhalf mile of community structures, is the area where the Forest Service \nhas said the most aggressive thinning should be done.\n  Such specificity will insure that the Forest Service and BLM make the \nprotection of Californians and others the highest priority.\n  Because of the agencies' propensity to turn thinning and salvage \nprojects into timber sales, this amendment also directs the agencies to \nprotect large trees and prohibit the development of new roads, which \nare generally associated with the removal of commercial timber.\n  It is unfortunate that we need to be this prescriptive. However, as I \nhave noted, there is good reason to be skeptical that the Forest \nService and BLM can be left to their own devices.\n  Without the public watching over them, and without any mechanism for \nchallenging agency actions, the Republican amendment will exacerbate \nthe problem. The agencies will continue to engage in senseless thinning \nand salvage logging in the middle of remote roadless areas--driven more \nby a thirst for commercial timber than by the need to protect homes and \ncommunities.\n  To me, that is an intolerable outcome and it is the reason I oppose \nthis proposal and have worked with others to craft an alternative.\n  I conclude by saying we have seen some disastrous fires. We have to \ntake\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\naction, but we know what we have to do. The studies have been done by \nthe Forest Service, by many of our States, and by the GAO. The Los \nAngeles Times sums it up very well. They did an exhaustive study and \ncame up with some conclusions. I will share those with my colleagues, \nand then I will yield to my friend for the rest of our time.\n  I will quote from this article. There was an investigative reporter \nwho went out to study the fires. It ran on September 17:\n\n       The Bush administration's timber-cutting prescription for \n     the West's wildfire epidemic runs counter to the record of \n     the last half century, when large forest fires erupted on the \n     heels of the heaviest logging ever conducted by the U.S. Fire \n     Service.\n\n  They had a chart in that newspaper. They showed that where you save \nthe old-growth trees, you save the forests, you save the communities. \nThe facts are in. Let's not use this tragic, horrible spate of \nwildfires as an excuse to let the loggers cut down the old-growth trees \nand pocket the money while our forests are left completely devoid of \nanything that makes them the gift that God gave us.\n  There is an editorial in today's L.A. Times. I will quote from it, \nand then I will cease:\n\n       We have to cut the nation's forests to save them.\n\n  That is how they open.\n\n       That seems to be the Bush administration's rationale for \n     its misnamed Healthy Forest Initiative, now before the \n     Senate.\n\n  It goes on to say that the Senate should defeat the Craig amendment \nand that there are other more reasonable and effective approaches.\n\n       Existing laws let the Forest Service do its job, provided \n     it files environmental impact reports and stays clear of \n     protected areas. In fact, President Bush can thin as many \n     trees as he wants to right now. He just can't take a saw to \n     the nation's environmental protections in the process.\n\n  I hope we will not adopt the Craig amendment. We are working on other \nways to compromise this matter. I hope we can get together.\n  I yield to my friend from Washington, Senator Cantwell, who has been \na leader on the environment since she came to the Senate. I yield my \nremaining time to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In total, there are 27 minutes \nremaining to the Democrats.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for a national \ndebate on how best to manage wildfires and improve forest health. I \nthank my colleague from California for being here this morning to \narticulate a vision about how we can move forward to protect old growth \nwhile being mindful about how much work really needs to be done before \nwe can come up with a solid proposal.\n  That is why I am here to speak this morning. I believe the amendment \nwe will offer today does not further the debate in the direction we \nneed to go but instead focuses on the controversial issues of weakening \nour environmental protection laws and limiting meaningful public \nparticipation.\n  While I appreciate the sense of urgency that this year's fire season \nhas brought us--and I believe the fire seasons in last several years \nhave made all of us anxious--I believe the reasonable way of dealing \nwith this situation is through the legislative committee process.\n  I applaud my colleagues who are on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee who have had much discussion about this problem and are very \nanxious to take the Governors' report that was done on the national \nfire plan and efforts to better implement it. We need to do that \nthrough the legislative committee process where we can hold hearings \nand talk to the experts and concerned members of our communities.\n  Trying to solve this important issue with a rider to an \nappropriations bill is unwise. It would be wrong to think that we could \nreverse hundreds of years of misguided forest fire management \nsuppression policy with a rider on an appropriations bill.\n  One of the most significant concerns I have about the amendment, as \nmy colleague from California mentioned, is that it does waive important \nenvironmental laws. Under this amendment, the agencies will no longer \nbe required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. \nFurthermore, the amendment eliminates the administrative appeals \nprocess and limits judicial review.\n  We do need to move forward, and I applaud my colleague from Idaho for \nwanting to take this issue to the next level and for the focus that he \nhas given to the issue. But I believe critical to this debate is the \ncentral issue of trust because after decades of documented problems \nwith forest management by the Forest Service, it is no wonder that \ncitizens are now skeptical about the plan before us today, which would \nallow timber companies to thin on ten million acres might really be \nmotivated more by economics than improving healthy forests.\n  If we go so far as to restrict a citizen's legal right, that is the \nwrong approach, but I believe working within the existing framework of \nenvironmental laws and allowing for the appropriate process for \nprojects in areas near communities is the right approach.\n  This basic step needs to be taken--to prevent the catastrophic \nwildfires that we have all experienced. This step has already been laid \nout in the laws of this country. In the 10-year comprehensive strategy \non collaborative approach for reducing wild land fire risk to \ncommunities and the environment which was issued in May, this strategy \nwas the highest priority.\n  We need to make sure we are treating fires in communities that could \nbe most effective in protecting lives and in protecting homes.\n  The work done in a community in Roslyn, which is in my home State, \ndemonstrates that protecting our forests has little to do with cutting \nbig trees far away from homes but, rather, treating areas adjacent to \ncommunities.\n  Now that is not to say we do not have to look at fuel reduction and \nthat fuel reduction is not critically important in other parts of our \nnational forests, but the key thing we have seen in this fire season is \nthe loss of homes and loss of areas that I think are the interfaces on \nwhich we need to focus.\n  The joint efforts of local citizens, the local fire department, the \nWashington Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Forest Service \nproduced a plan in our State to clear brush and other fuel materials \nfrom a buffer zone around this town of Roslyn. I support more funding \nto do thinning, prescribed burns, and hazardous fuel reduction in our \nefforts to manage our forests.\n  I think all of those need more discussion and more time and energy \nput into them and, as we will see with the Byrd amendment, more \nresources financially to obtain that goal since those funds have been \nsubverted in the past.\n  I also support providing the Forest Service and BLM with adequate \nfunding to do the hazardous fuel reduction projects so each year we do \nnot find ourselves in the same situation where the Forest Service \ndiverts the funds from fire accounts in order to pay for fire \nsuppression.\n  So let us make that clear. Let us divide the accounts. Let us make \nsure we are doing work both for suppression and for the prevention \nefforts we need.\n  The point is clear, we can protect our communities from fire, and we \ndo not need to waive environmental protection laws or limit public \nparticipation to do so. In closing, I would like to urge my colleagues \nto support Senator Byrd's amendment to provide more funding for fire \nsuppression efforts. However, I add a note of caution, that if we take \nthis approach with the rider my colleague from Idaho is offering, I do \nnot think it is in the best interest of the forests or the American \npublic. This rider is too overreaching to be put on this legislation. \nLet us go back to the committee process, let us have the hearings, and \nlet us push forward together.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an editorial from the \nSeattle Times that talks about the need to move ahead but that we \ncannot have, as this article says:\n\n       This administration's attempt to confuse and cloud the \n     issue of fire suppression by laughably proposing timber \n     thinning can\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\n     only mean a return to unregulated clear-cutting on our \n     Nation's forestlands.\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Seattle Times, Sept. 7, 2002]\n\n                          Don't Hold Your Fire\n\n                            (By Tommy Hough)\n\n       The recent Bush administration proposal to suspend \n     environmental laws and eliminate the public's right to appeal \n     Forest Service decisions should be viewed as nothing less \n     than a transparent attempt to increase commercial logging in \n     our national forestlands, which has been this \n     administration's stated intention since Day One.\n       How shameful too, that President Bush would so callously \n     use a disaster such as the recent wildfires in southwest \n     Oregon to launch the media spin for a plan designed to roll \n     back 20 years of good sense and good environmental \n     legislation, and in part enable the president to fulfill some \n     inappropriate, slimy promises made to timber baron \n     contributors and related special-interest groups during the \n     2000 campaign.\n       This administration's attempt to confuse and cloud the \n     issue of ``fire suppression,'' by laughably proposing \n     ``timber thinning,'' can only mean a return to unregulated \n     clear-cutting on our nation's forestlands. Has any \n     administration ever been so brazenly vacant and cynical?\n       Since this scheme was no doubt in part cobbled together by \n     forestry professionals, I'm guessing it may have occurred to \n     them that old-growth forests actually act as a natural \n     suppressant of fire, even in the driest years. Granted, that \n     would be bad for business, but the awful secret the Bush \n     administration and the timber industry doesn't want you to \n     know is this: Fire is not bad. Fire is simply one part of \n     nature's long-term, delicate balancing act.\n       Drought and flames aren't a problem any more than rain and \n     flooding are a problem. The problem is man and his meddling \n     ways and 120 years of forest management (i.e., unrestricted, \n     subsidized logging), screwing up and knocking out of whack a \n     natural process which had been working fine in North American \n     ecosystems for thousands, even millions of years.\n       We've knocked forest rhythms so far off by removing fire as \n     an element that nature isn't even allowed to compensate with \n     small-scale burns to clear away underbrush and tinder (unless \n     it's a manmade ``prescribed burn''), gently changing the way \n     the elements effect the forest floor, and paving the way for \n     pioneering species and new trees. We may as well have removed \n     rain from the equation.\n       The mature Ponderosa and lodgepole pines in the American \n     West as well as the big, old-growth Douglas firs, hemlocks \n     and spruces here in the Pacific Northwest are designed by \n     nature to survive burns with their thick bark and rich \n     moisture content, while the fires create temperatures for the \n     big trees to be able to rapidly seed. In fact, the longer a \n     tree lives, the more it is able to withstand fire (whew, \n     that's bad for business too!).\n       The juvenile trees growing in the wake of the ceaseless \n     clear-cuts that have left literal quilt marks on the tapestry \n     of the region's forests are the ones most susceptible to \n     catastrophic fire and drought, and while fire ideally should \n     clean the forest floor an acre here and an acre there, \n     manhandled nature is forced to wait for a drought to reclaim \n     the other half of the natural equation, when everything is \n     bone dry and hasn't been allowed to burn for 100 years. \n     Instead of cleansing the forest, fire now destroys the \n     forest, in a catastrophic fasion nature never intended.\n       That thinning excess timber, a natural reaction to logging \n     and clear-cutting as the forest slowly tries to weed itself \n     out, is somehow the Holy Grail solution to forest fires is to \n     buy into cheap, message-of-the-day stupidity. Does the \n     president really think Americans are just going to stand idly \n     by and let their treasured national forestlands be threatened \n     and destroyed? Has it not occurred to the greedy minds and \n     special interests that floated this scheme that we all share \n     and live in the same environment, of which forests are an \n     integral, absolute part, no matter which side of the \n     political or ecological fence you may be on?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time \ncharged equally against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. BOND pertaining to the introduction of S. 2967 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. CARNAHAN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Craig-Domenici hazardous fuels reduction amendment \nwhich is currently before the Senate. It is my hope that we can come to \na consensus on this issue for the benefit of the forests, the animals \nthat inhabit them and, more importantly, the people whose homes are \nnear them.\n  In my home State of Nevada, our all-time worst fire was in 1999. That \nseason set an all-time record for the severity and breadth of fire \ndamage. Nevada experienced over 1,100 fires which burned almost 2 \nmillion acres. To put that in perspective, in 1999 the total number of \nfires was 135 percent of the 5-year average and the total acres burned \nwere almost eight times what we normally burn during 5-year periods. \nMore acres were burned during a single 10-day period in August than had \nburned in any entire previous season on record.\n  I am afraid 2002 could be another year like 1999. This year, Nevada \nis experiencing its fourth year of drought that has been classified \nfrom ``moderate'' to ``exceptional.'' Large fire activity began in mid- \nto late-May--about 3 to 4 weeks earlier than normal. And, quite \nhonestly, we have been very lucky compared to other States such as \nArizona, Colorado, Oregon, or California. We are grateful for that. But \nwe know all too well that Nevada's fire season lasts longer than other \nStates'. We still have the potential of a devastating fire season yet \nto come this year. With the current extreme drought condition combined \nwith the buildup of dead and dying fuels, Nevada is placed in the \n``extreme'' and ``advanced'' categories for potential fire behavior.\n  I am particularly concerned about the Lake Tahoe Basin. When my \nfamily visited that area in August, I noticed the dry conditions of the \narea. There is no question that Lake Tahoe is a blazing inferno waiting \nto happen. The Lake Tahoe Basin is under the highest risk of wildfire \npotential. The entire region is classified as a class 3 risk for \ncatastrophic fire.\n  What is so distressing is that the land of this area is so \nenvironmentally sensitive. A catastrophic fire in the basin would \nresult in an incredible amount of damage to communities. Homes and \nstructures worth billions of dollars would be lost. Lake Tahoe, one of \nthe Nation's crown jewels, could lose its defining quality of lake \nclarity. Millions of tourists come every year to recreate in the basin. \nKey recreation areas would be destroyed. A fire could cause tremendous \ndamage to the sensitive watershed which feeds not only Lake Tahoe but \nsupplies water to communities in Reno, Carson City, and the rest of \nnorthwest Nevada, eventually emptying into Pyramid Lake.\n  The ecological consequences are distressing as well. Lake Tahoe is \nhome to one of our Nation's proudest symbols--the bald eagle. Other \nendangered and threatened species are native to the basin. Their safety \nis threatened by fire.\n  It is clear to me and anyone who actually goes out into the forests \nthat something must be done to reduce the fuels buildup to prevent the \noutbreak of catastrophic fire. That is why I am an original cosponsor \nof the Craig-Domenici amendment.\n  Currently, 74 million acres nationwide are classified as class 3 \nforests, which is the highest risk for catastrophic fires. The Craig-\nDomenici amendment will limit action to only 10 million of the 74 \nmillion class 3 acres. It is an emergency amendment. It only addresses \n7 percent of the problem. I wish it would address more of the problem. \nHighest priority will be given to wildland-urban interface areas, which \nare areas near homes and communities, municipal watersheds, and \nforested areas affected by disease, insect infestation, and windthrow.\n\n  The amendment seeks to cut through the bureaucratic mess that is \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\nin place that often needlessly delays implementation of these projects.\n  It also seeks to expedite the judicial process. Too often, these \nessential fuels reduction projects are halted by frivolous lawsuits. \nUltimately it is the forest and wildlife habitat that suffer.\n  That is the case in my State where two projects in the wildland-urban \ninterface were challenged by an outside party. The challenger was not \neven from Nevada. All the people in Nevada had agreed--\nenvironmentalists in Nevada, the Forest Service in Nevada, the BLM in \nNevada, and all the local people in Nevada--that this project was \nmeritorious and was good for the environment. Yet somebody from the \noutside challenged in court and was able to block this important \nenvironmental project.\n  Public land managers must be allowed to manage the land. \nUnfortunately, only one dissenter can stymie a completely collaborative \neffort to clean the forests. Without proper forest management, an \naccidental blaze can turn into a flaming inferno which can sterilize \nthe land and destroy the habitat for many endangered species of plants \nand animals.\n  The groups that are against our efforts claim they are \nenvironmentally friendly. What is environmentally friendly about \nobstructing sound management projects from going forward? Wildfires \ncontribute heavily to air pollution, destroy wildlife habitat, and kill \nendangered species.\n  While we were in Lake Tahoe this summer, the entire basin--which is \ntruly one of the most beautiful areas in the world--was filled with \nsmoke from the fires from far off in California and from Oregon. \nAnybody who is against air pollution ought to be for stopping and \npreventing these forest fires.\n  Extremists in the environmental community claim they are concerned \nabout the welfare of wildlife habitat and forest health. Yet they \noppose commonsense projects that seek to lessen the devastating effects \nof catastrophic wildfires. This amendment seeks to ensure that fuel \nreduction projects continue in spite of these extremists.\n  This legislation is absolutely necessary. It is necessary this year. \nIt was actually necessary last year and many years before. Every year \nwe talk about how we need to save the forests, but we do nothing to \nclean the forest to reduce the intensity of fires. We must be able to \nconduct these fuel reduction projects. Advocates on both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the political spectrum agree on this. They are \nessential to continue the health of our forests. We have waited long \nenough. Our forests have waited long enough.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us get this done. The fires we have seen \nthis year are unprecedented. I, for one, am committed to do all I can \nto ensure that forests are protected, watersheds are protected, homes \nprotected, and, most importantly, people are protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a matter that \nI find deeply troubling. An ``Inside the Beltway'' column in the \nSeptember 19, 2002, Washington Times reveals that a correspondent \nworking for National Public Radio, in what appears to be a flagrant \nviolation of all standards of professional journalism and ethical \nconduct, has set about to enlist the help of environmental radicals in \norder to concoct a story concerning thinning projects on our national \nforests. I find this abhorrent for two reasons.\n  First, it reveals the desperate lengths to which the environmental \ncommunity is willing to go to their quest to lock up our public forests \nand prevent efforts aimed at protecting and restoring health to our \npublic forests from going forward.\n  Second, and perhaps more troubling to me, it suggests the complete \nlack of intellectual honesty and the apparent complicity of a nonprofit \norganization, established by Congress for the purpose of educating our \npublic, in fabricating stories and spinning the news in a manner that \nis devoid of objectivity and at odds with the fundamental tenets of \nsound journalistic practices.\n  Let me read from a message that was sent out by a news correspondent \nworking for National Public Radio seeking assistance from members of \nthe environmental community. The message reads as follows:\n\n       Hey there. Put on your thinking cap and give me your best \n     example of a `thinning project' where they went in and did \n     the opposite. I'm working on a story about trust, which is at \n     the heart of all this . . . and I want to use just one \n     example of where the FS [Forest Service] and the industry \n     flagrantly abused the public's trust on a thinning project . \n     . . in short, concrete evidence as to why the environmental \n     community is distrustful of the FS and industry's so called \n     thinning projects.\n\n  In 1967, Congress passed the Public Broadcasting Act. This act \nauthorized the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nCPB. The Act called on CPB to encourage ``the growth and development of \nnoncommercial radio'' and to develop ``programming that will be \nresponsive to the interests of the people.'' National Public Radio, \nNPR, was established in 1970 as a private, nonprofit organization to \nprovide leadership in national news gathering and production and \nbroadcast of radio programming responsive to the interests of American \ncitizens.\n  I would ask my colleagues how is this biased effort at attempting to \nsway public opinion in the public interest? NPR appears to have allowed \nits news people to sink to new lows to scrape together a story to \nincite and inflame public opinion. Is this the kind of reporting we \nshould expect from a national news organization established by Congress \nto promote news gathering in the interest of American citizens? I think \nnot.\n  It is a sad day when our national news organizations must engage in \nfabricating stories by listening solely to one side and a sadder day \nstill when these stories are presented by these organizations to an \nunsuspecting public as a balanced reporting of the facts.\n  This message authored by the NPR correspondent was distributed by way \nof an environmental group mailing list. The forwarding message from an \norganization called ``Wild Rockies'' is also revealing.\n  The sender reveals that environmental groups have ``successfully \nappealed/litigated'' many thinning projects and also ``tied up'' many \nmore thinning projects. In short, the author of this message is making \nplain the fact that these groups have been successful in causing the \nvery sort of unnecessary delays that we are attempting to prevent with \nthe amendment introduced by Senators Craig and Domenici.\n  These environmentalists have demonstrated that they will stop at \nnothing--even shamefully dishonest practices--to impede, delay, and \nquash efforts by the Forest Service and Department of Interior land \nmanagement agencies to restore health to our forests. We cannot let our \nprecious American forests be held hostage by these extremists, nor \nshould we stand idly by and allow these zealots to continue to hold our \nforests hostage by employing these sort of unethical and distasteful \ntactics.\n  Shame on NPR for what appears to be an utter and complete lack of \nbalance in news gathering practices. Shame on Wild Rockies and the \nother environmental groups that would conspire to mislead the public in \nthis way. And shame on us, if we fail to enact legislation that will \nenable us to protect our precious public forests from these \nirresponsible sham artists and unethical charlatans who seek to deceive \nrather than truthfully inform our citizens on the conditions that exist \non our forests and what needs to be done to move them toward a \nhealthier state.\n  Madam President, we have just heard from another one of our \ncolleagues, in this case Senator Ensign from the State of Nevada, talk \nabout the conditions and situations that exist in that State and in the \nnorthern end of the High Sierras of California and Nevada. The \nconditions he talks about are real and very severe.\n  I used to chair the Forestry Subcommittee in the Senate. During that \nperiod of time, we examined the condition of the Sierras and especially \nwhat is known as the Greater Tahoe Basin\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\narea. In fact, our colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, grew very \nconcerned as to the state of health of those forests.\n  It was, at that time--a couple of years ago--very obvious those \nforests were in rapid declining health conditions, bug kill was \nrampant, and at some time in the very near future that forest could be \nconsumed in wildfire that would wipe out the whole of the Tahoe Basin.\n  Of course, as the Senator just spoke, it is a beautiful area. Lake \nTahoe is renowned for its beauty. That is why folks from all over the \ncountry have gone there to build phenomenal homes, to enjoy that \nbeauty. And, of course, at risk at that time in the investigation was \nthe reality that wildfire would wipe out many of those multimillion-\ndollar homes that were sprinkled around the lake, both on the Nevada \nside and on the California side of that lake, and the whole tourism and \nresort industry that exists there--another example of a forest crying \nout for a thinning and cleaning and management program that could \nreverse the state of the health of that forest.\n  We struggle mightily to solve a problem that has come upon the \nInterior appropriations bill, of which my colleague from Montana, who \nhas now joined us, is the ranking member of that subcommittee which \nfunds Interior issues.\n  I submitted some days ago a second-degree amendment to Senator Byrd's \namendment to increase fire funding, to try to find a compromise, to \ndevelop some degree of active management in these very critical areas \nof concern that are, in part, driving the wildfires of at least the \nwestern forests at this moment and are realities of growing conditions \nin all of the public land forests around our country. And that is a \nstate of health, a state of fuel loading, and dead and dying trees, and \ntherefore optimum fuels that, under the right conditions, ignite into \nthe catastrophic fires that we have experienced this year.\n  But yesterday I became aware of an interesting episode going on aside \nbut a part of this debate out on the public side of things--I should \nsay the private side of things--that I find very interesting. This \nmorning that was highlighted in the ``Inside the Beltway'' column of \nthe Washington Times, an article by John McCaslin. It is worth your \ntime and interest to read it because I do believe it demonstrates \nsomething that is in an apparent complicity of efforts between national \nradical environmental groups and an organization funded by this \nCongress, National Public Radio.\n  It is obvious to me that there was an effort underway to try to show \nto the public that what I was debating, and others were debating, \nsimply was not the case. And the e-mail transaction that was going on \nout there demonstrated quite the opposite because fundamental to what \nSenator Daschle did for his home State of South Dakota, and what we are \ntrying to do here, is to design a way to create a more active process \nthat disallows the obvious and constant use of the appeals process and \ntemporary court injunctions to deny any activity on our public lands, \nand especially in these critical areas that are so fire prone.\n\n  And, of course, the article is fascinating in what it says because \nwhat it basically says is: Can you show me a thinning process?--calling \nthe environmental groups that would give us the worst case scenario, in \nother words, a contradiction to what I and others have been saying is \nbeing done, and can be done effectively, in the thinning and the \ncleaning of these fuel-loaded areas.\n  And the answer is, I think, quite fascinating. The answer is: No, we \ncan't show you any because we have them all under appeal, and we have \nthem all blocked.\n  The very thing we have been arguing is the very thing that is \nreality, by the admission of the environmental groups themselves.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield without losing his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. When you said, ``We have them all blocked,'' that kind of \ncaught my ear. And I am wondering about these appropriations bills. \nSomebody has them all blocked. Here is my friend from Montana who is \nthe ranking member. We have been here at our posts on duty. When are we \ngoing to unblock the barriers to getting our appropriations bills \npassed?\n  I have a question of the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. And before I pose the question, I preface it by saying \nthis: I can appreciate what the distinguished Senator is trying to do. \nThe other day I said to him, on the floor: If you will remove your \namendment here, if we can vote for cloture, on the one hand, and get on \nwith this bill, if you offer your amendment on another bill, I will \nsupport it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. But my friends on that side did not vote for cloture. \nWhatever the vote was at that time, they did not vote for cloture. So \nthey have not helped me to get on with the appropriations bills. \nConsequently, I made a generous offer at that point, but I am concerned \nabout that offer.\n  The Senator did not take me up on it. Senators on that side did not \ntake me up on that. They did not help remove that block. I want to look \nat the Senator's amendment again when it comes time to vote on it. I am \nconcerned about judicial review, about that aspect of it and some other \nthings.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the Senators had me on board at that time if that would \nhave helped to take the plug out of the dike and let these bills pass. \nI am concerned, may I say to the distinguished Senator----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is a member of the committee. I am concerned about the \nway these appropriations bills are piling up around here, and when we \nare headed for a continuing resolution.\n  Now, would the Senator have a suggestion as to when we might have \nanother cloture vote on that very question of the other day? A motion \nto reconsider was entered on that vote, I believe. Am I correct, may I \nask----\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct, as I recall.\n  I do not, in any way, question the Senator's sincerity. You offered \nto solve it in one way, and I reciprocated by offering to solve it in \nanother.\n  I would go immediately to a unanimous consent for an up-or-down vote \non the Craig second degree. That is an immediate solution that could \noccur in the next 35 or 40 minutes. That is a clear and clean and \nwithin-the-rules solution to a problem. I believe my side feels that I \ndeserve a vote. And I know that the Senator is a stickler for the rules \nof the Senate and an advocate of them and strongly supportive of them.\n  I want to facilitate this process. The money you have so generously \nhelped us get----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. To fit into this Interior appropriations bill is critical, \nto pay back the funds within the Department of Agriculture and in the \nU.S. Forest Service that have been expended for the very fires about \nwhich we are concerned. This has to happen. Clearly, it is critical for \nthe operation of the Forest Service. What is also critical, in my \nopinion, is that the Congress respond in a responsible way to the \ncrisis.\n  You, as chairman, and if you are chairman again in the new Congress \nor someone else is, should not have to be asking the taxpayers to pay \nout an additional $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $2 billion more a year \nbecause clearly a public policy is failing out there at this moment to \naddress a crisis and, therefore, we are asking the taxpayer to pay for \nit. That is really what hangs in the balance here. They are intricately \nlocked, I do believe. That is why I think it is so fundamentally \nimportant we vote on it at this moment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I took at least 3 minutes of the Senator's \ntime. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from Idaho \nmay have 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I repeat what is a phenomenally \nfrustrating concern of ours, that the Public\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nBroadcasting Act that created NPR authorized the use of public money \nand what appears now at this moment to be an effort to go out and find \na worst case scenario to refute arguments being placed on the floor. \nThat is not the role of the public broadcasting program in this \ncountry.\n  I am extremely pleased that this article appeared. We became aware of \nthat e-mail traffic yesterday. I am glad some journalists have the \nright and the willingness to step forward and say: Wait a minute. This \nappears to be a complicit act of a nonprofit organization established \nby Congress for the purpose of educating our public but not \nmisinforming our public. That appears by every evidence to be exactly \nwhat was underway.\n  What fell out of it was the very basis of the argument I and others \nhave been placing for some time and why my amendment or a version of my \namendment in dealing with these critical areas and in dealing with \nallowing a process to move forward that cannot be just summarily \nblocked by an appeal but does not yet close the courthouse door is very \ncritical to all of us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time remains on the pending bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 15 \nminutes, a total of 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will today offer an amendment to \nexpedite forest thinning on our national forests and public lands. I am \npleased that Senator Daschle is a cosponsor of this amendment. I would \nlike to thank all of my colleagues who have worked with me to craft \nthis amendment and who offered invaluable input and expertise.\n  Everyone in the Senate wants to do what we can to reduce the threat \nof catastrophic wildfire. We all agree that we need to accelerate fuels \nreduction activities because the risk of severe fire is so high. \nOngoing, drought, past fire suppression policies, and excessive \nharvesting of timber have all contributed to the problem. All of us \nalso agree that it is much better to devote limited resources to \nproactive efforts to reduce fire risk rather than paying to fight the \nfires once they occur.\n  I have tried for years to improve the Federal agencies' forest \nthinning program in a variety of ways. I am also a vocal proponent for \nspending Federal dollars conducting proactive forest restoration to \nreduce fire risk rather than continuing to spend billions of dollars \neach year fighting fires. Although some may contend that restoration \ncosts too much money, over the long-term, it is much less expensive \nthan fighting fires. Restoring our lands is the preferred alternative \nfor the environment as well because, unfortunately, important species \nhabitat burns right along with the forests during a fire.\n  The main obstacle constraining us from substantially increasing our \nproactive efforts to reduce fire risk is a lack of adequate funding. As \nOregon Governor and cochair for the Western Governor Association's 10-\nYear Fire Plan John Kitzhaber states, ``it will take a significant \ninvestment of resources--far greater than what is envisioned to be \nsaved through process efficiencies.'' Ever since Congress first funded \nthe National Fire Plan 2 years ago, I have continually emphasized the \nneed to sustain a commitment to the fiscal year 2001 funding levels \nover a long enough period of time to make a difference--at least 15 \nyears.\n  Most fuel reduction projects will take several years to implement. It \nis critical that the agencies have reliable funding to complete the \nprojects they start. If funding is obtained to thin trees the first \nyear, but not to complete the slash disposal and reintroduce fire \nthrough prescribed burning the following years, short-term fire risk \nwill be increased. Around the villages north of Truchas, some villages \nface a tremendous danger of fire due to slash left from thinning. \nAccording to the agencies themselves, mechanical thinning comprises \nonly 19 percent annually of all hazardous fuels reduction activities.\n  Adequate funding means, at a minimum, sustaining fiscal year 2001 \nfunding levels for all components of the National Fire Plan. The \nWestern Governors Association recently sent a letter to Congress urging \nfull funding of the National Fire Plan at the fiscal year 2001 funding \nlevels. Similarly, recently the National Association of State Foresters \ncompiled projected funding needs for the National Fire Plan over the \nnext 10 years based on collaborative efforts with State governments, \nthe Forest Service, and the Department of the Interior. The Western \nGovernors' Association endorsed the State Foresters' projections. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that the cost to reduce fuels is \nabout $725 million per year for the next 15 years, GAO/RCED-99-65.\n  The funding levels in the bill we are currently considering are far \nbelow the State Foresters' and GAO's projected funding needs. For \nexample, while hazardous fuels reduction was increased in fiscal year \n2001 and has remained relatively constant since that time, the State \nForesters' analysis includes $100 million more for hazardous fuels \nreduction than the Interior appropriation bill provides. The State \nForesters project that hazardous fuels reduction also will need to \nsteadily increase over the next 10 years.\n  Other important programs that are part of the National Fire \nPlan, including economic action programs, community and private land \nfire assistance, and burned area restoration and rehabilitation have \nbeen drastically cut--and some have been zeroed out--by the \nadministration over the last two budget cycles. For some accounts \nincluded under the National Fire Plan, but not all, Congress has made \nup the difference. However, it would certainly be much easier to fully \nfund the National Fire Plan with the administration's support.\n\n  Funding constraints clearly affect the ground restoration work. In \nNew Mexico, there are several restoration projects that could make a \nmeaningful difference in reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire if \nfunds were available. Here are some examples:\n  One, Dry Lakes Project, El Rito Ranger District, Carson National \nForest.--This mechanical thinning and prescribed burning fuel reduction \nproject is located on the Tusas Ridge to the southwest of the community \nof Tres Piedras. The ridge has an unusually high incidence of \nlightening strikes which put the community at high risk. Tres Piedras \nis on the State list of highest priority areas. The district used \nfiscal year 2001 funding from the National Fire Plan to thin a large \narea but could not find sufficient funds in fiscal year 2002 to \ncomplete the prescribed burning. This is particularly troubling because \nseveral forestry experts agree that thinning trees without follow up \nwork to reintroduce fire with prescribed burns, the fire risk will \nincrease.\n  Two, in southern New Mexico, Otero County Commissioner Michael \nNivison has worked tirelessly to encourage broad community involvement \nwithin the context of existing laws and procedures. Unfortunately, the \ngroup found that lack of funding was an obstacle to moving forward with \nsensible forest thinning plans. In April 2002, I requested the \nnecessary additional funds from the Washington office of the Forest \nService because no additional funding was available from the Lincoln \nNational Forest's budget or the Southwest Region office budget. The \nminimum funding needed was $1 million to complete thinning projects \nwithin the wildland/urban interface in the Rio Penasco watershed and \nfor watershed analyses to prepare future restoration projects. \nFortunately, after waiting 3 months, the Forest Service complied with \nthe request. However, Commissioner Nivison estimates an additional $4 \nmillion per year for the next 10 years above existing funding levels \nwill be needed to successfully complete the forest thinning program on \nthe Lincoln National Forest.\n  Three, on the Gila National forest, the Catron County Citizens Group \nbased in Glenwood is working to establish a sawmill to process small \ndiameter wood removed from the forest as part of forest restoration \nprojects and has secured non-Federal matching funds for their \noperation. In December 2001, I was notified that Forest Service \nemployees had identified several restoration projects that were NEPA-\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\nready, however, no funding was available. Once again, after specific \nand repeated requests, the Chief complied with the request to allocate \nan additional $1 million to the Gila. However, a 1-year special \nallocation clearly will not provide the long-term restoration \ninvestment needed.\n  Four, earlier this year, the Chief told me that the Santa Fe \nMunicipal Watershed Project is one of the highest priorities for the \nForest Service's Southwest Region. Nonetheless, at the current rate of \nfunding by the agency, the project will be completed in 18 years. If it \nwere fully funded at $1 million per year, however, the project would be \ncompleted in 7 years. This is a critical project for the residents of \nSanta Fe to protect two city-owned reservoirs that hold 40 percent of \nthe city's water supply.\n  Five, Deer Lakes Fuel Break, Cuba Ranger District, Santa Fe National \nForest.--This fuel break project was put on the list of suggested \nprojects for fiscal year 2001 since NEPA review was complete, but it \nwas not funded in fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2002. The fuel break \nwill protect private homes in a forested subdivision. The Forest \nService considers this area to be a priority.\n  Six, Mt. Taylor Ranger District, Cibola National Forest.--A number of \nfuel reduction projects planned on this district have been held up by \ninsufficient funding. All of these projects were small, less than 500 \nacres.\n\n  Seven, the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, created through \nlegislation I sponsored two years ago, provides $5 million annually to \nfund a variety of forest restoration projects in many different \nlocations in New Mexico. Unfortunately, due to the Forest Service's \npractice of borrowing from other accounts to pay for firefighting, \naction on this year's projects has been suspended since July 8. Because \nthe administration was unwilling, until very recently, to support \nrepaying these accounts, it is unlikely that work will resume this year \non these projects.\n  Beyond funding constraints, some allege that administrative appeals \nand lawsuits limit our ability to reduce fire risk across the country. \nI am willing to provide new legal authorities and exemptions from \nadministrative appeals to address this concern. However, we should \nproceed carefully at this juncture and withhold from enacting sweeping \nchanges to Federal law without due consideration. If we need to make \npermanent changes to existing laws, we should do so next year after \nthis issue has been debated thoroughly in the Senate including hearings \nand committee business meetings.\n  Let me briefly describe our amendment. We propose to exempt from \nNational Environmental Policy Act analysis all forest thinning projects \nlocated in areas that are at the highest risk of fire and remove up to \n250,000 broad feet of timber or 1 million board feet of salvage. We \nprohibit administrative appeals on these projects, thereby saving 135 \ndays in the process. In addition, we eliminate judicial review granted \nunder NEPA for thinning projects within 1/2 mile of any community \nstructure or within certain key municipal watersheds. The combination \nof these provisions would save between one and one-half to three and \none-half years of process.\n  Moreover, in order to focus the agencies' work on the highest \npriority ares where human safety and property loss are the most \nserious, we require that 100 percent of hazardous fuels reduction funds \nbe spent in the highest fire risk areas, known as condition class 3, \nand 70 percent of those funds be spent within one-half mile of any \ncommunity structure or within key municipal watersheds identified in \nforest plans.\n  In order to recognize the role that forest dependent communities play \nin restoring our lands, we require that at least 10 percent of \nhazardous fuels reduction funds be spent on projects that benefit small \nbusinesses that use hazardous fuels and are located in small, \neconomically disadvantaged communities. Finally, in order to provide \nrobust monitoring of these experimental new authorities, we require \nmultiparty monitoring of a representative sampling of the projects.\n  We agree with, and included, many provisions of Senator Craig's \namendment in our amendment. For example, Senator Craig requires the \nsecretaries to give highest priority to protecting communities, \nmunicipal watersheds, and areas affected by disease, insect activity, \nor wind throw. He requires that projects be consistent with applicable \nforest plans and that the Secretaries jointly develop a collaborative \nprocess to select projects. We agree with all of these provisions.\n  However, our amendment differs from Senator Craig's amendment because \nwe felt it was appropriate to enact parameters and limitations along \nwith the new authorities for several reasons. First, we are legislating \nwithout the benefit of the normal authorizing Committee process. If, \nafter consideration through the authorizing Committee process, we \ndecide to make some or all of these changes permanent, we can do so \nnext year.\n  Second, the Forest Service has a poor track record with respect to \nsupporting projects that do not harvest large trees. One example that I \nam aware of occurred in New Mexico. On the Gila National Forest Sheep \nBasin project, there was broad agreement within the local community \nthat a project harvesting small trees would be a win-win. The community \nagreed this project would both benefit the environment and generate \nlocal jobs while also reducing fire risk. The Forest Service, however, \nrejected the community's proposal and insisted on following a plan to \nharvest large trees.\n\n  Third, many independent analyses have discovered numerous flaws with \nthe agencies' existing implementation of the National Fire Plan. For \nexample, a recent General Accounting Office report severely chastised \nthe agencies for their inability to account for where hazardous fuels \nreduction funds have been spent. Specifically, the GAO states:\n\n     It is not possible to determine if the $796 million \n     appropriate for hazardous fuels reduction in fiscal year 2001 \n     and 2002 is targeted to the communities and other areas at \n     highest risk of severe wildland fires.--GAO/RCED-02-259, \n     January 2002.\n\n  In addition, in November 2001, the Inspector General for the \nDepartment of Agriculture found that the Forest Service was \ninappropriately spending its burned area restoration funds to prepare \ncommercial timber sales. Similarly, it was recently discovered that the \nForest Service ``misplaced'' $215 million intended for wildland fire \nmanagement due to an accounting error.\n  Finally, another GAO report concluded that, because the Forest \nService relies on the timber program for funding many of its other \nactivities, including reducing fuels, it has often used the timber \nprogram to address the wildfire problem. GAO states:\n\n     The difficulty with such an approach, however, is that the \n     lands with commercially valuable timber are often not those \n     with the greatest wildfire hazards. Additionally, there are \n     problems with the incentives in the fuel reduction program. \n     Currently, managers are rewarded for the number of acres on \n     which they reduce fuels, not for reducing fuels on the lands \n     with the highest fire hazards. Becuase reducing fuels in ares \n     with greater hazards is often more expensive--meaning that \n     fewer acres can be completed with the same funding level--\n     managers have an incentive not to undertake efforts on such \n     lands.--GAO/RCED-99-65.\n\n  The parameters set forth in our amendment will ensure that the \nagencies conduct forest thinning in a way that truly reduces the threat \nof fire. For example, we require the agencies to focus on thinning \nprojects that truly reduce the threat of fire, namely removing small \ndiameter trees and brush. This limitation is based on numerous \nscientific research studies conducted by the Forest Service. Too often, \nthe Forest Service has cut large trees because of their commercial \nvalue instead of removing small-diameter trees that tend to spread \nfire.\n  Our amendment prohibits new road construction in inventoried roadless \nareas because the National Forests already contain 380,000 miles of \nroad, as a comparison, the National Highway System contains 160,000 \nmiles of roads, and the deferred maintenance needs on these existing \nroads totals more then $1 billion. Forest Service analysis reveals that \nroads increase the probability of accidental and intentional human-\ncaused ignitions.\n  A group of respected forest fire scientist recently wrote President \nBush a letter stating that, ``thinning of overstory trees, likely \nbuilding new roads, can often exacerbate the situation and damage \nforest health.'' Moreover, the vast majority of all trees in\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nthe west are small, more than 90 percent are 12 inches in diameter or \nsmaller.\n  Returning receipts to the Treasury is consistent with a provision in \nthe Wyden/Craig County payments legislation enacted 2 years ago and \navoids existing perverse incentives. Numerous GAO reports reveal that \nexisting agency trust funds provide incentives for the agency to cut \nlarge trees because it gets to keep the revenue. Cutting large trees \nwill not reduce fire risk, therefore, we should direct receipts back to \nthe Treasury. Jeremy Fried, a Forest Service research specialist at \nthe Pacific Northwest Research Station, states, ``If you take just big \ntrees, you do not reduce fire danger.''\n\n  The provision in our amendment stating that 70 percent of Hazardous \nFuels Reduction Funds be spent within one-half mile of any community \nstructure or within key municipal watersheds is more flexible than the \nPresident's fiscal year 2003 budget request which provides that the \nsame percentage only be spent near communities. We in Congress must \nensure that the agencies adhere to our direction that the number one \npriority is to protect communities at risk for catastrophic fire. To \ndate, this has not occurred. In fiscal year 2002, only 39 percent of \nthe areas where hazardous fuels will be treated are in the wildland/\nurban interface. In fiscal year 2003, only 55 percent of the acres \nscheduled to be treated are near communities. Finally, we need hard and \nfast assurance that the agencies will make its investments near \ncommunities because the National Fire Plan and the Western Governors' \nAssociation identify protecting people as the number one priority.\n  We are willing to provide the agencies with additional authority as \nset forth in our amendment but only to achieve the number of acres \ntreated that can be accomplished without a substantial increase in \nfunds. My amendment doubles the amount of acreage treated to reduce \nfire risk in the upcoming year form 2.5 million to 5 million acres \nwhereas Senator Craig's amendment covers 10 million acres of Federal \nland.\n  It is impossible for the agencies, even with the expedited procedures \nincluded in Senator Craig's amendment, to quadruple the amount of acres \ntreated annually. Since fiscal year 2001, Congress has provided about \n$400 million annually for hazardous fuels reduction. With this level of \nfunding, the agencies have treated approximately 2.5 million acres each \nyear. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate Interior appropriations bill \nprovides $414 million for hazardous fuels reduction, fully funding the \nAdministration's request. Again, the agencies estimate they will \ncomplete treatment on about 2.5 million acres. Senator Craig's \namendment does not provide any additional funds, therefore, it is \nincorrect to purport that now, suddenly, the agencies will quadruple \nthe amounts of acres treated.\n  Moreover, we do not need to treat every acre of land to reduce fire \nrisk. New Mexicans and others living in the west want their government \nto quickly and intelligently address the excessive build-up of \nhazardous fuels. If we're going to leverage limited Government funds to \nsolve this problem, we need to figure out in advance which forested \nlands need to be treated and how.\n  To act quickly and strategically to prevent catastrophic fires, we do \nnot need to treat every single acre of national forest and public \nlands. Instead, we should create firebreaks and other strategically \nthinned areas to stop fires from spreading out of control over large \nareas. A respected Forest Service researcher named Mark Finney has \nestimated that treatments need only address 20 percent of the \nlandscape, if thinned areas are strategically placed to make fires move \nperpendicular to the prevailing winds. The Forest Service should \nexperiment with Finney's ideas and those of others about how to most \nstrategically place thinning projects. The less acres the Government \nneeds to treat, the further our existing funds will stretch.\n  The board feet levels in this amendment are identical to the levels \npreviously set forth for categorical exclusions by the Forest Service. \nAlmost 3 years ago, a Federal district court invalidated these \ncategorical exclusions primarily because the agency literally lost its \nadministrative record. Notably, the court left room for the agency to \nreinstate these categorical exclusions but for some reason the agency \nstill has not done so. This approach also will benefit local businesses \nby requiring the agency to implement relatively smaller projects. \nResidents of Truchas, NM, tell me that the using categorical exclusions \nimproves the ability of local Federal land managers to make site \nspecific decisions that address community needs.\n  At this point in time, I do not believe we need to expedite judicial \nreview beyond what we offer in our amendment. Prohibiting any temporary \nrestraining orders or preliminary injunctions, which is what the \nRepublican and administration proposals would do, makes any judicial \nreview effectively irrelevant. In addition, on August 31, 2001, the \nGeneral Accounting Office reported that, of the hazardous fuels \nreduction projects identified for implementation in fiscal year 2001, \nnone had been litigated.\n  In conclusion, our amendment represents a thoughtful, balanced \napproach to expedite forest thinning in a way that truly reduces fire \nrisk for communities and the environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS.

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, about a year ago, we began hearings on the homeland \nsecurity issue in the Governmental Affairs Committee. Other committees \nhad hearings, but we had a series of hearings that lasted until \nrecently.\n  During that time, we reached bipartisan agreement on many important \nfactors. We reached bipartisan agreement on the notion that we need to \nreorganize our Government to meet the new challenges our country faces. \nWe live in a different world, a new world, a dangerous world, and we \nneed to reorganize our governmental agencies to deal with that world. \nWe have very broad bipartisan agreement on that.\n  We also discovered in that time that we have some very important \npoints of disagreement.\n  I think it was the understanding of everyone concerned that after we \naddressed this in the committee, after we had a full discussion, a \nseries of hearings, after we had an extensive markup and aired all of \nthese similarities, these points of agreement, and points of \ndisagreement, that we would be able to take that committee product, \nbring it to the floor, as Senator Lieberman has done, and that we would \nbe discussing the merits of the points of agreement and the points of \ndisagreement because we were about very important business of our \ncountry and the future safety of our country, with the full realization \nthat we were doing something that had not been done for over half a \ncentury in this Government, in terms of the scope of the \nreorganization.\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\n  I believe that was the understanding, that this would be the process, \nand that it was one of those rare times--all too rare around here--that \nwe would come together on both sides of the aisle and address it in \nthat way.\n  It was not to be. We have spent the last 3 weeks in the afternoons \nsupposedly on this bill and have accomplished very little.\n  Of course, we had the September 11 anniversary in the middle of that \ntime period, and we had a holiday in the midst of that time period. We \nalso had a commemoration in New York, which many of us attended, in \nconnection with the anniversary of September 11. But we still have had \n3 weeks of afternoons for consideration of this bill, and we only \nreally considered one of the substantive areas of disagreement.\n  We have had a considerable period of time in the way legislative \ncalendars go, but we have had very little time to consider these very \nimportant issues that we have been discussing in the press, in the \nmedia, on the floor, and in committee for now going on a year at least.\n  Instead of coming to the floor and proceeding with those issues, we \nhave had time taken up under the rules of the Senate, as Senators have \na right to do, on matters that are peripheral to the important \namendments and the issues with which we know we have to deal.\n  Our side of the aisle has all this time been trying to get \nconsideration of the issues that we know we have to consider. We are \ngoing to have to consider, one way or another, whether we want to \ndiminish the President's national security authority. Could there be \nanything more important than that?\n  We are going to have to decide whether or not we are going to give \nthis new Secretary management flexibility to deal with the new problems \nin any Governmental Department nowadays, especially in this one.\n  We are going to have to decide what kind of intelligence apparatus we \nare going to have within this new Department eventually.\n  We are going to have to decide whether we are going to give the \nPresident reorganization authority.\n  We are going to have to decide all these issues. All these issues \nhave been begging for consideration all this time. This Senator has \nbeen trying to get them up for consideration. This Senator took 6 days \ntrying to get a vote on the question of the nature of the White House \nperson and whether or not he would be Senate confirmed. We finally, \nafter 6 days, got a vote on that. It was a voice vote, and it was \nadopted. That is the only substantive amendment we have even had an \nopportunity to consider.\n  With that background, and before considering any of these other \nissues at all, or having any discussion, any debate, the other side has \nfiled cloture. After taking up all this time on all these other \nissues--days and hours of discussions on one thing or another--they \nhave filed cloture. They have essentially filed cloture against \nthemselves.\n  I may not have been here long enough to fully understand all of the \nhistory and the way things work around here, but I hope that it is a \nrare occurrence for the majority party, or anyone else, to bring up \ntheir own bill, filibuster, and then file cloture against themselves in \norder to cut off the other side from offering amendments, which we know \nhave to be considered. That is the situation we have. That is the \nbizarre circumstance in which we are today.\n  That is not the proper purpose of a cloture motion. I ask my \ncolleagues: Do they really believe there is any chance of getting a \nbill under these circumstances? This cloture motion is not about \nsubstance. It is not about moving the bill. Everybody knows if this \ncloture motion succeeds, there will be no bill this year. The President \nwill veto this bill as sure as I am standing here. Without even having \nthe opportunity to consider these issues concerning his own authority \nor the management flexibility or the reorganization or the intelligence \ncomponent, or any of these other issues, they file cloture and deprive \nus of considering these issues?\n  I am not sure anybody is going to argue the amendments would be \ngermane after cloture. The effect is to cut us off. It is not about \nsubstance. It is not about moving the bill along. It is about \nappearances and it is about assessing blame. I guess there is quite a \nbit of embarrassment around here that we have spent 3 weeks and have \nessentially done nothing. Now apparently we want to give the appearance \nwe are trying to move this along so we file cloture, plus putting us in \nthe position on this side of the aisle of opposing cloture and make it \nlook as if we are holding up the bill, when we are the ones who have \nbeen trying to get our amendments up and considered. I do not think the \nAmerican people are going to buy that.\n  When it comes to matters of this importance, where we could come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and address these issues, I say to those \nAmericans, better luck next time, because the matter has not gotten \nserious enough yet. We are only dealing with the security of this \ncountry, but we are going to engage in our same old games.\n  I have a suggestion that instead of worrying about the appearances of \nmoving this bill, let us actually move it. We should defeat this \ncloture motion and get on with those issues we are going to have to \naddress sooner or later and give us a chance of having a bill.\n  Therefore, I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose cloture in \nthis instance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I want to try to summarize my thoughts so \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee can preserve some of his time.\n  When 9/11 happened, and after that terrible day when we all stood \ntogether in front of the Capitol and sang ``God Bless America,'' I \nthought that coming together on a proposal to defend our country and \nits people was going to be about as easy as it had been after December \n7, 1941. I was absolutely and totally wrong.\n  As strange as it sounds, as unbelievable as it is, the Lieberman bill \ntakes power away from President Bush to declare a national emergency \nand, in the process, override business as usual in the Federal \nbureaucracy, a power that Jimmy Carter had, a power that Ronald Reagan \nhad, a power that the first President Bush had, a power that Bill \nClinton had and used.\n  Incredibly, after thousands of our people have died, after all of the \nsuffering and all the trauma, we now have in a bill--a bill that is \nshameless enough to call itself related to homeland security--an effort \nto take power away from the President that he had on 9/11.\n  I am not sure the American people truly understand that President \nBush has asked for no additional emergency powers to set aside work \nrules within the Federal bureaucracy. In fact, he has already agreed to \nreduce those powers very slightly as compared to what his four \npredecessors possessed. But that is not enough for the supporters of \nthe Lieberman bill. They want to deny the President the power to \ndeclare, on a national security basis, that we change the way the \nbureaucracy works to allow him to put the right person in the right \nplace at the right time.\n  Let me give a concrete example of it. At Logan Airport in 1987, \nCustoms agents decided they needed to change the way a room was \nstructured in order to do inspections and in order to improve the \nquality of the inspections. The Treasury employees labor union objected \nand filed a complaint with the Federal Labor Relations Authority that \nsaid, under their union work rules, they had to sign off on a change in \nthe work space, and the FLRA ruled that the Customs Service could not \nchange their inspections facility because it overrode a provision of \nthat union contract.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that two of those planes that were \ninvolved in terrorist attacks flew out of Logan Airport. Are we today \nto allow a work agreement and the Federal Labor Relations Authority to \noverride the President if he wants to improve security at Logan \nAirport? I do not think so. I do not think the American people believe \nthat we should, but that is exactly what is being proposed.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this idea that in the name of \nnational security we should take national security power away from the \nPresident. If this\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\ncloture motion prevails, we will have only been allowed to offer one \namendment, the Thompson amendment. A vote to kill it failed, but then \nfor 3\\1/2\\ days it was held in limbo. If this cloture motion is agreed \nto, a substitute amendment, which perhaps is supported by between 40 \nand 50 Senators, would not be able to be offered.\n  The majority had a right to file a cloture motion--that is the way \nthe Senate works--but with all due respect I think it was wrong to file \nit. I do not think it can be justified given we have had an opportunity \nto offer one amendment, and I do not believe the American people would \nbe in favor of ending debate on this bill while its major feature takes \npower away from the President to use national security waivers instead \nof preserving that power. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \ncloture motion.\n  I conclude by reading a quote from Dwight David Eisenhower. I think \nit is very appropriate as we debate the Homeland Security Department \nand its structure. Ike said:\n\n       The right organization will not guarantee success, but the \n     wrong organization will guarantee failure.\n\n  I believe the bill, as it is now structured, is an unworkable \norganization. The President has said he will veto it, that he would \nrather have no bill than this. When are we going to awaken and give the \nPresident the tools he needs to finish the job? I hope it is soon, and \nI hope we begin today by voting down this motion to deny us the ability \nto give the Senate an opportunity to work its will on the President's \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has a half hour.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What are the rules? Do I have to ask for a specific \nnumber of minutes or may I speak until I finish my remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls 30 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask Senator Lieberman if he will yield 5 minutes to me \nto speak in favor of cloture on his amendment, and then address the \nByrd amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia for that purpose.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much for yielding me the time.\n  As I begin my remarks, I offer my thanks to both Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Byrd for the work they have done on behalf of the American \npeople and for the principled and deliberative approach they have \nbrought to this very complex issue.\n  I have tremendous misgivings about the size and shape of this \nDepartment, which I will address. I do want to seek cloture. I do want \nto see some finality. I do think this is very important.\n  I was distressed yesterday to hear comments from the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, in which he said the American Government was the \nlaughingstock of the world because of our work rules. That is the first \ntime I have ever heard that the American Government is the \nlaughingstock of the world for any reason.\n  This is the greatest country in the world, and I believe one of the \nkey reason, is our people and their dedication. I know one of the big \nissues between both sides and some on our side of the aisle, as \nexpressed by Senator Miller yesterday, is we should, in fact, change \nsome of the worker rules and strip some of those rules from this new \nDepartment. I want to say respectfully I will fight that with every \nbone in my body, as will the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from \nTexas, who will oppose what my view is.\n  I want to say this and not linger on it too long because we will have \nmore time. Every single one of the heroes of 9/11--every fireman, every \npoliceman, every emergency worker--happened to be covered by work \nrules. They never looked at their watch and said, oh, my God, I am \nworking overtime, I had better get out of here, or I am in danger and I \nshould be getting hazardous duty pay. We never saw that. We saw an \nincredible dedication by workers who cared about what they were doing. \nI found it tremendously insulting to hear those words in the Senate. I \nwill fight for those workers.\n\n  We are creating a homeland security office that is supposed to be \nsecond to the Pentagon in defending the American people. What do we do \nto the people who work in that Department? Make them second class. In \nmy opinion, that is disastrous. I have met some of the workers. They \nare the heroes of tomorrow. They deserve to be treated with respect, \nnot stripped of the worker rules that protect them. We will talk more \nabout that.\n  Briefly, I support the Byrd amendment, and I look forward to having a \nchance to speak at greater length. This is a huge change in our \nGovernment. Under the current plan, much improved from the House--the \nLieberman plan is much improved from the House version--we will be \ntaking 170,000 employees and shifting them over to a new Department. \nMany of these agencies have multiple responsibilities--not just to \nprotect the homeland but, for example, in the Coast Guard search and \nrescue missions, so important to my home State.\n  In the case of FEMA, when we have an earthquake, if we have a flood, \nor if there is a hurricane anywhere in the country, FEMA must come and \ndeal with it, deal with the people who suffer losses, deal with the \nbusinesses that suffer losses. I don't understand why we have taken \nthose agencies in whole cloth and placed them in the new Department.\n  Senator Byrd says, yes, we need this Department of Homeland Security. \nHe moves forward with the top level people who will be bright and \nsmart, who will be able to look at their challenge and let the Congress \nknow in the ensuing days, weeks, and months what they need to do their \njob. Senator Byrd is courageous to get out here and slow this train \ndown.\n  I have been in government a long time. I started at local government \nmany years ago. I was on a county board of supervisors. We ran the \nwhole county--the court system, the emergency workforce, transit \ndistrict, and the rest. One of the lessons I learned: Do not do \nsomething that just looks good; do not do something that just sounds \ngood; do not do something just because it protects you politically; do \nsomething right. Mostly I learned, don't do something so big, so huge, \nthat there is less accountability rather than more accountability.\n  I thank Senator Byrd. I support the cloture motion. I want to see a \nstreamlined Homeland Security Department. That is what I will work for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the cloture motion Senator Daschle has \nfiled. It does seem to me that it is time to begin heading toward a \nconclusion of our deliberations on homeland security and to have a \nfinal vote as soon as we can. This cloture petition is a way to begin \nto do that. I have said before, and I will say it again, briefly, some \nof members on the Governmental Affairs Committee have been at this for \nalmost a year now. In fact, a certain amount of activity began in \nCongress before that. Congressman Thornberry of Texas, a distinguished \nMember of the other body, introduced legislation early in 2001, months \nbefore September 11, to create a Department of Homeland Security. That \nwas based on the work of the so-called Hart-Rudman Commission.\n  Our committee was carrying out hearings on this matter, held one \nprescheduled on September 12 on the question of how to protect the \nAmerican people from terrorist assaults on our cyber-systems, a point \nof vulnerability that we have to organize ourselves to protect against. \nWe held 18 hearings in our committee related to homeland security and \nthe creation of the Department. Our committee reported out a bill in \nMay by a 9-to-7 vote, unfortunately, a partisan split on the committee \nat that point.\n  President Bush endorsed the idea of a Homeland Security Department, \nand his proposed Department, most of the recommendations were quite \nsimilar--some exactly the same--as those contained in the bill that had \ncome out of our committee in May on a partisan vote. We worked together \nwith the White House and members of the committee.\n  On July 24 and 25 of this year, we had two long, thoughtful, \nproductive days of markup in our committee and reported out the \namendment before the\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nSenate as the underlying amendment creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  We came to this bill immediately after we returned after Labor Day. \nThis is the third week. A lot of the days have not been full days. We \nhave had the two-tiered system with appropriations matters in the \nmorning and homeland security in the afternoon. There has been a lot of \ndebate and I hope a lot of consideration of the merits and demerits of \nthe various ideas.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have begun to \ncomplain about the pace of action; that the longer we wait to adopt a \nhomeland security measure, the longer it will take to set it up, the \nmore the American people will be exposed to danger from the terrorists \nwho are clearly out there. We see it every day in the paper. We know it \nourselves from briefings we have had, both open and classified. The \nenemy is there and not just at our door, but as we see from the arrests \nthat occurred in Lackawanna, NY, within the last week, they are inside \nthe house.\n  It is time to move forward on the 90 percent of ideas that are pretty \nmuch the same. We have some parts on which we are in disagreement. \nSenator Gramm and the occupant of the chair, I gather, have a \nsubstitute amendment. We have various amendments to try to alter the \nunderlying amendment. Let's get on with it.\n  I must say, I am puzzled, having heard the Senator from Texas speak a \nfew moments ago, how those who have claimed we are not moving fast \nenough toward adopting a Department of Homeland Security bill because \nof the dangers involved are now going to vote against this cloture \npetition, which, of course, as all the Members know, would essentially \nnarrow the debate, begin to move us toward germane amendments, and \nhopefully say to our colleagues and to our country that we are getting \nclose to that time when we have to act.\n  I am puzzled why people who have complained about the pace of action \non the Department of Homeland Security bill would vote against this \ncloture motion, against a vote on cloture. I hope they give it a second \nthought. Not only is there a critical urgency that we move forward to \nadopt this bill, get it to a conference committee with the House, get \nit to the President's desk, have it adopted, begin the work of creating \nthe Department, but, Lord knows, we have a lot of other important work \nto do in this Senate and in the Congress generally, with appropriations \nbills, with matters related to potential military action against Iraq, \nmatters related to the economy--particularly the retirement security of \nthe American people, reactions to the corporate scandals that have \noccurred about which there is broad bipartisan interest in having us do \nsomething.\n\n  I think the time is now. I think each of us ought to vote for cloture \nand then let's have a system for having a finite number of amendments \ncome before the Chamber. Let's give people the opportunity to make this \nbill as it came out of the committee better than it is. I think we have \ndone a pretty good job. I described it yesterday, I believe, here on \nthe floor as obviously not perfect but the first best effort toward \ntaking the disorganization that exists now, that is dangerous, and \norganizing not just our Federal Government but our national strength to \nmeet the terrorist threat.\n  I just came from a meeting with some families of victims of September \n11. I have met with them several times before. There were about 120 who \nwe lost, who were residents of Connecticut--a grievous loss. From the \nfirst time I met with them, they asked the question that echoes in my \nmind and my heart, which is, How could this have happened? And the \nsubquestion is, Could this have been prevented so I would not have lost \na spouse, a child, a parent, a friend?\n  This Department proposal is an answer to that question--not fully the \nanswer to the question of how it could have happened, but surely an \nanswer to the plea that we take action to make sure nothing such as \nSeptember 11 ever happens again. It is for that reason I support the \ncloture motion and hope my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will vote \nfor it so we may then go forward on a bipartisan basis to adopt a bill \nthat will, as soon as possible, create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. Does the Senator wish to speak on the cloture \nmotion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not at length. Just a moment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to yield time to the Senator as he needs.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Mr. President, John Stuart Mill said:\n\n       On all great issues, much remains to be said.\n  This is a great issue. Much remains to be said. I understand that \nsome said that I have been filibustering and holding the floor. I would \nlike to hear that again. I am not holding the floor.\n\n       On all great issues, much remains to be said.\n\n  I hope other Senators will say much on the pending amendment, the \nReid-Byrd amendment. The floor is open.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to each side.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, neither side seems to be interested in \nsaying anything at the moment. I have a statement I would like to make \nif both sides would allow me to have the time, 10 minutes--I might be \nable to make it in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. NICKLES. What was the request?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The suggestion Senator Byrd raises is since neither \nside is using the time allocated, he has a statement he would like to \nmake in the remaining time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have a statement to make on the vote we will have in \n10 minutes, and then I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator may have the floor if he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to have the Senator from West \nVirginia speak. I do wish to speak on the issue we have before us.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: The unanimous consent calls for a vote at \n12:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes remain, according to a \nsubsequent unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I ask how much time our side has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The vote is anticipated to be at 12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 12:40.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me a few minutes?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield such time as the Senator may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think we have had some good debate. I \nam not here to debate the substance of the two proposals, but I am here \nto debate strongly against voting for cloture. It seems like I was here \nyesterday doing the same thing on the Interior bill. I am going to do \nit again. My friend and colleague for whom I have the greatest respect, \nthe Senator from West Virginia, knows the Senate rules better than \nany--I mentioned yesterday that we are getting way too frivolous about \ndropping cloture votes every time somebody wants to have a vote. It \nachieves no purpose whatsoever.\n  That is exactly what is going to happen here. Cloture is a very \nserious procedure. That limits a Senator's ability\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\nto offer amendments. The Senate of the United States is one of the \ngreatest institutions in the history of democracy, and we are going to \nhave cloture. I have heard some colleagues say they hope it is invoked. \nIf it is, that means the amendment the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson, is offering, along with Senator Gramm and Senator Miller, \ncannot be offered because it would be nongermane. Are we going to deny \nthem the opportunity to offer an amendment they have worked hard on and \nwhich every colleague in this body knows they are entitled to offer? \nAre we going to file cloture so you can't offer amendments to it?\n  I am amazed at how quickly people draw their gun of cloture to deny \nSenators on both sides the opportunity to offer amendments. I know \nthere are a lot of amendments that are floating around. I have heard \npeople say, for example, I think I might do an amendment dealing with \nthe intelligence operation. Those amendments, in almost all likelihood, \nwould be nongermane.\n  I just urge my colleagues to let us respect the rights of individual \nSenators to offer amendments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my friend from Oklahoma--I have not had an \nopportunity given to me to look at the substitute that may be offered \nby the Senator from Texas--why would it be germane if parts of it don't \nrelate to homeland security?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the question of my good friend. I am sure \nhe is aware of the Senate rules postcloture. Germaneness requirements \nare so strict that they prohibit a lot of amendments; amendments that \nare, frankly, quite germane wouldn't be germane by the ruling of the \nParliamentarian and by the history and precedents of the Senate.\n  We have all been around here for a while--some of us longer than \nothers. Postcloture germaneness is very strict and would prohibit \nprobably 90-some percent of the amendments to be offered. Any Senator \ncould offer amendments to strike a section of the Senator's bill. I \nguess we have been doing that a long time, but that is not the way to \ndo it. The Senator from Texas should be entitled to offer his \namendment. Senator Miller cosponsored the amendment. A lot of us have \ncosponsored the amendment. We want to have the right to offer that \namendment.\n  I haven't asked the Parliamentarian. But I would guess, if the \nParliamentarians have reviewed the language, they would find that \namendment would be nongermane postcloture. It is germane to the \nsubject. It would be germane by almost anybody's definition of \ngermaneness because we are talking about homeland security. It would be \ngermane because it is the President's proposal. The White House worked \non it, but according to strict Parliamentarian procedures, it may well \nbe ruled nongermane.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know what the Senator is saying. We all \nknow the Parliamentarian gives guidance, but I hope when the Senator \ntalks about the Parliamentarian and the aid which the Parliamentarian \ngives, we are talking about the ruling of the Chair. It is not the \nruling by the Parliamentarian, with all due respect to the \nParliamentarian. The Chair gets the guidance of the Parliamentarian. \nBut it is still the ruling by the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague saying it is the ruling of the \nChair. And the ruling would be following the advice most likely of the \nParliamentarian who would be following the precedents of the Senate. \nAnd the precedents of the Senate would be postcloture germaneness, \nwhich is very strict, indeed. And most germane amendments would fall. \nWe have just begun this debate.\n\n  I will tell my friend and colleague, who is also the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, that we agreed to allow two bills to go \nsimultaneously--Interior and the Department of Homeland Security. \nNeither bill is moving, much to my chagrin as a person who realizes we \nonly have 10 days left in this fiscal year, and we haven't been passing \nappropriations bills. We dual-tracked some bills when the Senator from \nWest Virginia was majority leader. We dual-tracked bills under Bob Dole \nas well. Sometimes it works. For the last 3 weeks it has not worked.\n  We haven't made adequate progress on Homeland Security, and we \nhaven't made adequate progress on Interior. Maybe it is because all of \nus have to fight or to wrestle with too many issues simultaneously. I \nam not sure. But the progress on both bills has been rather poor.\n  If we want to--and I want to--pass every appropriations bill by the \nend of the fiscal year and have them on the President's desk for his \nsignature, or for his veto. I think that is our constitutional \nresponsibility. We are not getting it done. That is disappointing me.\n  I happen to think there probably is no greater issue confronting this \nCongress than the Department of Homeland Security. And I think we \nshould have the opportunity to be able to offer alternatives. If \ncloture is invoked, I am afraid the primary alternative authored by \nSenators Gramm, Miller, Thompson, and myself wouldn't be allowed \npostcloture.\n  That is why I would say in fairness that we can count votes. I know \nyou are not going to get cloture. I do not know why we are doing it. If \nwe gave you cloture, we could tie this place up. Nobody is \nfilibustering this bill.\n  No one--at least on this side. Maybe others are. Maybe others have \ndifferent agendas, but no one on this side of the aisle wants to \nfilibuster this bill in any way, shape, or form.\n  I will say the same thing for the Interior bill. We had a vote on \ncloture on the Interior bill. I heard the Senator from West Virginia \nsay he wouldn't filibuster. We are not filibustering. Cloture is \nsupposed to shut off debate. Why? We are not having extended debate. We \nare not stretching out debate, not on Interior--and not on Homeland \nSecurity. We are willing to vote on the amendments on the Department of \nthe Interior, and vote. We may win; we may lose. I have won some; I \nhave lost some. That is part of being a legislator.\n  The same thing for Homeland Security; let us vote on the alternative.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish we would get on with Interior and the \nother appropriations bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee, as I \nhave said many times, has reported all 13 appropriations bills. We did \nthat long ago. Senator Stevens and I, and every Republican and every \nDemocrat on that committee voted. We have 13 appropriations bills on \nthe calendar.\n  If we cannot finish the Interior appropriations bill, will the \nSenator help us to get unanimous consent to proceed to other \nappropriations bills? We could take up Senate appropriations bills. We \ndon't have all of the House appropriations bills. The House \nAppropriations Committee has not reported all 13 appropriations bills. \nBut we have reported all of the 13 Senate appropriations.\n\n  Will the Senator and his side of the aisle help us to get unanimous \nconsent to go to the other appropriations bills?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to respond to my good friend and \ncolleague. I will help you try to get the appropriations bills done. I \nwill also tell you what I told my very good friend, Senator Reid. I \nwill object to dual-tracking on homeland security and appropriations \nbills simultaneously because it doesn't work. I think maybe we should \nhave a little greater focus and stay on homeland security.\n  I don't care if we stay all night and all weekend, this is an \nimportant issue. We ought to finish it.\n  I will tell my friend and colleague from West Virginia that I will \nstay all night, and we will help finish these appropriations bills. I \ndon't care if we have to work every weekend between now and the end of \nthe year, let us do it. But I don't like this idea of dual-tracking \nunless we have a greater understanding on the Interior bill. Let us \nfinish it.\n  I used to manage the Interior bill. I worked with my colleague. I was \nchairman of the committee. I was chairman, and I was ranking. We did \nthe Interior bill year after year, I might mention, with my colleague, \nSenator Reid, also\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nassisting on the floor. We did that bill generally in 3 days. We got it \ndone. It is usually a bipartisan bill, and it would usually pass with \n90 votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Shakespeare said the Senator ``is a man of \nmy own kidney.'' Some would say ``a man after my own heart.'' The \nSenator said he is willing to stay here all night and get these \nappropriations bill done. Let us do that.\n  I believe the objections from the other side of the aisle on moving \nthose bills is the word out of the White House. I am just thinking--I \nam presuming, some things which I have seen and heard are to that \neffect--that the word has come out of the White House. Has it come out \nof the White House to the Speaker of the other body?\n  That is where appropriations bills generally originate. \nAppropriations bills generally and customarily originate in the House.\n  Can the Senator inform me as to whether the word has come down from \non high to the House to hold up those appropriations bills? The House \nhas not moved those appropriations bills, and it is not because of the \nHouse chairman, Mr. Young. He would eagerly move those bills.\n  Can the Senator elucidate on this question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will have a minute at least to respond. \nWill the Senator from Connecticut yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut controls 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Does the Senator wish unanimous consent for an \nadditional moment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are not going to extend the time for the \nvote. I don't mind Senator Lieberman yielding him some of his time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator a minute of my \ntime.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my good friend from \nConnecticut doing that.\n  I just say, since I have taken all of Senator Thompson's time, I hope \nSenator Thompson, if he wishes, will be able to speak on the issue. We \nhave had an interesting colloquy. And I am happy to extend that time.\n  I am happy to work with my friend and colleague. I happen to be one \nwho thinks the Senate does not have to wait on the House. It is \ntradition. It is not constitutional. But the Senate has not been \nsetting records. Well, maybe we are setting records on Interior. We \nhave been on it for 3 weeks and have not finished it. So we are not \ndoing our job. Maybe the House isn't getting its job done, either. \nHopefully, both will get it done.\n  I would hope my colleague from Connecticut would yield some time to \nthe Senator from Tennessee on the issue at hand. I appreciate the \nconsideration of the Chair and my friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly, and then \nI will yield. The Senator from Nevada has withdrawn his request to \nspeak. Let me say a few words.\n  My friend from Oklahoma has talked about his concern that the \nsubstitute that the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, has fashioned would \nnot be ruled germane. I don't know because I have not seen it. But, of \ncourse, there is another alternative here, which is the normal course.\n  I refer back to our Governmental Affairs Committee's deliberations on \nthe bill in which, after we put our mark down, Senator Thompson, as \nranking member, offered several amendments going to powers of the \nPresident to reorganize, the latitude over appropriations, obviously \nmuch interest in civil service, collective bargaining questions, some \ndispute over the exact powers of division of intelligence in the new \nDepartment that all of us agree ought to be created, but we disagree on \nwhat powers it should have.\n  Again, I am not the Parliamentarian, but picking up on what the \nSenator from West Virginia has said, it certainly would seem to me \nthere would be ample basis for whomever the Presiding Officer is at the \ntime to rule that the kinds of amendments that the Senator from \nTennessee offered in committee--which put it in issue and give the \nSenate a choice of what I think are the remaining relatively small \nnumber of issues in controversy--would, in fact, be ruled germane. So \nthat is the way to get this moving.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. For a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just knowing postcloture, if the Senator from Tennessee \noffered the substitute section dealing with collective bargaining, \ndealing with Presidential flexibility, I can assure you--or my guess \nis--that 90 percent of those would be ruled nongermane. And that is \njust the facts of the postcloture rules in the Senate.\n  I understand what you are saying. One way we can nibble, we can \nstrike. We can always strike, but if we wanted to have strike-and-\ninsert language, most of those amendments would be ruled nongermane. \nThat is the reason why I am urging my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend.\n  My answer would be, again, I have not seen the exact components of \nthe substitute from the Senator from Texas, but as my staff has heard \nit described, it follows pretty closely after the House bill, which, \nagain, if I were in the chair I would think are germane.\n  I want to yield a few moments--as much time as he would like--to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I simply want to say this. It is obvious there are \nefforts made for us to do nothing in the Senate. And that is being \naccomplished almost 100 percent because we basically are accomplishing \nnothing.\n  The majority leader has attempted to invoke cloture on the Interior \nbill so we could move on. We are hung up with an amendment dealing with \nfirefighting, which is too bad; Neither side has 60 votes. The rules \nhave been in effect for 215 years, basically, with some minor changes. \nThose are the rules of the Senate. You need 60 votes on controversial \nissues. So we cannot move on Interior. That is too bad.\n  And on homeland security, the President has talked to every Senator \nin this room about the importance of that piece of legislation. Why \ncan't we move on? If cloture were invoked on this, it would narrow the \ntime with which we have to work on this bill. It would go to \nconference, of which the President has tremendous clout in the \nconference, and get this bill down to him.\n  I am seriously thinking that there are efforts being made here that \nwe don't finish this bill, and then that we, the majority, can be \nblamed for not completing the homeland security bill. We want to \ncomplete this bill. Even Senator Byrd, who, as everyone knows--because \nhe stated it on the floor--has problems with this piece of legislation, \nsigned a cloture motion.\n  We all know we have to move on with this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the Senator think it would expedite completion of \nhomeland security if we allow Senator Gramm's and Senator Miller's \namendment to be adopted, or at least be voted on? Let's have an up-or-\ndown vote on the Gramm-Miller substitute, let's have an up-or-down vote \non Lieberman, and maybe a couple other amendments, and we can complete \nthis bill.\n  Mr. REID. Well, Mr. President, we have spent days here. People are \nblaming Senator Byrd for slowing things down. All anyone has to do, \nwhen Senator Byrd sits down, is move to table his amendment, or what is \ngoing on at the time. There has been unending stalling on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I repeat, the President has talked to me. He has talked to the \nPresiding Officer. He has talked to the managers of the bill. He has \ntalked to Senator Nickles--everybody--about this bill. He believes this \nis important. Let's move on with it. If this bill comes out of the \nSenate, and it is not perfect, what he wants, he controls the House of \nRepresentatives. He has tremendous, I repeat, clout with the Senate.\n  We want to get this bill done. Let's move on.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't think I heard an answer to the question. \nShouldn't Senators Gramm and Miller be entitled to offer their \namendment? And you also said there are some people stalling. There is \nnobody on this side of the aisle who is stalling this piece of \nlegislation. And either side can move to table Senator Byrd's \namendment. I am happy to do that. But I am going to always insist that \nour colleagues have a right to offer their amendment.\n  Won't you agree with me to give Senator Gramm and Senator Miller a \nvote on their amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Nobody is stopping them from having a vote on their \namendment. Who says their amendment is not germane?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Cloture would stop them from having a vote.\n  Mr. REID. I would doubt that it is. But whatever are the rules of the \nSenate are the rules of the Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as this Nation wages our war against \nterrorism, I rise today in support of the Lieberman substitute \namendment to H.R. 5005, the Homeland Security Act. We must take this \ncritical step now, in a way that protects both our liberties and our \nlives.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Lieberman, and the entire Committee \non Government Affairs for drafting such meaningful and comprehensive \nlegislation.\n  The Government Affairs Committee reported the bill on a strong \nbipartisan vote of 12 to 5--a clear sign of substantial support. It is \nunfortunate that the President has threatened to veto this legislation.\n  It fills me with a deep sense of sadness that it took the tragedy of \n1 year ago to bring us this far. The deaths of nearly 3,000 people \nshowed us, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that our Government was ill-\nprepared to tackle the multifaceted threat of terrorism.\n  We would be doing a great disservice to the memory of those that \nperished on September 11--and to the citizens this new department will \nbe sworn to protect--if we fail to adopt a more effective system to \ncombat terror.\n  As a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee and chairman \nof the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government \nInformation, I have been immersed in the debate on homeland security \nfor a long time now.\n  I believe that we need to reorganize agencies to better fight the war \non terror and I think that the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity is a good first step.\n  This belief grew largely out of extensive hearings. In the 107th \nCongress alone, the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee has held 16 \nhearings with 79 witnesses on counterterrorism.\n  Other subcommittee hearings covered narcoterrorism, seaport security, \nthe National Guard, cyberterrorism, critical infrastructure, weapons of \nmass destruction, bioterrorism, biometric identifiers, and identity \ntheft.\n  Above all, what stood out at these hearings was the lack of \ncoordination among specific agencies involved in homeland security, \nbolstering the need for fundamental reorganization of our counter-\nterrorism effort.\n  For example, we dealt with the problems at the National \nInfrastructure Protection Center, NIPC, the chief body for coordinating \nthe Federal response to cyber-terrorism attacks.\n  The hearing revealed that NIPC had strong investigative capabilities \nbut was weak in analysis, warning and outreach.\n  Now, under the homeland security legislation, NIPC's investigative \nresponsibilities will remain at the FBI but the other functions will be \ntransferred to the Homeland Security Department.\n  These overall shortcomings in counterterrorism led me to introduce \nappropriate legislation.\n  Following the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole, Senator Kyl and I \nintroduced the Counterterrorism Act of 2000. This legislation would \nhave implemented a number of recommendations made by the \ncongressionally-mandated National Commission on Terrorism.\n  The Senate passed this Counterterrorism Act unanimously, before the \nend of the 106th Congress. Unfortunately, the House did not act on the \nbill before it adjourned.\n  But we are in a dramatically different world now--and we are facing \nan enemy capable of any striking out anytime, anywhere, and by a wide \nvariety of methods. The need for a Department of Homeland Security \ncould not be greater.\n  More important than getting it done, however, is getting it done \nright.\n  There are four key areas that I would like to address: the overall \nstructure of the new department, the critical role of immigration to \nhomeland security and the future of the INS, my concerns about \nintelligence sharing, the need for strong oversight over the money we \nspend fighting terrorism, and the importance of protecting our civil \nservants.\n  The task before us is enormous--the largest restructuring of the \nfederal government in half a century.\n  It come as no surprise that this last reshuffling was in response to \na new and unexpected war--the cold war. The Department of Defense, the \nCIA and the National Security Council were created by the National \nSecurity Act of 1947.\n  Begun in the immediate aftermath of World War II, the restructuring \ntook years of work and compromise between the executive and legislative \nbranches. To think we could undertake a similar operation in a matter \nof days or weeks is simply not practical.\n  We are talking about some 200,000 federal jobs, from over 20 \nagencies, to be shuffled around. Add to this a large chunk of the \nfederal budget--at least $40 billion, not counting transition costs.\n  As we begin this massive reorganization, it is critical to do \neverything we can to stay focused and organized in the fight against \nterrorism.\n  Nothing could be worse than if this reorganization effort distracted \nfrom the real work of the good people in these agencies--people who are \ncontinuing the difficult, complex, and ongoing fight to prevent future \nacts of terrorism.\n  We must also be sure to strike an appropriate balance regarding which \nagencies to move and why.\n  Nowhere is this more critical, in my mind, than with the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service.\n  One of the most alarming facts about September 11 is how the \nterrorists used our visa system to enter the United States with \nimpunity. They lingered here, undetected and under the radar, while \nsome were even reissued visas after the attacks.\n\n  Because of this--and because I have long believed our borders to be \nsieves--last year I introduced the Border Security and Visa Reform \nEntry Act, with Senators Kyl, Kennedy and Brownback.\n  Now that this legislation is law, the Congress must work closely with \nthe administration to ensure that its provisions are properly and \ntimely implemented.\n  The main thrust of this legislation was to prevent terrorists from \nentering the United States through gaping loopholes in our immigration \nand visa system.\n  Yet there is still much more to do, because the future of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service is critical to our homeland \nsecurity efforts.\n  To do this means ensuring that the immigration agency has the \nsufficient personnel and resources to get the job done. Without doubt, \nthis is a daunting task.\n  When the President first released his proposal to create a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I had major concerns about \ntransferring all immigration functions into a department made up of \nmore than 25 different agencies and burdened with 120-plus different \nmissions. But if such a transfer is to take place, the Lieberman \nsubstitute would implement it in the best possible way.\n  The President's proposal contained a mere two and a half pages of \nlegislative language abolishing the INS and permitting the \nadministration to divide the immigration system.\n  The White House would divide the INS with little direction as to how \nthe agency would meet its new homeland security mission, and with \nlittle input from Congress. It would also establish a weak executive to \noversee the immigration functions.\n  Finally, the administration's proposed new structure fails to \nadequately respond to intelligence failures at the hands of our front-\nline agencies.\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\n  For example, the General Accounting Office and the Justice \nDepartment's Office of the Inspector General has repeatedly criticized \nthe INS for its failure to adequately train its officers to properly \nanalyze intelligence information it collects from the field and from \nother agencies.\n  Yet the administration's bill fails to create a mechanism by which \nFederal authorities can share critical information with INS more \nquickly, so that the agency's officers and adjudicators can make the \nright decisions about whom to admit and whom to deny entry into the \nUnited States.\n  The Lieberman substitute, on the other hand, would establish two \nseparate enforcement and service bureaus with clear lines of authority. \nThis would ensure that: the agency's missions are straight-forward, \nthat they are properly managed and staffed, and that policies handed \ndown from the Director or the deputy directors of the two bureaus are \nimplemented and followed in the field offices.\n  The Lieberman substitute would also elevate the stature of the new \nimmigration agency executive--the Under Secretary for Immigration \nAffairs--and put into place a strong agency executive.\n  Right now, the Commissioner's office is too low in the Justice \nDepartment hierarchy to hold much weight with other federal agencies.\n  It has little meaningful authority over the District Directors, who \nwield enormous power, but are difficult to hold accountable. This would \nnot necessarily change under the administration's proposal.\n  The Lieberman substitute would also separate the enforcement and \nservice functions of the INS, but place them within the same \nDirectorate.\n  This would allow both bureaus to coordinate such functions as \ninvestigating visa fraud, and conducting background checks of \napplicants for visas, naturalization, other immigration benefits, and \nentry.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Lieberman substitute contains the \nUnaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act, bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced in January 2001.\n  I also believe that this illustrates how important it is, given this \nenormous restructuring, that we be very careful not to lump every role \nof every agency under the umbrella of homeland security.\n  Unaccompanied children represent the most vulnerable segment of the \nimmigrant population.\n  Clearly, most unaccompanied alien children do not pose a threat to \nour national security, and must be treated with all the care and \ndecency they deserve, outside the reach of this new department.\n  More specifically, this measure, comprising Title XII of the \nLieberman substitute, would make critical reforms to the manner in \nwhich unaccompanied alien children are treated under our immigration \nsystem.\n  It would also preserve the functions of apprehending and adjudicating \nimmigration claims of such children and repatriating a child to his \nhome country when the situation warrants within the Immigration Affairs \nAgency, under the larger umbrella of homeland security.\n  The unaccompanied alien child protection provisions would transfer \nthe care and custody of these children to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Its Office of Refugee Resettlement office has real \nexpertise in dealing with both child welfare and immigration issues.\n  These provisions would also establish minimum standards for the care \nof unaccompanied alien children; provide mechanisms to ensure that \nunaccompanied alien children have access to counsel, and have a \nguardian ad litem appointed to look after their interests; and provide \nsafeguards to ensure that children engaged in criminal behavior remain \nunder the control of immigration enforcement authorities at all times.\n  Roughly 5,000 foreign-born children under the age of 18 enter the \nUnited States each year unaccompanied by parents or other legal \nguardians. Some have fled political persecution, war, famine, abusive \nfamilies, or other life-threatening conditions in their home countries.\n  They often have a harder time than adults in expressing their fears \nor testifying in court, especially given their lack of English language \nproficiency. Despite these circumstances, the Federal response has \nfallen short in providing for their protection.\n  No immigration laws or policies currently exist to effectively meet \nthe needs of these children. Instead, children are being force to \nstruggle through a complex system that was designed for adults.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service detains some 35 percent of \nthese children in juvenile jails. There they are subject to strip \nsearches, shackles and handcuffs.\n  Even worse, their experiences of detention and isolation are often as \ntraumatic as the persecution they fled in their home countries.\n  These problems are emblematic of our immigration system. It is \nmanaged by a bureaucracy ill equipped to help the thousands of \nunaccompanied children in need of special protection.\n\n  This is why I urge my colleagues to support these important measures.\n  These changes would guarantee that the proposed Department of \nHomeland Security is not burdened with functions that do not relate to \nits core mission.\n  Second, it would ensure that the INS dedicate itself to its central \nfunctions and not suffer mission overload. And finally, the move would \nensure that the interests of unaccompanied alien children are \nprotected.\n  The future of the INS highlights two distinct questions, which relate \nto the larger issue of homeland security.\n  First, how we protect innocent civilians, immigrants and citizens \nalike, while uprooting terrorists and preventing terrorist attack, and \nsecond, how we organize such a large department in a way that avoids \nduplication and inefficiency.\n  With respect to this last question, the Lieberman bill is a marked \nimprovement from the present situation, where more than 100 Federal \nagencies across the government play some role within homeland security, \nnot to mention all 50 states and literally thousands of localities.\n  On one level, success depends on how the federal merges with State \nand local government--the so-called ``first responders''--and from the \ncooperation of citizens.\n  This is true on a variety of issues, from preventing possible \nattacks, through shared intelligence, to reacting to when an attack \nstrikes, and also how any emergency or rescue operations are able to \nrespond.\n  Success also depends on the need to improve the collection, analysis \nand dissemination of intelligence on homeland security. To do this \nright, we must not side-step possible failures within the intelligence \ncommunity that occurred before the attacks of September 11.\n  Understanding past problems is key to future successes. We cannot \nafford to make the same mistakes twice, especially mistakes of such \nconsequence.\n  Earlier this year, FBI Agent Coleen Rowley's startling testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee was a real wake-up call.\n  Her accounts of the many layers of bureaucracy at the FBI, and the \nmany frustrations faced in reaching superiors to authorize \ninvestigations, point to a critical need to revamp the existing \nstructure of key agencies outside the Homeland Security Department--a \ntask as complicated as it is sensitive.\n  It has been suggested that this new Department of Homeland Security \nis destined to failure if it cannot gain access to all relevant raw \nintelligence and law enforcement data.\n  I for one agree with such a scenario. We can't be fixing major kinks \nin the system a few years down the road, in the wake of another \nintelligence failure and another nightmarish attack. We've got to get \nit right, as best as possible, the first time around.\n  This will require answers to some tough questions.\n  For starters: What kind of intelligence would the new department get? \nAnd what recourse will it have if it does not get the information it \nneeds?\n  Both of these have yet to be adequately answered.\n  I want to emphasize a point that many commentators have overlooked: \nbillions of taxpayer dollars are at stake in this debate over homeland \nsecurity.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have studied what we \nspend on combating terrorism and will spend in the near future--are the \nnumbers are staggering. We must ensure\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\nthat this money is spent properly and not wasted.\n  According to the preliminary results of a General Accounting Office \ninvestigation of the terrorism budget requested by me, Senators Kyl, \nGraham, and Shelby, Congressmen Sensenbrenner and Conyers, the \ncombating terrorism budget increased 276 percent in just 1 year--and is \ngoing to increase even more. Consider the following figures: a $40 \nbillion supplemental appropriation bill was passed shortly after \nSeptember 11 last year; the August 2002 emergency supplemental amounts \nto $29 billion; and the fiscal year 2003 budget request is $45 billion.\n  The GAO also found that counterterrorism missions are spread over \nmultiple agencies and appropriations, but no real cross-agency \nterrorism budget exists. Neither the President nor Congress has a clear \nidea of how much we are spending to fight terrorism.\n  The GAO recommends that extensive interagency coordination and \noversight is needed not just to determine how much we are spending to \nfight terrorism but to figure out where our priorities are.\n  In addition, the GAO found a number of areas of potential overlap--\nareas where money seems to be wasted through duplication of efforts.\n  These areas cut across every agency and include law enforcement, \ngrant programs for State and local government, weapons of mass \ndestruction training, critical infrastructure protection, research and \ndevelopment to combat terrorism, and terrorist-related medical \nresearch.\n  The creation of a new Homeland Security Department alone will do \nnothing to solve these problems. Simply moving agencies into a new \norganization is insufficient to minimize duplication and waste.\n  We need to be sure that the President, his Homeland Security Adviser, \nand the Secretary of the new department work with Congress to assist \nagencies in consolidating terrorism programs, eliminating duplicate \nefforts, and coordinating complimentary agency functions.\n  The issue of how best to ensure oversight over funds to combat \nterrorism does not stand in the way of our getting this legislation \npassed. The same cannot be said for the labor provisions.\n  As we know, these provisions remain the major barrier between the \nWhite House and Congress.\n  I do not see any inherent clash between collective bargaining rights \nfor Federal employees and homeland security.\n  And I support civil service protections at the new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I support management flexibility, and I think that the Lieberman bill \nprovides it. Under the bill, the new Secretary will have broad powers \nto hire and fire whom he wants.\n  The bill also includes a number of new flexibilities in recruitment, \nhiring, training, and retirement.\n  The Lieberman bill gives the administration flexibility in these \nareas. While the collective bargaining rights of federal employees in \nthe new department will be grandfathered in, the President will be free \nto strip them of their collective bargaining rights if the job of those \nemployees changes.\n\n  To me, I could not imagine a more ill-timed attack on the Federal \nemployee unions. After all, Department of Defense civilians with top \nsecret clearances have long been union members and their membership has \nnot compromised national security.\n  And many of the heroes of September 11 were unionized. The New York \nCity firefighters who ran up the stairs to their deaths did not see any \nconflict between worker rights and emergency response.\n  At a time of such massive restructuring of the Federal Government, we \nmust maintain as much continuity as possible. By weakening workers' \nbenefits, the government risks losing many highly qualified individuals \nto the private sector. There is also a large percentage of workers who, \nif push comes to shove, can option for early retirement.\n  This is no time for the Federal Government to suffer a so-called \n``brain drain,'' and be forced to train individuals from scratch.\n  The last thing we want to do in the middle of our war on terrorism is \nlose experienced employees on the front lines of this war--employees at \nthe Coast Guard, the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, the Border Patrol, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, and other agencies that work around the clock to \nprevent another attack.\n  In closing, I would like to emphasize my belief that, in this age of \nuncertainty, in these uneasy times, the United States deserves a \nunified, streamlined, and accountable Department of Homeland Security.\n  Equally important, is the need to guarantee that our efforts to \ncombat terrorism, much of which will come under the jurisdiction of \nthis new department, remain consistent to our democratic values and our \ncommitment to an open and free society.\n  We must protect legal immigrants and innocent children, who have no \npart in this war. We have always been a nation of immigrants--and to \nchange this fundamental truth would undermine one of the pillars of our \nsociety.\n  If we fail on either of these fronts, the forces of terror would \ntriumph without another attack.\n  I believe that the Lieberman substitute amendment accomplishes this \nin a thorough and just way. A Department of Homeland Security under its \nguidelines will go a long way in making us more secure from terrorist \nattacks.\n  I stand in support the Lieberman bill. And I remain confident that \nthe executive and legislative branches will be able to work out any \nexisting differences.\n  We must be patient and thorough, and we must get this done right. \nPresent and future generations depend on us.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Senator Thompson asked me to yield him up to a minute, \nand then I ask that Senator Akaka, a member of our committee, be \nallowed to close the debate with the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is exactly right. I go back to what I said \nwhen I made my opening statement a few minutes ago. The bottom line is, \nthe important issues of national security authority for the President, \nmanagement authority for the new Secretary, what kind of intelligence \ncomponent we are going to have in this bill, what kind of \nreorganization authority we are going to give the President--all that \nwould be wiped out if this passed. None of that is going to be germane.\n  Take the management part, for example. To be germane, it would have \nto be narrowing. If we struck the management structure from the current \nbill, that perhaps would be germane, but we don't do that. We suggest a \ndifferent kind of management structure. I don't see how in the world \nthat could be considered germane.\n  What it would do would be to take that whole debate of management \nflexibility----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And do away with it. I respectfully suggest that is not \na good idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the current \nflexibilities available to agencies in the Federal Government and urge \nmy colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill. The President has \ncalled for flexibility to manage the workforce. I agree and have said \nrepeatedly that we must have the right people with the right skills in \nthe right places. I have long been a proponent of providing agencies \nwith tools they need to better manage their workforce. I agree with the \nPresident that agencies need flexibilities to carry out agency \nmissions. However, according to David Walker, Comptroller General of \nthe United States, agencies currently have many of the flexibilities \nthey need. Current law allows managers to remove a Federal employee \nfrom his post and suspend him immediately without pay if the head of \nthe agency finds that action necessary in the interests of national \nsecurity, 5 USC 7532;\n  Swiftly reassign Federal employees to fight terrorism and reassign \nFederal\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\nemployees to similarly graded positions or detail them from other \nagencies or within the Department and the employees who refuse \nreassignments or details may be terminated, 5 CFR part 335;\n  Retrain, reassign and reshape their workforce;\n  Choose whether to fill a vacant position from the outside or the \ninside, eliminate positions due to changes in programs, lack of \nfunding, reduction in workload, reorganizations, privatization, \n``divestiture,,'' or contracting out; establish personnel ceilings, or \ndecide to re-employ a returning worker; determine the job or jobs to be \neliminated in the context of a reduction in force, and unilaterally \nreassign employees to vacant positions in the agency;\n  Have additional management rights including: promotions; adverse \nactions, suspensions for 14 days or less; suspension for more than 14 \ndays; removals; demotions, reductions in grade or pay; permit the \nreturn of a career appointee from the Senior Executive Service, SES to \nthe GS or another pay system; the power to reassign, transfer, and \ndetail or fire of a career SES employee; determine the substance of a \nposition description, its performance standards of an employee's \nposition, and award, or not award, performance payments;\n  Decide whether employees have earned pay increases known as ``step'' \nincreases, based upon performance, and are able to grant employees \nadditional financial ``incentive awards'' such as performance-based \ncash awards, special act or service awards, and quality step increases; \nand\n  Decide whether to award recruitment, retention, and relocation \nbonuses worth up to 25% of base salary.\n  In addition, the Lieberman substitute provides additional \nflexibilities Governmentwide. The Voinovich-Akaka amendment, which was \nincluded in the Lieberman substitute unanimously by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, allows agencies to hire candidates directly and \nbypass the current requirements under Title 5 once OPM has determined \nthat there is a severe shortage of candidates for the position.\n  This provision allows agencies to streamline its staffing procedures \nby authorizing use of an alternative method for selecting new employees \ninstead of the traditional rule of three. This will make the Government \nmore competitive with the private sector by improving the Federal \nhiring process. Under the new system, the agency may divide applicants \ninto two or more quality categories based on merit and select any \ncandidate from the highest category while maintaining veterans hiring \npreference.\n  The amendment provides Governmentwide authority for Voluntary \nSeparation Incentive Payments and Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, \ntwo provisions currently in place in limited situations. The expansion \nof this authority would give agencies the flexibility required to \nreorganize the workforce should an agency need to undergo substantial \ndelayering, transfer of functions, or other substantial workforce \nreshaping. The provision would allow agencies to reduce high-grade, \nmanagerial, or supervisory positions, correct skill imbalances, and \nreduce operating costs without the loss of full time positions.\n  To address the impending human capital crisis, the government will \nneed to retain Federal employees with institutional knowledge. To \nassist in this effort, the amendment increases the cap on the total \nannual compensation of senior executive, administrative law judges, \nofficers of the court, and other senior level positions to allow career \nexecutives to receive performance awards and other authorized payments.\n  The Akaka-Voinovich amendments also helps ensure that we have a \nworld-class Federal workforce and can retain talented Federal employees \nwho wish to continue their education. This provision reduces \nrestrictions on providing academic degree training to Federal employees \nand requires agencies to facilitate online academic degree training.\n  As a result of the current flexibilities and those provided in the \nLieberman substitute, it is curious why the President continues to \ndemand additional flexibilities. As I have previously stated, studies \nindicate that the flexibilities at the Federal Aviation Administration \nand the Internal Revenue Service have not provided the intended results \nand employee morale is very low. With such uncertainty in additional \nflexibilities and the great importance of this new agency, I question \nthe need for such a broad grant of power. I believe the existing \nflexibilities and the Voinovich-Akaka provisions provide agencies the \ntools that they need to manage effectively their workforce. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Lieberman substitute and vote for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Lieberman \n     substitute amendment No. 4471 for H.R. 5005, Homeland \n     Security legislation.\n         Jean Carnahan, Herb Kohl, Jack Reed (RI), Richard J. \n           Durbin, Kent Conrad, Paul Wellstone, Jim Jeffords, Max \n           Baucus, Tom Harkin, Harry Reid (NV), Patrick Leahy, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, Byron L.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \ngracious intervention on my behalf. We\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\nare debating today homeland security. We are also engaged in another \nsignificant debate about international security in the context of Iraq \nand the war on terror. But as Senator Daschle reminded us, we also have \nto be concerned about economic security in the United States.\n  Frankly, the economic numbers we have been seeing lately do not give \nmuch confidence to the American people that their economic security is \nbeing protected. As the vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, \nI have the opportunity to review, along with the staff, the reports \nthat are coming in about our economy. It is clear that GDP is growing, \nbut too slowly to make much of a dent in the unemployment rate. People \nwho have lost their jobs face a much more difficult job market, and \nmany are beginning to exhaust their unemployment benefits.\n  Everyone is facing increased premiums for health care. Employers are \ncutting back their contributions to health programs. They are being \nstressed in terms of adequately funding pension programs. These are the \nreal concerns of Americans today all across this country.\n  When we look at the numbers, when we look at the reports, the \nconclusion is, obviously, we are still in an economic slump. Indicative \nof this are the figures I have on this chart. This is the record of job \ngrowth, but it is not growth at all, it is job loss during the Bush \nadministration. In January 2001, there were 112 million jobs, today, \nAugust 2002, 110 million jobs--a loss of over 2 million jobs that have \nnot yet been replaced in this economy.\n  The unemployment rate in August was 5.7 percent. That is one and a \nhalf percentage points higher than it was when President Bush took \noffice. The number of unemployed Americans was more than 2 million \nhigher in August than it was when President Bush took office, as \nindicated by this chart.\n  There is also another telling statistic that is within these \nunemployment numbers. The number of long-term unemployed Americans--\nthose who have been unemployed more than 26 weeks--has increased \nsignificantly. This chart reflects that increase. In January of 2001, \n648,000 Americans had been unemployed more than 26 weeks; in August \n2002, 1,474,000 Americans were unemployed more than 26 weeks--a \nsignificant jump. It is significant not just in terms of numbers but in \nterms of something else: Americans exhaust their basic unemployment \nbenefits after 26 weeks. Unless we have an extended benefit program in \nplace, after 26 weeks American workers have no support as they look for \njobs, as they try to support their families, as they try to make ends \nmeet. This problem is not going away.\n  Although as part of the stimulus package we have passed extended \nbenefits, they are scheduled to expire at the end of this year, so we \nhave a real obligation in these remaining days to protect a basic tenet \nof economic security in this country, and that is to provide extended \nunemployment benefits.\n  The 1,474,000 will increase, and these individuals will not have the \nsupport they need to provide for their families. The little bit of \ngrowth we have seen so far is not going to head off a jobless recovery.\n  It should be noted that when President George Herbert Walker Bush was \nPresident and we were in a recessionary period in 1991, the \nunemployment rate rose another full percentage point in the 15 months \nafter the GDP started to grow again. So we can likely see increased \nunemployment.\n  There are forecasters who have suggested our economic growth will be \nabout 2.8 percent for the rest of the year--that is the Blue Chip \nconsensus forecast--but the economy has to grow at more than 3 percent \nto generate the kind of new jobs that will reverse this unemployment \nsituation. No consensus forecaster fully expects that type of growth \ngoing forth. As a result, most economists suggest and predict that \nunemployment rates will rise to 6 percent. Again, this is a real \nchallenge to the safety and security of the American family, just as \nreal as the threats we are debating in terms of homeland security and \ninternational security.\n  The conclusion, as one looks at these numbers and the economic \nperformance from the time the President took over, is that President \nBush's economy looks a lot like his father's economy. It is in \nrecession, unemployment is growing, it will continue to grow, and yet \nthere has not been an adequate response to this problem by the White \nHouse. He seems to have one proposal with respect to every economic \nquestion, and that is cutting the taxes of the wealthiest Americans.\n  As this chart indicates, this is the effect of the proposed tax cuts \nof President Bush, tax cuts that were enacted last year. At year 10, \nwhen they are fully realized, the average benefits, based on income \nlevel, will be as portrayed in this chart. The lowest 20th percentile \nof Americans will receive about $66 a year in benefits. It goes up to \nabout $375 for individuals making around $20,000, $600 for those making \nabout $39,000 a year. The real gain, the real benefit, goes to the very \nwealthiest Americans--$55,000 roughly, on average, for the top 1 \npercent. That is their annual savings for the tax benefits generated by \nthe Bush tax proposal. This is not fair, and it is not smart. Unless we \nget all Americans participating fully in our economy, having the \ndisposable income to go to the store to keep consumption up, to keep \ndemand up, we are not going to have an economy that works for any \nAmerican. Indeed, this is a glaring example of what some criticized \nDemocrats for--class warfare. What is more unfair, inequitable, and \nslanted toward a class than this tax cut which favors the wealthiest \nAmericans?\n\n  In addition to these tax numbers, we have to understand that these \ntax cuts have put enormous pressure on other programs that are decisive \nfor every American, but particularly important for low-income \nAmericans: Medicaid Programs, Medicare Programs, a host of other \nprograms that need Federal support. That support has been strained \ndramatically because of the pressure of the tax cut.\n  We are at a point now where we have to act. We have to act in the \nvery short run to restore extended unemployment benefits for the \ngrowing number of long-term unemployed Americans. We have to act, also, \nto resist the temptation to make all of these tax benefits permanent. \nHowever unfair this situation is, it will be compounded, and it will be \ncompounded dramatically, if we make the tax cuts of the last year \npermanent.\n  We have to go ahead and focus on those issues that are critical to \nthe welfare of the American family today, for their economic security \ntoday. We have to be concerned about pensions, their strength. We have \nto protect, I believe, Social Security, which is the bedrock of \nAmerica.\n  I wonder how many employees of Enron and WorldCom and other companies \n2 years ago would have considered their Social Security as just a \ntrivial benefit compared to their expanded and ever-growing 401(k) \nplans. Today, I suspect, they see their Social Security benefit, their \ndefined benefit, as a lifeline, allowing them to make ends meet, or at \nleast giving them a little extra to get through.\n  We have to be strong in terms of protecting the bedrock program, \nSocial Security. We have to be concerned about rising health care \npremiums and prescriptions drug costs. None of these problems can be \naddressed unless we provide the leadership, the resources, and the \nattention the American people demand.\n  Let me conclude by saying, again, there is at least one thing we must \ndo in the next several weeks: Extend long-term unemployment benefits. \nUnemployment, long term, is growing. It will continue to grow for many \nmonths. American workers deserve the opportunity for some support as \nthey look for new jobs. They deserve the opportunity to help their \nfamilies as they get through a very difficult period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8890-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8890-S8891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in the past 24 hours the world awakened \nagain to another tragic incident causing great damage, death, harm, and \ndestruction to the people of Israel. There are now news reports that, \nunderstandably, the Israelis are positioning their forces such that \nthey, first and foremost, have to defend their sovereignty and the \npeople of their nation, but that could again result in injury and death \nto others.\n  Regrettably, this has gone on for a very long time. Speaking for this \none Senator, I feel it as an obligation on me, and I share that \nobligation with my colleagues, to address this subject and to put forth \nour own ideas as best we can fashion them. I am about to do that again. \nFor the fourth time I have taken this floor and spoken about a concept \nI have had. I once again share it with my colleagues in hopes, if they \nhave a better idea, if this administration has a better idea, then put \nit forward.\n  My thoughts were expressed on the floor on May 2 of this year in the \nCongressional Record, page 3812; June 21, Congressional Record, page \n5891; July 24, Congressional Record, page 7299.\n  On August 2, roughly 6 weeks ago, I wrote the President of the United \nStates. Copies were sent to his principal Cabinet officials having \nresponsibilities in these areas. I am going to read that letter because \nit embraces my thoughts. Even though it was 6 weeks ago, I still \nsteadfastly believe this is one approach to this tragic situation that \ndeserves consideration.\n  I fully understand our President and his Cabinet are heavily engaged \nwith regard to critical considerations on Iraq and the United Nations. \nBut I believe there is a connection between the ongoing crisis and the \nunsettled situation and the death and destruction in this tragic \nconflict between Israel and the Palestinian people.\n  Six weeks ago I wrote to the President. This is the first time, of \ncourse, I have made public this letter. I respect the President of the \nUnited States of whichever party. In these 24 years I have been \nprivileged to be in the U.S. Senate, I have written on occasion, as \neach of us do, to our Presidents. But I try not to write the letter and \nwithin the same day or days release it. So this is the first time I \nhave released this letter. It was 6 weeks ago, August 2 of this year:\n\n       Dear Mr. President, the Nation recently celebrated our \n     traditional 4th of July holiday--normally a time of joyful \n     reflection about our history and patriotism. Thankfully, it \n     was a peaceful day for America, but we entered that holiday \n     period confronted with yet more warnings off possible \n     terrorist attack. It is, indeed, prudent that our citizens be \n     warned of such threats, even when specifics are lacking. \n     However, if these warnings continue indefinitely, our people \n     will begin to wonder what is the root cause of this hatred \n     toward America and what is our government doing about it.\n       For the first time in the over 200 year history of our \n     Republic we, under your leadership, are establishing a \n     Department of Homeland Security and designating a new \n     military command, U.S. Northern Command, to protect the fifty \n     states. We've taken bold steps at home; others must join us \n     in taking bold steps abroad.\n       As we all know, the scourge of terrorism in our 21st \n     Century world is a complex, multi-faceted problem. There is \n     not a single cause, but many, including: disparate economic \n     development around the world; lack of political and economic \n     opportunity in many regions; the alarming spread of radical, \n     fundamentalist religious dogma's--especially Islam--amongst \n     those feeling disenfranchised from the mainstream; and, the \n     parallel rise in ethnic conflict after decades of oppression \n     by Communist and other tyrannical regimes.\n       In this environment of perceived hopelessness and despair \n     for many of the world's youth, certain seemingly unsolvable \n     events continue to fan the flames of anger and hatred that \n     lead to irrational acts. This is manifested in the individual \n     acts of terror we witness almost daily on the streets of \n     Israel and in the recruitment of angry young men and women \n     into radical terror organizations that encourage them to vent \n     their anger in the most destructive, often suicidal, of ways.\n       Finding solutions for the conditions that have bred this \n     hate and total disregard for peaceful solutions will be \n     complex, but it must be systematically addressed. Clearly, \n     you and key members of your Administration have shown, and \n     continue to show leadership in this area.\n       But, we must ask the question, can more be done by others?\n       The prolonged Israeli-Palestinian conflict contributes, in \n     part, to the unrest and anger in the Arab world. How much it \n     contributes cannot be quantified, but it is a significant and \n     growing factor. This conflict, often presented in a distorted \n     and biased manner to citizens of Arab nations, must be \n     confronted, if we are ever to meaningfully address the \n     disaffection and dissatisfaction felt by the people of this \n     region.\n       Each act of violence by either side in this unending \n     conflict further erodes hope for a peaceful future for the \n     people of Israel, the people of Palestine and others \n     throughout the Middle East. In fact, each act of senseless \n     violence in the Middle East further erodes hope that someday \n     we can feel secure from terrorism here at home. All \n     reasonable options to bring about an end to this violence and \n     indiscriminate loss of life must be considered. We can never \n     abandon hope. We must act in a way to renew hope in this land \n     of faith, and we must continue to consider all options.\n       May I respectfully submit the following concept for your \n     consideration concerning the use of NATO peacekeepers. My \n     recommendation would be for you to request that the North \n     Atlantic Council (NAC) formally consider a proposal to use \n     NATO forces as peacekeepers. If the concept is acceptable to \n     the NAC they could commence to draw up a plan for \n     peacekeeping. Once consensus had been achieved within the \n     NAC, the NAC would so advise the Government of Israel and the \n     Palestinian Authority, making it clear NATO would assist, \n     only if the two sides establish a genuine cease fire, and \n     both sides accept NATO's plan. Further, both sides must \n     commit to cooperate in preventing further hostilities until \n     negotiations have been successful to the point that NATO \n     forces could be withdrawn and a substitute security plan has \n     been put in place. Obviously, these steps are and will be \n     very challenging, but they are achievable, especially in \n     light of the bold, balanced vision you have articulated for a \n     resolution of this conflict.\n       The basic thoughts in this letter have been stated by me \n     previously in speeches on the floor of the Senate, and in my \n     remarks to a recent gathering of NATO ambassadors on Capitol \n     Hill, and in open hearings of the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee with the Secretary of Defense present. Time is of \n     the essence. I am concerned that recent events in the region, \n     including the unfortunate Israeli attack that killed women \n     and children as Israeli forces pursued Palestinian terrorists \n     and the subsequent terrorist attack on Hebrew University, \n     will further delay meaningful progress toward peace.\n       I strongly encourage you to explore this option with our \n     NATO allies, and determine if they are willing to consider \n     such a proposal. The time for discussion and consensus \n     building is now. When the conditions for a cease fire and \n     negotiations are right, we must be able to act quickly and \n     decisively with a credible peacekeeping force.\n       I believe a NATO force would be credible for the reason \n     that Europe is perceived as being more sympathetic to \n     Palestinian views and the U.S. as more sympathetic to Israeli \n     views. NATO can bond these viewpoints to act as one with \n     peace as its unifying goal, and dispel these perceived \n     biases. NATO troops are trained and ``ready to roll'' on \n     short notice. NATO is an established coalition of nations \n     with a proven record of successful peacekeeping in the \n     Balkans. Clearly, there are risks, but NATO peacekeepers \n     can--with the cooperation of Israel and the Palestinian \n     people--bring stability to this troubled region; stability \n     that will allow for meaningful negotiations that have a \n     chance to end the violence.\n       This is not a conclusion that I have reached lightly. Some \n     of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as noted journalists \n     and others, have discussed with me the broad issues \n     associated with this proposal. Mine has been one of the many \n     voices calling for well-defined principles and restraint in \n     the employment of U.S. forces around the world. I fully \n     recognize the risks to U.S. forces and our alliance partners. \n     I strongly feel this is one of those unique circumstances \n     that demand every resource and idea we can bring\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\n     to bear. If the opportunity arises, we must be prepared to \n     give peace and hope a chance.\n       I respectfully submit these thoughts as you forge ahead and \n     lead the world's efforts to find a path to peace for this \n     important region of our global community, and in so doing, \n     enhance the security of our people here at home. It is my \n     fervent hope that by the time we pause to celebrate our \n     nation's next birthday, the fledgling ideas we are \n     collectively considering today will have blossomed into \n     substantial progress toward freedom from the senseless \n     violence we are witnessing today.\n       With kind regards, I am respectfully.--John Warner.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2002]\n\n                         Never Mind, Mr. Sharon\n\n       Most of three months has passed since President Bush laid \n     out his vision for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict, and still there has been next to no follow-up by \n     his administration. No. Cabinet-level officials have visited \n     the region since the president's speech; despite pleas from \n     the Arab leaders Mr. Bush asked for support, no details have \n     been offered on how to move from the present situation to Mr. \n     Bush's vision of side-by-side Israeli and Palestinian states. \n     On the contrary: Despite Mr. Bush's announcement of an \n     international effort to reconstruct Palestinian security \n     forces, the CIA has taken only token steps to train new \n     officers; despite the president's clarion call for \n     Palestinian democracy, the administration has quietly joined \n     Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in opposing the holding \n     of Palestinian national elections anytime in the near future. \n     In effect, what the president cast on June 24 as a major \n     initiative for Middle East peace has all but vanished; in its \n     place is a suddenly all-consuming campaign against Iraq that \n     could soon lead to a new Middle East war. Vice President \n     Cheney, among others, is arguing that overturning the regime \n     of Saddam Hussein will make an Israeli-Palestinian settlement \n     easier, but even if that is true, what is not clear is how a \n     conflict that has cost more than 2,000 lives in the past two \n     years, and is a primary source of Muslim grievance against \n     the United States, can be contained between now and then.\n       In the now familiar absence of Bush administration \n     engagement, halting progress has been made by the parties on \n     the ground. There have been no major Palestinian suicide \n     attacks against Israelis in six weeks, despite several \n     attempts; both the Israeli army and the Palestinian \n     administration claim credit, and both probably had something \n     to do with it. Attempts by Palestinian political and military \n     leaders to change the direction of their self-destructive \n     uprising against Israel, and to force Palestinian leader \n     Yasser Arafat to yield most of his power, continue in spite \n     of Mr. Arafat's strong resistance; this week the legislative \n     body of the Palestinian Authority delivered an unprecedented \n     rebuff, forcing the resignation of Mr. Arafat's cabinet. The \n     more moderate Labor Party ministers in Mr. Sharon's cabinet \n     have been trying to negotiate incremental security agreements \n     with the Palestinians, and there are signs of revival in the \n     long-moribund Israeli peace camp.\n       But Israeli troops occupy six major West Bank towns and \n     significant parts of the Gaza Strip, imposing curfews and \n     other restrictions on movement that aid agencies say are \n     breeding a mounting humanitarian crisis.

Madam President, appropriately, there has been a great \ndeal of discussion over the past week about the fiscal status of the \ncountry, the condition of our budget, and our national economy. I would \nlike to take a few minutes to respond to some of the false claims that \nhave been made by the Bush administration and by some Members of the \nSenate over the last 10 days.\n  First, I would like to respond to some of the remarks made by the \nPresident when he was at a fundraiser in Iowa on Monday. The President \nsaid the following there. He said:\n\n       [W]e have a budget that focuses on setting priorities and \n     focuses on getting us back to a balanced budget. But there \n     has been no budget out of the United States Senate. They \n     haven't passed a budget. They have no plan to balance the \n     budget. . . . It's of concern, because if you have no budget, \n     it means there's no discipline. And if there's no discipline, \n     it's likely that the Senate will overspend.\n\n  If there was ever a case of someone accusing another of their own \nshortcomings, this is it. My grandmother once told me: Sometimes what \npeople say about others reveals more about themselves than it does of \nthose who they seek to characterize.\n  This is that circumstance. These comments by the President, I find \ndeeply disturbing. It is unfortunate that the President continues to \ndeny any responsibility for the Nation's dive back into deficits and \nfor increasing debt.\n  Instead, he desperately tries to blame others for the deficits that \nhis own policies have created.\n\n  Let's look at the President's first claim, that he and the House \nRepublicans have a plan that ``focuses on getting us back to a balanced \nbudget.'' No, they do not. That is not true. The President must know it \nis not true. They have no plan that gets us back into balance. In fact, \nthe plan they have drives us deep into the deficit swamp. That is the \ntruth.\n  You will recall 1 year ago, the President told us, with great \nconfidence, that we could expect $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the \nnext decade. We warned, at the time, that that was a risky gamble, that \none could not count on a 10-year forecast, that there was enormous risk \nassociated with it.\n  The President insisted not only that there was going to be $5.6 \ntrillion of surpluses over the next decade, but he and his \nadministration told us privately that there is probably going to be \nmuch more money than that.\n  We said: No, we think it is highly unlikely that we will see that \nlevel of surplus.\n  And just 1 year later, what we find is, if the President's spending \nand tax policies over the next decade are adopted, instead of $5.6 \ntrillion of surpluses, we will see $400 billion of deficits. The \nPresident says it is the fault of the Democrats, that they are spending \nthe money.\n  Madam President, this will happen without a dime of spending by \nDemocrats. These numbers only include the President's own proposals for \nspending and additional tax cuts. They lead us from a circumstance of \nlast year being told we had nearly $6 trillion of surpluses to one in \nwhich we now see $400 billion of deficits, if his policies are adopted.\n  In many ways, this is the best case scenario because it does not take \ninto account that the President will be using trillions of dollars of \nSocial Security money on top of this.\n  This chart shows--I will put it in the Record; I know it is too small \nto read from afar--but one can see the red. The red are the deficits. \nIf you don't count Social Security money, if you don't take Social \nSecurity money, as the President proposes, and use it for other things, \nwe see red ink throughout the entire rest of the decade. In fact, over \n$2.7 trillion of money is being taken from Social Security to pay for \nother things under the President's budget plan. That is a recipe for \nfiscal disaster. And it is the President's plan, make no mistake about \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent the chart I just referred to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\n\n\n                                        CHANGES IN BASELINE SURPLUS AND DEFICIT TOTALS, JANUARY 2001-AUGUST 2002\n                                                                [In billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011     2002-11\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal CBO surplus--January 2001        313        359        397        433        505        573        635        710        796        889      5,610\nTotal CBO surplus/deficit--              5          6         61        111        135        175        213        263        309        454      1,733\n March 2002....................\nTotal CBO surplus/deficit--           -157       -145       -111        -39         15         52         88        133        177        323        336\n August 2002 \\1\\...............\nTotal CBO surplus/deficit with        -157       -159       -138        -76        -44        -23         -2         36         70        108       -386\n President's proposed budget\n policies......................\nWithout Social Security........       -315       -329       -326       -282       -268       -265       -264       -245       -230       -211     -2,734\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The CBO baseline projection assumes no change in current policies governing taxes or entitlement spending and that discretionary appropriations in\n  FY 2003 through FY 2011 will equal the level enacted for FY 2002 (including FY 2002 supplemental appropriations), adjusted for inflation.\n \nSource: CBO estimates of January 2001, March 2002, and August 2002 baselines. SBC estimates of President's budget based on CBO baseline estimates and\n  the President's proposed policies.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The President, again, says the problem is spending. Let's \nlook at what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tells us is \nthe reason for this disappearance of the surplus. Nearly $6 trillion of \nprojected surplus from last year, gone. There is nothing left. If we \nadopt the President's budget and spending plan, there are no surpluses, \nonly deficits, some $400 billion. And that is the good news because \nthat assumes that the President takes every penny of Social Security \nsurplus over the next decade. So the real deficits are much worse than \nthe $400 billion that I have shown under the President's plan. The true \ndeficits, not counting Social Security, not taking Social Security \nmoney to use it for other purposes, is not $400 billion; it is $2.7 \ntrillion.\n  Where did all the money go? Here is what the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us.\n  Thirty-four percent of the disappearance of the surplus went to the \ntax cuts the President pushed through Congress that were passed last \nyear, and that he signed into law.\n  Twenty-nine percent is from overestimations of revenue by his \nadministration; that is, outside of the tax cuts. So revenue is down 63 \npercent, not counting lost revenue from the economic downturn; it \naccounts for 63 percent of the disappearance of the projected \nsurpluses. Twenty-two percent of the disappearance is because of \nspending, spending on national defense and homeland security. That is \nwhere the increases have been. The President supported every penny of \nthose increases in spending. That is where the money has gone. In \naddition, 15 percent of the disappearance of the surplus is the result \nof the economic downturn. That is where the money has gone.\n  For the President to assert it is Democrats who have been \noverspending is not supported by the facts. The facts are, the \noverwhelming reason for the disappearance of the surplus is the tax \ncuts the President proposed and pushed through Congress. The second \nbiggest reason for the disappearance of the surplus is his \nadministration's overestimates of revenue apart from the tax cuts. The \nthird biggest reason is spending on defense and homeland security, \nevery penny of which the President supported. And the smallest reason \nfor the disappearance of the surplus is the economic downturn.\n  The President, regrettably, is pointing fingers at everyone else but \nrefusing to acknowledge his own responsibility for this dramatic turn \nin the fiscal condition of the country. The President says: It is the \nattack on the country and the economic slowdown.\n  Those are two reasons, but, in fact, they are the smallest reasons \nfor the disappearance of the surplus. The biggest reasons are the tax \ncut he pushed and his overestimations of revenue. Those are his \nresponsibilities and his failures.\n  Remarkably, the President's answer to all of this is to advocate more \ntax cuts. Let's dig the hole deeper. We already see an ocean of red ink \nover the next decade. We see under the President's plan the taking of \nover $2 trillion from Social Security to pay for his tax cuts and other \nthings. And the President's answer is: Let's have more tax cuts, $400 \nbillion more in this decade for making the tax cuts passed last year \npermanent, and a cost in the next decade of $4 trillion.\n  I hope people are listening. I hope people are thinking about the \nimplications of this. We already face an ocean of red ink. And what the \nPresident is proposing is, let's get it bigger; let's have more red \nink.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, if we adopt the President's proposal, \nthis country will be digging a hole so deep that we will face \nenormously difficult choices in the future: massive cuts in benefits, \nmassive tax increases, huge debt, unsustainable, all of them. But that \nis the direction the President has us headed in fiscal policy.\n  I know people are distracted and thinking about war with Iraq and \nthinking about a war against terrorism. And those command our \nattention. But we must also pay attention to the fundamental financial \nstrength of America. The President has us on a disastrous fiscal \ncourse, with deficits all the rest of this decade, the President is \nproposing making them much deeper in the next decade, right at the time \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  We must understand, we are in the sweet spot of the fiscal future of \nAmerica. Right now the trust funds of Social Security and Medicare are \nthrowing off huge surpluses. Yet under the President's plan, all that \nmoney, every dime of it over the next decade, is being taken and used \nfor other purposes, used to fund the tax cuts, to pay for other \npriorities.\n\n  What is going to happen when these baby boomers retire and they are \neligible for Social Security and Medicare? This is not a matter of \nprojections. The baby boomers have been born. They are alive today. \nThey will retire, and they will be eligible for Social Security and \nMedicare. But they are going to find the cupboard is bare because the \nPresident has advocated and pushed through Congress a policy that uses \nall of the money.\n  Let's now consider the President's second claim that the Senate has \nno budget plan. We reported out of the Senate Budget Committee back in \nMarch a 10-year plan that would have made available to the President \nall of the resources requested by him for defense and homeland \nsecurity, but still we paid down as much as $500 billion more in debt \nthan the President's budget. To say we have no plan is simply wrong. We \nhave a plan, a very clear plan, a very detailed plan that also \ncontained a circuitbreaker to put the Nation back on a path to balance \nwithout raiding the Social Security trust funds and to do it within 5 \nyears.\n  I would like to do it this year but that is no longer possible. But \nit is critical we adopt a plan that does return fiscal responsibility. \nWe have presented that plan. It has passed the Budget Committee. Sadly, \nour counterparts in the House, instead of adopting a 10-year budget \nplan, as is traditional, as the President proposed, that could have \nbeen sent to a conference with the Senate, the House of Representatives \npassed only a 5-year plan. Why? Because they wanted to hide the \nenormous cost in the second 5 years of the President's plan to make the \ntax cuts permanent and to add even more tax cuts.\n  Further, the House used overly optimistic OMB numbers instead of the \nCongressional Budget Office projections of costs and revenues; again, \nmisleading the American public as to our true financial condition.\n  The House set spending for such priorities as education and law \nenforcement and highway construction at levels so low that the House \nRepublican leadership can't even get their own Members to vote for the \nappropriations bills on the floor of the House of Representatives. They \nwant to wait until after the election because they know they dare not \ngo to the American people with proposals to do such things as the \nPresident proposed as cutting the highway program 27 percent or \nvirtually eliminating the COPS Program\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nthat has put 100,000 police officers on the street. How wise is it to \neliminate the COPS Program when we are subject to terrorist attacks?\n  These factors have made it virtually impossible for the House and \nSenate to ever reach agreement on a budget resolution this year.\n  In June, in the Senate, a group of us, on a bipartisan basis, offered \na budget agreement for the next year containing the key elements of \nwhat the Budget Committee proposed, including the setting of realistic \nspending limits and renewing expiring budget enforcement mechanisms so \nwe could maintain fiscal responsibility.\n  What did the Bush administration do? They engaged in a furious \nlobbying effort against it--against setting a realistic cap on \nspending, against extending the budget enforcement procedures to help \nmaintain fiscal discipline. It seems shocking now to hear the President \nsay he is worried about deficits because he and his administration \nblocked the efforts to protect us against those very events.\n  The fact is that we got 59 votes for that proposal on a bipartisan \nbasis. We needed a supermajority, which is 60. Even though we had 59, \nwe needed 60. So that spending cap wasn't put in place and we did not \nget the budget enforcement procedures extended.\n  The bottom line is that we set a realistic and appropriate spending \ncap. The administration is opposing it in a desperate attempt to look \nfiscally conservative given the massive deficits that have returned on \ntheir watch. Yesterday, one of my colleagues came to the floor and \ncomplained that spending is too high and it is the reason for the \nreturn to deficits.\n  The place where spending has increased is in defense and homeland \nsecurity, every penny of which the President asked for, every penny of \nwhich passed here with huge, bipartisan majorities. Those measures that \nare still pending will pass with huge bipartisan majorities.\n  While it is true that defense and homeland security spending has gone \nup, it is very important to put into context what has happened to \noverall Federal spending over the last 20 years. What one sees is \noverall Federal spending--going back to 1980, it was 22 percent of GDP. \nIn the previous Bush administration, it was close to 22 percent of \ngross domestic product. It has come down to 18.4 percent. Federal \nspending has been coming down as a share of our national income.\n  It is true we have now had a blip up. We have had that blip up \nbecause of the attack on America. Yes, we have increased defense \nspending; yes, we have increased homeland security spending--at the \nrequest of the President of the United States. He was right to do so. \nEven with that, we see--looking ahead--a decline in the share of \nnational income coming to the Federal Government.\n  Federal spending, while certainly a part of this calculation and a \ncontributor to the increased deficits because of the increases for \nnational defense and homeland security, is not the major reason for the \nreturn to deficits and the increasing debt. It is a reason, but it is a \nrelatively small reason.\n  The same can be said of discretionary spending, which is for all of \nthe things that are not mandatory. Mandatory spending is Social \nSecurity, Medicare, farm program--that is mandatory spending. \nDiscretionary spending is for things such as parks, roads, law \nenforcement, and defense. You can see that discretionary spending has \ncome down quite sharply since 1981.\n  Again, we see a blip up because of homeland security and national \ndefense. It is also quite remarkable to see members of this \nadministration complaining about the discretionary spending cap we \nproposed when they are coming out at the same time estimating that a \nwar against Iraq could cost literally hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Just this Monday, we saw the President's chief economic aide say the \ncost of the war with Iraq may top $100 billion. More than that, Mr. \nLindsey dismissed the economic consequences of such spending, saying, \n``It wouldn't have an appreciable effect on interest rates or add much \nto the Federal debt, which is already about $3.6 trillion.''\n  I am from North Dakota. In North Dakota, $100 billion is still real \nmoney. That is big money. The President's Chief Economic Adviser--maybe \nit is part of the reason we are in such financial straits as we are, \nbecause this man doesn't understand the significance of $100 billion. \nHe said it really makes no difference. On the other hand, they say $9 \nbillion more so that we don't cut the Federal highway program by 27 \npercent, so we don't eliminate the COPS program, so we don't cut \neducation--that $9 billion is a disaster, but $100 billion doesn't \nmatter. That is a policy that does not add up.\n  So where has the Bush fiscal policy left us? The fact is that the \nsurplus is gone. The Federal debt has come roaring back. You will \nremember that last year the President promised us he would have maximum \npaydown of the Federal debt. Now we see that that is not true either. \nThe debt held by the public in 2008, he told us last year, would be \nvirtually eliminated. Now we see, instead of having virtually no debt, \nwe are going to be stuck with $3.8 trillion of debt. That has serious \nconsequences for the country.\n  The President, who said he would have maximum paydown of the national \ndebt, came and asked for a maximum increase in the debt limit. In fact, \nthe only larger request for an increase in the debt limit came from his \nfather when he was President. He asked for a $915 billion increase in \nthe debt. This President asked for $750 billion. The consequences of \nthis enormously increased debt--increased from what we were told last \nyear--is that the interest costs to the Federal Government have \ntripled, from $620 billion, over the next 10 years, to $1.9 trillion. \nThese policies have real consequences, and real effects, and real \nimpacts on our national economy.\n  Last year, the President said maximum paydown of the debt. Now what \nwe see under his policy, instead of maximum paydown of debt, is that we \nwill have maximum taking of money from the Social Security trust fund \nto pay for other things. In fact, the remarkable reality of what we \nconfront is that the President, under his plan, will take every penny \nof the Social Security surplus over the next decade to pay for his tax \ncuts and other things. This is the time when we are on the brink of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  This is what we face in the longer term. Right now, the trust funds \nof Social Security and Medicare are throwing off large surpluses. But \nthat money is being taken under the President's plan to pay for other \nthings, including his tax cut. And we know that, starting in the year \n2016, these trust funds go from cash positive to cash negative, and \nthey do it in a very big way. We need to get ready for this reality. \nThat is why we proposed less of a tax cut, more money to paying down \ndebt, more money to secure the long-term solvency of Social Security. \nThe President rejected that plan in a reckless way and has put us on a \nfiscal course that means more deficits, more debt, more economic \ninsecurity, higher interest rates, lower economic growth, lower \nemployment.\n  It is critically important that there be a balance in what we do in \nWashington. It is not healthy to have only one side to a debate. That \nis what we have seen in the last week. It is time for our side to speak \nup, to stand up, and to fight back because much is at stake for our \nNation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for some time now, Senator Wyden and \nI have been working together to try to put forward a compromise \namendment on two amendments which are on the Interior appropriations \nbill. One amendment is by Senator Bingaman; the other by Senator Craig.\n  At present, both amendments need 60 votes. Neither amendment has 60 \nvotes. Both amendments deal with a very real emergency in American \nforests today. It would be a tragedy if we could not use this \nappropriations bill as an opportunity to move a plan forward to do\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nthe emergency work we need to do to protect our people, our property, \nour forests, and our endangered species from the risk of catastrophic \nfire.\n  Right now, 190 million acres of public lands are at high risk of \ncatastrophic fire. That is 190 million acres, and 73 million of these \nare in the highest fire risk category, called class III. Of that class \nIII, 23 million acres have been designated by both the Forest Service \nand the Department of Interior as in vital need of emergency treatment. \nThose are the strategic areas that need hazardous fuels taken out of \nthe forests to avoid catastrophic fire.\n  Today in America, moderate to severe drought covers 45 percent of the \nContinental United States. It is predicted that El Nino is returning, \nwhich means we can expect volatile weather patterns, more pronounced \nrainfall, more pronounced drought. All of this will only exacerbate the \nrisk of catastrophic fire.\n  It is estimated that this is the third hottest summer on record in \nthe United States. To this fact, we are adding that 2002 looks as if it \nis going to turn out to be the worst fire season on record in the \nUnited States.\n  This year, 6 million acres of land has burned. That includes nearly a \nhalf a million acres in California, and because we have an Indian \nsummer, we are not out of the forest fire season yet.\n  More property will be lost, more vital habitat for endangered species \nwill be destroyed, and more people will be in greater danger if we do \nnot do something. We have firefighters laying down their lives on these \nfire lines in some of the worst fires we have ever experienced.\n  Today, fires burn hotter, faster, and more intensely than ever, and \nthere is a reason for this. The reason is because of forest policy \nwhich is what has been called fire suppression. That means you go in \nand suppress the fires as soon as they begin. Of course, that takes a \nlot of money, and we have used over $1 billion just fighting these \nfires. It does not prevent a future fire from happening, but I believe \nfire suppression has to become the policy of the past rather than the \npolicy of the future because what is happening in our forests is that \nwe have an unprecedented buildup of materials on the ground, so-called \nbiomass, fuels in plants and bushes.\n  We have a lot of nonnative species now springing up where certain \nancient trees are fire resistant, such as the giant sequoias, for \nexample. If other trees grow up among them, they become fire ladders so \nthat when a fire starts, it has the fuel on the ground. It has the new \nyoung trees to use as ladders, and the fire whooshes up, hits the \ncanopies of the old trees which are, for the most part, the habitat of \nendangered species and the greatness of our ancient forests.\n  The question comes up: How do we work at this? Senator Wyden and I \nhave chosen to see if we can put together a compromise between the \nCraig amendment and the Bingaman amendment which will allow us to move \nfor the 1 year that is the life of the fiscal year 2003 Interior \nappropriations bill vigorously to treat some of those areas.\n\n  The areas that we would treat really is very small. Our \nrecommendation would be up to 7 million acres out of the 24 million \nacres. We know the forest departments are going to try to do at least 2 \nmillion acres. What we are saying to them is: This next year triple \nyour activity, move rapidly. Then we try to set the parameters of that \nemergency movement.\n  For a moment, I wish to share some of those parameters.\n  We make a number of findings in our amendment that document and \nreflect the emerging conditions we find in our forests, and I will talk \nabout that in a moment. But the amendment establishes a 1-year pilot \nproject to enable the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service \nto move rapidly to treat up to 7 million of the 24 million acres in \nthose strategic areas.\n  Our amendment would have directed all of the work to be only on those \nlands at the highest danger level of catastrophic fire. It would \nstipulate that 70 percent of hazardous fuels reduction projects be done \neither within one-half mile of a community--that is what is called \nurban wildland interface--or within municipal watersheds. Those are the \nwatersheds where the fire risk to the ecosystem is the greatest. So 70 \npercent of the program would be concentrated in the areas where we know \nthere is the greatest risk. The urban interface has been broadly agreed \nto. There is some question on the watershed areas.\n  Having said that, for many States, rural States in particular, the \nonly way they are going to get any emergency treatment is if we include \nthese watershed areas because this is where they generate the big \nfires. These are, obviously, the more rural States. California can \ncertainly use all of its funds just within urban interface, but that is \nnot true for more rural States.\n  Our amendment would also allow the administrative appeals process to \nbe truncated for these areas. What we are trying to do is speed things \nalong, and we estimate this would save at least 135 days. Any fuels \nreduction projects, such as thinning or brush removal, within a half \nmile of any community would be excluded from what is called NEPA, the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, thus preventing these projects from \nbeing stalled indefinitely. I think there is broad agreement about \nthat.\n  I think the environmental community understands the need to work \nquickly in areas very close to communities and very close to property.\n  Additionally, any temporary injunctive relief, whether it is a TRO, \nwhich is limited in days, we know, or a preliminary injunction, which \ncan go on for a substantial period of time--this is a big give on our \npart. This is, I think, for Senator Wyden--and he will speak for \nhimself--but certainly for me this is the last best offer to try to get \nan accommodation with the other side of the aisle. What we did was say \nthat any temporary injunctive relief, preliminary injunction, or TRO, \nwould be limited to 60 days with the authority to renew each temporary \ninjunction without limitation.\n\n  What we believe it would do is cause the judge to reflect on our \nfindings in the legislation, on the emergency situation, and on the \nproblems directly on the ground at the time.\n  I understand my time is up. I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This means in situations where the risk of fire is \nabsolutely the greatest and projects are being held up in the courts, a \njudge must consider changing circumstances and whether to renew a \npreliminary injunction. Anybody filing an administrative appeal to a \nhazardous reduction project would be required also to raise the issue \nbefore the close of notice and comment; in other words, to have some \nstanding to bring an appeal, not just to be able to jump in after all \nthe periods have closed and go to court.\n  These were two of our biggest gives in the interest of trying to gain \n60 votes. I truly do not think there is anything else we can do. These \nare very big concessions, at least as far as I am concerned, and I \nthink that is echoed by Senator Wyden as well.\n  I will quickly outline some of the additional safeguards in our \namendment. There would be no road construction in any inventoried \nroadless area. An ecologically sufficient number of old and large trees \nwould be maintained for each ecosystem; and for fuels reduction \nprojects, agencies would be required to do all thinning from ground \nlevel up. This means that thinning would start with small trees and \nbrush at ground level and act as a safeguard against the cutting of \nlarger trees. And in special, or what is called extraordinary \ncircumstances, such as areas with endangered species or tribal issues \nor where archeological findings may lie, the exclusions from the normal \nprocess do not apply.\n  Additionally, I will speak for one moment about the four findings in \nour amendment because they underlie the problems we are facing.\n  Firstly, in 2002, we find that approximately 6.5 million acres of \nforest land have burned, 21 people have died, and 3,079 structures have \nbeen destroyed. We find the Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement have spent a billion dollars fighting these fires. We find \n73 million acres of public lands are classified in the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire. We find that forest management policy of fire \nsuppression has resulted in an accumulation of fuel\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\nload, dead and dying trees, infested trees, nonnative species, creating \nfuel ladders that allow fires to reach the crowns of large old trees \nand cause catastrophic fires. Fourthly, we find the U.S. Forest Service \nand the Department of the Interior should immediately undertake an \nemergency program to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Obviously, \nthe emergency program is confined to those areas I spoke about.\n  In closing, I thank, first, Senator Wyden. I also thank Senator \nBingaman, Senator Daschle, Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, Senator \nKyl, and Senator Burns, all of whom have spent an inordinate amount of \ntime trying to reach some agreement.\n  I restate my belief that the forest fires raging throughout the \nWestern United States represent one of the most severe crises facing \nour Nation. The devastation has and will continue to be immense. It is \nthe greatest human and ecological threat now facing virtually every \nWestern State. This is a crisis that transcends the issue of party \npolitics, and I deeply regret our inability to reach a meaningful \ncompromise, at least at this time. Because the Interior appropriations \nbill will be on the floor at least for the next few days, I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to seek a consensus \nand I, for one, remain open to one.\n  I am sorry we do not have an agreement to report, but I want to end \nby thanking Senator Wyden for his leadership. He has a State that has \nglorious forests, as do I. He has been wonderful, and I hope there is a \nchange and we may be able to work something out together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let me begin by expressing my thanks to \nSenator Feinstein. I still hope the Feinstein wisdom will prevail upon \nthe Senate and we can get to common ground on this contentious issue. I \nwant my colleague to know how much I appreciate the many hours and \nnights we have been at this, shuttling back and forth between our \noffices and the offices of Senator Craig and Senator Bingaman.\n  I share the Senator's commitment that, despite the news we have to \ndeliver that there is no compromise today, we are not going to give up \nand we expect to revisit this issue in the Senate again soon. I thank \nmy colleague for all her leadership, and particularly for her passion \non this issue.\n  When I came to the Senate, I never felt very comfortable when the \nnews media said I was elected to fill the seat of Senator Morse or \nSenator Packwood. That is because I do not think the people of Oregon \nsend someone to the U.S. Senate just to fill a seat. The people of \nOregon send someone to the Senate to work for what is right. That is \nwhat they expect of their Senators: to do what is right and take your \nlumps. They can live with that.\n  With that in mind, Senator Feinstein and I have now spent certainly 6 \nor 7 weeks trying to help find the common ground in the Senate for a \nbalanced, narrowly focused bill to address the fire threat in our \nforests. We knew it would be a difficult task when we took it on, and \nit has certainly lived down to that promise.\n  This is what the Senate faced, as Senator Feinstein and I tried to \nmove forward. On the one hand, there is one camp of considerable \npassion that, unfortunately, would be willing to use this summer's \nhorrendous fires to deny citizens the right to seek justice in a court \nof law or to severely limit those rights. In another camp, there have \nbeen many who have said we will accept no changes in these laws \nwhatsoever, even changes that will benefit the environment. Their \nposition, as far as I can tell, is that there is practically a \nconstitutional right to a 5-year delay on forest management decisions.\n  Given these two camps, Senator Feinstein and I, optimists by nature, \nsaid we know there are Senators who want to try to come together to \nfind the common ground. We set out to do it. Unfortunately, as of this \nafternoon, it seems the Senate is not willing to seize the common \nground which Senator Feinstein and I believe is within the Senate's \ngrasp.\n  Today, in a front page article of the Oregonian newspaper it was \nsuggested that the Bush administration does not think it needs \ncongressional authorization to pursue a solution to the forest health \nproblem. My sense is they agree with Senator Feinstein and myself that \nthe use of, for example, what are called categorical exclusions offers \na way to expedite the process required to reduce fire threats and \nrestore diseased and damaged forests. The administration plans to \npursue categorical exclusions though history shows there have been \nsuccessful court challenges to administratively created categorical \nexclusions in the past. We believe the American people and the forests \nwould have been better served with narrow specific congressional \nauthorization of categorical exclusions--but, due to the lack of a \ncompromise, that congressional action, as of this afternoon, will not \nhappen on this bill.\n  Though, as we worked over the last few weeks, it seemed a core group \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, \nand others--were very close to a compromise, we did not get there.\n  Instead, the result has been so many pieces of stray paper floating \naround Washington, the country, and the internet, as well as a whole \nhost of poorly informed rumors. So much misinformation is out there \nthat I have posted our joint Feinstein/Wyden proposal on my Web site so \nthat people will see what it is we have sought to do to try to bring \nthe Senate and our constituents together. I will touch on that proposal \njust briefly.\n  First, we allow the use of broad categorical exclusions to thin and \nsalvage in the most fire-prone areas within the urban-wildland \ninterface and allow the use of somewhat narrower categorical exclusions \nto manage fire-prone lands in other areas.\n  Second, we require people who may want to file an administrative \nappeal on a project at a later date to participate in the public \ncomment process on that project.\n  Third, we require judges to periodically review temporary injunctive \nrelief granted and to review those injunctions with updated information \nevery time a project is brought before the court.\n  My sense is the administration could have accepted the proposal \nSenator Feinstein and I have pursued--but not enough Senators could see \ntheir way there.\n  If Members want to get something done, they are going to have to take \nsome political risk. I am not here to blame anyone. Senators have \nworked in good faith. However, I do not think it is too much to ask \nSenators to take a political risk to solve this critical problem so \nthat families and forests are not facing the ultimate risk of \ndevastating fires summer after summer.\n  There should be no confusion on this point. Unless there is some \nwillingness on the part of the Senate to take the kind of political \nrisk necessary to find common ground, we will see these devastating \nunnatural fires summer after summer after summer, as sure as night \nfollows day.\n  There were a host of obstacles to a compromise today, though in the \npast we have been able to find common ground. Senator Craig and I, for \nexample, led an effort in this body to write the county payments law, a \ncritical law that is used to offer billions of dollars for rural \ncommunities to pay for services and schools. People said that could not \nbe done. The Forest Service now calls it the most important law for \nthat agency in 30 years. Senator Craig and I came together more \nrecently to try to advance an old growth protection proposal for the \nPacific Northwest, though we have a lot more work to do in that arena. \nMy point is, it is possible to find common ground.\n  I am going to try again, probably a lot sooner than some people think \nor may want, on this issue. But I do know that two Democrats, despite \nall the pushing and pulling, do not make a winning hand in the Senate.\n  Senator Feinstein and I faced some big challenges. I opposed those \nwho hold out for a major overhaul of the judicial process on this bill, \nthough, due to its controversial nature, that approach is not going to \nallow us, any time soon, to address the risk of fire. We opposed others \nwho may want to grant very broad forest management exemptions for \nprojects conducted within municipal watersheds. That will also make it \nimpossible to find common ground and a compromise.\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n  But like I said earlier, I don't want to blame anyone today. \nCertainly, with all the misinformation out there about what I have done \nand supposedly not done or said during the last few weeks--and I am \nsure other Senators feel the same--this is not a time to offer a litany \nof charges with respect to any Member of this body.\n  My bottom line is this: I hope these efforts, laborious though they \nhave been, can someday soon yield fruit. Toward that end, I thank a \nnumber of colleagues. Senator Craig has worked in good faith, and \ncertainly closely with me. I hold him in the highest regard. Senator \nFeinstein, as I have already mentioned, was there night and day working \non this issue and I appreciate her efforts. Senator Daschle and Senator \nBingaman went out of their ways to try to accommodate Senator Feinstein \nand me. For their efforts, I am appreciative, as well.\n  I chair the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management. In \nOregon, we have had tragic fires. I have been consumed by this day \nafter day after day. I wish we were in the Senate today saying we had \nfound the common ground. I think it is possible to do it. The Senate \ncannot leave this subject for too long and will return to it after this \nbill is done in some form or another. Too many lives and too many \ncommunities will be devastated if the Senate washes its hands of this \nissue. I am committed to working with all my colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, day after day after day, until this gets done.\n  I hope one day soon I will be able to come to the floor of the Senate \nand participate with my colleagues on something that all Members can \nbelieve is a positive step forward to make sure these treasures, our \nforests and lands across this country, are managed properly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8897-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FORESTS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I congratulate my colleague from \nOregon and my colleague from California for the effort to try to reach \na rationalization relative to the decimation of the forests in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  I am frustrated with regard to the extended negotiations associated \nwith forest health. Any Member, if we are stricken, seeks the very best \nadvice. We do not hold a townhall meeting. We seek out a specialist, a \nspecialist who obviously is well trained, a specialist who bears the \nbrunt of a suit if there is malpractice associated with the care given.\n  If I may draw a parallel, we have very sick forests. They are sick as \na consequence of well-meaning environmental pressures to basically \nterminate access into the forests, which has always been provided by \nlogging. Many people assume that old growth has always been. They \noverlook the reality that a forest is similar in many respects to a \nfield of wheat. If it is harvested, it regenerates.\n  Depending whether selective logging is used or clearcut logging, the \nappropriate procedure is reforestation. Reforestation occurs by \nindividually planting trees or it can be done by natural reseeding, \nwhich is much the case in my State. But we prolong this argument and \ntake it beyond the realm of addressing in a timely manner the necessary \ncorrection. The necessary correction associated with our forests as a \nconsequence of the tremendous exposure of fires is the management of \nunderbrush that is predominant in the second growth. If that is not \ncleared, why, clearly we expose ourselves to complications associated \nwith a huge fire moving through an area very rapidly and the inability \nto go in and fight it because we have eliminated access in much of our \nnational forest.\n\n  So I beseech my colleagues to consider the ramifications. Let's make \nthese decisions not on emotion; let's make them on the best forest \nmanagement practice. We have foresters who spend a lifetime in the area \nof forest health. We have to listen to those people; otherwise, we are \nkidding ourselves and we are kidding the public. We should be taken to \ntask by the public for not directing this corrective result.\n  While well-meaning environmental groups say let nature take its \ncourse, that is not, if you will, in the opinion of many of us, the \nappropriate procedure. We can help nature. We can help our forests. The \nforests are there, and we should recognize that we use the forests. \nThey are a place of recreation; they are a place of productivity. If we \nhave fires, we should take what the salvage capabilities are in the \nforests and move that timber out while it still has some value.\n  It is very frustrating to the Senator from Alaska. We have fires in \nthe interior. The Tongass is a very wet area and we have few fires. But \nto see this debate go on and on with no conclusion, no recognition that \ndecisions should be made on the basis of forest health, is extremely \nfrustrating. I hope my colleagues will consider the bottom line. Let's \nmake a decision on what is good for forest health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8897-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8897-S8899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DRAFT JOINT RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF U.S. ARMED FORCES \n                              AGAINST IRAQ\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am going to briefly turn to another \nmatter, and that is the recognition that today OPEC announced they were \nnot going to increase the production of oil from the OPEC nations. What \ndoes this mean? It simply means that as we look at going into a \nshowdown with Iraq, the Mideast nations that control oil--basically \nOPEC--are not going to increase production. That means to the American \nconsumer a continuation of high gasoline prices, high oil prices, \nperhaps well beyond $30 a barrel.\n  We have seen the development of that cartel over a period of time. It \ninitiated a program that said, in effect, if the price fell below $22 a \nbarrel, they would reduce supply to stabilize the price. They wanted a \nprice structure of $22 to $28. That puts a tremendous burden on the \nstructure of our society and our economy.\n  It is rather revealing to recognize that as we continue to address \nour situation with Iraq, we also continue to import oil from Iraq. I \nthink currently we are importing about 600,000 barrels from Iraq each \nday.\n  We have delivered from the White House to the Speaker, majority \nleader, minority leader, as well as the House minority leader, a \ntransmittal, which is the consequences of discussions with the \nPresident, identifying a suggested form of resolution with respect to \nIraq. I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 19, 2002.\n     Hon.

Iraq\n\n       Whereas Congress in 1998 concluded that Iraq was then in \n     material and unacceptable breach of its international \n     obligations and thereby threatened the vital interests of the \n     United States and international peace and security, stated \n     the reasons for that conclusion, and urged the President to \n     take appropriate action to bring Iraq into compliance with \n     its international obligations (Public Law 105-235);\n       Whereas Iraq remains in material and unacceptable breach of \n     its international obligations by, among other things, \n     continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and \n     biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear \n     weapons capability, and supporting and harboring terrorist \n     organizations, thereby continuing to threaten the national \n     security interests of the United States and international \n     peace and security;\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n       Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the \n     United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in \n     brutal repression of its civilian population, including the \n     Kurdish peoples, thereby threatening international peace and \n     security in the region, by refusing to release, repatriate, \n     or account for non-Iraqi citizens wrongfully detained by \n     Iraq, and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by \n     Iraq from Kuwait;\n       Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction \n     against other nations and its own people;\n       Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the \n     United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate \n     former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of \n     occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged \n     in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing \n     responsibility for attacks on the United States, its \n     citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred \n     on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other \n     international terrorist organizations, including \n     organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, \n     2001 underscored the gravity of the threat that Iraq will \n     transfer weapons of mass destruction to international \n     terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas the United States has the inherent right, as \n     acknowledged in the United Nations Charter, to use force in \n     order to defend itself;\n       Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to \n     use weapons of mass destruction, the high risk that the \n     current Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to \n     launch a surprise attack against the United States or its \n     Armed Forces or provide them to international terrorists who \n     would do so, and the extreme magnitude of harm that would \n     result to the United States and its citizens from such an \n     attack, combine to justify the use of force by the United \n     States in order to defend itself;\n       Whereas Iraq is in material breach of its disarmament and \n     other obligations under United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687, to cease repression of its civilian \n     population that threatens international peace and security \n     under United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and to \n     cease threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations \n     in Iraq under United Nations Security Council Resolution 949, \n     and United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes \n     use of all necessary means to compel Iraq to comply with \n     these ``subsequent relevant resolutions;''\n       Whereas Congress in the Authorization for Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has \n     authorized the President to use the Armed Forces of the \n     United States to achieve full implementation of Security \n     Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, \n     670, 674, and 677, pursuant to Security Council Resolution \n     678;\n       Whereas Congress in section 1095 of Public Law 102-190 has \n     stated that it ``supports the use of all necessary means to \n     achieve the goals of Security Council Resolution 687 as being \n     consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n     Against Iraq (Public Law 102-1),'' that Iraq's repression of \n     its civilian population violates United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 688 and ``constitutes a continuing threat \n     to the peace, security, and stability of the Persian Gulf \n     region,'' and that Congress ``supports the use of all \n     necessary means to achieve the goals of Resolution 688'';\n       Whereas Congress in the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law \n     105-338) has expressed its sense that it should be the policy \n     of the United States to support efforts to remove from power \n     the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a \n     democratic government to replace that regime;\n       Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution \n     to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of \n     international terrorism against the United States, as \n     Congress recognized in the joint resolution on Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and\n       Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution \n     to use force in order to defend the national security \n     interests of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Further \n     Resolution on Iraq''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       The President is authorized to use all means that he \n     determines to be appropriate, including force, in order to \n     enforce the United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     referenced above, defend the national security interests of \n     the United States against the threat posed by Iraq, and \n     restore international peace and security in the region.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This contains a number of ``whereas's.'' It is \ntransmitted by the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs \nand the Counsel to the President. At the conclusion of the resolution \nthat is going to be before this body is a joint resolution cited as \n``Further Resolution on Iraq.'' I will read the ``resolved'' portion:\n\n       The President is authorized to use all means that he \n     determines to be appropriate, including force, in order to \n     enforce United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     referenced above, defend the national security interests of \n     the United States against the threat posed by Iraq, and \n     restore international peace and security in the region.\n\n  We undoubtedly will be addressing this issue in the very near future. \nI encourage my colleagues to recognize the significance of what this \nobligation means to each and every Member of the Senate. We know Saddam \nHussein is unpredictable. We know he is dangerous. We know he has \nweapons of mass destruction. We know he has used those weapons--\ncertainly chemical warfare--on his own people.\n  I had an opportunity several years ago, with a small group of \nSenators, to visit Baghdad. Later we had an opportunity to meet with \nSaddam Hussein. His ruthlessness was apparent at that time.\n  To reflect a little bit on that particular time, there was at issue \nan allegation that Iraq was importing a delivery capability consisting \nof a huge cannon-type device that had been intercepted in the docks of \nLondon. This was going to have the capability of delivering a \nprojectile farther than any projectile had ever been delivered by \nconventional methods, as opposed to a missile-type system.\n  There was allegedly a triggering device also found on the docks of \nLondon.\n  When we confronted Saddam Hussein, he advised us these were parts for \nhis refinery, these were technical developments by the Baghdad \nInstitute of Technology. This was prior to the Persian Gulf war.\n  My point is, he has been misleading, if you will, the Western World \nfor an extended period of time and continues to do so. The announcement \nhe made that he would welcome U.N. inspectors is a guise. He will not \nallow U.N. inspectors to have free rein in his country, and we will \nclearly see this as we continue the process of evaluating our position.\n  But we have an opportunity now to fish or cut bait. We are going to \nhave this resolution before us. I encourage each and every Member of \nthe Senate to review it in detail and recognize the insecurity of our \nNation oil supply. Currently, we are importing somewhere close to 60 \npercent of our oil, primarily from the Mideast. We have the capability \nof reducing that dependence here at home. It is an issue in my State. \nANWR has been debated in this Chamber. It has been supported by the \nHouse but not the Senate.\n  The technology that we have to develop this area is evident. To \nsuggest we can do it safely is something that most people with an \nobjective view would recognize clearly. The reserves are as much as we \nwould import from Saddam Hussein in 40 years or from Saudi Arabia in 30 \nyears.\n  This matter is in the conference. It is being discussed. It will be \ndetermined by the conference as to what the disposition will be. But I \nencourage Members to recognize that we have an opportunity to take a \nposition that would affirmatively reduce our dependence on imported oil \nand send a very strong message to the Mideast that we intend to reduce \nthat dependence.\n\n  Recognize that we do have an alternative. I think in future times, as \nwe address our continued vulnerability and dependence on the Mideast, \nwe are going to have to assert ourselves to find some relief. That \nrelief partially might be in the joining together of Canada, Mexico, \nthe United States, Alaska, and Russia as an offset to our dependence on \nimported oil from the Mideast. While we do not have the depth of \nreserves, we have substantial reserves collectively. The idea of an \nenergy group made up of those nations could clearly send a message to \nthe Mideast that we will not be held hostage by policies of the cartel \nwhich are designated to simply maintain high prices for oil by \ncontinuing to keep the availability of oil at a minimum.\n  As this matter comes before the Senate for further discussion and \nconsideration, as well as the conference, I urge my colleagues to keep \nan open mind and recognize that, again, we are going to have to vote \nnot on what is necessarily the litany of America's environmental \ncommunity but what is right for America. To suggest we should not have \nthese jobs in the\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nUnited States as if we do not have the technical capability to open up \nthis area safely is not fraught with any degree of accuracy but it is \nsimply misleading arguments that environmental groups continue to use \nto generate revenue in dollars.\n  I encourage each Member to recognize the obligation that we have. \nThat obligation is do what is right for America. What is right for \nAmerica is to produce more energy and and to produce clean energy here \nat home.\n  One of the inconsistencies we have is that nobody seems to really \ncare where they get the oil as long as they get it. They do not concern \nthemselves with whether it comes from a scorched Earth, lack of any \nenvironmental oversight a field in Iraq, or from fields in Saudi \nArabia, or from the rain forests of Colombia. They only care if they \nget it.\n  As I have said time and time again, the world will continue to depend \non oil, because that is what the world moves on. We have no other \nalternative.\n  Some people suggest we have alternatives, but hot air is not going to \nmove us in an out of Washington, DC, although occassionally there is \nquite a bit of it here.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8899-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am going to be asking unanimous consent \nto proceed forward on the bill, but I am not going to do that until \nsomeone is here from the other side. And I know they are going to \nobject, or most likely will object.\n  But let me bring to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate a \nsituation that is not dissimilar to a situation we faced some months \nago in trying to provide emergency assistance, under the Small Business \nAdministration, to those who had been affected by the events of \nSeptember 11 of last year.\n  We had a lot of small businesses in the country that were hurting \nthat had collateral damage, if you will, as a consequence of those \nevents. Many, many small businesses were dependent on the economy as it \nflows through all sectors. So whether it was a small drycleaner that \nwas affected because they were not doing as much business because \nhotels were not doing as much business or a limousine company or a taxi \ncompany, there are many people who were affected tangentially because \nof the dropoff in air travel, and so forth.\n  It took us a number of months, almost six, unfortunately, in the \nSenate to respond in a way that many of us thought was both appropriate \nand adequate. And, again, we are sort of running into a strange kind of \nunexplained resistance by the administration to something that makes \ncommon sense, is very inexpensive but also very necessary for a lot of \nsmall entrepreneurs in our country. I am specifically referring to the \nSmall Business Drought Relief Act.\n  In more than 30 States in our country, we have a declared drought \nemergency. And the drought is as significant in some places as it was \nduring the great Dust Bowl years of the Depression in the United \nStates.\n  Drought hurts more than farmers, more than ranchers. The purpose of \nthis bill is to try to provide some emergency assistance, in an \naffordable and sensible way, for those small businesses that are not in \nagricultural-related fields but desperately cannot get help, and need \nit, and cannot get it because the SBA does not apply the law uniformly \nfor all victims of drought.\n  The SBA makes disaster loans to small businesses related to \nagriculture that are hurt by drought, but they are turning away small \nbusinesses that are in industries unrelated to agriculture, and \nclaiming that those businesses are not entitled to it because drought \ndoes not fit the definition of disaster.\n  That is just wrong. It is wrong because the law does not restrict \nthem from making loans to those small businesses. It is wrong because \nthat is not the intent of the Congress to turn away those small \nbusinesses, and they should be following the law and following the \nintent of Congress.\n  I might add that the SBA has in effect right now disaster \ndeclarations in 30 States that I just talked about. For instance, in \nSouth Carolina, the entire State has been declared a disaster by the \nSBA, but the administration is not helping all of the drought victims \nin South Carolina that are looking for help.\n  Let me share with you the declaration of drought itself. It addresses \nthis question of intent.\n\n       Small businesses located in all 46 counties may apply for \n     economic injury disaster loan assistance through the SBA.\n\n  Let me read to you from the declaration:\n\n       Small businesses located in all 46 counties may apply for \n     economic injury disaster loan assistance through the SBA. \n     These are working capital loans to help the business continue \n     to meet its obligations until the business returns to normal \n     conditions. . . . Only small, non-farm agriculture dependent \n     and small agricultural cooperatives are eligible to apply for \n     assistance. Nurseries are also eligible for economic injury \n     caused by drought conditions.\n\n  What do I mean by other businesses that may be affected by drought? \nIn South Carolina, conditions are so bad that small businesses \ndependent on lake and river tourism have seen their revenues drop \nanywhere from 17 to 80 percent. So you have victims of the drought that \nrange from fish and tackle shops to rafting businesses, from \nrestaurants to motels, from marinas to gas stations. Their livelihood \nis no less impacted and no less important than those who have been \ndeemed to fit under only the agricultural definition.\n  Thousands of small businesses make their living in tourism, \nrecreation industries, not just in South Carolina but in many other \nparts of the country, including my State of Massachusetts, in Texas, \nMichigan, Delaware, and elsewhere.\n  In fact, for a lot of States around the Great Lakes Basin, sport \nfishing, as reported by the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, brings into the region some $4 billion a year. There \nare many industries that are dependent on water that are affected by \ndrought, and they ought to be eligible for this help.\n  Is this opening Pandora's box with respect to a flow of lending that \nwe cannot afford? The answer is definitively no. The SBA already has \nthe authority, but its lawyers have decided not to help these \nindustries based on their own interpretation of a definition, despite \nthe fact that Congress believes otherwise.\n  That defies both common sense and fairness. Small businesses with \neverything on the line desperately need this,\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\nespecially at a time when capital is a lot tighter for working capital \npurposes, where the lending is significantly tighter from the banks and \nfrom other traditional credit sources.\n  Our bill, the drought relief bill, does not expand the existing \nprogram. It simply clarifies existing authority. That is a matter of \ncommon sense.\n  In terms of cost, the Congressional Budget Office estimates a cost of \nabout $5 million annually. What we have here is a resistance by \nsomebody in the U.S. Senate to allowing this to go forward based on \nabout a $5 million annual estimate by CBO.\n  This chart of CBO's estimate is a tally of the estimated spending \nunder the SBA's disaster loan program which shows the differential with \nthis particular bill.\n  This bill is bipartisan. The principal cosponsors are Senator Bond \nand Senator Hollings. All the members of our committee--the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship--voted in favor of this bill. \nThere are 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans; 17 Governors have \nwritten us to express their support of this legislation in hopes we \nwill pass it, including 15 of the Southern Governors' Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter, and others, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 19, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We are deeply concerned that small \n     businesses in states experiencing drought are being \n     devastated by drought conditions that are expected to \n     continue through the end of the summer. We urge you to \n     support legislation that would allow small businesses to \n     protect themselves against the detrimental effects of \n     drought.\n       Much like other natural disasters, the effects of drought \n     on local economies can be crippling. Farmers and farm-related \n     businesses can turn in times of drought to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture. However, non-farm small businesses \n     have nowhere to go, not even the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA), because their disaster loans are not \n     made available for damage due to drought.\n       To remedy this omission, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) \n     introduced the Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) on \n     July 16, 2002, to make SBA disaster loans available to those \n     small businesses debilitated by long drought conditions. This \n     bill was passed by the Senate Small Business Committee just \n     eight days later. Also, the companion legislation (H.R. 5197) \n     was introduced by Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) on July 24, 2002. \n     Both bills are gaining bipartisan support, and we hope you \n     will cosponsor this important legislation and push for its \n     rapid enactment in the 107th Congress.\n       As 11 southern states are presently experiencing moderate \n     to exceptional drought conditions this summer, we cannot \n     afford to wait to act. We urge you to cosponsor the Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act and push for its consideration as \n     soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama, Gov. Mike Huckabee of \n           Arkansas, Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, Gov. Paul E. \n           Patton of Kentucky, Gov. M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. of \n           Louisiana, Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, Gov. \n           Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi, Gov. Bob Holden of \n           Missouri, Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, \n           Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Gov. Jim Hodges of \n           South Carolina, Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, Gov. \n           Rick Perry of Texas, Gov.

John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The State of South Carolina is in its \n     fifth year of drought status, the worst in over fifty years. \n     Some parts of the state are in extreme drought status and the \n     rest is in severe drought status.\n       99% of our streams are flowing at less than 10% of their \n     average flow for this time of year. 60% of those same streams \n     are running at lowest flow on record for this date. The \n     levels of South Carolina's lakes have dropped anywhere from \n     five feet to twenty feet. Some lakes have experienced a drop \n     in water level so significant that tourist and recreational \n     use has diminished.\n       State and national climatologists are not hopeful that we \n     will receive any significant rainfall in the near future. To \n     end our current drought, we would need an extended period of \n     average to above average rainfall.\n       Droughts, particularly prolonged ones such as we are \n     experiencing now, have extensive economic effects. For \n     farmers who experience the economic effects of such a \n     drought, assistance is available through the USDA. For small \n     businesses, assistance is available only for agriculture \n     related small businesses, i.e. feed and seed stores. For \n     businesses that are based on tourism around Lakes and Rivers, \n     there is currently no assistance available.\n       We have reports of lake and river tourism dependent \n     businesses experiencing 17% to 80% declines in revenue. The \n     average decline in revenue is probably near 50% across the \n     board.\n       My staff has contacted Small Business Administration and \n     they are not authorized to offer assistance to these \n     businesses because a drought is not defined as a sudden \n     occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing natural \n     disaster that is causing great economic damage to these small \n     business owners.\n       I am requesting that you assist us in this situation by \n     proposing that the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     Committee take action to at least temporarily amend the SBA \n     authorizing language and allow them to offer assistance to \n     small businesses affected by prolonged drought. This would \n     allow Governors to ask SBA for an administrative declaration \n     of economic injury because of drought. The low interest loans \n     SBA can offer these businesses would allow many of them to \n     weather the drought and remain in business for the long run.\n       My staff has also been in contact with Senator Hollings' \n     legislative staff. I hope together, we can find an expedient \n     solution to the plight of these small business owners. Short \n     of finding a way to control the weather, this may be our only \n     option to help their dire situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Hodges,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          State of North Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Raleigh, NC, July 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I am writing to urge your support for \n     legislation recently introduced in the Senate to add drought \n     as a condition for which small businesses may apply for Small \n     Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loans.\n       The Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) will \n     correct the current situation facing our small businesses in \n     North Carolina. SBA disaster assistance is not available \n     despite a historic drought that is impacting not just our \n     agriculture sector, but causing real business and revenue \n     losses, which threaten some firms with job layoffs or even \n     bankruptcy.\n       These businesses need help, and access to low-interest SBA \n     loans can offer a lifeline to allow paying bills and making \n     payrolls until business returns to normal.\n       I urge you to push for rapid action on this important \n     enhancement to SBA's ability to help our people through this \n     time of trouble.\n       With kindest regards, I remain\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Michael F.

John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Bond: Much of Nevada and the Nation \n     have been experiencing extreme drought over the past several \n     years. In Nevada we have seen the effects of this situation \n     through catastrophic range and forest fires, insect \n     infestations and loss of crops and livestock.\n       Prolonged drought causes a drastic reduction in stream and \n     river flow levels. This can cause the level of lakes to drop \n     so significantly that existing docks and boat ramps cannot \n     provide access to boats. In the case of range and forest \n     fires we have seen small innkeepers and hunting and fishing \n     related\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\n     businesses that have their entire season wiped out in a \n     matter of a few hours.\n       Unfortunately for some small businesses, drought assistance \n     is available only for agriculture related small businesses, \n     such as feed and seed stores. For businesses that are based \n     on tourism around lakes and rivers, there is currently no \n     drought assistance available.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) is not currently \n     authorized to help these businesses because a drought is not \n     a sudden occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing \n     natural disaster that causes great damage to these small \n     businesses.\n       I would like to lend my support to S. 2734, The Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act. This bill would amend the \n     guidelines and authorize the SBA to offer assistance to small \n     businesses affected by prolonged drought. With passage of \n     this bill, Governors would be allowed to ask SBA for \n     administrative declarations of economic injury because of \n     drought. The low interest loans SBA can offer these \n     businesses would allow many of them to weather the drought \n     and remain economically viable for future operation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kenny C.

John F. Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry and Senator Bond: As you know, much of \n     our nation is struggling to overcome ``moderate'' to \n     ``extreme'' drought conditions. Droughts, especially \n     prolonged droughts, have extensive, devastating effects that \n     damage crops and livestock, deteriorate soil, and fuel raging \n     wildfires. These are only some of the irreparable effects \n     that droughts can have on small businesses, communities, and \n     state and local economies.\n       In general, federal disaster assistance is available for \n     agriculture and agriculture-related small businesses that are \n     impacted by drought. However, droughts hurt more than \n     agricultural, forestry, and livestock businesses.\n       Prolonged drought also causes a drastic reduction in stream \n     and river flow levels. This can trigger such a significant \n     drop in the level of lakes that existing docks and boat ramps \n     cannot provide access to boats, which impacts many additional \n     small businesses.\n       As a result, many non-farm small businesses that are water-\n     reliant also suffer staggering revenue losses in the wake of \n     a drought disaster, yet they do not currently receive \n     disaster relief. Unlike other natural disasters such as \n     hurricanes or floods, the effects of drought build up over-\n     time, last for several years, and are jeopardizing the future \n     of these small business owners. The lack of federal disaster \n     assistance available to these non-farm small businesses only \n     forces undue job layoffs and bankruptcies and further \n     disrupts drought-impacted communities.\n       I thank you for recognizing that many fish and tackle \n     shops, rafting businesses, restaurants, motels, camp grounds, \n     marinas, gas stations, and other small businesses in Kentucky \n     and other states are severely impacted by drought but are \n     unable to receive federal disaster assistance. I strongly \n     support your resulting efforts, the Small Business Drought \n     Relief Act (S. 2734), which would allow the Small Business \n     Administration to offer low-interest disaster loans to these \n     businesses and afford them the same opportunity as \n     agriculture-related businesses to recover and survive.\n       I appreciate your assistance and support and look forward \n     to working with you and your colleagues on this very \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul E. Patton,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. This is a letter from the Southern Governors' Association, \nwith 15 southern Governors signing and asking us to pass this \nassistance. They have sent letters to Members of Congress asking them \nto support and pass the bill.\n  Finally, we are not talking about grants. We are talking about loans. \nThese are going to be repaid. The default record of the SBA over the \nlast 10 years is really quite extraordinary on the positive side of the \nledger. The question is whether we are going to look to small \nbusinesses that are equally hard working as anyone else in the country, \nwho, like farmers, are suffering the economic consequences of a drought \nthat is beyond their control.\n  I thank Senator Bond for working with me to try to address this \nproblem. I thank Senator Hollings, particularly, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, for introducing the bill with me. I am particularly \ngrateful to the small business owners who have brought this issue to \nour attention and who hope we can break out of any partisan resistance \nwithin the Senate in order to do what is right.\n  I hope my colleagues will permit us to proceed forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 535, S. 2734; and that the \nBond amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment, as amended, be considered and \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record at the appropriate place as \nif read, without further intervening business or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my hope is, again, that Senators on the \nother side, who are also cosponsors of this bill, will assist us in \ntrying to proceed forward because there is no rationale for delay--I \nunderscore--there was an e-mail circulated by somebody with some \ngargantuan unofficial estimate of cost that has no relationship to any \nlegitimate estimate that has been made here. The CBO estimate clearly \ndemonstrates that this measure is sensible, with a cost of about $5 \nmillion a year.\n  What is happening is we are seeing a little bit of partisanship--\nmaybe we are seeing a lot of it these last days here in the Senate. I \nhope we can overcome this in the next days. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Bond and others to see if we can proceed forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8901-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8901-S8913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we all agree that one of the many important \ntasks of the new Department of Homeland Security will be protecting our \ncountry's computer infrastructure from cyber attacks. Computer \ntechnology is at the heart of our country's economy and has improved \nevery aspect of our lives. Terrorists and others who wish to harm our \ncountry recognize that cyber attacks on our vital computer and related \ntechnological systems can have a devastating impact on our country, our \neconomy and the lives of our people. The threat of cyber attacks, be it \nfrom foreign and/or domestic actors, is not new, but we all understand \nthat the risks today are even greater.\n  The threat of a devastating cyber attack is real and the potential \nfor harm is great.\n  A recent study found that cyber attacks on the Internet were \nprojected to increase this year by as much as 65 percent. Just last \nyear, two Russian hackers infiltrated American banks and businesses, \nstole private data, including credit card numbers, and extorted those \ncompanies by threatening to destroy their computers or release their \ncustomers' private information.\n  Since September 11, there has been growing concern about the risk to \nour country of a serious cyber attack, particularly one against our \ninfrastructure which could have devastating consequences. Late last \nfall the FBI traced a suspicious pattern of surveillance against \nSilicon Valley computers originating from the Middle East and South \nAsia involving emergency telephone systems, electrical generation and \ntransmission, water storage and distribution, nuclear power plants and \ngas facilities in the bay area. Recently, it was reported that energy \ncompanies have suffered a significant increase in cyber attacks--up 77 \npercent this year--which have raised concern that the country's power \nsystem may be within the cross hairs of cyber terrorists.\n  Given the vital role that computer and related technologies play in \nour\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\ncountry's economy and infrastructure, it is not difficult to imagine an \nassault on a computer system which might cause death or serious bodily \ninjury. For example, a hacker who infiltrates a hospital database to \nerase records may thereby cause a patient to be deprived of necessary \nmedication or treatment. As another example, consider the possibility \nof a cyber attack on a natural gas distribution pipeline that opens \nsafety valves and releases fuel or gas. Attacks on sophisticated \ncontrol systems, such as those involving natural gas, oil, electric \npower and water, which typically use automated supervisory control and \ndata acquisition systems, would have a far-reaching effect.\n  We have acted before when necessary to protect our country and our \neconomy from cyberterrorists. The Patriot Act included \nseveral important provisions to improve our nation's cyber security in \nresponse to the increasing threats to our country. The amendment I am \noffering today continues that work.\n\n  The amendment I am offering today is noncontroversial, and was passed \nby the House, on July 15, 2002. The House bill, H.R. 3482, was \nsponsored by Representative Lamar Smith from Texas, and passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 385 to 3. We need to act \nin the same bipartisan manner and pass this amendment.\n  The amendment will strengthen our criminal laws and provide greater \nflexibility to communications providers and law enforcement when \nnecessary to prevent and protect against devastating cyber attacks. \nSpecifically, the amendment would increase the criminal penalty in \nsection 1030 of title 18 of the United States Code for a cyber attack \nto a maximum of 20 years imprisonment where such an attack causes \nserious bodily injury, and life imprisonment where such an attack \ncauses death. Currently, section 1030 provides a maximum punishment of \nonly 10 years imprisonment for a cyber attack which results in serious \nbodily injury or death.\n  The amendment directs the Sentencing Commission to review the Federal \nsentencing guidelines for cyber crimes to reflect the significant harm \ncaused by such crimes and the need for deterrence. Such a review was \nnot included in the Patriot Act, and is clearly necessary in light of \nthe changes to the federal computer crime statutes contained in the act \nas well as in this amendment. Such a review based on the factors \nincluded in this amendment should give judges greater latitude to \nincrease a defendant's sentence to better account for the seriousness \nof the cyber attack.\n  The amendment also includes provisions to give communications \nproviders and law enforcement greater flexibility when dealing with \nemergency situations where there is a risk of serious bodily injury or \ndeath. Specifically, the amendment creates a ``good faith'' exception \nto allow communications providers to disclose communications to a \ngovernmental entity--e.g. hospital, law enforcement--in an emergency \nsituation involving danger of death or serious bodily harm. The \namendment also expands the list of ``emergency'' situations where law \nenforcement may obtain pen register and trap and trace information to \ninclude ongoing attacks on a protected computer and when necessary to \nprotect national security interest. In order to address privacy \nconcerns, the amendment includes increased penalties for illegal \ninterceptions of cellular telephone calls and intrusions of stored \ncommunications.\n  Finally, the bill establishes the Office of Science and Technology as \nan independent office under the general authority of the Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of Justice Programs. This modification will \nhelp OJP to focus the necessary resources on the development of \ntechnology and hard science research. This measure will enhance OST's \nability to assist state and local law enforcement in developing new \ncutting-edge technologies, such as computer forensics, firearms and \nballistics technology, and crime mapping. Law enforcement is \nincreasingly relying on new and innovative technologies, and we need to \nmake sure that they have all of the tools available to fight terrorists \nand other criminals.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of my \namendment. Once again, we need to demonstrate to our country that \nworking together, in a bipartisan fashion, we can accomplish great \nthings, and we can protect our country from the dangers of potentially \ndevastating cyber attacks.\n  Mr. President, I pay special tribute to Senator Schumer from New \nYork, who is a cosponsor, and tell him how much I appreciate the work \nof him and all the others who are cosponsors of this particular \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside and that Senator Hatch be recognized to offer \nhis amendment dealing with cybersecurity; that Senator Hatch be allowed \nto speak for up to 5 minutes--and we have been informed there is no one \non our side who wishes to speak on this matter--that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order; that at the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold 1 minute, we \nare in the process of trying to work out the next step of our unanimous \nconsent request. We think we are going to be able to do that. Senator \nThompson is on his way to the Chamber.\n  If that is the case, the next amendment that will be offered in the \nnext few minutes will be that of Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain. \nThat should occur, hopefully, momentarily. That amendment will be \ndebated tonight. The leader is expecting to vote sometime tomorrow \nmorning before noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4693 To Amendment No. 4471\n\n              (Purpose: To provide greater cybersecurity)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 4693 to amendment No. \n     4471.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment of Senator Byrd be laid aside so I might offer \nanother amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself \n     and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4694 to \n     amendment No. 4471.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which embraces \nlegislation that my friend and colleague\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, and I introduced last December and then \njoined up with similar legislation introduced by the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Torricelli. Ultimately, we have 22 Members of the Senate \nfrom both parties who have joined as cosponsors of the legislation.\n  The underlying bill went to the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which I am privileged to chair, and was reported out \nfavorably earlier this year.\n  This amendment now embraces that legislation. It would create an \nindependent, nonpartisan citizens commission to investigate how and why \nthe tragic terrorist attacks against the United States happened on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  The underlying measure we are considering to create a Department of \nHomeland Security, to better organize the Federal agencies whose \ndisorganization, I fear, created some of the vulnerabilities that the \nterrorists took advantage of in striking us on September 11, is a \nproposal that also came out of our committee.\n  This amendment would improve the Department that will be created as a \nresult of the underlying proposal. Up until this time, the Joint \nIntelligence Committees of the House and Senate have been pursuing \ninvestigations focused particularly on how the intelligence community \nperformed and what lapses there were in that performance that may have \ncontributed to the attacks of September 11.\n  Senator McCain and I, and our colleagues, introduced this measure \nlast December because we believed, first, that there was a need now, \nafter this truly unprecedented attack of September 11, 2001. People \ncompare it to Pearl Harbor. It is comparable, but remember, Pearl \nHarbor was primarily an attack against Americans in uniform. September \n11, 2001, was an attack against innocent civilians, a classic terrorist \nattack. After Pearl Harbor, there were investigations in Congress, not \nunlike the ones being carried out by the Joint Intelligence Committee. \nBut there were also citizens' commissions involved to carry out broader \ninvestigations, and that is exactly what this commission, as created by \nthis amendment now, would do, if adopted.\n\n  This commission would build on the work done by the Intelligence \nCommittees which began their reports yesterday.\n  The testimony from the staff director of the committee, I found \nchilling, insofar as it reported that as far back as 1998, if I \nremember the date correctly, there was intelligence traffic intercepted \nthat indicated that the al-Qaida terrorists were, in fact, discussing \nthe use of civilian aircraft as weapons targeted against prominent \nbuildings in the United States of America. Along the way, the Director \nof the CIA, so the testimony yesterday went before the Intelligence \nCommittees, effectively declared an intelligence community war against \nal-Qaida but only assigned a single analyst to that task; there was \nintelligence information, of course, and law enforcement intelligence, \nnot being coordinated.\n  Senator McCain and I, as well as Senators Torricelli and Specter, met \nearlier today with some of the families of the people who lost their \nlives on September 11. The question they continued to ask is: How could \nthis have happened and was it preventable? They strongly support the \nadoption of this independent commission. Why? Because they have had the \nheroic strength to turn their grievous loss into active advocacy for \nthe kind of investigation that will go as far as we can humanly go to \ndetermine the causes of September 11 so we make sure it never happens \nagain.\n  The commission, to be appointed by legislative leaders of both \nparties of both Houses, is to have 10 persons on it, not Government \nemployees, not Members of Congress--an equal number of members of both \npolitical parties. They choose the chair and vice chair. This ought to \nbe, and I am confident will be, a commission that will not consider \nitself in any sense limited or truly identified by party affiliation. \nThis is a commission that will have a public purpose: To go beyond the \nfocus of the Intelligence Committees; directed towards intelligence; to \nconsider the widest array of possible causes of September 11; to look \nat our defense policies, our foreign policies, our international \neconomic policies, our international public diplomacy policies, our \nintelligence, our law enforcement; to leave no stone unturned in trying \nto answer the question of how September 11 could have happened, so we \nmake sure it never happens again.\n  It will have the credibility of an independent, nonpolitical, \nnonpartisan commission composed of a mix of citizens whose experience \nand capacity will bring great credibility to this report.\n  I am so pleased there has been a twist of fate and procedure, often \nquite important in this body, that has allowed us now to introduce this \namendment. I am, therefore, honored to move its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend, Senator Lieberman, \nfor the privilege of working with him on an issue that I think is of \nsome importance. I appreciate again the fact that he moved this \nlegislation through the committee of which he is chairman. At that \ntime, the debate and the discussion lent weight to the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  We are simply seeking a commission to investigate all of the factors \nthat led to the tragic events of September 11. We believe there is more \nthan an intelligence aspect of this scenario that needs to be \naddressed. We believe there were a variety of factors that need to be \nmade known to the American people. Whether they be economic, \ndiplomatic, intelligence, there are a number of factors which led up to \nthe tragic events of September 11.\n  Obviously, the lawmakers and those who are involved so far in the \ninvestigation are not satisfied with the information we have received. \nThere is an article in the Washington Post, dated Thursday, September \n19, today, which says in part:\n\n       Lawmakers from both parties yesterday protested the Bush \n     administration's lack of cooperation in the congressional \n     inquiry into September 11 intelligence failures and threaten \n     to renew efforts to establish an independent commission.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       ``Are we getting the cooperation we need? Absolutely not,'' \n     Sen. Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the \n     Senate Intelligence committee said in a joint appearance with \n     Chairman Bob Graham (D-Fla). . . .\n       Graham added: ``What we're trying to do is get people who \n     had hands on these issues. . . .And what we're being told is: \n     no, they don't want to make those kind of witnesses \n     available.''\n       Both Graham and Shelby yesterday endorsed the idea of \n     independent panels. In his remarks at the start of the \n     hearings, Shelby warned that ``there may come a day very soon \n     when it will become apparent that ours must be only a prelude \n     to further inquiries.''\n       Shelby acknowledged that the congressional probe would be \n     incomplete. ``I'm afraid if we try to publish at the end of \n     this session a definitive paper on what we found, that there \n     will be things that we don't know because we hadn't had time \n     to probe them and we have cooperation.''\n\n  I quote Senators Shelby and Graham because they are two of the most \nrespected Members of this body, the chairman and ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee, both highly regarded in all areas but \nparticularly in carrying out their responsibilities as members of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I go back for a second to the issue of what brought about September \n11. I will give an example of a factor that needs to be examined which \nhas nothing to do with any secret information or intelligence \ninformation.\n  In 1989, with the active help of the United States of America and our \nallies, the then-Soviet Union was driven out of Afghanistan. At that \npoint in time, we, as a policy, the United States of America, turned \nour back on Afghanistan. We provided very little assistance, we paid \nvery little attention, except to celebrate a great victory for the \nthen-Afghan freedom fighters.\n  We all know what transpired in the ensuing 10 to 11 years. The \nGovernment of Afghanistan basically became a series of fighting \nwarlords, and chaos prevailed throughout the Nation, and up came, as \nhappens in history, a group called the Taliban that promised order to \nthe people of Afghanistan. Over time they welcomed the Taliban and, of \ncourse, the Taliban assumed power. As part of their regime, they not \nonly allowed but encouraged and provided help and assistance--all this \nis a matter of public record--to Osama bin\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\nLaden. It was well known that Osama bin Laden maintained and built his \nterrorist training camps there, his financial network, and was the \nbreeding ground for the terrorists, including those who hijacked the \nairplanes on September 11.\n  What is it that led the United States of America to make a policy \ndecision that what happened in Afghanistan was not of sufficient \nconcern to the United States of America and our policymakers to \nintervene at any time as this scenario unfolded? That is just one \nexample of the areas that need to be explored.\n  Where was the economic aid? Did the United States of America, because \nof a variety of reasons, not encourage or even countenance the behavior \nof the Saudi Government? The Saudi Government, as we all know, is \nfunding the Madrasas. They are giving money to the Islamic extremists \nwho recruit young Middle Eastern men off the streets and teach them to \nhate the United States of America, our culture, our values, the West. \nIndeed, 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11 were Saudi citizens. \nThey were not uneducated. Many of them, as we all know, had received \npilot training in the United States of America.\n  Why did the United States fail to realize that the Saudis, in the \nguise, perhaps, of being the guardians of the most sacred places of the \nMuslim Islamic religion, were funding very generously these radical \nIslamic elements whose influence spread all over the Middle East?\n  There was a tragic bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. \nWhat was the reaction of the United States to that, beside an eventual \nvery rapid withdrawal from Beirut?\n  The U.S.S. Cole, in port in Yemen, was attacked by Islamic \nextremists. U.S. Embassies all over the world were attacked. What was \nthe response of the United States to those tragedies?\n  My point is there is a broad variety of issues that need to be \naddressed. Those issues, as credible as the U.S. Congress is, need to \nbe examined by the most respected people in the United States of \nAmerica--men and women who have spent their entire lives in public \nservice and are highly regarded by the American people whose assessment \nand evaluation and, most importantly, recommendations will be given \nenormous credibility by the Congress of the United States, the \nPresident of the United States and, most importantly, the people of the \nUnited States, who still are confused as to how these events came about \nto their great surprise, astonishment, and sorrow.\n  The makeup of the commission should be of the most respected people \nin America. Exactly who appoints who--the President, the majority \nleader--we have a formula in our bill, but we are willing to negotiate \nthat. In a bipartisan spirit, we can select the most respected people \nin America to serve on this commission.\n  But let's have no doubt that a commission is called for, just as a \ncommission was called for following December 7, 1941, when Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt felt that the United States of America was not too \nbusy to appoint a commission to examine the events that led up to what \nhe called the day that will live in infamy.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman. I will quote from several articles that \nappeared in the newspapers in previous days that are bound to ratchet \nup concern and, in some cases, the frustration of the American people \nabout this issue.\n  L.A. Times headline: U.S. Overlooked Terrorism Signs Well Before \nSeptember 11:\n\n       A House-Senate panel report says al-Qaida was focusing on a \n     domestic attack and the use of planes as far back as the mid-\n     1990s.\n\n  New York Times editorial, September 19, 2002, ``While America \nSlept'':\n\n       The initial findings of a Congressional committee that has \n     been reviewing the performance of America's intelligence \n     agencies before Sept. 11 are profoundly disturbing. While the \n     investigation has not found that the agencies collected \n     information pointing to the date and targets of the attacks, \n     it has discovered reports that Osama bin Laden and his \n     followers hoped to hit sites in the United States and that \n     they might employ commercial airliners as weapons. The \n     response of spy organizations--and the government at large--\n     was anemic.\n       One of the great unanswered questions has been whether the \n     government had enough intelligence in the months before Sept. \n     11 to fear an imminent blow within the United States and to \n     take aggressive steps to heighten security, especially at \n     airports. The answer now appears to be affirmative. \n     Investigators working for the Senate and House intelligence \n     committees found numerous reports in the archives of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency and other spy organizations \n     suggesting that the bin Laden network was eager to mount \n     attacks within the United States.\n\n  One of the articles here from USA Today is entitled ``Intelligence \nFails.'' It is very curious:\n\n       Almost 3 years before the September 11 attacks, CIA \n     Director George Tenet sent a memo to his deputies. ``We are \n     at war against Osama bin Laden. I want no resources or people \n     spared in this effort.''\n\n  I want to repeat what CIA Director George Tenet sent in a memo 3 \nyears prior to September 11:\n\n       We are at war. . . . I want no resources or people spared \n     in this effort.\n\n  But the article goes on to say that, by the morning of September 11, \nthe war effort had yet to be mounted.\n\n       According to a report released Wednesday by the House and \n     Senate in their first public hearing. . . . Lawmakers \n     revealed CIA's Counterterrorism Center had just five analysts \n     assigned full time to tracking bin Laden's network. The FBI \n     put one lone al-Qaida analyst assigned to the agency's \n     international terrorist unit. A lack of attention devoted to \n     al-Qaida before 9/11 helps explain why the $30 billion a year \n     spent on intelligence did not turn up the terrorist plot.\n       But the report raises new questions about the failure of \n     the FBI and CIA to redirect resources from cold war enemies \n     to new age terrorists.\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       Despite DCI's declaration of war in 1998, there was no \n     massive shift in budget or reassignment of personnel to \n     counterterrorism until after September 11.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles I just quoted from be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          While America Slept\n\n       The initial findings of a Congressional committee that has \n     been reviewing the performance of America's intelligence \n     agencies before Sept. 11 are profoundly disturbing.

There were also warnings \n     that terrorists were considering using airplanes.\n       The accumulation of alarming evidence led George Tenet, the \n     director of central intelligence, to tell his top aides in \n     December 1998 that ``we are at war'' with Osama bin Laden and \n     ``I want no resources or people spared in this effort.'' That \n     was exactly the right reaction, but the mobilization of \n     resources that followed did not match the threat.\n       The Congressional investigators learned that almost no one \n     at the Federal Bureau of Investigation was aware of Mr. \n     Tenet's declaration of war. On Sept. 11, the F.B.I.'s \n     international terrorism unit had just one analyst to deal \n     with Al Qaeda. Even the C.I.A. itself did not make major \n     readjustments to evaluate the threat. The agency increased \n     the number of analysts assigned full time to the bin Laden \n     network from three in 1999 to five in 2001 before the \n     attacks. Despite the indications that airliners might be used \n     as weapons, including one August 1998 report that terrorists \n     might fly a plane into the World Trade Center, intelligence \n     analyst apparently made little effort to assess the aerial \n     threat. The Federal Aviation Administration did not take the \n     threat seriously.\n       Since Sept. 11, the C.I.A., F.B.I. and other agencies have \n     poured resources into the fight against terrorism, and \n     addressed many of the inadequacies depicted in the \n     Congressional study. The findings underscore the urgent need \n     for greater alertness, more coordination between agencies and \n     the recognition that intelligence agencies must constantly be \n     looking not just for familiar threats but also for new and \n     unexpected methods of attacking America.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                           intelligence fails\n\n       As the massive FBI investigation uncovers more details of \n     the scope, complexity and long-term planning behind the Sept. \n     11 terrorist attacks, it is revealing an equally massive \n     failure in the nation's counterintelligence efforts.\n       Earlier this week, the FBI suggested that two more planes \n     might have been targeted for hijacking. That's on top of what \n     is already known--that more than a dozen terrorists spent \n     years training and preparing for the attack inside the USA, \n     almost certainly with the help of many more accomplices. How \n     could so many terrorists operate for so long in the U.S. \n     piecing together a complex attack plan without detection?\n       President Bush took the first much-needed step to \n     addressing that question Thursday with a call for a new \n     Cabinet-level homeland-defense agency. It is a recognition of \n     what many terrorism experts have long seen as a key weakness \n     in national security, one that has left the country not just \n     scrambling to piece together the Sept. 11 attack, but also \n     wondering whether the nation's counterterrorism efforts will \n     be able to detect the next attack before it is launched.\n       The nation's checkered history of tracking Osama bin Laden \n     and anticipating the evil deeds later linked to his network \n     is anything but reassuring.\n       Since the U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya in \n     1998, the government has claimed that it is taking \n     substantial efforts to root out bin Laden's terrorist \n     network. As recently as June of this year, the CIA and Senate \n     Intelligence Committee members were reassuring the public \n     that bin Laden was being kept ``off balance'' and ``on the \n     run.'' Yet this diligence didn't detect or deter either the \n     Sept. 11 tragedies or the October suicide bombing of the USS \n     Cole in Yemen, both of which were only later linked to bin \n     Laden's terrorist network.\n       These missteps come as no surprise to terrorism experts. In \n     recent years, studies by those inside and outside government \n     have repeatedly warned that the intelligence system, built \n     during the Cold War, was ill-suited to counter the modern \n     terrorist threat. The focus was too much on monitoring troop \n     movements and acquiring hardware and spying technology, not \n     utilizing the kind of human intelligence needed to penetrate \n     multinational, loosely organized terror cells.\n       Responsibilities have been spread across several federal \n     agencies that don't always coordinate. As a December 2000 \n     RAND report put it, the nation's anti-terrorism program ``is \n     fragmented, uncoordinated and politically unaccountable.''\n       At the same time, reports were detailing the growing threat \n     of massive attacks posed by rogue terrorists. The spread of \n     technology made greater levels of destruction possible, and \n     the advance of religious fanaticism made use of it more \n     likely. As a June 2000 National Commission on Terrorism \n     report noted, ``today's terrorists seek to inflict mass \n     casualties, and they are attempting to do so both overseas \n     and on American soil.''\n       With all efforts now devoted to tracking down leads in the \n     wake of the Sept. 11 attack, law enforcement and intelligence \n     communities have little time to analyze their failings. As \n     CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield put it Tuesday, the agency \n     ``won't be distracted'' by criticism.\n       That's fine. Their failings will get plenty of airing in \n     Congress and elsewhere. The Senate Intelligence Committee has \n     already promised hearings on the failure to detect the \n     suicide hijackings.\n       More important, though, is that problems identified in \n     these postmortems should be corrected. Recommendations made \n     in the wake of previous attacks tended to result in piecemeal \n     reforms. What's needed is a wholesale review of how the U.S. \n     collects, studies and uses foreign and domestic intelligence. \n     Preferably with an eye toward better coordination.\n       In this context, Bush's new Cabinet position makes perfect \n     sense.\n       There are almost certainly other terrorist plots in the \n     works designed to take advantage of previously identified \n     weaknesses in the system.\n       Finding out who perpetrated the unimaginable horror \n     inflicted on the U.S. last week is important. Preventing any \n     future attacks on U.S. citizens is critical.\n\n  Madam President, there is an editorial from the Weekly Standard, \n``Time For An Investigation.''\n\n       If President Bush knows what's good for the country--and we \n     think he does--he will immediately appoint an independent, \n     blue-ribbon commission to investigate the government's \n     failure to anticipate and adequately prepare for the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11. Make George Shultz and Sam \n     Nunn co-chairmen. Give the commission full and unfettered \n     access to all intelligence from the CIA and FBI and to all \n     relevant internal administration documents.\n\n  This is a very important point in this commission. This commission \nmust have access to all relevant documents. I think the frustration \narticulated by Senators Shelby and Graham cannot be a part of this \nindependent commission.\n\n       There are three reasons such an investigation is necessary. \n     First, the administration is now in danger of looking as if \n     it has engaged in a cover-up. The carefully worded and \n     evasive statements by various administration spokesmen in \n     response to the report of the president's August 6 CIA \n     briefing have raised as many questions as they have answered. \n     We understand the conundrum that administration spokesmen \n     face. They can't be precise about what they did or didn't \n     know without revealing classified information. We also \n     presume the administration has nothing to hide. But the cat \n     is out of the bag. The ranking Republican on the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee, Richard Shelby, says that ``we've \n     just scratched the surface.'' The country needs to be assured \n     that a reputable and unbiased group is going beneath the \n     surface to find the truth.\n       Nor can we assume that the investigation already in \n     progress by a special joint congressional committee will do \n     the trick. Given the vulgar partisanship into which most \n     elected officials descended last week, we have no confidence \n     that any congressional committee can come up with a reputable \n     and authoritative report.\n       Furthermore, regardless of what congress does, the \n     president should order an investigation for the sake of \n     accountability within the executive branch.\n\n  I think my colleagues and the American people may know that not one \nperson has been replaced, removed, fired, asked to resign, retire or \nheld responsible for the events of September 11--remarkable. \nRemarkable.\n\n       Ever since September 11 we have been troubled and puzzled \n     that almost no one in the government seems to have been held \n     responsible--much less, heaven forbid, stepped forward to \n     assume responsibility--for failure. Was what happened on \n     September 11 the consequence of everyone doing their job \n     perfectly? Can it really be that no one made a mistake? And \n     if someone did make a mistake, shouldn't that someone be held \n     accountable, just a little? People lose jobs in government \n     for hiring nannies and forgetting to pay their taxes. In the \n     military, officers resign when something goes wrong on their \n     watch, even if they were personally blameless for what \n     happened. Isn't it possible that some people should be \n     reprimanded, or even lose their jobs, when 3,000 Americans \n     are killed in a terrorist attach? For the past eight months \n     the Bush administration has essentially been saying that \n     everything and everyone worked just fine. That is absurd and \n     unsustainable.\n       And, of course, it's perilous. The third reason we need an \n     investigation is that the system did not work. Either we \n     didn't have the intelligence we should have had before \n     September 11. Or the information was not adequately \n     distributed and therefore key signals were missed. Or the \n     intelligence was assembled but wasn't taken seriously enough. \n     Or it was taken seriously but insufficient action was taken \n     to prevent an attack. We don't know there the system broke \n     down. We only now that it did.\n       Surely the first step in fixing the system--and thereby \n     defending ourselves against the next attack [and that is \n     really what this commission is about, fix the system and \n     defend ourselves from the next attack] is to identify what \n     went wrong or who performed badly. Isn't anyone troubled by \n     the fact that if the failure stemmed partly from \n     incompetence, then the incompetent people are still at their \n     vitally important posts? Isn't President Bush troubled? If it \n     was the system that failed, then should that same system be \n     left in place because no one is willing to take a hard look \n     at how and why it failed?\n       We understand the administration's reluctance to go through \n     this wrenching process. We understand, too, why the \n     president's supporters are reluctant to demand an \n     investigation. It was nauseating last week to watch \n     Democratic politicians trying to score cheap points against \n     President Bush, treating this most serious of questions as if \n     it were another made-to-order Washington scandal. ``What we \n     have to do now is to find out what the president, what the \n     White House, knew about the vents leading up to 9/11, when \n     they knew it, and, most importantly, what was done about it \n     at that time,'' said Dick Gephardt smarmily, desperately \n     trying to fasten blame on the president a la Watergate.\n       Unfortunately, the Bush administration, too, has gone into \n     scandal mode--into a defensive crouch. Vice President Dick \n     Cheney came out swinging, claiming that any criticism, even a \n     call for an investigation of the administration's actions \n     before September 11, was ``thoroughly irresponsible . . . in \n     a time of war.'' But he's wrong. It's precisely because we're \n     in a war that we need an investigation to find out where we \n     failed. After Pearl Harbor, there were half a dozen such \n     investigations. Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the first--just \n     after Pearl harbor. President Bush should follow that war \n     president's lead. Then he should get back to the business of \n     winning the war.\n\n  Again, I believe everyone who is responsible for anything, as a \nmatter of public service, should be held responsible. That is obvious. \nBut the reason why Senator Lieberman and I have fought so hard is \nbecause the American people deserve to know one fundamental fact; that \nis, that we know all of the factors and causes of the tragedy of \nSeptember 11. Once we know all of those factors and causes, we will \nthen be able to take the necessary action to prevent a repetition.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n  I don't know how in the world we can assure the American people that \nthere will not be a repetition unless we know everything that caused \nit. That seems to me so obvious on its face that that alone is a \ncompelling reason for the appointment of this commission.\n  I have had the great honor, as have most Members of this body, to \nhave the opportunity to know the family members and survivors of those \nwho perished or were wounded in the tragic events of September 11. They \nhave come to me and to Senator Lieberman and many other Members of this \nbody and said: We deserve to know. We deserve to know what happened \nthat brought about the deaths of our loved ones.\n  They make a very compelling case. They make an argument that I think \nis hard to refute. We owe them a great debt because of the service and \nsacrifice of many of their loved ones. Incredible feats of heroism, as \nwe all know, were performed on September 11. I hope we will give some \nweight to their opinions and desires. I think it is perfectly \nlegitimate and understandable that they have a right to know what \ncaused the events that took away their husbands, fathers, wives, sons, \ndaughters, brothers, sisters, and friends.\n  I hope we can get a large majority vote so we can go to conference \nwith the House, get this commission appointed, and give them the tools \nthey need to make sure we appoint in a nonpartisan--not bipartisan, \nnonpartisan--fashion the members of this committee who are the most \nrespected men and women in America. We could come up with a list in a \nvery short period of time, give them the tools they need, and within a \nreasonable length of time they could report back to the President, to \nthe Congress, and, most importantly, to the American people.\n  In that way, as far as those who lost loved ones in the tragic 9/11 \nattacks are concerned, at least they may have some comfort in the \nknowledge that we will be prepared to take whatever necessary steps to \nensure that no other family member ever experiences the tragic loss \nthey experienced.\n  I hope we can discuss this issue at the proper length.\n  I again thank my friend from Connecticut. I see my friend Senator \nThompson on the floor, who probably knows as much as or more than, on \nmany of these issues, any Member of this body. I am obviously very \ninterested in hearing his views on this legislation.\n  Finally, I say again that this legislation is not carved in stone. \nSenator Lieberman and I are willing to make adjustments to it. We are \nwilling to take input from the administration or any of our colleagues \nor anyone else who is concerned about it. That is why we have the \namending process. But we also think we ought to get it done, and we \nalso think that time is not on our side because the sooner we get the \nresults of this commission, the sooner we can take the necessary \nmeasures to defend against a repetition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Arizona for \na very eloquent statement. I thank him for the work we have done \ntogether on this proposal. I also thank him for clarifying something \nabout which I misspoke. I said there had only been one analyst at the \nCIA committed to targeting al-Qaida even after al-Qaida had been \ndetermined to be the source of terrorism against us in a very committed \nact. In fact, there were five--still not a significant enough number--\nin the counterterrorism center of the CIA, and one analyst at the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  For the record, the amendment we have offered today differs in a few \nrespects from the bill reported out of committee.\n  We are calling for an even division between Republicans and Democrats \nin choosing commission members. As Senator McCain said, I certainly \nhope this is a nonpartisan commission--not even bipartisan--with the \nmajority parties of the Senate and House each receiving three picks and \nthe minority parties in each House having two nominations. This is the \nconfiguration of an equivalent commission recently created by the House \nof Representatives. And it has another notable precedent in the form of \na National Commission on Terrorism created by Congress in 1999 headed \nby former Ambassador Paul Bremer, which produced some work that had an \neffect on our foreign policy.\n  There are three other minor changes in the text of our original bill. \nThe bill emphasizes that the commission should build on the progress of \nCongress and its committees, and other inquiries, especially the joint \ninquiry of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees regarding \nterrorist attacks.\n  I hope they will come to the floor and speak for themselves. But I \nwant to say that Senator Gramm, chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nof the Senate, and Senator Shelby, vice chairman, have each said to \nme--although originally earlier in the hearings--that they have some \nconcerns but now fully support the creation of the commission that this \namendment would bring about.\n  The amendment, as we have submitted it, provides that the chair and \nthe vice chair of the commission, in addition to the chairpersons, can \nissue subpoenas. And it makes technical improvements to the bill's \nalternative subpoena enforcement mechanism.\n  I wanted my colleagues to know that there have been those changes \nfrom the bill as it came out of our committee, and to echo what Senator \nMcCain has said. This is an idea. It is an idea that we believe is a \nnecessity, in the public interest, to answer the plaintive cries of the \nfamilies of those who died on September 11: How did this happen? And \nhow can we know everything that is possible to know so we can make sure \nit never happens again?\n  But as to the specific details, we welcome the questions and \ninquiries of the Members of the Senate before this amendment comes to a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while the two sponsors of this amendment \nare in the Chamber, and the two managers of this bill, we have had a \nnumber of inquiries in the cloakrooms about what the rest of the day is \ngoing to hold. There is the question of whether or not we will have any \nmore votes tonight.\n  I know the Senator from Tennessee has looked at the proposed \nunanimous consent request, which basically would give several hours of \ndebate on this amendment today and an hour set aside for Monday to \ncomplete debate on it and vote on it on Monday. But I am wondering, \nwithout pressing the Senator from Tennessee too hard, could the Senator \ngive us some indication when he might be in the position to see if we \ncan enter into this unanimous consent request so we can better field \nthe questions in the cloakrooms?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am not sure exactly what is in the unanimous consent \nrequest. But I can possibly be a little bit more definitive after we \nhave had a chance to discuss what is going on here.\n  Mr. REID. What it simply says is that there would be a total of \nprobably 3 hours for debate equally divided, and then we would come \nback on Monday and debate it for another hour. At that time, the Senate \nwould vote in relation to the amendment. There would be no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the disposition of the amendment.\n  It is very simple and direct. But we are trying to get something set \nup for tomorrow and Monday. We have left a lot of Senators without any \ndirection. We need to do that. As soon as the Senator from Tennessee \nfeels confident that we can enter this agreement, let us know, and we \nwill do that as quickly as possible. If we can do that, I think the \nleader will be in a position to announce that there will be no more \nvotes tonight. Until that happens, we can't do that.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be happy to respond to the Senator a little \nlater this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity, while I \nhave two of my close friends and respected Members who are sponsoring \nthis amendment here on the floor, to hopefully enter into a discussion \nunder the rules of the Senate and with the consent of our colleagues as \nto some of the details of this proposal, as to what is\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\nintended, as to what we are trying to accomplish, and as to whether or \nnot this is the best way to accomplish it.\n  I commend my colleagues for their effort. I think they have had for a \nlong time the idea of a commission--a long time before a lot of other \npeople who are now calling for one. They have had this vision. Quite \nfrankly, I have tried to keep an open mind with regard to the wisdom of \nit. I sit on the Intelligence Committee. Right now, we are having \nbipartisan and bicameral hearings with regard to many issues, some of \nwhich have to do with 9/11.\n  I ask my colleagues--either or both of them--how they view the role \nof the commission with regard to the intelligence issues.\n  I am wondering whether we could probe very deeply and successfully \ninto what happened with regard to 9/11, including any intelligence \nbreakdown, and still come away with a not very good analysis of the \ndifficulties we are having in the intelligence community.\n  Is it the best thing to do to have a commission that has a rather \nbroad mandate with regard to anything and everything and at any level \nof Government with regard to September 11 of which intelligence would \nbe a part? Is that better than maybe a deeper probe that is more \nnarrowly focused with regard to our intelligence failures? Because most \nof us believe that is at the heart of the difficulties we saw in \nrelation to September 11.\n  I have had the opportunity to read the amendment once. I notice the \nfunctions of the commission are to conduct investigations that may \ninclude relevant facts relating to intelligence agencies. But \n``intelligence agencies'' is mentioned, along with a lot of other \nagencies: ``law enforcement agencies;'' ``immigration, nonimmigrant \nvisas, and border control;'' ``the flow of assets to terrorist \norganizations;'' and other areas of concern that are not agencies, such \nas ``commercial aviation'' and ``diplomacy.'' I am not sure what that \nmeans.\n  But I would ask my colleagues what went into their thinking, what is \nthe state of their thinking with regard to that issue. Is it best to \nhave the broader scope that might trip lightly over intelligence \nissues? Would that be better than having a more detailed and narrow \ninquiry as to intelligence failures?\n  I would ask my friend from Arizona what his thinking is with regard \nto that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman, Senator Thompson, and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy \nfor the exchange of comments to one another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank you, Madam President.\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee, first of all, our amendment \nexplicitly states--and we would be glad to report language, with the \nassistance of the Senator from Tennessee, to point out that clearly \nintelligence is a central and perhaps most important aspect of any \ninvestigation of this nature. The Senator mentioned that there are a \nnumber of other factors we would want to take into consideration.\n  While the Senator was off the floor, I pointed out that we turned our \nback on Afghanistan after 1989. What were the reasons for that? And \nwhat were the diplomatic or national security factors that led to that \ndecision being made?\n  However, having said that, it is clear intelligence plays a featured \nrole in any investigation. But I am also a little bit concerned--and I \nwonder if the Senator from Tennessee is concerned--about a report in \nthe Washington Post where, ``[Senator] Shelby acknowledged that the \ncongressional probe would be incomplete. `I'm afraid if we try to \npublish at the end of this session a definitive paper on what we found, \nthat there will be some things that we don't know because we hadn't had \ntime to probe them and we have not had enough cooperation,' he said.''\n  As I respond, I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee has that \nconcern, as expressed by Senator Shelby.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would say, in response, that I indeed have had that \nconcern as that investigation has gone along. And we have seen the \nvarious problems we have had with it and the various difficulties we \nhave had internally and externally, and with the time limitation we \nplaced on ourselves in this intelligence investigation. And I was \nconcerned a long time about where we were going to end up and whether \nwe were going to be in a position of assuring the American people that \nwe had done more than we had really done.\n\n  I will have more to say on that later. I still want to keep my powder \nas dry as I can for as long as I can because it is ongoing and hope \nsprings eternal.\n  But I certainly do have concern about that, which gets me back to my \noriginal concern about where intelligence ought to play in this \ninquiry.\n  I appreciate the Senator's reassurance with regard to that, and its \nimportance and, perhaps, central function, central role. But I wonder; \nit concerns me when I see that put together with immigration issues, \nand aviation issues, and diplomacy issues.\n  For example, I would be interested and would like, if we could get \nthe right kind of people and the right kind of objectivity, to have a \nsession as to our policies with regard to reaction ever since the \nbombings in Beirut, to the attack on the USS Cole, to the events in \nSomalia, and all of that.\n  What effect did all of that have on all of this? Did that embolden \npeople around the world, who have ill intent toward us, to do some of \nthese things? Those are very interesting, important issues. But can we \ntake on all of that within--what do we have here?--a year's timeframe \nfor this investigation?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator, a total of 18 months, with \na preliminary report due after 6 months.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. All right. Well, that is more than the Intelligence \nCommittee has had. I must concede that. But the question really is, Can \nwe do all of that? We are combining some things that would be very \nsubjective, very politically sensitive. Hopefully, we will have the \nkind of people on this commission to be able the deal with that, along \nwith some very detailed inquiry with regard to the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Is that the best way to go? Can we really hope that at the end of the \nday we have been able to do all of that?\n  That leads me to my second question, I suppose, and that is in regard \nto access to information. As I read through this, there is a provision \nfor ``Information From Federal Agencies'' for this commission. On page \n9 of the amendment, it says:\n\n       The Commission is authorized to secure directly from any \n     executive department, bureau, agency, board, commission, \n     office, independent establishment, or instrumentality of the \n     Government information, suggestions, estimates, and \n     statistics for the purposes of this title.\n\n  I am not sure that--let's just say for the purposes of this \ndiscussion--having access with regard to intelligence agencies, with \nregard to suggestions, estimates, and statistics would do us very much \ngood.\n  Now, the right kind of information would be helpful, but is the \nintent here that this commission will be able to go into these \nagencies, regardless of what they are?\n  Also, you have another provision in here that provides for clearance \nand providing access to people with sensitive information.\n  But is the intention to provide the members and/or staff of this \nagency with the authority and the ability to go into these agencies and \nto review the most sensitive information?\n  I think back to the Rumsfeld Commission, which I think most people \nwould agree was a very successful enterprise, dealing with issues of \nmissile technology and nuclear capability of various countries, and so \nforth, very sensitive information. It was done successfully.\n  A lot of these people were scientists and the same kind of people, \nperhaps, in many respects that your commission would adopt. They have \ndone that very successfully. I am wondering if someone some months \nhence would read this document and say: We did not intend to do that. \nWhatever reports are out there, analyze those reports. But we didn't \nhave any intention for you going in and really getting something that \nthey didn't want to give you.\n  I think that is relevant because apparently we still have to make the \nWhite House a believer that this is a good idea. I am wondering, in \nterms of\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\nthe wording of the bill or legislative history, what would be the \nproper way to address that question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I will respond to the Senator from \nTennessee. I thank my friend for his very thoughtful and directly \nrelevant questions.\n  I will try to respond to the first one very briefly and add to what \nthe Senator from Arizona said.\n  The commission is given a broad mandate, in section 604 of this \nproposal, to conduct an investigation of all relevant facts and \ncircumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \nand then it goes on to say, that ``may'' include relevant facts and \ncircumstances relating to, first, intelligence agencies, and then all \nthe rest. Obviously, intelligence is listed first, though I emphasize \nthe ``may.''\n  This commission has discretionary authority to go ahead as it will \ndecide to conduct a very broad investigation called for under that \nsection A that I read from. I certainly hope they will do some work on \nthe intelligence community, building on the work the joint intelligence \ncommittee has done.\n  The uniqueness of our proposal is to have it be more comprehensive, \nto get into exactly the kind of broader questions that may seem remote \nbut are not, about what impact the USS Cole and Somalia, et cetera, had \non both our foreign policy and the attitudes of others abroad that may \nhave all contributed to what happened on September 11. The breadth is \nvery important.\n  We are trying to build a complementary structure because if you want \nto end this commission's work feeling that you asked every question \nthat could have been asked about how September 11 happened, there would \nhave to be a lot of questions about intelligence agencies but a lot as \nwell about things that may seem remote, like commercial aviation \npolicies or immigration policies. That is what the intent is.\n  I do want to respond to the second question, which is very important. \nIt seems to me this commission will not be able to successfully \ncomplete its work unless it has full access to all the relevant \ndocuments in our Government. That is why we have required in the \nwording of the proposal that the various departments expeditiously \nrespond to requests for security clearances by members of the \ncommission and their staffs.\n  There was an earlier time when some criticized the idea for this \ncommission, saying it might be a circus; I guess on the presumption \nthat it would all be in public. That is not our intention.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Do you provide for closed hearings?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is right. The legislation provides for closed \nhearings. It is my guess that most of the work of this commission, \nthough not all of it, would be done in closed classified \ninvestigations. But some of it, hopefully, presumably, would be done in \npublic, certainly to engage public testimony at various points.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have one additional comment for my friend from \nTennessee. One, I believe some of these hearings have to be held in a \nclassified environment. There is just too much raw data out there. I \nbelieve the Warren Commission, in their investigations, held closed \nmeetings as well.\n  I also want to say to the Senator from Tennessee, he was an integral \npart, as all of us know, in probably the most successful and best known \ninvestigation in this century. That, of course, was the Watergate \ncommittee. There are certain parallels, there are certain nonparallels, \nobviously, because we are dealing with different issues. But I know the \nSenator from Tennessee learned a number of lessons from the Watergate \nhearings. Those that apply to this legislation that he thinks could \nimprove our efforts and get a better product--we now will have that \nvote on Monday, I understand--I would be eager to work up an amendment \nor amendments with the help of the Senator from Tennessee to bring this \ncommission to the quality and level which would achieve the goals that \nwe seek.\n  I would like to engage in those discussions, if we could.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate that very much. I would ask, just \nnarrowing down a little bit more, how do my colleagues see the work of \nthis commission in relation to the work of the joint intelligence \ncommittee?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from Tennessee--another very \nimportant question--it is the intention of the sponsors that the work \nof this commission build on and complement the work of the joint \nintelligence committee in investigating the events of September 11, \n2001. The joint intelligence committee has done some very important \nwork. It already produced some material, just yesterday released \npublicly, that was riveting and in its way raised an additional set of \nquestions to be answered either by the committee and its later \ninvestigation or by this commission.\n  Again, the purview, the focus of the commission we intend to create \nis much broader and would build on what the joint committee on \nintelligence has done but then go into other areas we talked about: \nDefense, foreign policy, immigration policy, law enforcement, \ncommercial aviation, et cetera.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to my colleague, it seems to me the situation is \nbasically this: We have concerns, some with regard to our intelligence \ncommunity and our intelligence difficulties; some have to do with \nnonintelligence areas. We have talked about the area of diplomacy and \naction and reaction to attacks, for example. We have a committee that \nis about to wind up its work dealing with the intelligence area. I \nthink many people are very concerned that they are not going to get to \nthe heart of the issue.\n  Your commission would come along and overlay that and take up where \nthat leaves off but would have quite a bit broader mandate. It makes me \nwonder whether you really could pick up where they leave off and do the \nsame kind of job they would have done had they been in business for a \nwhile longer, which leads me to the additional question: Has my friend \nconsidered--I haven't discussed this with anyone because it just \noccurred to me--whether or not it might be wise to extend the inquiry \nof the joint intelligence committee? We placed an end-of-the-year \nlimitation on this. We had the first, I guess you might say, \nsubstantive public hearing yesterday. We know about how much longer we \nare going to be around here from a practical standpoint in terms of \nMembers.\n  I don't think anybody wants a result and a report that is totally \nstaff driven. It is not even a permanent staff. It is a very good \nstaff, assembled from various places. Some of us know who these people \nare and some of us don't. But on something this important, with this \nkind of time limitation, there is going to be an awful lot of \nuneasiness about all of that.\n  I have some uneasiness about the ability of this commission to just \npick up from there and go on, when we are considering these other broad \ncategories that perhaps need to be considered, either in a commission \nor otherwise. I am not sure. But one of the things that occurs to me--I \ndon't see why we would shy away from putting it on the table and \ntalking about it--is perhaps extending the joint committee's work into \nnext year.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding again to my friend from Tennessee, let me \ndirect myself to the first part of your question. If this commission \nfunctions as its sponsors want it to, this national commission on \nterrorist attacks upon the United States, it will have the high-quality \ncommissioners devoted to its work, as well as a large, first-rate staff \nthat will have the capability both to pick up the work in the \nintelligence community and carry it as far as it can be carried forward \nto answer all relevant questions relating to the causes of September \n11, but also to investigate the other subject matter areas we have \ntalked about--diplomacy, law enforcement, aviation policy, et cetera.\n\n  Of course, the question of whether the Intelligence Committee \ninvestigation goes on is a separate question. And this commission idea \nstands on its own. I am encouraged, as I mentioned, that the chair and \nvice chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senators Graham of Florida \nand Shelby, both support the establishment of an independent \ncommission. So I conclude they believe its work can be complementary.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleague. Does the Senator from New Jersey \nhave a contribution to make?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I might first note the presence of the Senator from\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\nNew Jersey on the floor, he was an early, outspoken, and passionate \nadvocate for an independent investigation--and I have another \nadjective--persistent. Acting separately, he introduced a bill with \nSenator Grassley, and Senator McCain and I introduced another measure. \nWe all agreed we have the same goals, and we put our two proposals \ntogether.\n  I thank him for his advocacy of this idea, and I am glad he is on the \nfloor. I welcome him now to this discussion.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my friend. Is the Senator from Tennessee \ncontrolling the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, on September 12, 2001, I came to the \nfloor of the Senate to suggest to my colleagues that the magnitude of \nwhat had happened to the United States of America in the terrorist \nattack required an independent analysis and establishment of a national \ncommission of inquiry. I am proud to have led this effort, but it was \nnot either my creation or principally my idea.\n  In New Jersey, a week after the terror of September 11, I began to \nhear from the widows and the families--simple Americans who believe in \ntheir country, pay their taxes, and felt secure behind our borders, \nrecognizing that the United States is the most awesome military power \never assembled on the face of the earth. Intelligence and law \nenforcement services are larger here than in every other nation \ncombined. Just 24 hours before, 19 men with $250,000 had delivered the \nmost devastating attack on these United States in our history.\n  Their inquiry of me as their Senator was simply: What do we tell our \nchildren? What are we to believe about our country and our Government \nthat we were unable to defend our most vulnerable citizens; that \nthousands had been left dead and thousands were orphaned and lives will \nnever be the same again? I did not have any answers to their questions, \nso I brought their questions to my colleagues.\n  It has been a long struggle to bring this commission to this point. I \nam more grateful than I can explain that Senator Lieberman and Senator \nMcCain have taken this effort to the point of legislation and possible \nadoption.\n  No one seeks to cast blame. No one seeks to unfairly lay \nresponsibility upon those who may not deserve it. But something is \nwrong--370 days have passed, after thousands of lives were lost in a \ncomplete and total breakdown of the security of the United States of \nAmerica, and I am unaware that one individual has been transferred, \ndemoted, held responsible, fired, noted, or criticized. It cannot be \nthat the security of the United States was breached, thousands of lives \nwere lost, and every agency performed perfectly, everybody did their \njob, all 1 million Federal employees performed as expected.\n\n  Madam President, I cannot give that explanation to the hundreds of \nwidows or orphans and parents and brothers and sisters in the State of \nNew Jersey who have survived and dealt with the unimaginable. I do not \nsimply hope that this commission is adopted, but that, on a bipartisan \nbasis, Members of this Senate send an unequivocal message that this \nGovernment is accountable, its agencies are accountable, and the \nAmerican people will get answers.\n  It is not that I have come to the floor with a suggestion that is \nsomehow a compromise with our tradition or unusual in our practice. \nThis commission will respond, exactly as every other generation of \nAmericans has responded in every other crisis of similar or lesser \nproportions. This Congress demanded an answer from a commission about \nthe reasons of the causes of the Civil War. They were still collecting \nbodies in the North Atlantic and this Senate went to New York and met \nin midtown Manhattan to get answers for how the Titanic could have \nsunk. The Depression was still ongoing when we demanded a commission \nfor its reasons. And 11 days after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, before the U.S. even counterattacked, wanted the American \npeople to know how their Armed Forces had let them down. He would not \nallow American sons and daughters to die in a war until their parents \nknew what happened to our military, our preparedness, so their parents \nwould know that their lives were in good hands.\n  Lyndon Johnson did no less after the Kennedy assassination, and \nPresident Reagan did no less after the Challenger accident.\n  None of these reports were perfect. It was always a painful \nexperience. None of us ever want to admit that anyone in our \nGovernment, anyone in the service of our country did not perform \nperfectly. The truth is that terrible things happen even when people do \nperform well, and that may be the conclusion of this commission, as it \nhas been with others. I don't know. But the truth is, no Member of the \nSenate knows either. Unless this commission is established, we will \nnever know.\n  The simple truth is the Senate might reject this commission, the \nPresident may fail to sign it, or the House of Representatives may fail \nto adopt it. But that does not mean that there will not be a \ncommission.\n  Sometimes justice is so overwhelming, a cause so obvious and powerful \nthat you can delay it, but you cannot stop it. Defeat this commission \ntoday and it will be voted on next year or the next year--even if it is \n10 years, even if it is 20 years. No event of this magnitude can happen \nin a country, inflicting this much pain, this much change in a society, \nwithout the accountability of its Government. Either the widows and the \nwidowers and the parents of these victims will get this commission or \ntheir children will.\n  Either the Members of the Senate will establish this commission or \nour successors will. But make no mistake about it, there will be \nanswers. Something very wrong happened.\n  Somebody has to provide answers. First, we were told that a \ncommission was impossible because it would interfere with the war in \nAfghanistan. What an extraordinary notion: A nation with a $2 trillion \nbudget, a quarter of a billion people, a million men under arms and \nconfronting al-Qaida in Afghanistan prohibited us from using resources \nor personnel to conduct an investigation--an extraordinary notion, \nconsidering that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was willing to undertake an \ninvestigation while fighting the Germans and the Japanese with \nsufficient resources.\n  Then we were told this was better done in the Intelligence \nCommittee--possibly a good explanation if the only issues of failures \nwere in the intelligence community. What about immigration? How about \nthe FAA? How about law enforcement? How about the coordination of \npolicies to save the lives of those firefighters or police officers? \nHow about 100 other Government agencies? This may be a CIA issue, but \nit is not only a CIA issue. Still the belief was this could be done in \nthe Intelligence Committee. Only now the bipartisan leadership of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Shelby and Senator Graham, report to us \nthat they cannot get cooperation from the necessary Government agencies \nto even conduct their limited review in this narrow focus.\n  How dare they. How dare anyone withhold information or cooperation \nfrom this Senate or the families of the victims who have demanded \nanswers? How dare anyone.\n  Are there those in this Government who believe their principal \nloyalty is to their agency, the reputation of their bureau, someone in \nthe bureaucracy rather than the people of the United States of America? \nDoes it mean so much to be an agent of the CIA, an employee of the FBI, \nor the National Security Agency? Is that so important that you would \nwithhold information from the American people in a search for justice \nfor the United States of America?\n  I have served in institutions, and I believe in institutional \nloyalty, but that means nothing compared to loyalty to the United \nStates of America. Yet we have the spectacle of the bipartisan \nleadership of our Intelligence Committee claiming they cannot get \ncooperation from the bureaucracy itself.\n  There are issues so large in this debate that they can only be \nsettled by an overwhelming vote for this commission. It is about the \naccountability of the Government itself to the people. It is about many \nthings, but most fundamentally it is that: Can the people of the \ncountry hold their Government and its agencies accountable? I do not \nknow.\n  For one of the first times in my life, I am not sure the bureaucracy \nor its\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\ncomponents in the intelligence or law enforcement agencies genuinely \ncan be monitored and controlled by the Congress of the United States. \nBut we are going to find out because that is what this commission is \nabout, more than anything else.\n  One year has passed. Billions of dollars have now been appropriated \nto deal with terrorism and homeland security. The Congress has been \nasked for the most sweeping reorganization of the Government in \nAmerican history. There is not a Member of this Senate who in good \nconscience either cast these votes or can cast votes in the future \nwithout knowing the results of this inquiry. Spend $10 billion, $20 \nbillion, $30 billion. On what basis is the money spent? Is there a \nMember of the Senate who knows which agencies failed, which should be \nimproved, which should be expanded, which should be curtailed, what new \nactivities would make a difference? What is the sum of our knowledge of \nwhat happened on September 11? I do not know. More importantly, neither \ndo the other 99 Members of the Senate, and they will never know until \nwe know what happened, why, who failed and who succeeded, who met their \nresponsibilities, and who did not.\n\n  Does this reorganization, the underlying legislation before the \nSenate, make sense for the country? Mr. President, I am going to be \nasked to vote upon that issue and, in good conscience, I cannot tell \nyou. On what basis is this reorganization done? Because we have learned \nwhich agencies did not perform?\n  It is no different than the financial recommendations. There is not a \nMember of the Senate who knows which agencies were not in control, \nwhich were, which met their responsibilities, how a chain of command \nmight have been different. Some day we will know but not without this \ncommission.\n  What we are learning about the failures of intelligence and law \nenforcement since September 11 is shocking. Naming a national \ncommission dealing with the realities of what happened is going to be a \npainful national experience.\n  We now know that the CIA had advised the FBI of the names of a \nhundred terrorists and to watch for their entry into the United States. \nThey failed. We now know as early as 1998 intelligence agencies \nreceived information about Bin Laden planning an attack involving \naircraft in New York and Washington.\n  We now know, as late as July 2001, the National Security Agency \nreported 33 communications involving a possible and imminent terrorist \nattack. We now know the U.S. Government was put on notice by foreign \nintelligence agencies and our own of the possibility of such attack.\n  This will be a painful national experience--painful for the country, \npainful for the families. But this problem is not going away. Time will \nnot heal it. The distance between ourselves and the events will not \nlessen the intensity of the need or the demand for the inquiry.\n  I want nothing but the truth for the families, the communities in my \nState of New Jersey which have suffered so badly, and mostly for my \ncountry. The U.S. Government failed our people. It does not mean that \nwe are not a good people or that this is not a great Government, but \ngood and great governments learn by experiences and their failures. We \ncan be a better country better able to protect our people with a more \naccountable Government, with intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nthat understand their responsibilities and their needs based on this \nprocess.\n  It will be a painful process of growth, but it will happen. We will \nlearn how it is that the FBI, given all these warnings, could not have \nhad people who were possibly trained in Arabic translation, how piles \nof documents may have accumulated having never been analyzed. We will \nlearn how information about flight schools and the possible warnings of \nthe ill intent of its students never came to proper attention.\n  We will learn how over the course of years a conspiracy was built, \nsignals were received, but we were unable to see the dimensions of a \nplot that would so change our country.\n  Put aside your loyalties to institutions. Put aside your commitment \nto individuals. This is not about the bureaucracy. We have passed the \npoint of being able to preserve the reputations of agencies that failed \nour country. It is no longer about them. It is about the accountability \nof the United States Government. Whoever is found at fault, whoever is \nfound to have performed their duties, it is time to face the truth.\n  This is the issue that will never go away. This is the one part of \nthe Government, the formation of an independent commission on September \n11, 2001, that will happen no matter what we do, no matter how we vote, \nor whatever is said. It is as inevitable as tomorrow morning's sunrise \nbecause the cause is so powerful, so just and so necessary.\n  Give those few widows, parents, and children the one thing they have \nbeen demanding. Writing them checks will not change it. Laying wreaths \nwill not change it. Prayers will not change it. They are asking for an \nanswer. They want an answer, and so do other Americans. And I intend to \nget it for them. I intend to get that answer. I hope it is today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New Jersey for his comments. I \nused the words ``passionate'' and ``persistent'' to describe his \nadvocacy of an independent inquiry into the events of September 11. He \nhas brought that passion and eloquence to the floor today. We will \npersist together, in growing numbers in this body, until the questions \nthat he asks, that the families are asking, are answered. He is right, \nthere is an inevitability to this idea, but ``inevitable'' can be a \nlong time. We have to make it happen sooner rather than later, and the \nadoption of this amendment will do just that.\n  I do want to say to my friend from New Jersey, he raised a question \nabout the underlying bill--I know it was done in the context of what he \nwas saying. I do want to assure him, which I know he knows, that the \nunderlying proposal for the Department of Homeland Security does derive \nfrom the Hart-Rudman Commission, which saw these vulnerabilities before \nSeptember 11, and called for a new department, and the National \nCommission on Terrorism--the Bremer Commission did the same--and from \nthe various hearings of our committee. So I think there is an ample \nrecord that cries out for the establishment of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, but as I have said all along in this debate, this is our \nfirst best effort to create such a department.\n  It will be, in my opinion, hope, and belief, measurably improved over \ntime, by experience but also by the results of the inquiry that this \namendment will create because the more we know about how September 11 \nhappened, the better we will be able, through this new Department of \nHomeland Security, to make sure it never happens again.\n  This morning, I spoke to one of the family members of someone who was \nkilled in New York on September 11, and she said that sitting at the \nhearing of the joint intelligence committee yesterday, hearing the \nstaff director report on findings to date, forced her to a conclusion \nthat she did not want to reach; that the attacks were preventable.\n  I am not one who believes that another September 11 type of attack is \ninevitable. It is not. We all know that if somebody is crazy enough to \nstrap explosives around their waist and walk into a crowd, it is hard \nto stop that; but even that, with proper intelligence and infiltration \nof terrorist groups, can be stopped. A terrorist event as large and as \ncomprehensive as September 11, involving all of the context it had with \nfinancial resources, with aviation, with Governmental agencies, \nimmigration and otherwise, when one considers all the money we are \ninvesting every year in satellites and conversation surveillance \ndevices, that should have been noted and prevented, and that is the aim \nof the commission and the department, to make sure that September 11 \nnever happens again.\n  The Senator from New Jersey made reference to the Titanic. I will \nshare with my colleagues very briefly an excerpt from an article that \nappeared in the New York Times on September 11, 2002, just last week, \non the first anniversary of that day. It is written by Jim Dwyer, and \nit says:\n\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\n\n       Of course the country had to understand what went wrong. \n     One of the largest structures ever built had failed, at a \n     terrible cost in lives. When warned of danger, those in \n     charge had shrugged. Many died because the rescue effort was \n     plagued by communication breakdowns, a lack of coordination, \n     failure to prepare.\n       These findings on the sinking of the Titanic entered the \n     public record after the Carpathia docked at the Chelsea piers \n     in Manhattan on April 18, 1912, with the 705 survivors \n     plucked from the North Atlantic. Starting the next morning at \n     the Waldorf-Astoria, the barely dry witnesses provided a rich \n     body of facts about the accident, the Titanic, the maritime \n     practices to the United States Senate Commerce Committee, \n     which held 18 days of hearings. Their testimony gave form to \n     a distant horror, shaping law and history. No inquiry \n     remotely similar in scope, energy, or transparency has \n     examined the attacks of last September 11, the devastating \n     collapse of two of the world's tallest structures, the deaths \n     at the Pentagon, or on United Airlines flight 93 in \n     Pennsylvania. A handful of tightly focused reviews have taken \n     place mostly in secret, conducted by private consultants, or \n     by Congressional committees.\n       One year later, the public knows less about the \n     circumstances of 2,801 deaths at the foot of Manhattan in \n     broad daylight than people in 1912 knew within weeks about \n     the Titanic, which sank in the middle of an ocean in the dead \n     of night.\n       That hardly seems possible, considering that 9/11 \n     iconography has been absorbed into everything from football \n     pageants to pitches by speakers peddling lessons in \n     leadership. And yet, says John F. Timoney, once a senior \n     police commander in New York and the former police \n     commissioner in Philadelphia, the events of September 11 are \n     among the most rare in American public life: true \n     catastrophes that have gone fundamentally unscrutinized.\n       ``You can hardly point to a cataclysmic event in our \n     history, whether it was the sinking of the Titanic, the Pearl \n     Harbor attack, the Kennedy assassination, when a blue-\n     ribbon panel did not set out to establish the facts and, \n     where appropriate, suggest reforms,'' Mr. Timoney. That \n     has not happened here.''\n\n  That is the dreadful gap and omission that this amendment aims to \nfill. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, my colleague is very eloquent in the \npromotion of his cause, which is the creation of this commission. I \nappreciate the response of Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain to the \nconcerns I have. I appreciate the offer they have made to work with us \nto see if we go in this direction and make sure we can put forth our \nbest effort. I suppose I look at the whole endeavor a little bit \ndifferently than my friend from Connecticut.\n  Probably the best reason for going forward with some additional \nactivity, whether extension of the joint committee or creation of a new \ncommissioner, is not necessarily because we can do something that will \nprevent future catastrophes. I wish we could. But there is too much \nhate and too much technology in the world to be able to ever guarantee \nour citizenry that we can do that. It is not that we can even resolve \nthe issue. Tragedies have happened before in this country, and we are \nstill debating what happened or what did not happen.\n  It is a matter of doing what we can to find out what happened in the \nbest way possible. It is a matter of simple justice. We owe it to the \npeople involved. We owe it to the American people. We owe it to \nourselves. We owe it to our world to do the best we can to do all those \nthings to make it a little more preventable, to resolve key issues, do \nthe best we can. It is the right thing to do. It is a matter of simple \njustice--not that there will be a pot of gold at the end of the \nrainbow.\n  I have become more realistic as I look into these things. When I hear \nabout the ``connecting of the dots,'' we should have been able to \nconnect these dots, or this is preventable, what I know is these dots \nwere in a sea of dots, a veritable sea of dots. The problem we had with \nregard to September 11 is not just the fact we did not have the \nanalytical capability there at that time, before that time, in order to \nput this together, but for a long time now we have lost our ability, \nanalytically and technologically, to pull together these disparate \nfacts. Technologically, we ought to be able to evaluate the disparate \nfacts and put our computers to work and get analyses and estimates as \nto what is likely to happen.\n  It will be a long, drawn-out deal. We did not get there overnight, \nand we will not get a solution to it overnight. Even if we do \neverything right, we are never going to be totally safe. There is too \nmuch hatred, too much fanaticism in the world, and too much high \ntechnology. It is too easy for those things to come together. We will \nhave to be vigilant for the rest of our lives and the lives of our \nchildren and our grandchildren--and spend a lot of money and have a lot \nof effort.\n  The idea that we can come together and have a little investigation or \nhave a commission, and we can tell the American people and those tragic \nvictims who lost loved ones, and imply we are going to find out exactly \nwhat happened, we will prevent this thing from happening again--I wish \nthat were true. I don't think it will be.\n  As I said, we need to do what we can. We need to do as much as we \ncan. What we are struggling with is trying to determine the best way to \ndo that and the best forum. We should not be afraid.\n  People say it is not a blame game. Of course, it is a blame game, to \na certain extent. Why shy away from assessing blame if there is blame \nto be assessed? We are talking almost 3,000 lives here. That is part of \nit. Prevention is a part of it. But also a very important part of it is \ndoing what we can to assess the nature of the problem so that we are as \nstrong as we can be--not that we can prevent any potential problem, but \nbe as strong as we can be. That is what I think my friend is trying to \ndo with this commission. I appreciate that effort.\n  I want to continue to study this bill, this amendment.\n  I want to talk to my friends who support this amendment between now \nand the time we vote. I want the opportunity to discuss our process \nwith my colleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked me to announce \nthere will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Lieberman's \namendment establishing a National Commission on Terrorist Acts Upon the \nUnited States. This amendment would direct the new independent \ncommission in both investigation of the facts and circumstances \nrelating to the September 11 attacks, and evaluation of the lessons \nlearned from the attacks regarding the Federal Government's abilities \nto detect, prevent and respond to such attacks. Further, the bill \nempowers the commission to hold hearings, collect relevant materials \nand subpoena witnesses for the purpose of studying the systemic \nproblems within the intelligence and law enforcement communities and to \ndiscover what part these problems played in the September 11 attacks. I \nsupport this amendment with the expectation that the recommendations \ncoming from this commission will assist us in strengthening our \nnational security by improving our intelligence and law enforcement as \nwell as our intelligence efforts. We need to do everything possible to \nmake sure that this type of attack never happens again.\n  As we learn more from the investigation into the September 11 \nattacks, it is increasingly evident that there are many barriers of \ncommunications between the several agencies involved in the battle \nagainst terrorism. I have been concerned about this problem for a \nnumber of years. There is no place for jurisdictional battles and \nunnecessary statutory barriers when America's security is at risk. We \nalso need to determine where our national security shortcomings are, \nand what can be done to remedy them, so that we can look at potential \nlegislative initiatives or the appropriate allocation of resources.\n  Make no mistake, this commission will not be a witch hunt. We are not \ntrying to place blame. Our goal in creating this commission is to find \nthe best way to make our law enforcement and intelligence the best that \nit can be.\n  Although I support this amendment and the general idea of a \ncommission\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nfor this purpose, I would like to note that I have concerns regarding \nthe changes to the composition of the commission. Focusing on the party \naffiliation of the officials who select the commission members \nunnecessarily politicizes the commission's work. This commission should \nbe staffed by men and women with knowledge and expertise necessary to \ndevelop solutions that will prevent further terrorist attacks.\n  That having been said, I would like to reiterate the importance of \nthis amendment and the need for an independent commission that will \ndedicate its time to fleshing out these problems and in turn allow us \nto prevent further attacks and most importantly to protect the American \npeople.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, more has changed in the last year than any \nof us, 1 year ago, would have cared to imagine. It was on a September \nday not unlike this one that terrorists committed mass murder in \nAmerica, transforming forever the way we think about our security and \nour role in the world. One year later, we are in the midst of \nrestricting our entire apparatus of Government to protect against \nfuture acts of terror in our homeland. But we have yet to \ncomprehensively assess what went wrong last September 11--how our \ndefenses failed us, why our worldwide intelligence network did not \nprovide us warning of imminent attack, how terrorists operated and \ntrained within our borders, how policy decisions may have made the \nevents more likely, and how various Government agencies failed to \nanalyze information in their possessions that could well have provided \nus a blueprint of the terrorists' intentions.\n  The anniversary of September 11 is past us, and with it the \ncelebration of heroism and sacrifice that will forever mark that day. \nNow is the time to take a harder look at the other side of that tragic \nevent: the utter failure of the United States Government to predict and \nprevent the slaughter of Americans in America's greatest city.\n  The September 11 attacks were incredibly depraved but not, as it \nturns out unimaginable. As early as 1995, an accomplice of Ramzi Yousef \nrevealed that the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center attack \nintended to plant bombs on 12 U.S.-bound airliners and crash a light \nplane packed with explosives into CIA headquarters. The accomplice had \ntrained as a pilot at three separate U.S. flight schools. In 1999 the \nLibrary of Congress prepared a report for the National Intelligence \nCouncil warning that al-Qaeda suicide bombers ``could crash-land an \naircraft packed with high explosives'' in the Pentagon, the CIA, or the \nWhite House.\n  Two months before the September 11 attacks, Kenneth Williams, an FBI \nfield agent in Phoenix, suspected that terrorists had enrolled in an \nArizona pilot training school. He urged the FBI to begin investigating \nwhether other U.S. flight schools might be training terrorists to fly. \nHis prophetic warnings went unheeded. Similarly, FBI agent Coleen \nRowley, whose efforts to have the FBI and CIA investigate hijacker \nZacarias Moussaoui were rebuffed, believes such an investigation could \nhave uncovered the terrorists' plot in the weeks before the attacks.\n  Yesterday, the joint congressional intelligence committee reported \nthat U.S. intelligence received a number of reports indicating that \nterrorists were plotting to use planes as weapons and planning to \nattack domestic targets. According to the committee, U.S. intelligence \nlearned in August 1998 that a ``group of unidentified Arabs planned to \nfly an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the World \nTrade Center.'' This information was given to the FBI and the FAA, \nwhich took little action.\n  CIA Director Tenet told the intelligence community in December 1998 \nthat ``We are at war,'' and ``I want no resources or people spared in \nthis effort.'' According to the joint committee, ``Despite the D.C.I.'s \ndeclaration of war in 1998, there was no massive shift in budget or \nreassignment of personnel to counterterrorism until after September 11, \n2001.'' The committee's report continues: ``By late 1998, the \nintelligence community had amassed a growing body of information--\nthough general in nature, and lacking specific details on time and on \nplace--indicating that bin Laden and the Al Qaeda notework intended to \nstrike within the United States, and concern about bin Laden continued \nto grow over time and reached peak levels in the spring and summer of \n2001, as the intelligence community faced increasing numbers of reports \nof imminent Al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests. . . .''\n  According to the congressional investigators, senior government \nofficials in July 2001 were briefed on the threat in the following \nlanguage: ``Based on a review of all source reporting over the last \nfive months, we believe that [Osama bin Laden] will launch a \nsignificant terrorist attack against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in \nthe coming weeks. The attack will be spectacular and designed to \ninflict mass casualties against U.S. facilities or interests. Attack \npreparations have been made. Attack will occur with little or no \nwarning.'' National Security Agency intercepts on September 10th \nwarning in Arabic that ``The match is about to begin'' and ``Tomorrow \nis zero hour'' went untranslated until the attacks, when their meaning \nbecame all too apparent.\n  Asking for, urging, and demanding answers for why various agencies of \nthe Federal Government failed to understand the enormity of the danger \nfacing the United States is an obligation shared by all elected Federal \nofficials. As is the responsibility for understanding why and how the \nprevious administration failed to combat the growing menace of \ninternational terrorism more effectively. As is responsibility for \nquestioning Congress' inability or unwillingness to exercise more \ndiligently its oversight responsibilities for those agencies. As is the \nexpectation that officials who did not competently discharge their \nresponsibilities be held accountable.\n  Congress is on the verge of creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity that constitutes the largest reorganization of the Federal \nGovernment in many of our lifetimes. But there has been no \ncomprehensive diagnosis of the state of our preparedness for terrorism \nprior to last September, no proper analysis of the security loopholes \nin our immigration and airline security organization that provided the \nterrorists with the access they needed to kill Americans; no systematic \nreview of the failure of Government agencies to analyze and share \ninformation on the terrorists' planning that coordinated analysis could \nhave revealed prior to the attacks; and no formal assessment of the \nconsequences of policy decisions dating back years that led to a \nclimate in Afghanistan in which a terrorist network could train and \nflourish, with consequences that need no retelling.\n  We need an honest search for answers, so that we and the people we \nrepresent can arrive at fair conclusions about what went wrong and \ndevelop ways to repair it. The independent commission we are proposing \nto look into these and all matters concerning our vulnerability and our \ninitial response to the attacks would provide a blueprint for reform of \nthe way we defend America. The insights of a blue-ribbon panel of \nexperts, removed from the pressures of partisan politics, would add to \nthe reforms we are making with creation of a Homeland Security \nDepartment by highlighting additional areas where the way our \nGovernment is organized have made us vulnerable.\n\n  Eleven days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt \nmandated an investigation into how such tragedy could have struck an \nunknowing America. Ultimately, four different major panels appointed by \nthe President and Congress investigated this ``Day of Infamy.'' Seven \ndays after President Kennedy was murdered, President Johnson appointed \na commission of distinguished leaders to investigate the assassination. \nThe independent commission we are proposing would carry on this \nrequirement for answers, which has gone unquestioned and been deemed \nnecessary in previous crises of this magnitude.\n  There is a crisis of confidence in America today. Americans are more \nproud than ever to be American. But large percentages deeply distrust \nthe institutions that shape our daily lives--the Federal Government, \ncorporate America, the Church. Corporate corruption, the scandals of \ncampaign financing and corruption of the political process have \ndeprived many Americans of the sense that they have a stake in the way \nthey are governed. In\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\nthe same way, I believe the lack of a fundamental accounting for the \ngreatest tragedy in the Nation's history--one that touched all \nAmericans and permanently altered the way we live and think about \nourselves--is another source of alienation and insecurity.\n  I do not believe the administration and the Congress have given the \nAmerican people reason to be confident that we no longer remain \nvulnerable to terrorist attack, despite the admirable leadership our \nPresident has shown in prosecuting the war on terror, and despite the \nimportant work of Congress to create a Department of Homeland Security. \nThe congressional intelligence committees have been conducting a very \nlimited investigation into the intelligence failures related to \nSeptember 11 and even this narrow inquiry has been sidelined by staff \ndisputes that disrupted its operations and an FBI investigation into \nleaked material. Strangely, the FBI is now investigating the same \npeople who are investigating the FBI. Indeed, until this week the joint \ncommittee has not held any open hearings. Ranking Republican Senator \nShelby in particular has been outspoken in criticizing its lack of \nprogress before it goes out of existence when the 107th Congress \nadjourns.\n  Both Senator Shelby and joint committee co-chairman Senator Bob \nGraham support the establishment of an independent commission to carry \non the work performed by the congressional intelligence investigation \nthey helped to lead. I am pleased that a number of the Senate members \nof the joint congressional intelligence committee have endorsed our \nproposal to establish a panel that would build upon their work. The \nrationale for an independent commission seems indisputable if the very \nleaders charged with a more narrow inquiry do not believe their own \ninvestigation met the necessary standards to authoritatively report on \nand learn from our past failures.\n\n  Many in Congress and the administration voiced concern last year that \nan independent investigation into September 11th's causes and \nconsequences would interfere with Congress' investigation into these \nmatters. With Congress planning to adjourn very soon, the congressional \ninvestigation represents only a first step into the intelligence and \nother failures that gave the terrorists their opening. The independent \ncommission Senator Lieberman and I are proposing would explicitly build \non the work of the congressional investigation and would go far beyond \nit by examining Government practice and policy in a host of other \nareas, including foreign policy, border control, aviation security, and \nlaw enforcement.\n  Americans deserve answers after the events of September. This issue \nrises above politics, as the families and friends who lost loved ones \nwill attest. Indeed, a commission would remove the issue from the \npolitical realm and serve the needs of both the administration and \nCongress by providing a blueprint for action, above and beyond any \nconclusions the joint congressional intelligence investigation may draw \nfrom its limited review.\n  Leaders of the joint congressional investigation into the \nintelligence failures of September 11th have said the attacks may well \nhave been preventable, based on everything we have learned since then \nabout what we knew and how it fit together in a way that formed a \nblueprint for attack. I find it unfathomable, and frankly unacceptable, \nthat we would accept that we could have prevented the attacks, but in \nthe same breath say we should move on. We should move on--after we have \nanswered all the lingering questions about why we were neither prepared \nnor organized to meet the challenge of terrorism, and after we have \nmade the kind of reforms that only a panel of distinguished experts \nseparated from politics could propose.\n  An independent inquiry will not impose a serious burden on the \nadministration as it prosecutes our just war on terrorism, any more \nthan a similar inquiry after Pearl Harbor impeded Franklin D. \nRoosevelt's prosecution of World War II. Nor should it prevent members \nof Congress, the press, or any American citizen from questioning or \ncriticizing the Government's apparent failures over the course of \nsuccessive administrations. All wars and national security failures \nhave occasioned contemporaneous criticism, and the Republic has managed \nto thrive.\n  It is irresponsible in a time of war, or any time for that matter, to \nattack or defend unthinkingly or because partisan identification is \none's supreme interest. But it is not responsible or right to shrink \nfrom offering thoughtful criticism when and to whom it is due, and when \nthe consequences of incompletely understanding failures of governance \nare potentially catastrophic. On the contrary, such timidity is \nindefensibly irresponsible especially in times of war, so irresponsible \nthat it verges on the unpatriotic.\n  Two years before the attacks, the distinguished Hart-Rudman \nCommission on national security warned that as a result of the threat \nof catastrophic terrorism, ``Americans will likely die on American \nsoil, possibly in large numbers.'' Congress and successive \nadministration ignored the commission's recommendations for reform to \ndefend against this threat--many of which are now embodied in the \nhomeland security legislation we are considering this week. We \nshouldn't wait for the next attack to investigate what more we need to \ndo to protect the American people.\n  Until we have comprehensive assessment of needed reforms across the \nspectrum of our Government, based on what went wrong last September, we \nwill not be prepared to predict and prevent the next attack. Americans \nneed answers. I urge my colleagues to join us to create a commission \nthat will tell them the truth--and put in place the protections that \nwill prevent future generations from judging us for abdicating our \nresponsibility to that truth.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have been asked by Senator Hatch to \nrequest unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be removed as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 4693.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to thank publicly the majority \nleader, Tom Daschle. Yesterday, Leader Daschle took to the floor and \ntalked about something that, frankly, is just not talked about by this \nadministration, and that is the very sad state of our economy. Somebody \nneeds to focus on that because, while we must devote much of our time \nto the war against terrorism, while we must devote much of our time to \nfiguring out the best way to meet the threat that Iraq poses in terms \nof her weapons of mass destruction and the frightening prospect of \nthose weapons being used, while we address those issues, I think we \nknow very well that an administration must also pay attention to \ndomestic needs, to the job needs, the educational needs, the health \ncare needs. We must do both things in a great nation like this.\n  So as the Democratic leader made his statement yesterday, it is \nstunning to see that, in some categories, this economy under this \nadministration is the worst we have seen in more than 50 years. It is \nvery serious. We must address it. We must have a plan to address it. We \nmust look back at the success of the Clinton administration and other \nadministrations, Democratic and Republican, which had good economic \nrecords. We are seeing record stock market losses because there is a \nloss of confidence. There is a decrease in earnings and there are \nmassive layoffs. We have seen a maiming or loss in private sector \njobs--the worst in 50 years--and the weakest economic growth in 50 \nyears.\n  Madam President, I hope this Senate will take care of the two most \nimportant things we could do: Foreign policy concerns and also domestic \nconcerns, with a prime focus on this economy and turning it around and \ngiving Americans the kind of confidence they had in the 1990s. That was \na good time for America.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8914-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n                           CHARITABLE GIVING\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise to talk about a plan that is \nbeing discussed here in the Halls of the Senate and a very important \nplan in this time of economic recovery when we are looking at the 1-\nyear anniversary a week ago of September 11 and the tragedy that has \nbefallen so many people.\n  When we look at a lot of hardships going on in America, and while we \nhad a great response and outpouring of support from the American public \nto the victims of 9/11, if we look at the rest of the charitable world, \ncharitable giving is off about 20 percent. Part of that is the stock \nmarket, and part of it is because of the funds and worthy causes \nsupporting the victims of 9/11. A lot of the service needs, artistic \nneeds, and educational needs in communities all across the country are \ndoing with a lot less money this time of year--at a time when the need \nis very great.\n  We are looking at a piece of legislation and working on a piece of \nlegislation in the Senate. The Finance Committee marked up a bill in \nJune to try to help the situation as part of the President's faith-\nbased initiative. It is a charitable giving package that will \nstrengthen the nonprofit sector of our economy--those who help in the \nhuman service area--as I mentioned, education and the arts.\n  We have been working very hard to try to get this legislation on the \nfloor. Senator Daschle, I know, has given a commitment to the President \nthat he will in fact bring this measure to the floor of the Senate and \nhave a vote before the end of this session. We are winding down to the \nfinal days of the session, and that has yet to happen.\n  Senator Lieberman, I know, has been working very hard, as have I, to \nget this legislation to the floor and do it under a unanimous consent \nagreement. Obviously, there are a lot of important issues being \ndiscussed, and we want to have the opportunity to have debate and \namendments offered.\n  We are willing on our side of the aisle to have a limitation on \namendments and a limitation on debate. We have had a discussion back \nand forth. The majority leader has suggested the way he would feel \ncomfortable bringing this legislation up is to have one amendment on \neach side.\n  I have been working very hard on our side. I thank our leader, \nSenator Lott, and our ranking member on the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, for getting together as a team and working our side of the \naisle to make sure we get that down to one amendment.\n  We shared that amendment with the Democratic side of the aisle last \nweek. So we had that amendment out so everybody would know what our \namendment is. There are two other amendments. One will be an amendment \non the Democratic side. I understand Senator Reed from Rhode Island \nwill be the offerer of that amendment. And then there will be a \nmanagers' amendment. There will be a managers' amendment because there \nare certain issues in the underlying CARE Act that Senator Lieberman \nand I worked out with the White House several months ago that are not \nunder the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and cannot be reported \nout of the Finance Committee. They have to be added on the floor.\n  Senator Lincoln had concerns about provisions in the act. We worked \ndiligently. Again, I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \nworking this issue. We now have agreement, I understand, on Senator \nLincoln's provision and that is going to be included in the managers' \namendment.\n  We had an amendment on our side of the aisle from Senator Hutchison \nof Texas which had bipartisan support, as Senator Lincoln's did, and we \nput that in the managers' amendment.\n  We had things pop up, and we have been able to work out compromises \nand make this happen.\n  I was just informed a few minutes ago that the majority committee \nstaff has actually given us the managers' amendment. I thank them for \nmoving the ball down the field. We are reviewing that amendment. We can \nnow, with that managers' amendment, actually go through the process of \nhotlining the bill on our side of the aisle.\n  I am very sanguine about our chances of getting approval on our side \nof the aisle for this very important legislation affecting millions of \npeople in need in our society and the thousands upon thousands of \nvolunteers, people who are committed to helping those less fortunate in \nour society. They are waiting for this legislation to pass.\n  I know the President in speech after speech has asked the Senate to \nmove forward on this legislation during this time of economic need. We \nare approaching that point. I encourage this work to continue.\n  I understand there is a good-faith effort ongoing, but we are \nreaching the end of the session. We have 3 weeks to go. If we pass this \nlegislation, we have to get our colleagues in the House to act on it. \nWe do not know how they are going to act on it, but I am hopeful we can \nwork out something to get this bill to the President before we adjourn \non the 11th of October.\n  I wish to report that progress is being made. I am hopeful that, with \nthis information, we can get approval on our side of the aisle for an \nagreement. I am hopeful an agreement also can be reached on the \nDemocratic side so we can move forward and get this very important \nbipartisan legislation passed. Senator Lieberman and I are sponsors of \nit. I know Senator Daschle announced publicly he is in support of it. \nThere is broad support on this side of the aisle for the legislation.\n\n  This bill affects the people, the armies of compassion on the front \nlines meeting the needs of Americans in every State of the country. \nThis is something very good we can do. It looks small, but it has a \nhuge impact on millions of Americans if we do this before we leave.\n  I encourage all those who have an interest in this legislation to \ncome forward and make sure a unanimous consent agreement is \naccomplished very quickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8914-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8914-S8915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to the \ntenuous food security situation in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The United Nations estimates that 14.4 million people are in need of \nimmediate food aid and humanitarian assistance in southern Africa, \nwhere drought and poor harvests have combined with manmade factors--\nincluding economic mismanagement and politically-motivated disruption \nof agriculture in Zimbabwe--to create deadly conditions for the people \nof Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho. This \nfood crisis is striking a population already devastated by HIV/AIDS, \ncompounding the difficulty of African families' struggle for survival. \nI have asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the causes of \nthe food shortage and the obstacles to successfully addressing it in \nthe hopes of gaining greater clarity as the relationship between \nnatural and manmade obstacles to food security in the region.\n  In the Horn of Africa, food shortages are again threatening the well \nbeing of millions. As the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea struggle to \nrecover from a costly war and severe food shortage in 2000, many have \nhad no opportunity to reestablish their own economic security. Large \nnumbers of people are living on the margin, and are extremely \nvulnerable to food shortages. In Angola, the brutal civil war is \nfinally over, but the legacy of that conflict and of years of neglect \nhas left hundreds of thousands malnourished and seeking assistance. And \nin West Africa, disturbing reports suggest that the people of \nMauritania and Senegal are also threatened by food shortages linked to \ndrought. Sadly, from Burundi to Liberia, populations living in conflict \nzones also suffer from resulting food shortages.\n  As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I know that \nour interests throughout the sub-Saharan region are many, from \npromoting democracy and development to combating terrorism and other \ninternational criminal activity. None of those aims can be vigorously \npursued when populations are weakened and governments distracted by \ndesperate hunger and humanitarian catastrophe. I also know that our \nforeign policy agenda today is a crowded one, and that many crucially \nimportant issues compete for resources and attention.\n  There are some baseline conditions that we must strive to maintain if \nother elements of our policy are to have a meaningful impact around the\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nworld. Basic food security is one of those baseline conditions. We need \nstrong partners, and the strength of the region is being sapped every \nday by hunger. Working with others to fight off starvation, and then to \nhelp strengthen food security systems to avoid future crises, must \nalways be a priority. I will work with my colleagues and the \nadministration to ensure that the United States finds a way to give \nfood security issues throughout sub-Saharan Africa the attention that \nthey deserve, and I urge my colleagues to support efforts to address \nthe problem in the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8915-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 31, 2001 \nin Browns Mills, NJ. Two white men attacked a black couple while they \nwere sleeping in their home. The attackers beat the victims with \nbaseball bats, causing severe cuts and broken bones. Neighbors said \nthat the assailants had previously indicated their intention to ``beat \nup'' the victims, and used racial slurs to describe them.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8915-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services program, commonly known as COPS. \nThe COPS program was established in 1994, due in large part to the \nefforts of my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, and \nthe support of then President Clinton. Since its inception, the program \nhas greatly enhanced community oriented policing across the Nation. The \nCOPS program has facilitated the hiring and training of over 116,000 \npolice officers who help keep our communities safe. I am especially \npleased that this program has been a shining example of an effective \npartnership between local and Federal Governments. It provides Federal \nassistance to meet local objectives without imposing mandates or \ninterfering with local prerogatives, and it provides federal dollars \ndirectly to the police departments and communities.\n  COPS has had a positive and very tangible impact on communities \nthroughout the country, including in my home State of Wisconsin, by \nputting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens \nsafer. In the State of Wisconsin alone, COPS has funded over 1,300 new \nofficers by contributing more than $100 million to communities.\n  The effects of community-based policing cannot be understated. The \nCOPS program has succeeded because it helps individual officers to be a \nfriendly and familiar presence in their communities. They are building \nrelationships with people from house to house, block to block, school \nto school. Community policing helps law enforcement to do their job \nbetter, makes our neighborhoods and schools safer, and, very \nimportantly, gives residents peace of mind. Increasing the number of \nlocal law enforcement on the streets and in our neighborhoods fosters \nan environment of mutual respect between officers and their neighbors, \nand community pride from home to school to fire station to corner \nstore. Reducing crime and keeping our communities safe has been and \nshould continue to be a top priority for all of us. As the tragic \nevents of September 11 have shown our Nation, local police officers \nplay a vital role to protect and secure our communities. We should give \nthem the support they need.\n  As I travel through Wisconsin and talk to sheriffs, police chiefs and \nother law enforcement officers, I hear the same refrain, time after \ntime: the COPS program is vital to their work and has enabled them to \nget more officers out from behind their desks and onto the streets. \nWisconsin is not alone. Since 1994, the COPS program has provided \nfunding for thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country, \nand has expanded to include the COPS in Schools Program and the COPS \nTribal Resources Program, and now funds the Community Policing to \nCombat Domestic Violence grants.\n  As the COPS program has grown, crime rates have decreased. But in \norder to maintain a low crime rate, we must continue to provide the \nnecessary resources. The COPS program gives us an opportunity at the \nfederal level to send a strong signal of support back to local police \nofficers that we value community-oriented policing as integral to the \nprotection and safety of all Americans.\n  We have taken up funding for the COPS program in this body numerous \ntimes since its inception. I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee \nreported favorably a bill calling for its re-authorization this spring, \nthe PROTECTION Act, S. 924, introduced by Senator Biden. I commend and \nthank Senator Biden for his leadership on this issue. I was very \npleased to support his bill re-authorizing the COPS program in \nCommittee, and I urge the full Senate to work to ensure that the COPS \nprogram is authorized again before we adjourn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8915-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE OAKLAND ATHLETICS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are times when the \nachievements of an individual athlete or sports team are so dramatic, \nso sensational and exciting, that the entire country stops what it is \ndoing to simply watch in wonder. The sport of baseball, in particular, \nhas supplied us with many such moments over the years.\n  I recall the thrill of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak; Bobby \nThompson's ``Shot Heard Round The World'' home run; pitcher Don \nLarsen's perfect World Series game; Hank Aaron's 715th trip around the \nbases; Cal Ripken Jr.'s 2,131st consecutive game; and Barry Bond's 71st \nhome run of the season. All of these milestones are embedded in \nAmerica's sports memory.\n  There is another baseball milestone that I believe deserves a place \nin the pantheon of remarkable sporting achievements, an accomplishment \nas exciting as Carlton Fisk's 12th inning World Series home run or \n``The Catch'' by Willie Mays in another, earlier World Series. That \naccomplishment, Mr. President, is the 20-game, American League record \nwinning streak set this season by the Oakland Athletics--the longest \nwin streak in baseball in 67 years.\n  Until the Oakland Athletics rewrote the American League record book, \nmany had considered the 19-game win streak record held jointly by the \nNew York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox to be untouchable. Indeed, \nthere are only three teams in the entire history of baseball--the New \nYork Giants, the Chicago Cubs, and now the Oakland Athletics--that have \never won 20 or more games in a row.\n  This summer, baseball fans from around the world were caught up in \nthe excitement as the Athletics continued to win game after game after \ngame. At work, in the car, and at home, and regardless of time zone, \nAmericans watched with fascination as the Oakland Athletics approached \nthe magic number of 20 victories. I shared in that growing sense of \nexcitement and cheered along with the rest of the country when the team \nset the new record on September 4th.\n  My hat is off to the Oakland Athletics, to the players and staff, \nManager Art Howe, and to the fans. I know how proud the Oakland \ncommunity is of its team, and of a win streak record that is one for \nthe ages. With this amazing achievement, the 2002 Oakland Athletics \nhave secured a special place in baseball history and lore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8915-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8915-S8916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICKIE PAILTHORP\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to share with the \nSenate a tribute to Mickie Pailthorp, a leader in my home State of \nWashington who passed away on July 31, 2002. On August 8, I was honored \nto speak at a memorial service for Mickie, and today I want to\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\nshare her accomplishments with my colleages.\n  I will never forget my first meeting with Mickie Pailthorp. It was \nearly in 1992, and I had just announced that I was running for the U.S. \nSenate. Many in the established political community had written me off. \nThey said I hadn't paid my dues. They said I couldn't raise the money. \nThey even said I was too short.\n  Many dismissed me sight unseen, but Mickie decided to find out for \nherself. Shortly after I announced, Mickie called my campaign office. \nShe said she was thinking about supporting me because I was a woman \ncandidate, but she absolutely had to meet me first. I thought, ``No \nproblem.'' We met at a restaurant for what I thought would be a casual \ndinner.\n  Instead, Mickie grilled me for over an hour. She wanted to know very \nspecifically what I was going to do about this issue and that issue. \nShe wanted to know why I thought I could win, and she wanted to know \nthat I would work hard. To be honest, by the end of our dinner, I \nreally wasn't sure whether she was going to help me.\n  But before I knew it, she was one of my strongest behind-the-scenes \nsupporters, and her support made a difference. Mickie quietly opened \ndoors for me. She got me into places that I couldn't go on my own.\n  When I won the election, she didn't come after me seeking favors or \ndemanding credit, but I knew she was watching. Every year at Joel and \nMickie's Christmas party, she would come up to me and say very quietly \neither: ``I was really proud of what you did here.'' Or more sternly, \n``Now you've got to be careful about this.'' So I knew she was \nwatching.\n  When I think about Mickie, I remember her as whirlwind of passion and \nenergy. She was there fighting the good fight for women on the ERA and \nso many other issues before it was popular and before it seemed \npossible. One of the things that made Mickie so unique is that she \ndidn't seek any credit. She was happy to work behind the scenes. Mickie \nnever needed to be the ``picture'' for the cause, but she clearly \npainted every line.\n  Some leaders climb up to the top and when they get there they pull up \nthe ladder behind them and leave everyone else stuck below. But \nMickie's whole purpose was to help other women make it to the top, and \nshe did that well. So today, while a generation of young women might \nnot know Mickie's name, they know the women she helped elect. And they \nknow that they can make a difference, too.\n  Mickie Pailthorp was not a visible women's leader, but she made a lot \nof other women leaders visible. And because Mickie didn't trumpet her \nown accomplishments, it's up to us to make sure that others know about \nthis remarkable woman and carry on her legacy. So I invite Mickie's \nfriends and fans in Washington State to tell their children and \ngrandchildren about an energetic, passionate woman named Mickie \nPailthorp, and the opportunities she gave all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8916-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE POEM AMERICAN PRIDE\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the events of September 11 were \nvery tragic and very traumatic for our Nation, especially our children. \nThis poem, written by 10-year-old James Dillon Hughes of Bourg, LA, \ndemonstrates, very simply, what is great about America. In these few \nlines James captures the spirit of his country, stronger now than ever \nbefore. It is our job to ensure that the freedoms we enjoy now will \nstill ring true for our children and future generations to follow. \nJames wrote this on September 13, 2001, only two days after the \nterrible events of September 11.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to \nrecognize four outstanding women who the Iowa Commission on the Status \nof Women have selected for this year's inductees to the Iowa Women's \nHall of Fame.\n  Each year, the Commission solicits nominations of women, living or \ndeceased, who have had a significant impact on society or their \ncommunities. Four nominees are selected by a five-member committee and \nthe Commission and then are honored by the Governor and the Lieutenant \nGovernor at a special ceremony. I'd like to add my voice to this \ntribute to four accomplished Iowa women.\n  Bonnie Campbell has been a strong leader since she first began her \nprivate practice in Des Moines. In 1990, she became the first female \nelected Iowa attorney general in our State's history. She used her \nposition to author and pass one of the Nation's first anti-stalking \nlaws. By 1995, her work was recognized nationally and she was appointed \ndirector of the U.S. Department of Justice's Violence Against Women \nOffice. She played a critical role in the implementation of the \nViolence Against Women provisions of the 1994 Crime Act. Now in private \npractice, Bonnie continues to serve as a role model for women. On a \npersonal level, Bonnie is a good friend of mine and I congratulate her \non this well-deserved recognition.\n  Sue Ellen Follon's impact on women's issues was once described in the \nDes Moines Register this way: ``You may never have heard her name, but \nthere's a good chance she has touched your life.'' A Volga native, \nFollon served as the executive director of the Iowa Commission on the \nStatus of Women from 1976 to 1984. Throughout her service, Follon \nworked to expand the Commission's influence and scope, to strengthen \nrape and sexual abuse laws, and help public hearings on domestic abuse, \ndisplaced homemakers and the feminization of poverty. In fact, her \nefforts helped to make Iowa the first State in the Nation to \nlegislatively address gender inequities in many facets of life. Follon \nwent on to become the first woman to serve as Vice President at the \nUniversity of Iowa. Throughout her career, she made over 150 \npresentations from the local to the international level on the subjects \nof women's equality, leadership, higher education and mentors for women \nand minorities. Born in 1942, Follon died on November 4, 1998, the day \nafter voters passed the equal rights amendment to the Iowa \nConstitution.\n  Alice Yost Jordan is internationally known as one of the most \ndistinguished and published American composers. A Des Moines resident, \nJordan is best known for her choral and organ works numbering over 200, \nwhich have sold over 250,000 copies. Her recital song, Take Joy Home, \ncommissioned by Sherrill Milnes of the Metropolitan Opera and pianist \nJon Spong, received world-wide exposure on concert tours and was \nperformed at a White House State Dinner in 1983. Her arrangement of \nAmerica the Beautiful, commissioned by the Iowa High School Music \nAssociation for the All-State Chorus and Orchestra, opens the All-State \nFestival Concert biennially. She has composed another 40 works that \nwere commissioned by churches, universities and organizations across \nthe Nation. Born in Davenport in 1916, she graduated from Drake \nUniversity, where she studied composition for her undergraduate and \ngraduate studies with the late Dr. Francis J. Pyle and received an \nHonorary Degree, Doctor of Letters from Grand View College.\n  Shirley Ruedy of Cedar Rapids is a nationally recognized journalist, \nspeaker and cancer survivor. Twice diagnosed with breast cancer, Ruedy \nlaunched a biweekly ``Cancer Update'' column that the Cedar Rapids \nGazette began publishing in 1991. The column focused on her own \nexperiences as well as providing the latest expert information on \ncancer treatment and prevention to her readers. ``Cancer Update'' is\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\nnow carried in a publication from the Mayo Clinic Women's Cancer \nProgram. Each October, in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, \nRuedy runs a column she co-wrote with a surgeon about the life journey \nof a breast cancer cell. Through her writing and speaking, Shirley \nRuedy serves as a role model of courage and positive advocate for all \nof those who have been diagnosed with cancer.\n  These women have aspired to high standards in their career fields and \nin serving their community. They also serve as an inspiration to young \nIowans who can look to them for direction and leadership. I applaud the \nIowa Commission on the Status of Women for recognizing their \noutstanding contributions. They are strong role models for all of us \nand deserve the highest praise. And they are some of the many special \npeople who make Iowa such a great place to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8917-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS WHO \n        COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM--PM 109\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith the 6-month \nperiodic report prepared by my Administration on the national emergency \nwith respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support \nterrorism that was declared in Executive Order 13224 of September 23, \n2001.\n                                                      George W.

This legislation is aimed at protecting the \neconomic stability and national security of the United States by \nestablishing a broad-based agenda to reinvigorate America's aeronautics \nand aviation R enterprise and maintain America's competitive \nleadership in aviation. Congressman Larson and other members of \nCongress introduced companion legislation in the House several months \nago.\n  The United States has dominated the aircraft industry for years. In \n1985, we dominated the aerospace market controlling more than 73 \npercent of the commercial aircraft industry. Unfortunately, since 1985, \nthe U.S. has fallen behind considerably. Today, we control less than 50 \npercent of the global market. Over the last decade, funding for the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's aeronautics research \nand development program has fallen by approximately 50 percent.\n  Last year, the European Commission and aerospace industry executives \nunveiled a report entitled ``European Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020'' \nwhich outlines ambitious goals of attaining global leadership in \naeronautics and creating a world class air transport system for Europe. \nThe U.S. aeronautics industry is being left behind at the gates, and is \nnow in a position where it must catch up in an effort not to lose its \neconomic and technological dominance over the international aeronautics \nmarket. Europe has committed to spending more than $93 billion within \nthe next 20 years in order to implement ``A Vision for 2020''.\n  The Aeronautics Research and Development Revitalization Act of 2002 \nwill provide a funding basis for NASA to plan and implement their \n``Aeronautics Blueprint-Toward a Bold New Era of Aviation''. The \n``Aeronautics Blueprint'' confronts the challenges that are faced by \nthe aviation industry and puts forth a vision of what can be achieved \nby investments in aeronautics research and technology, and stresses the \nimportance of combining the efforts of NASA, DOD, DoT, the FAA, \nacademia, and industry. It does not, however, provide a program plan to \nactually achieve the vision, nor does it address the huge disparity \nbetween current NASA aeronautics funding and what is required to \nachieve the vision. The bill that Senator Allen and I are introducing \ntoday provides the necessary program plan needed to achieve the \nnation's aeronautics vision as found in the ``Aeronautics Blueprint,'' \nand stresses the importance of having agencies like NASA and FAA work \nclosely together in achieving these goals.\n  The Aeronautics Research and Development Revitalization Act of 2002 \nwould reverse the trend of declining Federal investments in aeronautics \nand aviation R by doubling the authorization of funding over five \nyears. Funding for NASA would increase to $900 million in 2005, which \nis approximately the level it was in 1998, and would increase to $1.15 \nbillion in 2007. The legislation would also double funding for the FAA \nto more than $550 million in 2007.\n  This bill will have a direct impact on technologies that can be \neasily incorporated into the commercial airline industry. The bill \nfocuses on improving fuel-efficiency for commercial standard airliners, \nas well as noise reduction, improved emissions, wake turbulence, more \nstringent safety and security standards, a more efficient air-traffic \ncontrol system, and supersonic transport. Universities will also be \ngiven resources to develop training methods for people who will make \nuse of these technologies. Individual engineering graduate students \nstudying aeronautics will be eligible for scholarships and summer \nemployment opportunities which will be made possible through specific \nfunding in this legislation.\n  These new technologies will help our Nation militarily, as well. \nPlanes will be able to fly farther than before, communications networks \nwill be improved, making it easier to coordinate military operations, \nand quieter engines will make planes less detectable to ground forces \nthat do not have the benefit of radar. Even transport missions will be \nmuch more efficient.\n  The events of September 11 not only highlighted the importance of \naviation to our entire economy, but they also demonstrated the need to \nenhance our aviation security system. This bill should, we believe, be \npart of our government's commitment to investment in the economic \ngrowth, security and safety of America's aviation and aeronautics \nsector.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2967. A bill to promote the production of affordable low-income \nhousing; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable \nHousing Expansion Act of 2002. I include a summary of the provisions of \nthe legislation with my statement, and I urge all members to review the \nbill and the summary. Obviously this is a major piece of legislation \nthat will undoubtedly be considered in the next session of Congress as \nwell, but I want to be out in public for discussion this year so we can \nwork on it early next year. This is an important bill that is designed \nto start to meet the long-term housing needs of very low- and extremely \nlow-income families. This bill is targeted especially to provide \naffordable housing for extremely low-income families, those at or below \n30 percent of medium income.\n  In particular, the Affordable Housing Expansion Act would establish a \nnew block grant program to be administered by the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development--HUD. HUD would allocate funds to state housing \nfinance agencies for the development of mixed income housing with the \nFederal funding targeted to the development of the very low-income and \nextremely low-income housing component of the mixed income housing. \nEach state housing finance agency would have to submit an affordable \nhousing expansion\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\nplan to HUD that ensures the funds are allocated to meet the low-income \nhousing needs in both the rural and urban areas of each state. States \nalso would have to contribute a 25 percent match. Moreover, each state \nhousing finance agency could use up to 20 percent of these block grant \nfunds to preserve existing low-income multifamily housing and for the \nrehabilitation needs of low-income multifamily housing.\n  The Affordable Housing Expansion Act also provides new authority for \nlow-income housing production under the Section 8 program and the \nPublic Housing program. Under the Section 8 program, the bill provides \nnew authority for a ``Thrifty Voucher'' program that would allow the \nuse of section 8 project-based assistance for new construction, \nsubstantial rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing for \nextremely low-income families. Because the cost of these vouchers is \ncapped at 75 percent of the payment standard, these vouchers will need \nto be used in conjunction with other housing assistance programs, such \nas the HOME program, the Community Development Block Grant program or \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit program, to be successful.\n  The bill also would authorize a new loan guarantee program that will \nallow public housing agencies to rehabilitate existing public housing \nor develop off-site public housing in mixed income developments. The \nlong-term debt of these loans would be tied to the pro-rata share of \nfunds under the Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds that would \nbe allocated to the units that are rehabilitated or constructed over a \nmaximum of 30 years. This tool will allow Public Housing Agencies to \naddress more aggressively the over $20 billion backlog of public \nhousing capital needs.\n  The Affordable Housing Expansion Act of 2002 is an important first \nstep towards addressing a growing shortage of affordable housing for \nvery low-income and extremely low-income families. While homeownership \nrates have grown and the cost of housing has skyrocketed, many very \nlow-income and extremely low-income families are being left behind \nwithout the availability of affordable rental housing. This is \nunfortunate. It is a tragedy. The social and economic costs to the \nNation are dramatic. And while we have several Federal housing \nproduction programs, such as the HOME program and the Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit, not enough is being done.\n\n  In particular, HUD's most recent report on worst case housing needs, \nA Report on Worst Case Needs in 1999: New Opportunity Amid Continuing \nchallenges, concluded that the shortage of affordable housing has \nworsened. In particular, the number of units affordable to extremely \nlow-income renters dropped between 1997 and 1999 at an accelerated \nrate, and shortages of affordable housing available to those renters \nworsened. As we have seen in this economy, as rents continue to rise \nfaster than inflation, the pressure for above-average rent increases at \nthe bottom end of the rental stock is eroding further the supply of \nrental units that are affordable without Government subsidies.\n  In addition, this report found a record high of 5.4 million \nfamilies--some 600,000 more families with worst case housing needs than \nin 1991--that have incomes below 50 percent of median income and pay at \nleast 50 percent of their income in rent. In addition, worst case \nhousing needs have become increasingly concentrated among those \nfamilies with extremely low-incomes. In particular, over three-quarters \nof the families with worst case housing needs in 1997 had incomes below \n30 percent of median income. I have seen no evidence that these \nfamilies have fared better since 1997, and as rents have increased, I \nthink it obvious that the problem has worsened. Further, since that \ntime, we have lost some 200,000 units of section 8 project-based units \nto rent increases as well as to decisions by owners of the housing not \nto renew their section 8 contracts. Also, as families age and people \nlive longer lives, we are beginning to face a new crisis of a lack of \naffordable housing for our seniors.\n  The Affordable Housing Expansion Act is designed to provide \nadditional, needed tools that will allow States and communities to \ndevelop new affordable low-income and mixed-income housing, including \nunits targeted to extremely low-income families. This would help fill a \ngap in the housing needs of the Nation that would allow these lowest \nincome families to begin to climb the housing ladder to homeownership. \nDecisions would be driven by local choice and need and start to meet \nthe burgeoning need for new low-income housing in tight markets where \nthere is little or no housing for families and seniors at the low end \nof the economic scale. These families need to be served and the cost is \nsmall compared to potential cascading social and economic costs to both \ncommunities and families--it is a simple equation--homes equal stable \nenvironments in which children are educated and people can obtain jobs. \nJobs and homes represent the tax base of any community and educated \nchildren are the future of our Nation.\n  This is important legislation. The private sector is not making the \nneeded investment to meet the low-income housing needs of the present \nand future. The Federal government must show the leadership and make \nthe needed investment to partner with state and localities as well as \npublic and private entities in the low-income housing infrastructure of \nthe Nation. This bill is designed to start to meet this need and focus \nthe debate on the importance of low-income housing production to the \ncurrent and future housing needs of this Nation.\n  Too often in this body we say we are going to help low-income people \nget more housing because we are going to expand the number of section 8 \ncertificates. The sad fact is that in many communities, particularly in \nthe St. Louis area, no matter how many more vouchers you put out, no \nmore housing is available. Too many of the vouchers, the certificates, \nare not used because there simply is not the affordable housing. This \ndeals with the problem that we see, not just in St. Louis but across \nthe Nation.\n  I believe my colleagues should take a hard look at this. We invite \ntheir comments and consideration. We must do something, and it will \nprobably be next year, but we must get to work right now thinking about \nhow we are going to meet the need for affordable housing for the very \nlow and extremely low income people who live in our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be printed \nwith my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I send the bill to the desk and ask for \nits appropriate referral.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n\n Affordable Housing Expansion Act of 2002 (Introduced by Senators Bond \n                              and Collins)\n\n\n TITLE I--PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING FOR EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME AND VERY \n                          LOW-INCOME FAMILIES\n\n       Establishes a $1 billion block grant program beginning in \n     2003 that would allocate funds to state housing finance \n     agencies on a per capita basis according to the population of \n     the state. No state would receive less than $6 million.\n       Allows funds to be used for acquisition, new construction, \n     reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of \n     affordable housing; permits funds to be used for \n     rehabilitation needs and preservation of existing assisted \n     low-income housing (although no more than 20 percent of the \n     funds can be used for rehabilitation and preservation); \n     allows conversion of existing housing to housing for the \n     elderly or for persons with disabilities.\n       Requires states to meet a 25 percent matching requirement \n     to ensure accountability and to leverage additional funds.\n       Requires housing developed to be low- and mixed-income \n     housing with at least 30 percent of the assisted unites \n     targeted to extremely low-income families (families at or \n     below 30 percent of medium income); remaining assisted units \n     would be targeted to very low-income families.\n       Rents for assisted units are modeled after the low-income \n     tax credit program only with deeper targeting--extremely low-\n     income families would pay no more than 25 percent of 30 \n     percent of medium income and very low-income families would \n     pay no more than 25 percent of 50 percent of medium income.\n       Authorizes a new multifamily risk-sharing mortgage \n     insurance program to help underwrite housing assisted under \n     this title.\n\n\n                 TITLE II--SECTION 8 HOUSING PRODUCTION\n\n     Thrifty vouchers\n       Establishes a ``Thrify'' Voucher Housing Production program \n     that targets section 8\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\n     project-based assistance for new construction, substantial \n     rehabilitation and preservation with eligible families \n     defined as ``extremely low-income families'' (those at or \n     below 30 percent of adjusted income).\n       Limits assistance to 25 percent of units in a building \n     while limiting the cost for a unit at 75 percent of the \n     payment standard or fair market rent (really is operating \n     costs, utility costs and reasonable return on operating \n     costs.). Initial rent term would be 15 years with renewals \n     through at least year 40. The premise is to use anticipated \n     section 8 project-based funds to capitalize the cost of new \n     construction, substantial rehabilitation and preservation \n     while subsidizing these costs over some 40 years plus. \n     Thrifty vouchers could be used in conjunction with low-income \n     housing tax credits, HOME, CDBG or the (Title I) ``Bond'' \n     Housing Production Block Grant program.\n       New Thrifty Vouchers would be distributed under the formula \n     used for the HOME program.\n     Reallocation of vouchers\n       New section 8 provision would provide for the reallocation \n     of section 8 funds where a PHA fails to utilize at least 90 \n     percent of allocated section 8 tenant-based assistance, and \n     then 95 percent after 16 months from notice on failure to \n     meet the 90 percent utilization requirements. Allows PHAs to \n     challenge for a new survey of market rents in an area for an \n     increased rent payment standard or fair market rent. Provides \n     for a reallocation to another PHA, State or local agency, or \n     nonprofit/for-profit capable of administering section 8 \n     assistance upon a finding that a PHA has failed to meet these \n     performance requirements.

A bill to amend the American Battlefield Protection act of \n1996 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to establish a \nbattlefield acquisition grant program; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleagues Senator Jeffords and Senator Sessions, \nwhich will help preserve significant sites associated with the Civil \nWar. A similar companion bill has been introduced and has bipartisan \nsupport in the House of Representatives.\n  According to the Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields, \nprepared by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, CWSAC, in July, \n1993, of the 384 principal Civil War battlefields, less than 20 percent \nhave been protected for posterity and 60 percent have been lost or are \nin imminent danger of being fragmented by development and lost as \ncoherent historic sites. To adequately address this problem, CWSAC \nrecommended a federal investment of $10 million a year for seven years \nwith a one-to-one Federal/non-Federal match.\n  While Congress has yet to fund Civil War battlefield preservation at \nthe levels recommended in the 1993 report, in recent years it has taken \nimportant steps to preserve our Civil War heritage. In Fiscal Years \n1999 and 2002, the Congress appropriated a total of $19 million in \nmatching grants for battlefield protection. Thus far, these grants have \npreserved over 7,000 acres of key Civil War battlefields in 11 States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today seeks to build upon these \nsuccesses by directing the Secretary of the Interior to establish the \nCivil War Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program. The bill authorizes \nCivil War battlefield acquisition matching grants of $10 million per \nyear for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008. The legislation requires a \nnon-Federal share of at least 50 percent, thus leveraging $20 million \nannually. State and local governments and non-profit organizations will \nbe eligible to receive grants under the program. All lands acquired by \nthese grants must be identified in the 1993 report and may only be \npurchased from landowners who voluntarily sell their interests.\n  The legislation also directs the Secretary to update the Report on \nthe Nation's Civil War Battlefields to reflect the activities carried \nout on the battlefields during the period between original publication \nof the report and the time of the update, including any changes or \nrelevant developments relating to the battlefields during that period.\n  In my view, this legislation represents an important opportunity to \nmaintain and preserve tangible links to our past so that future \ngenerations may experience firsthand this most critical period in our \nnation's history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the XVIII of the Social Security act to \nassure fair and adequate payment for high-risk medicare beneficiaries \nand to establish payment incentives and to evaluate clinical methods \nfor assuring quality services to people with serious and disabling \nchronic conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nPromoting Care for the Frail Elderly Act of 2002, which is of critical \nimportance to the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries, disabled \nseniors and those with complex medical conditions.\n  A number of States have successfully chosen to serve seniors and the \ndisabled by combining Medicare and Medicaid services through a waiver \napproved by the Department of Health and Human Services that integrates \nservices under Medicare and Medicaid capitated financing arrangements. \nThese programs provide beneficiaries with a comprehensive benefit \npackage that combines the services traditionally provided by Medicare, \nMedicaid, and home and community based wavier programs.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Partnership Program, \nWPP, is one such success, a community-based program that has improved \nthe quality, access, and cost-effectiveness of the care delivered to \nits beneficiaries. Perhaps most important to the beneficiaries, these \nprograms help the disabled and the frail elderly remain in their own \ncommunity, and avoid institutionalized care. Wisconsin is lucky to have \nfour such programs across our State: Elder Care and Community Living \nAlliance of Dane County, Community Care for the Elderly of Milwaukee \nCounty, and Community Health Partnership of Eau Claire, Dunn, and \nChippewa Counties.\n  In order to qualify for these programs, a person must be Medicaid-\neligible, have physical disabilities or frailties of aging, and require \na level of care provided by nursing homes. Through programs such as the \nWisconsin Partnership Program, these frail elderly and disabled \nbeneficiaries are able to receive quality preventive care up front, \nwhich allows more beneficiaries to stay in their communities and \nreduces the rate of hospitalization.\n  In Wisconsin, about 26 percent of all Medicaid recipients age 65 or \nolder are in nursing homes. This rate drops dramatically for those \nenrolled in the Wisconsin Partnership Program, where only 5.9 percent \nof recipients age 65 or older are in nursing homes.\n  While the Wisconsin Partnership Program is a success, we must ensure \nthat the Federal Government continues to support these State-based \nsolutions to our long-term care needs and other specialty managed care \nprograms that focus on frail, chronically-ill seniors. The current \nformula used to cover those enrolled in Medicare managed care programs \noverpays for healthy beneficiaries and underpays for the frail elderly \nand disabled. This payment method creates a backwards incentive for \nplans to avoid serving the most vulnerable segment of the Medicare \npopulation, the very seniors who could benefit most from program such \nas the Wisconsin Partnership Program.\n  While a number of steps have been taken to improve these payment \nmethods over the past four years, we must ensure that they meet the \nneeds of Medicare beneficiaries with complex care needs.\n  This legislation will help develop an appropriate incentive for \nspecialty managed care programs serving a disproportionate number of \nfrail, medically complex beneficiaries. My legislation will take \nseveral steps toward meeting this goal. First it will require the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services to evaluate alternative risk \nadjustment methods that account for the higher costs borne by plans \nwith a disproportionate number of high cost beneficiaries.\n  During this study, it will also implement the recommendations of the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission by permitting these plans that \ncurrently operate under demonstration authority to maintain existing \npayment formulas until the Secretary devises a risk adjustment method \nthat pays adequately for high risk enrollees. At the same time, it \nwould also direct MedPAC to evaluate appropriate methods to adjust \npayment rates based on the makeup of the beneficiaries.\n  Finally, my legislation would also authorize the Secretary to conduct \na demonstration to enhance care and improve outcomes for frail, \nvulnerable Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I would also like to make clear that this legislation uses existing \nfunds to pay for these initiatives, and is thus budget neutral. It \nauthorizes the demonstration program within existing dollars and would \nalso provide additional funding for the frailty adjustment with \nexisting Medicare+Choice dollars.\n  Fundamental long-term care reform is vital to any health care reform \nthat Congress may consider. As part of these reforms, we must support \nstate and local efforts to encourage care for the most vulnerable \npopulations. We must provide our seniors and disabled with real \nchoices. They are entitled to the opportunity to continue to live in \nthe homes and communities that they helped build and sustain. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure that will help provide a measure of \nsupport for the most frail elderly and disabled to allow them to stay \nin their own homes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2971. A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to provide the Highway Trust Fund additional funding for Indian \nreservation roads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce the \nTribal Transportation Program Improvement Act of 2002. The goal of this \nlegislation is to help provide safe and efficient transportation \nthroughout Indian country. At the same time, this bill will help \npromote economic development, self-determination, and employment of \nIndians and Alaska Natives. I believe the Federal Government has an \nobligation to provide safe and efficient transportation for all tribes. \nIndians pay the same Federal gasoline, tire, and other taxes, as all \nother Americans and are entitled to the same quality of transportation.\n  This bill is a 6-year reauthorization and improvement of the Indian \nReservation Roads program, which funds transportation programs for all \ntribes. Next year, Congress must reauthorize\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\nthe IRR program, along with all other transportation programs in TEA-\n21. I am introducing the bill today as a first step in that process.\n  Congress has long recognized the importance of improving \ntransportation and access to tribal lands. The Indian Reservation Roads \nProgram was established in 1928, and in 1946 the BIA and the FHWA \nexecuted the first memorandum of agreement for joint administration of \nthe program. Since 1982, funding for tribal transportation programs as \nbeen provided from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Major changes to the \nprogram were again made in 1998 as part of TEA-21.\n  Today, the Indian Reservation Roads program serves more than 560 \nfederally recognized Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages in 33 \nStates. The IRR system comprises 25,700 miles of BIA and tribally owned \nroads and another 25,600 miles of State, county, and local government \npublic roads. There are also 4,115 bridges on the IRR system, and one \nferryboat operation, the Inchelium-Gifford Ferry in Washington State.\n  Of the 25,700 miles of BIA and tribal roads on the IRR system, only \nabout one quarter are paved. Only about 40 percent of the 25,600 miles \nof state, county, or local government IRR roads are paved. Together, \nover two-thirds of all IRR roads are unpaved. Many of these unpaved \nroads are not passable in bad weather. In addition, about 140 of the \n753 bridges owned by the BIA are currently rated as deficient.\n  Some of the roads on tribal lands resemble roads in third-world \ncountries. In some cases, the roads are little more than wheel tracks. \nEven though the IRR system perhaps the most rudimentary of any \ntransportation network in the country, over 2 billion vehicle miles are \nannually traveled on the system.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration's most recent \nassessment of the Nation's highways, bridges, and transit, only 34 \npercent of paved IRR roads are rated in good condition, 37 percent are \nrated only fair, and 29 percent are rated poor. Of course, these \nratings apply only to the paved roads on the IRR system, not the 33,000 \nmiles of dirt and gravel roads.\n  The poor road quality also has a serious impact on highway safety. \nAccording to FHWA, the highway fatality rate on Indian Reservation \nRoads is four times above the national average. Automobile accidents \nare the number one cause of death among young American Indians.\n  Reflecting the current poor state of roads throughout the Indian \ncountry, FHWA now estimates the backlog of improvement needs for IRR \nroads at a whopping $6.8 billion dollars.\n  This year, the authorized funding level for IRR is $275 million from \nthe highway trust fund. As required in TEA-21, the BIA distributes \nhighway funding to federally recognized tribes each year using a \nrelative need formula. This formula reflects the cost to improve \neligible roads, road usage, and population of each tribe. Some \nmodifications to the formula are currently being made as part of a \nnegotiated rule making.\n  I hope all Senators recognize the broad scope of the IRR program and \nits impact on 33 of the 50 States. I'd like to read a list of the \nfiscal year 2002 distribution of IRR funding in the States that have \ntribal roads and ask unanimous consent that the table be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     EXHIBIT 1.--APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION OF FISCAL YEAR 2002 INDIAN\n                        RESERVATION ROAD FUNDING\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Funding to\n                          State                               tribes\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArizona.................................................     $56,100,000\nOklahoma................................................      34,000,000\nNew Mexico..............................................      31,900,000\nAlaska..................................................      18,500,000\nMontana.................................................      13,600,000\nSouth Dakota............................................      11,700,000\nWashington..............................................      10,100,000\nWisconsin...............................................       6,600,000\nNorth Dakota............................................       6,500,000\nMinnesota...............................................       5,780,000\nCalifornia..............................................       5,100,000\nOregon..................................................       3,900,000\nUtah....................................................       2,970,000\nIdaho...................................................       2,850,000\nWyoming.................................................       2,070,000\nMichigan................................................       1,560,000\nNevada..................................................       1,290,000\nNorth Carolina..........................................       1,190,000\nColorado................................................       1,100,000\nNew York................................................         949,000\nMaine...................................................         890,000\nKansas..................................................         851,000\nMississippi.............................................         706,000\nNebraska................................................         626,000\nFlorida.................................................         550,000\nTexas...................................................         220,000\nLouisiana...............................................         197,000\nRhode Island............................................         162,000\nIowa....................................................         126,000\nAlabama.................................................         100,000\nSouth Carolina..........................................          89,000\nConnecticut.............................................          83,000\nMassachusetts...........................................          47,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: BIA. Data are approximate because some reservations and roads\n  extend into more than one state.\n\n  I know every senator is keenly aware of the importance of \ntransportation to the basic quality of life and economic development of \na region. Safe roads are essential for children to get to school, for \nsick and elderly to receive basic health and medical treatment, and for \nfood and other necessities to move to shops and to consumers. Moreover, \ntransportation is critical to any community's efforts to sustain robust \neconomies and to attract new jobs and businesses.\n  Unfortunately, most tribes today lack the basic road systems that \nmost of us take for granted. Indian communities continue to lag behind \nthe rest of the Nation in quality of life and economic vitality. \nUnemployment rates in Indian country frequently top 50 percent and \npoverty rates often exceed 40 percent.\n  The limited availability of housing and jobs on the reservation \nforces people to commute long distances everyday for work, school, \nhealth care, basic government services, shopping, or even to obtain \ndrinking water.\n  I'd now like to take a moment to discuss the impact of the Indian \nReservation Roads Program on just one tribe, the Navajo Nation. I think \nmost senators know that Navajo is the largest federally recognized \nIndian tribe. The current membership is about 280,000. By itself, \nNavajo represents about one quarter of the entire Indian Reservation \nRoads program.\n  The Navajo Reservation covers 17.1 million acres in the States of \nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. It is roughly the size of the State of \nWest Virginia. The reservation includes the three satellite communities \nof Alamo, Ramah, and To'hajiilee in New Mexico.\n  According to BIA, the Navajo IRR system includes 9,800 miles of \npublic roads, or about 20 percent of all IRR roads. However, 78 percent \nof the roads within Navajo are unpaved. Because of the nature of the \nsoil and terrain, many of the unpaved roads are impassable after snow \nor rain. Navajo estimates a current backlog of road construction \nprojects totaling $2 billion.\n  The safety of bridges is also a continuing concern on the Navajo \nreservation. Of the 173 bridges on Navajo, 51 are rated deficient. Of \nthe deficient bridges, 27 must be completely replaced and the rest need \nmajor rehabilitation.\n  The Navajo Nation also operates a transit system with 14 buses and \nthree vans. The system carries 75,000 passengers each year. The system \nserves both Navajo people as well as the nearby communities of Gallup, \nFarmington, Flagstaff, and Winslow.\n  Finally, the few roads that are being built on the Navajo Reservation \nare not being properly maintained. Funding for road maintenance is not \npart of the IRR program. Instead road maintenance is funded each year \nas part of the BIA's annual appropriation bill. Unfortunately, BIA's \nbudget lags woefully behind the need for road maintenance. Each year \nthe Navajo Region of BIA requests about $32 million to maintain about \n6000 miles of roads, but receives only about $6 million, or about 20 \npercent of the funds needed just to maintain the existing roads.\n  The bill I am introducing today will begin to address this crushing \nneed for road construction and transit programs throughout Indian \nCountry. The bill will benefit all tribes, both large and small. I'd \nlike to briefly summarize the major provisions of the bill.\n  First, the bill increases funding for the Indian Reservation Roads \nprogram to $2.775 billion for the six years from 2004 to 2009. Under \nTEA-21, the IRR program is currently authorized for $275 million per \nyear. This level represents less than 1 percent of annual Federal \nfunding for road construction and rehabilitation. However, the 50,000 \nmiles of the IRR system represent about 5 percent of the nation's \n957,000 miles of Federal-aid-highways. I do believe the substantial \nincrease in IRR funding in my bill is fully justified based on the very \npoor condition of so many IRR roads as well as the importance of \ntransportation to economic development in Indian country.\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\n  Second, the bill removes the obligation limitation from the Indian \nReservation Roads program. This funding limitation was first applied to \nthe IRR program in 1998 in TEA-21, and over the six years of TEA-21 the \nlimitation will have cut about $31 million per year in much-needed \nfunding out of IRR. The IRR was not subject to any obligation \nlimitation from 1983 to 1997, and my bill restores the program to the \nstatus it had before 1998.\n  Third, the bill restores the Indian Reservation Bridge Program with \nseparate funding of $90 million over six years. TEA-21 had eliminated \nseparate funding for the Indian reservation bridge program in 1998. In \naddition, the bill streamlines the bridge program by expanding the \nallowable uses of bridge funding to include planning, design, \nengineering, construction, and inspection of Indian reservation road \nbridges.\n  Fourth, the bill increases the current limit for tribal \ntransportation planning from 2 percent to 4 percent. These funds will \nbe used by tribes to compile important transportation data and to \nforecast their future transportation needs and long-range plans. Many \nof the tribes have indicated they currently don't have funding for \ncapacity building, and the additional planning funds in my bill would \naddress this need.\n  Fifth, TEA-21 established a negotiated rule making for distribution \nof funds based on the relative needs of each tribe for transportation. \nTo ensure the distribution is tied to actual needs, my bill requires \nthe Secretary of Transportation to verify the existence of all roads \nthat are part of the Indian reservation road system.\n  Sixth, I propose a new tribal transit program to provide direct \nfunding to tribes from the Federal Transit Administration. The new \nprogram would parallel the existing Indian Reservation Roads program \nfunded through FHWA. In general, while States may allocate to tribal \nareas some of their transit funding under the existing formula grant \nprograms for transit for elderly and disabled, section 5210, and for \nnon-urbanized areas, section 5311, they rarely do so. Because the \ntribes are at a disadvantage in having to compete for funding within \nthe states, I believe we need a direct funding program to allow tribes \nto provide better transit services to young people, elderly, and others \nwho lack access to private vehicles. The bill sets aside a very modest \nlevel of funding of $120 million over six years for the new tribal \ntransit program.\n  Seventh, the bill states the sense of Congress that the BIA should \nhave sufficient funding to maintain all roads on the Indian Reservation \nRoads System. Federal funding for road maintenance is provided through \nthe BIA's annual appropriation bill. Road maintenance has typically \nbeen funded at about $25 million per year, about one-fifth of the level \nneeded to protect the Federal investment in IRR roads.\n  Finally, the bill increases funding for the successful school bus \nroute maintenance program for counties in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah \nthat maintain roads used by school buses on the Navajo Reservation. The \nfunding over six years is $24 million. Without this funding many of the \nchildren on the reservation would often not be able to get to school. I \nask unanimous consent that a letter from Gallup McKinley County Public \nSchools describing this program be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Gallup McKinley County\n\n\n                                               Public Schools,\n\n                                                       Gallup, NM.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Gallup McKinley County Schools \n     serve over 14 thousand students, of which 10,040 are bussed \n     daily. Our District's school buses travel 9,235 miles daily. \n     Several miles of these roads are primitive dirt roads with \n     poor or no drainage, no guard rails, and some not maintained. \n     The inability to safely negotiate school buses over these \n     roads during wet, muddy and snowy conditions, greatly \n     restricts our ability to provide adequate services for \n     families living along these particular roadways. Continuing, \n     and expanding, funding for school bus route maintenance is \n     vital to providing safe and efficient transportation for \n     thousands of students throughout our County.\n       The School bus route maintenance programs have helped \n     tremendously. Our County Roads Division (McKinley County) has \n     been tremendous in maintaining hundreds of miles of bus route \n     roads. The bus route improvements made in the Bread Springs \n     area have benefited families immensely. Along with graveling, \n     they constructed a bus turnaround. Improvements have also \n     been made and maintained in other areas in our County such as \n     Rock Springs. This bus route was graveled along with a \n     graveled bus turnaround. In Rock Springs, Mexican Springs, \n     Coyote Canyon, and County Road 1 areas, similar improvements \n     were made, allowing us to provide safe and efficient services \n     for hundreds of families.\n       The School bus route program is a very important program, \n     one that should continue and expand. The McKinley County \n     Roads Division has worked diligently to provide safe access \n     and passage for our School District's 160 school buses. \n     Without the school bus route program, it will be impossible \n     to maintain safe conditions on these roads. To insure the \n     safety of our school children and families, the program must \n     continue.\n       Your help in sponsoring bills in the past which address the \n     unique situations with respect to school bus route roads have \n     been greatly appreciated. Your continuing support of the \n     school bus route program will enable our County Roads \n     Division to improve and maintain hundreds of miles of school \n     bus routes.\n       It is through these cooperative efforts that we are able to \n     provide safe and efficient transportation for thousands of \n     school children daily. Thank you for your continued efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ben Chavez,\n                                            GMCS Support Services.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The IRR system doesn't just serve Indian communities, \nbut also visitors, including tourists, recreational, commercial and \nindustrial users of roads and transit throughout Indian country. For \nthe tribes, transportation is an important contributor to economic \ndevelopment, self-determination, and employment for all Indian \ncommunities. This bill represents a very modest, but important step \ntoward providing basic transportation services throughout Indian \ncountry.\n  The proposals in my bill are similar to many of the recommendations \npresented by Chairwoman Robyn Burdette of the Summit Lake Paiute Tribe \nof Nevada at the August 8 hearing of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Infrastructure, and Nuclear Safety of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. In her testimony, Chairwoman Burdette \nspecifically cited the need to remove the obligation limitation, \nincrease funding for the IRR program, create new programs for transit \nand bridges, and increase funding for road maintenance in the Interior \nappropriations bill. All of these items are addressed in my bill.\n  In addition, my bill parallels most of the recommendations in the \nrecent White Paper prepared by the National Congress of American \nIndians' TEA-21 Reauthorization Task Force.\n  I well appreciate that tribes in different regions of the country may \nhave different views and proposals on how best to improve Indian \ntransportation programs. I see my bill as just the first step in a \nyearlong process leading up to the reauthorization of the TEA-21. I do \nbelieve it is important that we start the process as soon as possible, \nand that is my goal in introducing this bill today. I hope that \nChairman Inouye and Senator Campbell of the Committee on Indian Affairs \nwill soon hold hearings on the reauthorization of the Indian \nReservation Roads Program. I look forward to working with them an the \nother members of the committee on developing a consensus proposal that \nis fair to all tribes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to provide for a cooperative research and management \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwould help restore credibility in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, and the National Marine Fisheries Service's, \nNMFS, data collection programs and improve their cooperative research \nand management programs.\n  I am introducing this bill today because of recent events in New \nEngland in which a commercial fisherman noticed that the trawl warps on \nthe NOAA research vessel, Albatross IV, were improperly marked. As a \nresult of this mis-calibration, the groundfish stock assessment data \ngathered since February 2000 may be inaccurate and its usability for \nmanagement purposes is questionable. This fish-counting error could not \nhave come at a worse time for NMFS, which is under a federal judge's \norder to impose some of New England's strictest fishing restrictions by \nnext August.\n  This revelation and the possibility of other discrepancies is \nseverely eroding the credibility of NMFS's stock assessments. These \nstock assessments form the foundation for all of our fisheries \nregulations and determine how many fish our fishermen can harvest. When \nthese stock assessments are flawed and lack credibility, the entire \nprocess is adversely affected. We must act now to restore this \ncredibility in the process and ensure that our stock assessments are as \naccurate as possible.\n  My bill would require the National Research Council to conduct an \nindependent review of NMFS' data collection techniques; its protocols \nthrough which stock assessment equipment is calibrated, operated, \ninspected, and maintained; the frequency and financial cost of these \nquality control checks; how the accuracy and validity of data collected \nwith sampling equipment is verified; and how measurement error is \naccounted for in stock assessment modeling and analysis based on these \ndata. The National Research Council completed a report on the Northeast \nFishery stock assessment process in 1998, so this new study would build \nupon the previous one. This assessment will provide us with an \nindependent baseline to determine the extent of NMFS' data collection \ndiscrepancies.\n  Additionally, my bill will require NMFS to implement a national \ncooperative research program to facilitate industry involvement in data \ncollection and stock assessments. I have also included a section that \nauthorizes $3 million to enable cooperative comparative trawl research \nbetween the NMFS and fishing industry participants in the Northeast \nmulti-species groundfish fishery. The fishing industry has been calling \nfor a commercial vessel to trawl alongside the NOAA's vessels and this \nprovision would require it. Nothing will help restore NMFS's \ncredibility more than having commercial fishermen verifying its data.\n  The third section of this bill would address a flexibility concern \nfor fisheries management. Earlier this year NMFS came out with new \nbiological targets for groundfish. In other words, NMFS increased how \nmany fish there have to be in order for the fishery to be considered \nrecovered. The law is not clear on whether or not a change in the \nbiological targets means the time-line for recovery changes as well. \nNMFS has interpreted the law to mean that despite a change in the \nbiological targets, the fish must be recovered in the same amount of \ntime. Accordingly, I have drafted language which allows, but does not \nrequire, the Secretary to adjust the time allowed for recovery if the \nbiological targets have changed in the middle of the rebuilding plan. \nThis provision would clarify existing law and make Congress' intent \nclearer.\n  As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, and \nFisheries, I am dedicated to ensuring that our stock assessments are as \naccurate as possible and the process we use\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\nis transparent to all the stakeholders. This bill will allow us to take \na critical step forward in ensuring that we can restore credibility and \nfaith in this important process. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nsupport this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW OF DATA COLLECTION \n                   PROCEDURES.\n\n       The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \n     Act is amended by adding at the end of Title IV the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 408. PEER REVIEW.\n\n       ``The National Academy of Sciences shall review and \n     recommend measures for improving National Marine Fisheries \n     Service's procedures for ensuring data quality in the data \n     collection phase of the stock assessment program.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at Fifth \nand Richardson Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico, as the ``Joe Skeen \nFederal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nrename the Federal courthouse in Roswell, New Mexico for my longtime \nfriend and ally, Representative Joe Skeen.\n  I have had the highest honor of serving the State of New Mexico with \nthis amazing man for more than 20 years. Joe was first elected to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1980 as a write-in candidate. He is only \nthe third man in the history of this country to achieve this feat.\n  As great an accomplishment as this was, history will show that it was \namong the least of his great achievements. As I'm sure you can imagine, \nthe litany of successes that Joe has had in his work for New Mexico is \nmuch too long to go into here today. Suffice it to say that New Mexico \nis infinitely better for having had Joe Skeen representing us in \nCongress; this country is better for having had Joe participate in \nmaking decisions that affect the entire nation.\n  Joe will be the first to tell you that he has not done it on his own, \nhowever. He has had a partner in his great adventure who has walked \nbeside him every step of the way. Mary, his wife of 57 years, has been \na calming influence in the storm that is the life of a Congressman. She \nhas made it possible for Joe to continue to be a ranching \nRepresentative, running the family ranch while Joe has served in \nWashington.\n  Joe has decided that it is time to return to that ranch to spend time \nwith the family and the land that he loves so much. I know that \nWashington will go on without the Skeens but there is no way that it \nwill be as a good a place.\n  It is only a small token of the appreciation New Mexico and this \ncountry have for his many years of service, but I believe that renaming \nthe Federal Courthouse in Roswell, New Mexico is a fitting tribute to \nthis exceptional public servant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Federal building located at Fifth and Richardson \n     Avenues in Roswell, New Mexico, shall be known and designated \n     as the ``Joe Skeen Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Joe Skeen Federal Building.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2980. A bill to revise and extend the Birth Defects Prevention Act \nof 1998; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Birth \nDefects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2002. It is a \npleasure to work, once again, on this important issue with Senators \nDodd, Kennedy and Frist.\n  My interest in birth defects prevention began while I was Governor. \nAs Governor I had secured dollars to fund the neonate care units at our \nhospitals in Missouri. These remarkable institutions and the dedicated \nmen and women who serve there do a tremendous job of saving low birth \nweight babies and babies with severe birth defects.\n  As I visited those hospitals and held those tiny babies, the doctors \nand nurses who staffed these units asked me, ``Why don't we do \nsomething to reduce the incidents of birth defects and the problems \nthat bring the tiniest of infants to these very high-tech, specialized \ncare units.''\n  Since I became a Senator I have been working with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and with the March of Dimes to deal with this \nserious and compelling health problem facing America. Many people are \nnot aware that birth defects affect over 3 percent of all births in \nAmerica, and they are the leading cause of infant death.\n  This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a \nbirth defect. Among the babies who survive, birth defects often result \nin lifelong disability. Medical care, special education, and many other \nservices are often required into adulthood, costing families thousands \nof dollars each year.\n  In 1992, due to a terrible tradegy in Texas when at least 30 infants \nwere born without or with little brain tissue over a short period of \ntime, I introduced the Birth Defects Prevention Act.\n  Because at the time Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance \nsystem, and because our country did not have a comprehensive birth \ndefects prevention and surveillance strategy, the severity of the \nproblem was not\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nrecognized until the incidence of birth defects was so high that it was \ndifficult to miss.\n  In 1998, we passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which created a \nfederal birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy. That was \nfollowed by the Children's Health Act of 2000, which established the \nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at CDC. \nWith these two important pieces of legislation Congress for the first \ntime recognized that birth defect and developmental disabilities are \nmajor threats to children's health.\n  As a result, CDC, through eight regional Centers for Birth Defects \nResearch and Prevention are collaborating on the largest study on the \ncauses of birth defects ever undertaken, the National Birth Defects \nPrevention Study. CDC is also assisting 28 States by providing 3-year \ngrants to improve their surveillance systems. We have come a long way \nin the past 5 years toward preventing certain birth defects, but we \nface many challenges ahead.\n  There is still much work to be done to improve the health of all \nAmericans by preventing birth defects and developmental disabilities in \nchildren, promoting optimal child development and ensuring health and \nwellness among child and adults living with disabilities.\n  Today, with the introduction of this bill we have the opportunity to \nrenew our commitment to birth defects prevention and to improve the \nquality of life of those living with disabilities. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure and enhance the well-being of our \nNation's children.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senators Bond and \nDodd in re-introducing the ``Birth Defects and Developmental \nDisabilities Prevention Act of 2002''. This bill reauthorizes the \nNational Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDD) \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote optimal \nfetal, infant, and child development and prevent birth defects and \nchildhood developmental disabilities.\n  Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United \nStates, accounting for more than 20% of all infant deaths. Of the \n150,000 babies born with a birth defect in the United States each year, \n8000 will die during their first year of life. In addition, birth \ndefects are the fifth-leading cause of years of potential life lost and \ncontribute substantially to childhood morbidity and long-term \ndisability.\n  Congress passed the ``Birth Defects Prevention Act in 1998''--a bill \nto assist States in developing, implementing, or expanding community-\nbased birth defects tracking systems, programs to prevent birth \ndefects, and activities to improve access to health services for \nchildren with birth defects. The authorization for this important \nlegislation for this important legislation expires at the end of this \nyear, and the legislation we are introducing today will strengthen \nthose important programs.\n  In order to educate health professionals and the general public, this \nlegislation requires NCBDD to provide information on the incidence and \nprevalence of individuals living with birth defects and disabilities, \nany health disparities, experienced by such individuals, and \nrecommendations for improving the health and wellness and quality of \nlife of such individuals. The Clearinghouse will also contain a summary \nof recommendations from all birth defects research conferences \nsponsored by the agency including conferences related to spina bifida.\n  This legislation also clarifies advisory committees, already in \nexistence, that have expertise in birth defects, developmental \ndisabilities, and disabilities and health will be transferred to the \nNational Center for Birth Defects.\n  This piece of legislation also supports a National Spina Bifida \nProgram to prevent and reduce suffering from the nation's most common \npermanently disabiling birth defect.\n  I ask that this piece of important legislation be reauthorized. I \nwant to thank my colleagues, Senators Bond, Dodd, and others, for the \nintroduction of this initial piece of legislation in 1998 and for their \ncontinued initiatives on birth defects and developmental disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 2981. A bill to exclude certain wire rods from the scope of any \nanti-dumping or countervailing duty order issued as a result of certain \ninvestigations relating to carbon and certain alloy steel rods; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WIRE RODS FROM ANTIDUMPING \n                   AND COUNTERVAILING DUTY ORDERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any antidumping or countervailing duty order that is \n     issued as a result of antidumping investigations A-351-832, \n     A-122-840, A-428-832, A-560-815, A-201-830, A-841-805, A-274-\n     804, and A-823-812, or countervailing duty investigations C-\n     351-833, C-122-841, C-428-833, C-274-805, and C-489-809, \n     relating to carbon and certain alloy steel rods, shall not \n     include wire rods that meet the American Welding Society \n     ER70S-6 classification and are used to produce Mig Wire.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     applies with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from \n     warehouse for consumption, on or after the 15th day after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Fitztgerald, Mr. Sarbanes, and \n        Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2982. A bill to establish a grant program to enhance the financial \nand retirement literacy of mid-life and older Americans and to reduce \nfinancial abuse and fraud among such Americans, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nFitzgerald, Sarbanes, and Akaka to introduce the Education for \nRetirement Security Act of 2002. This bill will provide access to badly \nneeded financial and retirement education for millions of mid-life and \nolder Americans whose retirement security is at stake.\n  Improving financial literacy has been a top priority for me in \nCongress. I believe it is a critical and complex task for Americans of \nall ages, but it is especially crucial for Americans as they approach \nretirement. In fact, low levels of savings and high levels of personal \nand real estate debt are serious problems for many households nearing \nretirement. Although today's older Americans are generally thought to \nbe doing well, nearly one-out-of five, 18 percent, were living below \n125 percent of the poverty line in 1995, which was a year of tremendous \neconomic prosperity in our nation. And, only 53 percent of working \nAmericans have any form of pension coverage. In addition, financial \nexploitation is the largest single category of abuse against older \nindividuals, and this population comprises more than one-half of all \ntelemarketing victims in the United States.\n  While education alone cannot solve our Nation's retirement woes, \nfinancial education is vital to enabling individuals to avoid scams and \nbad investment, mortgage, and pension decisions, and to ensuring that \nthey have access to the tools they need to make sound financial \ndecisions and prepare appropriately for a secure future. Indeed, the \nmore limited time frame that mid-life and older Americans have in which \nto assess the realities of their individual circumstances, recover from \nbad economic choices, and to benefit from more informed financial \npractices make this education all the more critical. Financial literacy \nis also particularly important for older women, who are more likely to \nlive in poverty and be dependent upon Social Security.\n  The Education for Retirement Security Act would create a competitive \ngrant program that would provide resources to State and area agencies \non aging and nonprofit community based organizations to provide \nfinancial education programs to mid-life and older Americans. The goal \nof these programs is to enhance these individuals' financial and \nretirement knowledge and reduce their vulnerability to financial abuse \nand fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, and pension fraud.\n  My legislation also authorizes the creation of a national technical \nassistance program that would designate at least one national nonprofit \norganization that has substantial experience in\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nthe field of financial education to provide training and make available \ninstructional materials and information that promotes financial \neducation.\n  Over the next thirty years, the percentage of Americans aged 65 and \nolder is expected to double, from 35 million to nearly 75 million. \nEnsuring that these individuals are better prepared for retirement and \nare more informed about the economic decisions they face during \nretirement will have an important impact on the long term economic and \nsocial well-being of our nation.\n  I hope that as the Senate moves to address pension reform, my \ncolleagues will work to address the issues outlined in this \nlegislation. The recent rash of corporate and accounting scandals and \nthe declining stock market have jeopardized the retirement savings of \nmillions of Americans, making the need for financial literacy even more \nclear.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge the expertise and assistance \nthat AARP, the Older Women's League, OWL, and the Women's Institute for \na Secure Economic Retirement, WISER, offered to me in drafting this \nlegislation.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2982\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education for Retirement \n     Security Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Improving financial literacy is a critical and complex \n     task for Americans of all ages.\n       (2) Low levels of savings and high levels of personal and \n     real estate debt are serious problems for many households \n     nearing retirement.\n       (3) Only 53 percent of working Americans have any form of \n     pension coverage. Three out of four women aged 65 or over \n     receive no income from employer-provided pensions.\n       (4) The more limited timeframe that mid-life and older \n     individuals and families have to assess the realities of \n     their individual circumstances, to recover from counter-\n     productive choices and decisionmaking processes, and to \n     benefit from more informed financial practices, has immediate \n     impact and near term consequences for Americans nearing or of \n     retirement age.\n       (5) Research indicates that there are now 4 basic sources \n     of retirement income security. Those sources are social \n     security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance \n     coverage, and, for an increasing number of older individuals, \n     necessary earnings from working during one's ``retirement'' \n     years.\n       (6) The $5,000,000,000,000 loss in stock market equity \n     values since 2000 has had a significantly negative effect on \n     mid-life and older individuals and on their pension plans and \n     retirement accounts, affecting both individuals with plans to \n     retire and those who are already in retirement.\n       (7) Although today's older individuals are generally \n     thought to be doing well, nearly \\1/5\\ (18 percent) of such \n     individuals were living below 125 percent of the poverty line \n     during a year of national prosperity, 1995.\n       (8) Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals \n     in the United States is expected to double, from 35,000,000 \n     to nearly 75,000,000, and long-term care costs are expected \n     to skyrocket.\n       (9) Financial exploitation is the largest single category \n     of abuse against older individuals and this population \n     comprises more than \\1/2\\ of all telemarketing victims in the \n     United States.\n       (10) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Identity Theft Data \n     Clearinghouse has reported that incidents of identity theft \n     targeting individuals over the age of 60 increased from 1,821 \n     victims in 2000 to 5,802 victims in 2001, a threefold \n     increase.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 328\n\n       Whereas parents play an indispensable role in the rearing \n     of their children;\n       Whereas good parenting is a time consuming, emotionally \n     demanding task that is essential not only to the health of a \n     household but to the well-being of our Nation;\n       Whereas without question, the future of our Nation depends \n     largely upon the willingness of mothers and fathers, however \n     busy or\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\n     distracted, to embrace their parental responsibilities and to \n     vigilantly watch over and guide the lives of their children;\n       Whereas mothers and fathers must strive tirelessly to raise \n     children in an atmosphere of decency, discipline, and \n     devotion, where encouragement abounds and where kindness, \n     affection, and cooperation are in plentiful supply;\n       Whereas the journey into adulthood can be perilous and \n     lonely for a child without stability, direction, and \n     emotional support;\n       Whereas children benefit enormously from parents with whom \n     they feel safe, secure, and valued, and in an environment \n     where parent and child alike can help one another achieve joy \n     and fulfillment on a variety of levels; and\n       Whereas a safe and secure domestic climate contributes \n     significantly to a child's development into a healthy, well-\n     adjusted adult, and it is imperative that the general \n     population not underestimate the favorable impact that \n     positive parenting can have on society as a whole: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 22 through September \n     28, 2002, as ``National Parents Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe that \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, to submit a resolution \ndesignating September 22 through September 28, as ``National Parents \nWeek.''\n  As proud parents of eight children and now seven grandchildren, my \nwife, Fran, and I know that our Nation's future is in the hands of all \nchildren. To safeguard this future, parents must fulfill many demanding \nresponsibilities. They must teach their children values, participate in \ntheir education, encourage their dreams, and comfort them in times of \nneed. As any parent knows, this is not easy. It takes dedication, \nconstant attention, and unconditional love. This resolution serves as a \n``thank you'' to all parents across the nation working hard, day after \nday, to provide for their children emotionally, physically, \nspiritually, and materially.\n  It is very common today for a single parent to be solely tasked with \nthe responsibility for raising his or her children. This month we have \nall remembered the over 100 babies who were born to widowed mothers \nafter the tragic events of September 11, babies who will never know \ntheir fathers. We've also remembered the countless children who have \nbeen left fatherless or motherless due these events. Indeed, these \nsingle parents have an extremely challenging job ahead.\n  Studies indicate that children in families maintained by one parent \nface more challenges and are more likely than children raised in two-\nparent homes to do poorly in school, have emotional and behavioral \nproblems, become teenage parents, and have poverty-level incomes as \nadults. These frightening facts, once again, show us that strong \nparental involvement is vital to children's development and long-term \nsuccess.\n  Knowing the many risks kids face today, parents are increasingly \ngetting involved in their children's lives from talking with them about \ndrugs to making sure their homework is done to getting to know their \nchild's friends and teachers. This resolution is important to let \nparents know that we are grateful to them and support them in their \ntasks. Parenthood is, at minimum, an eighteen-year full-time job, and \ntakes unending commitment to ensure a bright and promising future for \nour country's children. And so today, I thank parents on behalf of a \ngrateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/19/senate-section/article/S8934-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 142--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS AND \nIDEAS OF A DAY OF TRIBUTE TO ALL FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE LINE \n      OF DUTY AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT MISSION OF THE FALLEN \n  FIREFIGHTERS FOUNDATION IN ASSISTING FAMILY MEMBERS TO OVERCOME THE \n                       LOSS OF THE FALLEN HEROES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

This includes 23 million acres that are \n     in strategic areas designated by the Forest Service and the \n     Department of the Interior for emergency treatment to \n     withstand catastrophic fire.\n       (3) The forest management policy of fire suppression has \n     resulted in an accumulation of fuel loads, dead and dying \n     trees, and non-native species that creates fuel ladders which \n     allow fires to reach the crowns of large old trees and cause \n     catastrophic fire.\n       (4) The Forest Service and the Department of Interior \n     should immediately undertake an emergency forest grooming \n     program to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall conduct immediately and to \n     completion projects consistent with the Implementation Plan \n     for the 10-year Comprehensive Strategy for a Collaborative \n     Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and \n     the Environment, dated May 2002, developed pursuant to the \n     Conference Report to the Department of the Interior and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY 2001 (H.

Any project carried out \n     pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the \n     applicable forest plan, resource management plan, or other \n     applicable agency plans.\n       (c) Priority.--In implementing projects under this section, \n     the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall give highest priority to--\n       (1) wildland urban interface areas;\n       (2) municipal watersheds; or\n       (3) forested or rangeland areas affected by disease, insect \n     activity, wind throw, or areas subject to catastrophic reburn\n       (d) Acreage Limitation.--In implementing this section, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall treat an aggregate area of not more than 2.5 million \n     acres of federal land. This amount is in addition to the \n     existing hazardous fueled reduction program that treats \n     approximately 2.5 million acres each year.\n       (e) Process.--The Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall jointly develop a \n     collaborative process with interested parties consistent with \n     the Implementation Plan described in subsection (b) for the \n     selection of projects carried out under this section \n     consistent with subsection (c).

The amount of the \n     share of funds reallocated under this paragraph for any \n     metropolitan city or urban county shall bear the same ratio \n     to the total of such reallocated funds in the metropolitan \n     area as the amount of funds awarded to the city or county for \n     the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds become \n     available bears to the total amount of funds awarded to all \n     metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same \n     metropolitan area for that fiscal year.\n       (2) Transfer.--Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph \n     (1), the Director may upon request transfer responsibility to \n     any metropolitan city for the administration of any amounts \n     received, but not obligated, by the urban county in which \n     such city is located if--\n       (A) such city was an included unit of general local \n     government in such county prior to the qualification of such \n     city as a metropolitan city;\n       (B) such amounts were designated and received by such \n     county for use in such city prior to the qualification of \n     such city as a metropolitan city; and\n       (C) such city and county agree to such transfer of \n     responsibility for the administration of such amounts.\n       (d) Allocation to States on Behalf of Non-qualifying \n     Communities.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the amount approved in an appropriation \n     Act under section ____04 that remains after allocations \n     pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), 30 \n     percent shall be allocated among the States for use in \n     nonqualifying areas. The allocation for each State shall be \n     based on the population of that State, relative to the \n     populations of all States, excluding the population of \n     qualifying communities.
