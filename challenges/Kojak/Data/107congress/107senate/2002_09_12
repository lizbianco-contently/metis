The Senate is going to vote on Timothy Corrigan to be a \ndistrict judge for the middle district of Florida. Following \ndisposition of that nomination, we will go to the Interior bill; that \nis, the pending Craig amendment. The Dodd amendment also has been \noffered. We hope there can be some resolution of the forest amendment. \nIf we could do something about the fire suppression amendments that are \naround, the Craig amendment and there is another to be offered, we \ncould resolve this bill quickly. It appears at this stage that has not \nbeen done yet.\n  After 2 o'clock, we hope there will be a couple of back-to-back \nvotes. They have been cleared on this side and tentatively cleared on \nthe other side to vote on the Thompson amendment and also on the \nHollings amendment. That has not quite been done yet, but Members \nshould understand there very possibly could be votes at 2 o'clock \ntoday.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I think the leader has certainly appropriately explained \nwhere we are with the Craig-Domenici amendment and our efforts. We have \nmet consistently over the last several days with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to see if we could strike a bipartisan agreement. At \nthis time we are working with Senator Feinstein and Senator Wyden to \nsee if we can come together so they can come to your caucus to \ndetermine whether we can pick up support in a bipartisan way.\n  We would like to have the remainder of the day to work. At the same \ntime, I recognize the frustration holding up the Interior \nappropriations bill for this purpose. I think both the Senator and I \nrecognize the critical character of what we are trying to do here--or \nthe nature of it--in resolving this issue. If you can give us a little \nmore flexibility, I think at some point--probably by the end of the \nday--we will know whether we can or cannot go any further.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is really a waste of the Senate's time to \ndebate his amendment today and, further, we pretty well know the \nrespective positions. Senator Byrd will be here to manage the bill this \nmorning. I know he has an amendment to offer, as others do. Maybe there \ncould be an agreement made to set aside the Senator's amendment, \nrecognizing that it would be the matter before the Senate at any time \nyou call it. We will try to work on something like that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator saying that. I am certainly \nwilling to look at that and allow other amendments that the chairman \nwould think are appropriate to move on this amendment--to move without \nit being an obstruction.\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\n  The Senator is right, this issue is defining it. I will probably want \nto speak on it, and others may want to do the same. We have at least a \n2-hour timeframe to get some work done. I hope we can do it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't mean to say that anybody speaking \non the amendment is a waste of time. I meant to say there is no need to \nbe speaking unnecessarily when we can do other things. If the Senator \nor people who oppose his amendment want to speak, that will be helpful \nto the Senate. What I am saying to the Senator from Idaho is, you don't \nneed to maintain the floor to protect your rights, nor do we. I have \nreceived calls, as has the majority leader, from some Democratic \nSenators who believe there may be some ability to work out a \ncompromise.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Good. I thank the Senator for saying that. I did not take \nthat characterization in any critical way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8510-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will go into executive session to proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 960, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Timothy J. Corrigan, of \nFlorida, to be United States District Judge for the Middle District of \nFlorida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to the Senator \nfrom Vermont in his capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks on the United States. Americans, very appropriately, honored \nthe memory of the brave men and women who died in that terrible time. \nOur thoughts were and are with those who perished that day, the loved \nones they left behind, and the heroes who acted with fearlessness, \nbravery and hope.\n  The world has changed during the last year, but, fortunately, the \nprinciples on which this country was founded have not changed. I want \nto especially commend Chief Judge William Sessions of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Vermont for proceeding with an immigration \nand naturalization ceremony in Vermont yesterday. What a wonderful \ngesture, granting citizenship to a new group of Americans and reminding \nus that we are a nation of immigrants and that our borders are open to \nimmigrants who come to America seeking freedom, opportunity and a \nbetter life for their children. Whether our relatives came here for \nreligious or political freedom in the 17th or 18th centuries, or to \nescape famine and persecution in the 19th and 20th centuries, many of \nus are descendants of those immigrants. Senator Kennedy reminded us all \nearlier this year that immigrants are not the problem, terrorists are \nthe problem. When the President appeared last night on Ellis Island, \nframed against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty, that setting \nlikewise reminds us that we are a nation of immigrants. Let this \ncountry, and what it stands for, always be a beacon of hope and freedom \nfor the oppressed and downtrodden.\n\n  I am glad to see the President before the U.N. today. When our \nPresident speaks before the United Nations, we should not be looking at \nit as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We want him, in his \nrepresentation of our Nation and as our chief spokesperson on foreign \npolicy, to be successful, and I wish him that success. I also \nappreciate his invitation to be there for the speech. Of course, our \nSenate votes will keep me here.\n  The Judiciary Committee continues working hard to make progress on \njudicial nominations and on legislation to respond to the new \nchallenges that face our great nation. The Senate met on September 12 \nlast year, and the Judiciary Committee held a business meeting on \nSeptember 13. I kept the agenda that day to consensus items and \nbipartisan legislation. I felt strongly that we did not need partisan \nbickering but that we needed to come together and show that we can \nunite and that there is much that unites us all. We were able to report \nthe first United States Attorneys nominated by President Bush. We \nworked on our bill to authorize the activities of the Department of \nJustice, a bipartisan drug use prevention, treatment and rehabilitation \nbill and the bipartisan Drug Competition Act.\n  That same afternoon we held a confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations, including a judicial nominee from Mississippi. Just as we \ncontinued to meet and work in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on \nSeptember 11, we also proceeded with hearings through and in the \nimmediate aftermath of the receipt of the anthrax letters sent to \nMajority Leader Daschle and to me.\n  We worked hard to improve what became the USA PATRIOT Act with \nbipartisan support in the weeks that followed in September and into \nlate October. In addition to our work on this landmark legislation, as \nwell as continued oversight of the Justice Department, the FBI and the \nINS, we continued to hold judicial nominations hearings to help fill \nvacancies in our Federal courts with fair-minded judges.\n  We have now reported 80 judicial nominees out of committee. With \ntoday's confirmation of Judge Corrigan for the Middle District of \nFlorida, we will confirm our 75th judicial nomination from President \nGeorge W. Bush. We have confirmed more of President Bush's nominees in \nless than 15 months--75--than were confirmed in the last 30 months that \na Republican majority controlled the Senate and the pace of judicial \nconfirmations--73. We have also now confirmed more of President George \nW. Bush's judicial nominations since July, 2001--75--than were \nconfirmed in all of 1989 and 1990, the first 2 years of the term of his \nfather President George H.W. Bush--73.\n  As I have noted through the year, we could have accomplished even \nmore with a modicum of cooperation from the White House. I regret that \nthe administration and some Senate Republicans have been unwilling to \nacknowledge what we have accomplished in this regard but have, instead, \nchosen a strident posture and rejected our efforts toward bipartisan \ncooperation. The administration has chosen division rather than \nconsensus with respect to its selection of Federal judges, which is \nunfortunate and unnecessary. The White House has insisted on sending \nforth a number of nominees who are divisive. Their records evidence \njudicial activism to reach ultra-conservative outcomes. Thus, in \naddition to reporting favorably 80 judicial nominees since the change \nin majority, the Judiciary Committee has, after a hearing and careful \nconsideration, voted against reporting two nominations.\n\n  I regret that with respect to the important matter of our independent \nFederal judiciary, a matter that affects all Americans, the White House \nhas chosen the path of partisanship. I regret that some in the White \nHouse and among Republicans would rather raise campaign funds and stir \nup their most extreme supporters than fill judicial vacancies quickly \nwith consensus nominees.\n  Senate Republicans are running away from their own record. It is \nrevealing that they refuse to make a fair comparison to the actual \nresults during their most recent period of Senate control, which shows \nstarkly how far we have come. Had they, in the 6\\1/2\\ years they were \nin the Senate majority, acted as fairly and as quickly on President \nClinton and President Bush's judicial nominees as we have, we would \nhave far fewer vacancies.\n  The truth is that we have done about twice as much as they. With \ntoday's vote, the Democratic-led Senate will confirm its 75th judge--\nexceeding the\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\nnumber of circuit and district court nominees the Republican Senate \nmajority was willing to confirm in the last 30 months of their control \nof the process. Democrats have done more than Republicans did in less \nthan half the time. Likewise, in less than 15 months of Democratic \ncontrol of the committee, we have held more hearings, for more \nnominees, and voted on more nominees in committee, and the Senate has \nconfirmed more nominees, than the Republicans did in their first 15 \nmonths of control of the committee in 1995 and 1996.\n  That today the Senate will confirm the 75th judge since July, 2001, \nis indication both of what we have been able to accomplish and what \ncould be accomplished with some cooperation from the White House and \nSenate Republicans. I have noted how simple procedural accommodations \nthat I suggested would have already resulted in another 10 to 15 fewer \nvacancies and more confirmations.\n  Unfortunately, my efforts to increase cooperation with the White \nHouse have been rebuffed. We continue to get the least cooperation from \nany White House I can recall during my 26 years in the Senate. This is \nnot the way to get judges through the Senate. Rather, with cooperation, \nwith work, with something more than just words, nominees get through.\n  A New York Times editorial this week, on September 10, noted: ``We \nmust fight the enemies of freedom abroad without yielding to those at \nhome.'' We know that the terrorists are our enemy; they attacked all of \nus last September 11 and in the attacks that preceded it on U.S. \nembassies and the USS Cole and the 1993 World Trade Center attack. \nRepublicans are wrong to try to make Democrats or the Judiciary \nCommittee the enemy. We all want to ensure an independent and impartial \nFederal judiciary as a protector of our freedoms. Thus, ends-oriented, \nideologically driven nominees selected to push the circuit courts and \nthe law in a rightward direction are going to be scrutinized and may \nwell be rejected.\n  I hope that, as we did in the days immediately following September \n11, 2001 last year, we can come together and demonstrate unity. Since \nlast July, we have greatly reformed the confirmation process and \nbrought it out of the shadows and into the light of day. We now hold \nhearings, debate nominations, cast our votes, and abide by those votes. \nThat was not the committee practice in the recent past, when secret \nholds and anonymous objections stalled scores of nominees by President \nClinton. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of regularly \nholding hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without \na single hearing. In fact, we have already held 23 judicial nominations \nhearings, including one the week of September 11, 2001, and others \nduring the period in which committee offices and hearing rooms were \nclosed because of the anthrax letters.\n\n  Yesterday I noticed our 24th hearing to be held next week. I intend \nto call Professor Michael McConnell of Utah as a nominee at that \nhearing. Despite the fact that the committee has already acted upon and \nthe Senate has already confirmed Judge Harris Hartz last December and \nJudge Terrence O'Brien this April to the 10th Circuit, the first new \n10th Circuit judges in 7 years, I will proceed with a third hearing on \na 10th Circuit nominee at the request of Senator Hatch. The other \ncircuit court for which we have held hearings on three nominees has \nbeen the 5th Circuit. There, we proceeded with nominees at the request \nof Senator Lott and Senator Hutchison.\n  In addition, at the nominations hearing next week we will hear from \nDistrict Court nominees from California, Delaware, New Jersey, \nTennessee, and Texas. By proceeding next week we are able to proceed \nwith a full complement of District Court nominees. That leaves only one \nDistrict Court nominee with the support of home-State Senators and an \nABA peer review who has not yet been scheduled for a hearing.\n  Today's vote is on the nomination of Judge Corrigan to the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Judge \nCorrigan has an extensive career, serving as a general litigator in \nprivate practice for over 14 years and as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for \nthe Middle District of Florida since 1996. He received a unanimous \n``Well-Qualified'' rating from the ABA and has strong bipartisan \nsupport. While so many nominees of President Clinton had that rating \nbut were never given a vote by the Republican majority, Judge Corrigan \nreceived a hearing and a vote within days of his file being complete in \nJuly.\n  The confirmation of Judge Corrigan today will bring additional \nresources to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nFlorida. Judge Corrigan was nominated to fill a new position Congress \ncreated by statute in 1999 to address the large caseload facing the \nfederal courts in Florida. He makes the second Florida district court \nnominee that we will have confirmed in one week. I congratulate Judge \nCorrigan and his family.\n  During the Clinton administration, we all worked very hard in \ncooperation with Senators Graham and Mack to ensure that the Federal \ncourts in Florida had its vacancies filled promptly with consensus \nnominees and had the judicial resources it needed to handle its \ncaseload. Due to bipartisan cooperation among the Senators and with the \nWhite House, during the Clinton administration, the Senate was able to \nconfirm 22 judicial nominees from Florida, including 3 nominees to the \n11th Circuit. It is most unfortunate that such tradition of \ncooperation, coordination and consultation has not been continued by \nthe current administration.\n  My recollection is that the only Florida nomination that generated \nany controversy or opposition was that of Judge Rosemary Barkett of the \nFlorida Supreme Court to the 11th Circuit. I do recall that Judge \nBarkett was strongly and vociferously opposed by a number of Republican \nSenators because of what they viewed as a judicial philosophy with \nwhich they did not agree. Those voting against her confirmation include \nSenators Hatch, Grassley, McConnell, Specter, and Thurmond, all of whom \nare now on the Judiciary Committee, as well Senators Lott, Nickles, and \nHutchison of Texas. Judge Barkett received the highest rating of the \nABA, ``Well Qualified,'' and yet 36 Republicans voted against her \nconfirmation, but she was confirmed with bipartisan support, including \nthe support of her home-State Senators. Indeed, there was extended \nopposition both before the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor.\n  Unfortunately, the cooperation, coordination and consultation that \nSenator Mack and Senator Graham shared with the Clinton White House do \nnot seem to be the model for the way this White House has chosen to \ncommunicate with Senator Graham and Senator Nelson. That is most \nunfortunate. It is a tribute to Senator Graham and to Senator Nelson \nthat we have made the progress that we have. I know that it has not \nbeen easy. They have been more than gracious in their willingness to \nsupport these nominees. We urge the White House to work with these \nSenators to nominate qualified, consensus nominees for the remaining \nvacancies in the courts.\n  With today's vote, the Democratic majority in the Senate has \ndemonstrated once again how it is fairly and expeditiously considering \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. We have worked very hard to provide \nbipartisan support for the White House's nominations in spite of its \nlack of willingness to work with us in partnership.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nTim Corrigan to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nFlorida.\n  I have had the pleasure to review Judge Corrigan's distinguished \ncareer and I can say, without hesitation, that his confirmation will \nbring to the Federal bench, not just a legal scholar with impeccable \ncredentials, but a caring individual who used his many skills and \ntalents to serve his community and his less fortunate fellow citizens.\n  Tim Corrigan graduated with distinction from Duke University in 1981, \nwhere he was a member of the editorial board of the Duke Law Journal. \nAfter graduation, he served as a law clerk to the Honorable Gerald B. \nTjoflat of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Following his clerkship, Judge Corrigan spent 14 years in private \npractice with a prominent Jacksonville law firm, where he focused on \ncivil litigation. He also engaged in a substantial appellate practice, \nincluding preparing\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nappellate briefs and delivering oral argument in several district \ncourts of appeals in Florida, the Supreme Court of Florida, and the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Moreover, Judge \nCorrigan served as co-counsel in a case in the U.S. Supreme Court where \nhe had a primary role in the preparation of the briefs.\n  Judge Corrigan became a U.S. Magistrate Judge in 1996. Because of the \nheavy caseload of the Middle District of Florida, the magistrate judges \nare entrusted with substantial responsibilities. Thus, in addition to \nhandling a broad array of civil and criminal non-dispositive motions, \nhe has conducted numerous evidentiary hearings in criminal cases and \nissued many reports and recommendations regarding dispositive criminal \nmotions. He has also exercised full jurisdiction over Federal civil \ncases, including a lengthy jury trial.\n  Judge Corrigan has published a number of legal writings and recently \nparticipated in a revision of the Middle District of Florida's Civil \nDiscovery Handbook. He has also taught law school classes as an adjunct \ninstructor.\n  Judge Corrigan has been recognized by the Jacksonville Bar \nAssociation for the many hours he has spent doing pro bono work. \nThroughout his career he has volunteered his time for the United Way, \nBig Brothers, the Special Olympics, the Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, \nand the Guardian of Dreams, an organization that provides scholarships \nto low-income students.\n  Judge Corrigan will make a fine member of the Federal Bench.\n  Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the remarks of my \ncolleague from Vermont about the Judiciary Committee's treatment of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n  My colleague from Vermont says that the Judiciary Committee has moved \n80 nominees and only voted against two. This, he says, is a record \nwhich hasn't been equaled in years and years, certainly not during \nPresident Clinton's administration. I am frankly amazed by this \nassertion. In fact, under my chairmanship the Judiciary Committee did \nnot vote against a single nominee. Not a single nominee in the span of \nsix years of Republican control of the Senate. Even when one of \nPresident Clinton's nominees was voted down, the Committee under my \nchairmanship permitted the nomination to go to the floor for a full \nSenate vote. My colleague from Vermont certainly cannot say the same. \nIn the last fifteen months, the Democrat-controlled Judiciary Committee \nhas already voted against two nominees in committee and voted against \nallowing their nominations to go to the floor for a vote. This is not a \nrecord to promote.\n  The real story is the Senate's Democratic leadership is treating \nPresident Bush unfairly when it comes to judicial nominees. Some would \njustify this unfair treatment of President Bush as tit for tat, or \nbusiness as usual, but the American people should not accept such a \nsmokescreen. What the Senate leadership is doing is unprecedented.\n  Historically, a President can count on seeing all of his first 11 \ncircuit court nominees confirmed. Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nall enjoyed a 100-percent confirmation rate on their first 11 circuit \ncourt nominees. In stark contrast, seven of President Bush's first 11 \nnominations are still pending now for almost a year and a half since \nthey were nominated.\n  History also shows Presidents can expect almost all of their first \n100 nominees to be confirmed swiftly. Presidents Reagan, Bush, and \nClinton got 97, 95, and 97, respectively, of their first 100 judicial \nnominations confirmed. I know that is true. I helped to get President \nClinton's 97 of his first 100 judicial nominations confirmed. In this \ncase, the Senate has confirmed only 73 of President Bush's first 100 \nnominees.\n  Some try to blame Republicans for the current vacancy crisis, and \nthat is pure bunk. In fact, the number of judicial vacancies decreased \nby three during the 6 years of Republican leadership of the committee. \nThere were 70 vacancies left by the Democrats when I became chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee in January 1995, and there were 67 at the time \nthe Republicans left.\n  I might add again--I have said it many times, but it needs to be \nsaid--President Reagan was the all-time judicial confirmation champion \nwith 382 judges confirmed. He had 6 years of a Republican--his own \nparty--Senate helping him. President Clinton had virtually the same \nnumber confirmed, 377, and he had 6 years of the opposition party, \nmeaning the Republican Party, to assist him, and he got basically just \nas many as President Reagan. He was treated very fairly, and I know \nbecause I was the Judiciary Committee chairman for those 6 years.\n  Some have tried to blame the White House for the committee's sluggish \npace on nominees, and that again is pure bunk.\n  Specifically, I want to respond to the unbelievable allegations that \nthe White House has failed to consult with home State Senators about \njudicial nominations.\n  In contrast to the claims of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nthere has been an abundance of consultation by the White House with \nhome State Senators. In my 26 years, I have not seen anything like it. \nThe White House has risen above and beyond the call of duty insofar as \nconsultation is concerned.\n\n  My colleagues who complain about the alleged lack of consultation \nfrom the White House really want something else altogether. What they \nwant is for the President to defer to them 100 percent on judicial \nnominations. They want to be the one to nominate judges with only \nminimal, if any, input from the White House.\n  This, of course, would turn the Constitution on its head. The \nConstitution plainly gives the President the power to nominate Federal \njudges. The Senate's role is only that of advice and consent. It is an \nimportant role, but it is certainly not as important as the right to \nnominate judges.\n  Maybe they should offer an amendment to the Constitution if they \nwould like it otherwise, but I know that amendment would not see the \nlight of day.\n  The bottom line is that President Bush will continue to consult in \ngood faith with home State Senators about judicial nominations. He \ndeserves the same courtesy of good faith in return, not the partisan \nrejection of qualified nominees that the committee Democrats have \nhanded him.\n  Mr. President, last week in the Judiciary Committee, one of my \ncolleagues appeared to partially justify his vote against Justice \nPriscilla Owen by claiming that the White House failed to consult him \non the nomination of Judge Reena Raggi from his home State of New York.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the \nWhite House counsel totaling the number of consultations that were made \nwith the distinguished Senator. I think the record needs to be made \nclear.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, September 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hart Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Schumer: I write in response to your statement \n     this morning during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting that \n     you were not consulted by the White House prior to the \n     nomination of Judge Reena Raggi to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit. I was surprised and very \n     disappointed to hear of your comments, given the extensive \n     consultation that took place between us prior to President's \n     Bush's nomination of Judge Raggi in early May, 2002.\n       Our records reflect that beginning in early September, \n     2001--more than eight months before Judge Raggi's nomination \n     was submitted to the Senate--my staff called your office \n     numerous times to seek your input on prospective candidates \n     for the Second Circuit vacancy to which Judge Raggi was \n     ultimately nominated. By early November, 2001, my staff had \n     provided your office with a list of the names of candidates, \n     including Judge Raggi, who we planned to interview for the \n     vacancy.\n       In mid-November, I advised you that we were prepared to \n     submit Judge Raggi's names to the President in advance of \n     commencing an FBI background investigation, Immediately after \n     receiving the President's approval, my staff informed yours \n     that Judge Raggi's names had indeed been submitted to the \n     FBI. At that time, we invited your staff to contact us at any \n     time with any questions or concerns as you reviewed Judge \n     Raggi's qualifications. No such questions or concerns were \n     ever raised.\n       In late April, 2002, upon completion of the FBI background \n     investigation, my staff informed yours of the President's \n     intention to nominate Judge Raggi. Following the nomination, \n     you returned your ``blue slip'' reflecting your support for \n     Judge Raggi's nomination. Today, you joined your colleagues\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\n     on the Judiciary Committee in unanimously voting to approve \n     the nomination.\n       In my view, the extensive consultation that took place \n     between us concerning Judge Raggi's nomination reflects the \n     common practice we have followed to date regarding federal \n     judicial nominations in New York and elsewhere. In light of \n     this record, I find your statements this morning very \n     troubling. I trust that you share my desire to continue the \n     same extensive practice of consultation on federal judicial \n     nominations in New York that has been in place since the \n     President took office. In light of that past practice and the \n     history of Judge Raggi's nomination, I know that you will \n     want to issue a public correction of your statements this \n     morning.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Finally, some might suggest that the Republicans left an \nundue number of nominees pending in committee without hearings at the \nend of the Clinton administration. We did leave 41, which is 13 less \nthan the Democrats left without hearings in 1992 at the end of the Bush \nadministration. In fact, a number of the nominees now who have been \nsubmitted to the committee were submitted by Bush 1 back in the early \nnineties. They were never given a hearing, never given a chance, and \nthey are still being dragged through the mud--not so much the mud, but \nthrough the difficult times of the confirmation process without any \nhearings.\n  President Bush deserves to be treated at least as well as the last \nthree President. Instead of thinking up new ways to rewrite history, \nthe Senate Democratic leadership of the committee should begin \nconfirming President Bush's first 11 and first 100 judicial nominations \nat a pace that matches or exceeds the rate we reached for President \nReagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, and President Clinton.\n  I think it would be fair, and I hope we can some day in the future \nwork it out where both sides on the Judiciary Committee will work \ntogether to see that these nominations are brought to the floor where, \nin an expeditious fashion, the Senate as a whole can decide whether or \nnot to confirm them. We have to work towards that end. I am going to be \ndedicated towards working toward that end.\n  I know there are colleagues on the other side on the Judiciary \nCommittee who would like that as well. I believe it will end a lot of \nthis partisan confusion. Frankly, I hope we can see that the \nConstitution will be implemented and that the Senate as a whole will \ndecide whether or not to confirm these people. If that were the case, I \nhave no doubt that Judge Pickering would have been confirmed to the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I think there is no question that \nJustice Priscilla Owen would have been confirmed to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I have high hopes they will be confirmed in the \nfuture anyway.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Judiciary \nCommittee for recognizing the needs of Florida and favorably reporting \nthe nomination of Judge Timothy Corrigan. Tim Corrigan, an experienced \nJudge in Florida's Middle District, has been nominated to serve as a \nFederal judge in the Middle District of Florida.\n  Tim Corrigan's qualifications make him an excellent candidate for \nservice on the Federal bench. Prior to his appointment as a Magistrate \nJudge, Judge Corrigan spent 14 years in private practice with the \nJacksonville law firm of Bedell, Dittmar, De Vault, Pillans and Coxe, \nP.A. As a Magistrate Judge since 1996, he has considerable experience \nhandling a broad variety of civil and criminal matters, including \nconducting numerous evidentiary hearings and misdemeanor trials.\n  Judge Corrigan received his law degree, with distinction, in 1981 \nfrom Duke University School of Law, where he served as a member of the \neditorial board of the Duke Law Journal. He received his undergraduate \ndegree, with honors, from the University of Notre Dame in 1978.\n  Mr. Corrigan is a member of the Florida Bar, the Jacksonville Bar \nAssociation, the Federal Bar Association and the American Bar \nAssociation. The Jacksonville Bar Association recognized Judge Corrigan \nin 1991 for his pro bono services. From 1987-1989, Judge Corrigan \nserved on the board of Jacksonville Legal Aid and was honored for his \nefforts.\n  I thank my colleagues for considering this nominee. I am confident \nthat they will agree that Judge Timothy Corrigan posses the qualities \nneeded to effectively serve on the Federal Bench.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as Senator Hatch just mentioned, last \nThursday, on September 5, 2002, the Judiciary Committee met in an \nexecutive business meeting and considered the nomination of Texas \nSupreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to be a Federal Court of Appeals \nJudge for the 5th Circuit. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nparticipated in the debate on her nomination and then cast my vote in \nOwen's favor. Unfortunately, Owen's nomination was rejected on a \nstraight party-line vote of nine in favor and ten against. I thought \nthat the issues that had been raised against Justice Owen were \nunfounded. I won't go into Justice Owen's excellent qualifications here \ntoday, nor will I address objections that have been raised regarding \nher nomination.\n  However, had the full Senate engaged in a debate on Justice Owen, and \nI think she deserved such a debate, I would have pointed out \nsignificant mischaracterizations that have been made about her \ndecisions in a series of parental notification cases before the Texas \nSupreme Court. I discussed this issue in the Judiciary Committee \ndebate, so for the information of other Senators who did not have the \nopportunity to participate in that debate, I ask unanimous consent to \nprint my committee statement for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement regarding 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Nominee Justice \n                             Priscilla Owen\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I believe that we are headed for a very \n     momentous vote today and I would like to follow up on a \n     comment made by Senator Feinstein in regard to the closeness \n     of the last election. I would simply say that whether an \n     election is decided by a few votes or whether it is a \n     landslide, the President still has the constitutional duty \n     that is prescribed in the Constitution and the Senate has its \n     constitutional obligation. I candidly do not think that how \n     close an election is or whether it was a landslide matters \n     one bit.\n       Let me talk about Justice Owen's opinions in the Doe cases \n     that Senator Feinstein was talking about. I think we need to \n     put this in its proper perspective. First of all, these are \n     not abortion cases. These are parental notification bypass \n     cases.\n       As we all know, these were a series of Texas Supreme Court \n     cases interpreting a Texas statute that requires a minor to \n     tell one of her parents before she has an abortion. None of \n     these cases had anything to do with whether a woman could get \n     an abortion. That was not before the court. In Texas, as in \n     the rest of the country, women may legally get abortions.\n       The question of a right to abortion is not what these cases \n     were about. The only question in any of these Doe cases was \n     whether a minor child could avoid the requirement of Texas \n     law to get parental consent to tell one of her parents before \n     she got an abortion.\n       The Doe cases came to the Texas Supreme Court only after an \n     act of the Texas Legislature in 1999, when it passed a law \n     that requires parental notification when a minor is seeking \n     an abortion. Let me just reiterate, the Texas legislature \n     created this notice requirement, not the Texas Supreme Court, \n     and certainly not Justice Owen.\n       When the legislature enacted this law, it included a \n     process that a minor could use to circumvent the notice \n     requirement. The legislature looked to the United States \n     Supreme Court and looked to the precedent of the Supreme \n     Court on parental notice rights to craft what was intended to \n     be a limited exception to the parental notice rule, but an \n     exception that was constitutional.\n       The process allowed a teenage girl to go to a State court \n     judge and ask for a ``judicial bypass''. The legislature \n     instructed the court to grant the bypass if the young lady \n     could demonstrate one of the following. Senator Feinstein has \n     outlined these, but I am going to read them again because I \n     think it is important to understand the context of these \n     decisions.\n       One, the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to \n     make the decision to have an abortion performed without \n     notification to either of her parents; OR if she could \n     demonstrate that notification would not be in the best \n     interests of her; OR, three, if she could demonstrate that \n     notification may lead to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse \n     of the minor.\n       Now, while these exceptions appear straightforward, as with \n     all statutes in a common law system--and that is what we are \n     dealing with--the terms are, of course, subject to \n     interpretation by the courts. And I would submit that what we \n     see in the Texas Supreme Court is that give-and-take on the \n     interpretation; that when you look at both the majority and \n     minority opinions in each one of the cases, you will see \n     interpretation. So that should not be the issue.\n       Many, many, many statutes every single day are construed by \n     our courts, and the\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\n     courts are obligated to interpret and apply the statutes as \n     they believe the legislature intended.\n       Senator Feinstein and others at the hearing raised the \n     issue of statutory construction, and basically the charge was \n     that Justice Owen had become a judicial activist. Let me \n     talk, if I could, about some questioning I did of Justice \n     Owen at the hearing on three separate issues.\n       I asked Justice Owen about her analysis of the Texas \n     parental notification statute. She made these three points \n     about decision making in state courts of appeals, and \n     although I think these points are obvious, I would like to \n     repeat them because I think it gives us a better \n     understanding of what the issues are in front of us.\n       I think that it is particularly important for the Committee \n     to consider how the Texas Supreme Court analyzed the Doe \n     cases and whether that analysis was consistent with standard \n     appellate review.\n       First, Justice Owen told me that the Texas Supreme Court \n     applied the standard presumption, something that all courts \n     must apply, that a state legislature is aware of U.S. Supreme \n     Court precedent on an issue on which it is legislating. So in \n     interpreting the statute, both the majority and, in a \n     dissent, Justice Owen applied this rule of construction.\n       The language of the Texas statute tracks closely with \n     language in Supreme Court precedent on the issue. It \n     therefore was simply standard procedure for the justices to \n     look to the U.S. Supreme Court case law to interpret the \n     Texas law. You can't interpret one without the other. It was \n     not an act of activism in any sense. It was merely standard \n     appellate procedure to look at Supreme Court precedent. The \n     only difference in the outcome of the majority's opinion and \n     Justice Owen's dissent in one key case had to do with a \n     pretty nuanced application of the precedent to the facts of \n     the case.\n       Second, another important point Justice Owen made in \n     response to my questions was that appellate courts almost \n     always defer to trial courts on issues of fact. That was \n     Justice Owen's position in the Doe cases and that is the \n     standard applied to fact issues in a vast majority of cases \n     in our country's courts of appeals.\n       That deference is necessary because the trial courts are in \n     a much better position to judge factual issues. The trial \n     courts get to see the witnesses firsthand and to judge their \n     credibility. These Doe cases obviously hinge on that \n     analysis, the analysis by the trial court, the trial court's \n     ability to judge the demeanor of the witnesses, the trial \n     court's determination of the facts. The trial court, for \n     example, had the advantage of actually listening to the \n     teenager's testimony to determine whether she was ``mature'' \n     or not.\n       Now, in all the cases before Judge Owen--I think we need to \n     keep this in mind--in all the cases, when we think about the \n     factual determination that the teenager had not met the \n     requirements for a judicial bypass. The trier of fact had \n     already made that determination.\n       The final point, again to state the obvious, that was \n     brought out in my discussion with Justice Owen was that \n     before the Texas Supreme Court ever heard a parental \n     notification case, a bypass case, a number of judges had \n     already denied the bypass.\n       First, the trial judge would have ruled against the \n     teenager not just once, but really on all three of the ways \n     that she could achieve the bypass. The judge would have had \n     to have found that she had not proven her case on any of the \n     three.\n       Next, a three-judge court of appeals would have ruled \n     against the teenager on these same issues. So before this \n     case ever reached the Texas Supreme Court, the case had \n     already been decided once at the lower court and already \n     decided at the appellate court.\n       I believe these are important points, all of them, all \n     three, about how Justice Owen analyzed the Doe cases. And I \n     think it may be constructive to put these cases in the \n     context of all the bypasses requested by teenage girls in \n     Texas.\n       We don't know the total number and I am not sure really \n     what great significance it has, but we do know that at least \n     657 bypass petitions were filed between January 1, 2000 and \n     March 8, 2002. This is the number of cases in which the Texas \n     Department of Health paid some of the expenses for filing the \n     petition. So it is the minimum number of cases that were just \n     filed.\n       Of all these cases, we ended up with 10, 12 cases that got \n     to the Supreme Court, depending on how you calculate them. \n     Some came up for the second time on review. Of these ten \n     cases, Justice Owen thought the majority of the Texas Supreme \n     Court got it wrong three times. So she is only in the \n     minority three times in the Texas Supreme Court, and in these \n     cases she agreed with both lower courts. I think these are \n     things that we need to keep in mind to put this in its proper \n     perspective.\n       What we are really talking about here is a small handful of \n     cases. A handful of cases in which a minor was required under \n     Texas law to tell one of her parents that she wanted to have \n     an abortion. Justice Owen conducted a perfectly reasonable \n     analysis in her opinions. In three of those cases, she came \n     to a different conclusion than the majority of the court.\n       That conclusion would not, as some would imply, overturn 30 \n     years of abortion precedent. It would simply require each of \n     these three teenage girls to tell one of their parents that \n     they are going to have an abortion. So, in my view, it is \n     ludicrous to think that this is sufficient to disqualify \n     Justice Owen for a seat on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your time. I don't want to take \n     the committee's time to talk about all the other issues. I \n     thought I would just devote my time to that one particular \n     issue.\n  Am I to understand the vote is to occur at 10 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabernow). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I do not want to cut Senator Hatch off \nfrom speaking, but I have to acknowledge that this judge will be \napproved by, I think, a unanimous vote. Unless Senator Burns feels \nstrongly to the contrary, we should go ahead with the vote. If Senator \nHatch has something to say, he can speak after the vote. If Senator \nBurns wants him to speak, I will be happy to do that. Senators are \nwaiting around to vote. Schedules have to be met.\n\n\n                 unanimous consent agreement--h.r. 5005\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while the Senator is making that decision, \nI ask unanimous consent that at noon today, when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of H.R. 5005, the homeland security legislation, the \nThompson amendment be set aside and Senator Hollings be recognized to \noffer a first-degree amendment relating to national security; that the \nHollings and Thompson amendments be debated concurrently for a total of \n2 hours, prior to a vote in relation to each amendment, which 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled between the proponents and opponents of \neach amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order to either \namendment prior to a vote in relation to each amendment; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, without further intervening action or \ndebate, the Senator vote in relation to the Thompson amendment, to be \nfollowed by an immediate vote in relation to the Hollings amendment; \nthat upon disposition of these amendments, Senator Byrd be recognized \nto offer a first-degree amendment, as provided for under a previous \norder; provided further, that following a vote in relation to the \nThompson amendment, regardless of the outcome, the Senate vote in \nrelation to the Hollings amendment; that if neither amendment is \ndisposed of, then the amendments remain debatable and amendable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the only caution I will make is that this \norder does not provide for who is for and against these amendments. We \nreally do not know at this stage. When the time of noon arrives, the \nChair will have to make some ruling as to who is going to control the \ntime in opposition to these amendments, if, in fact, there is anyone \nopposed to them.\n  Has the Senator made a decision?\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I suggest and recommend to the chairman \nof the committee that we move forward on this vote. I know Senators \nhave made their schedules around the vote that was determined to happen \nat 10 o'clock this morning. We have other business to do on the \nInterior appropriations bill and a short time within which to do it. I \nsuggest to the chairman that we move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest we go ahead with the vote. I will ask for the \nyeas and nays once it is reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have previously been \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Timothy J. \nCorrigan, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida? The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nClinton), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Torricelli), and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nWellstone), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business to allow for the second reading of a bill. I \nunderstand there will be objection. However, this relates to the award \nof the special Congressional Gold Medal to the crew and passengers on \nflight 93.\n  I had said on Wednesday and Tuesday, yesterday and the day before, \nthat I intended to do this. Since making that announcement, I have \ndiscussed the matter with the Senator from New York, who is in the \nChamber, and also the Senator from Texas, who is the ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee. I asked the chairman to be present, but he had \nother business to which he had to attend.\n  This unanimous consent request is to proceed to the second reading of \nthe bill, which I will object to, and then to ask unanimous consent \nthat S. 2924, which was previously introduced as S. 1434, be taken up, \nand the Senator from New York will object to that. I said that if he \nwas absent I would object on his behalf.\n  I am doing this so it will be known that every effort is being made \nby this Senator to get a resolution of S. 2924, which seeks to give \ngold medals, special Congressional Gold Medals, to all those who were \non flight 93.\n  There are others, including the Senator from New York, who would like \nto include other people. The Banking Committee ranking member wants to \nsit down--which we are committed to do early next week--to try to get \nit resolved. However, for purposes of the record, I would like to \nproceed now with the second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the title of the bill for \nthe second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2924) to authorize the President to award \n     posthumously the Congressional Gold Medal to the passengers \n     and crew of flight 93 in the aftermath of the terrorist \n     attack on the United States on September 11, 2001.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Reserving the right to object, and I will object, the \nintentions of the Senator from Pennsylvania are good and noble and I am \nsupportive of them, but there are people in New York who should be \ntaken into account as well. We have been negotiating for a little \nwhile. We will continue to negotiate and hopefully come to a happy \nresolution. That is why I object. I have no objection to the \nPennsylvanian people being included, but certainly I have objection to \nleaving out some of the heroes in New York who were not police and \nfirefighters--they were included--but we have lots of people who tried \nto carry people downstairs and everything else. That is what we have to \nwork out. So I will reluctantly object and hopefully we can resolve \nthis shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from New York for his comments. As I \nsaid, I anticipated the objection. I am willing to work with the \nSenator from New York to give recognition to the many heroes who were \ninvolved in the rescue effort in the World Trade Center towers. There \nis no doubt about that. However, I do want to get it moved along. I \nthink this is something that would have been better had we been able to \nfinish it before September 11, 2002.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4518\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Craig second degree \namendment. This amendment will address the continuing problem of \nhazardous fuels buildup in our Nation's\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\nforests. Unfortunately, the excessive buildup of these fire producing \nfuels has reached a crisis stage.\n  Nowhere is this fact more evident than what is happening in our \nforests this year. Currently, conditions in our Nation's forests are \nterrible. The fire risks as a result of the buildup of these fuels are \nextremely high. According to the Society of American Foresters, ``As a \nresult of 80 years of fuels accumulation and several years of drought, \nthe potential for wildfire is at an all time high in many regions of \nthe U.S.'' In addition to this, recent forest service estimates \nindicate that approximately 73 million of the Nation's national forests \nare at risk from ``catastrophic'' wildfire.\n  For many of the states, the damage is already done. As you all know, \nmany western states have experienced devastating wildfires--fires that \nhave not only destroyed homes and property, but vast acres of trees and \nwildlife as well. As of late August, more than 6.3 million acres of \nland have burned this fire season--more than double the 10-year \naverage. So far in this fire season, we have seen devastating fires in \nColorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska, and Oregon.\n  Mr. President, these fires not only clean out and tear down living \ntrees, they kill the wildlife, they threaten homes, they threaten \nlives; most of all, they scorch the Earth, subjecting it to disastrous \nsoil runoff into our Nation's rivers, streams, and lakes, and knocking \nout the potential of forest regrowth for decades.\n  The time for addressing the problem of excessive fuels buildup in our \nforests is long overdue. Current efforts to reduce fuel loads are \ntaking far too long due to senseless bureaucratic delays. According to \nthe U.S. Forest Service, it can take up to 8 years to plan and \nexecutive a relatively routine fuels reduction project. We simply \ncannot afford to wait this long.\n  We are talking about good science-based forest management here. In a \nletter to the St. Louis Post Dispatch, Dr. Gene Garrett of the \nUniversity of Missouri School of Natural Resources, who has studied and \ntaught forestry for over 32 years, indicates that ``In many forests in \nthe west, trees become susceptible to insects and disease, die off, and \nadd their wood mass to an already excessive fuel load on the forest \nfloor. Studies have shown that fuel loads are 5-10 times higher per \nacre in the pine and mixed conifer types in the west than during pre-\nsettlement times. Forest scientists all across the country believe that \nreduction of these excessive fuel loads is the necessary and prudent \naction to take to restore the health of our forests, to protect our \nenvironment, to protect our wildlife.\n\n  If we do not address this problem now, we risk losing many of \nAmerica's most pristine forests due to wildfire devastation. Congress \nneeds to pass legislation to streamline and expedite the clearing of \nthese fire producing fuels.\n  I believe that the Craig hazardous fuels reduction amendment will \naccomplish this goal. This amendment is designed to cut through \nbureaucratic red tape and speed up the review and approval process for \nfuels reduction efforts.\n  Specifically, this amendment limits projects to areas that qualify as \nCondition Class 3 or high fire risk areas with priority placed on \nwildlife urban interface zones, municipal watersheds, diseased, dying, \ninsect-infected or wind-thrown trees and areas susceptible to reburn.\n  Proposed projects must also be consistent with the applicable forest \nplan, resource management plan, or other applicable agency plan. \nFurthermore, this amendment limits the aggregate treatment area to 10 \nmillion acres of Federal land or roughly 6 percent of the 190 million \nacres of Federal lands that are at high risk of wildfire.\n  Finally, the Craig amendment allows parties to seek judicial review \nin Federal district court.\n  This amendment is important to Missouri because it addresses most of \nthe causes of excessive fuels buildup in Missouri Forests.\n  No. 1, there has been a significant increase in fuels in the Mark \nTwain National Forest as a result of a serious tornado that occurred in \nSoutheast Missouri on 4/24/02.\n  According to the U.S. Forest Service's Tornado Fuels Assessment for \nthe Mark Twain, heavy winds from the tornado caused tops of trees to be \nbroken off, stems splintered and whole trees to be uprooted. Because of \nthis damage, fuels in this region of the forest have increased by \nanywhere from 5-25 times pre-tornado conditions.\n  Fuels in the tornado-affected areas are now classified under two \nlevels: ``very high to extreme fire danger'' and ``high fire danger.'' \nCurrently, over 470 valuable private structures near this damaged area \nare endangered by this fuels buildup.\n\n  No. 2, Missouri has a significant number of wildlife urban interface \nareas. These are areas in and around forests that have a high \npopulation with a significant number of private structures. Some of \nthese areas include individual residences, numerous rural subdivisions \nand small towns. These areas are particularly prevalent in southeast \nMissouri.\n  No. 3, in additional to the tornado, several years of drought, oak \ndecline and oak mortality have accelerated the process of fuels buildup \nin other areas of the Mark Twain. The USFS has prepared an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for oak decline and forest health for a \n192,000 acre area of the Mark Twain where trees are dying from a \ncombination of age, drought and insect infestation red oak--bores and \ntwo line chestnut bores.\n  The first of Missouri's two fire seasons starts next month. The most \nrecent high wildfire season in Missouri occurred in 2000 when over \n8,700 acres of wooded lands burned--more than 3,000 acres over the ten \nyear average. The time for this body to act on this problem is now.\n  As stated earlier, I believe that the Craig amendment will address \nmost of the fuels buildup issues in Missouri's forests, and prioritize \nthem for expedited cleanup. In closing, I urge you to vote in favor of \nthis amendment. By expediting the cleanup or clearing of these fuels, \nMissouri and the rest of the Nation can expect to see the risks of \ncatastrophic wildfires reduced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I proceed \nafter the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I amend that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments directly \nfollowing Senator Wyden, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri. He has stated the case very dramatically, not just for \nMissouri but in many respects for the rest of the West and many States \nin this Union where we are losing our forests because we cannot clean \nout from the forests the existing fuel. We cannot keep the forests thin \nso they are not susceptible to the tremendous losses we have been \nsuffering.\n  Utah is no exception. We have lost thousands and thousands of acres \nof wonderful forests. We have not been able to take care of the forests \nbecause of basically what I consider to be environmental extremism. We \nare all environmentalists. We all want the forests to last. We all want \nto make sure it works.\n  My gosh, what has been going on in this country is environmental \ngroups using the courts to override our professional land managers. It \nhas led to a total neglect of the forests, a total neglect of what we \nconsider to be not only natural resources but the beautiful forests of \nthis land and the ability to keep them beautiful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 12 noon, the Senate will resume the issue \nof homeland security.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate has before it the Craig-Domenici \namendment with respect to how we should spend the money we have in this \nappropriations bill designated for hazardous fuels reduction. It is an \nenormously important issue to my constituents.\n  I chair the Senate Subcommittee on Forest and Public Lands \nManagement. There were devastating fires throughout this summer all \nover the west. Because of that, I have spent a large\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nchunk of my waking hours in the last few months, both out in Oregon and \nhere in DC, trying to find the common ground that would allow us to \ndeal with the risk of fire on the millions of acres of national forest \nland that are fire prone and at the same time be sensitive to \nenvironmental values and legal processes.\n  It saddens me to rise today in opposition to this amendment because I \nhad hoped by this morning to be able to come to the Chamber and talk \nabout how the Senate had found common ground. I know the distinguished \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is very much committed to this \nas well.\n  I agree that hazardous fuels reduction on our national forests must \nbe pursued aggressively. I strongly believe in the concept of expedited \ntreatment for fire-prone areas, but I simply cannot agree to the \nexcessively broad slashes that this amendment takes at our \nenvironmental laws.\n  For instance, let me spend a moment talking about some of the \nprovisions with respect to access to the courts that are in the \namendment that is before the Senate this morning.\n  First, I feel strongly that citizens have a constitutional right to \naccess the courts with respect to concerns over the management of our \nnational forests, but I also believe they do not have a constitutional \nright to a 5-year delay. So, I have made it clear I support reforms \nthat address these questions and expedite the critical work that needs \nto be done. But, I want my colleagues to understand this amendment \nbefore us today goes too far and that is why I oppose it.\n\n  This amendment strips away a plaintiff's right to a temporary \nrestraining order and a preliminary injunction. This means, \nessentially, that the plaintiff's case will be heard on its merits, but \nwhile he is waiting to be heard the agency does not need to wait to \ncomplete the project over which the suit was filed. In effect, people \nare going to be suing over stumps.\n  I do not think that is what the Senate wants. I do not think that is \nwhat makes sense.\n  They are going to say this keeps the courthouse door open. I want my \ncolleagues to know that though the courthouse door may be open, the \neffect of this provision is the plaintiff never makes it past the coat \ncloset of the courthouse. This is not a meaningful and balanced \napproach to forestry. Justice is not going to be found with respect to \nthe provisions as written.\n  This issue is fundamentally about trust. Certainly, there are many \ngood people at the federal land management agencies. But suffice it to \nsay there are many in the environmental community that do not trust the \nnatural resources leadership of these agencies. There are many on the \nother side and many people in rural communities who believe there are \nsome in the environmental community that simply are committed to delay.\n  So what I have tried to do, along with Senator Feinstein, Senator \nBingaman, and others who spent many hours with us, is to come up with a \nreasonable, mainstream proposal to reduce hazardous fuels, improve the \nenvironment and protect communities.\n  For example, we have said there ought to be a categorical exclusion \nfrom required NEPA analysis of the hazardous fuels reduction projects \nthat produce a significant amount of green timber and salvage when \naccompanied by environmental safeguards like protecting big old trees \nand the assurance that the building of new roads will not waste the \nlimited resources we have for such projects. This provision that we \nhave talked about could save between 1\\1/2\\ and 3\\1/2\\ years of time.\n  Going even further, we said--and this can only be done by statute--\nthere should be no administrative appeals on these projects.\n  Senator Bingaman, Senator Feinstein, myself and others, have said \nthese are the kinds of ideas and approaches that help to bring the \nSenate together to try to find the common ground in this area. \nUnfortunately, that has been unacceptable to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle up to this point. That is why I believe the Craig-\nDomenici language that overreaches will polarize, in my view, this very \ncontentious debate even further.\n  I would like to see the Senate make a very real and meaningful \nattempt to address the important forest management issues and reduce \nthe risk of wildfire. I would like to see expedited treatment for key \nareas. My sense is there is broad agreement now that on 5 million \nacres, even 6 million acres--I have heard colleagues talk about 7 \nmillion acres--if we could address the questions of a fair and open \nprocess with respect to the courts, the Senate could come together.\n  I am very anxious to work with my colleagues to do that. But given \nthe contentiousness of this issue, I think the amendment before us now \nso restrains people who would like to bring legitimate questions of \nforest policy to the courts, that provision is going to so polarize the \nSenate as to set back the effort to try to find common ground.\n  What I want to do is work on a bipartisan basis to implement the \nNational Fire Plan. That is a collaborative effort. That is the kind of \neffort that would bring the Senate together. That is what we were able \nto do in the county payments law and I hope we can do it again.\n  We have to put firefighting dollars where they can best be used in a \nstrategic way to reduce hazardous fuels, to start in the places where \ntreatment would be most effective, the wild and urban interface \necosystems and municipal watersheds where fire can cause the most \ndamage.\n  Senator Bingaman has worked with Senator Feinstein and others on \nthat. I think this is the kind of approach that brings people together. \nCertainly there is a commitment to cut these never-never land legal \nprocesses down in a significant way, but they have to maintain the \nintegrity of the system.\n  Already I mentioned the prospect of being able to save 1\\1/2\\ to 3\\1/\n2\\ years of time when we are talking about the categorical exclusions \nfrom required NEPA analysis on hazardous fuels that myself and Senator \nBingaman and others have supported. That is a significant step towards \nreducing the time line that so many folks are upset about in pursuing \nhazardous fuels reduction projects.\n  I am open to other ideas and suggestions but I hope the Senate will \nnot support the amendment that is before us now. I do believe what will \nhappen if this amendment passes is that plaintiffs will be suing over \nstumps. People will not be able to have the issues addressed, in \neffect, while it is appropriate, while the case is moving forward. That \nis why I think the amendment is an overreach.\n  I hope my colleagues will continue to work with Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Feinstein and me, and the many colleagues who would like to \nfind common ground come forward to work with us and support a package \nthat would allow us to get expedited treatment for important projects \nwhile at the same time be sensitive to fair access to the courts and to \nenvironmental values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I truly believe we have a real fire \nemergency in America's forests. It is precipitated somewhat by drought, \nbut it is precipitated by a very flawed forest policy, a forest policy \nthat has practiced fire suppression and spent over a billion dollars \nthis year in suppressing the largest number of acres burned in the \nhistory of our Nation--6 million acres burned, 28 people lost, hundreds \nof millions of dollars of property lost, and a major concern of the \nAmerican people. All the money cannot be spent suppressing fires. We \nhave to begin to spend the money grooming forests so they are more fire \nresistant.\n  Over the past 100 years, there has been a buildup of underbrush, a \nbuildup of dead, dying, and downed trees, a buildup of infested trees, \nand a buildup of nonindigenous species trees which become fire ladders. \nAll of this presents fire ladders. So a fire begins, and it ``ladders'' \nup into the crowns of old growth, and there is a fire conflagration. I \nwatched that happen in Colorado. I flew over the fires in Arizona. We \nwatched it happen in New Mexico. Yes, it is happening in California, \nand we are not through with our fire season yet.\n  There is a true bona fide message. It needs to be met. I have been \ntrying to work with Senator Wyden, Senator Craig, Senator Kyl, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Burns. We have spent hours trying to come up with a \nbipartisan amendment which could get 60 votes on\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nthis floor. I believe we are relatively close to those 60 votes. \nSenator Wyden has indicated some of the parameters in which we have \nbeen negotiating.\n  We have 74 million acres of forests in the highest risk of \ncatastrophic fire; 24 million of those acres are Federal lands. We took \nthe Federal lands--California alone has 7 million acres of the 24 \nmillion acres in what is called class 3, highest risk of catastrophic \nfire--to see if we could create for 1 year, as an amendment in an \nappropriations bill, an expedited program to address those acres, \nmaking 70 percent of the effort in urban interface areas where we find \nproperty, and people, where fire is devastating. Also, in some of the \nwatershed areas, the areas of heaviest pest infestation, windthrow, as \nwell as those acres which are apt to burn--highly catastrophic.\n  We are very close. We can agree on the number of acres which, after \nall, will be conditioned by the amount of money. We have agreed to \ntruncate the administrative process. We concentrate on the areas I have \nmentioned.\n  But on this side of the aisle, there are very strong feelings we \nshould not change the judicial review process. We are trying to come to \ngrips with the Republicans on this issue. I am hopeful we can. Those on \nthe Energy and Water Development Subcommittee who are negotiating \nhopefully will be on that subcommittee next year as well. If we can \nhave a 1-year trial of moving the administrative processes faster, \ncreating the emergency within these 5 to 7 million acres of the 24 \nmillion acres, confining most of it to the urban interface and the \nwatersheds that are in the resource management and forestry plans, we \ncan make a difference. We can see whether it works.\n  There are people who say it will not work because there are \nindividuals or groups who will go into court to try to stop us. I am \nnot sure that is entirely correct. I thought so initially, and then I \nlooked at a GAO letter. I will read part of it into the Record. It is \ndated August 31, 2001. It says:\n\n       In summary, as of July 18, 2001, the Forest Service had \n     completed the necessary environmental analyses and had \n     decided to implement 1,671 hazardous fuel reduction projects \n     in fiscal year 2001. Of these projects, 20 (about 1 percent) \n     had been appealed and none had been litigated. Appellates \n     included environmental groups, recreation groups, private \n     industry interests, and individuals.\n\n  That is just with one program, that hazardous fuel reduction project \nin that year. It would indicate that in this small area court \nchallenges have not been a big problem. Many people who believe in the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, believe very strongly \nthat we should not vitiate the NEPA process in any way, and we should \nnot vitiate the judicial process in any way in this 1-year pilot \nproject.\n\n  I am hopeful we will be able to find an accommodation that will get \n60 votes. On this side, we clearly have to get Democrats centered \naround an effort. And on the Republican side, we have to be able to \nconvince them we are serious about moving in a constructive, emergency \nway to address the problem of catastrophic fire in our country. We can \ndo it. Senator Craig, Senator Kyl, Senator Burns, Senator Domenici, all \nwant to do it.\n  It is true that on both sides there are different approaches. I \nbelieve in a draft either called Bingaman 3 or Feinstein Modified--\nwhatever one wants to call it. We are relatively close to that. I am \nhopeful we can, by unanimous consent, not take the vote on any of these \nat this time but continue to negotiate at least until tomorrow morning, \nand hopefully be able to get through the impasse we are in at the \nmoment--or even to next week. This bill will not be included. I believe \nit is important we try to move more rapidly this year with hazardous \nfuels mitigation. In what is Bingaman 3 or Feinstein Modified--whatever \nanyone wants to call it--we have a very good first start.\n  We would like to hear from the other side of the aisle. We would like \nto continue these negotiations. I am hopeful there is not a vote at \nthis time, that we are able to continue the matter, and we are able to \ncontinue to negotiate. I was present at meetings for 3 hours yesterday. \nI was in a conference call on it for an hour and a half last night. I \nwant the Senate to know our efforts are sincere, they are earnest, that \nwe would like to find an accommodation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wyden and Senator \nFeinstein. There is no one better to work with as we have moved through \nthe negotiations to change the way we look at management areas with \nregard to reduction of the fuel load on the floors of our forests and \ndealing with diseased forests.\n  It is most troubling to me that we are seeing the results of 20 years \nof frivolous appeals and putting the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau \nof Land Management under such review that they cannot manage with any \ncommon sense; 20 years' experience, with a lot of folks on the ground \nwho probably do not have 2 days' of education in their whole life, but \nthey have been in the forest all their life, saying we are going in \nexactly the wrong direction and this will lead to disaster. But because \nthey do not have a certain standing in the process to get their voice \nheard, their warning goes unheeded.\n  So we come to the years of 2000, 2002, even 1998. My State of Montana \nis just completing its fifth year in drought and also in low snowpack. \nWe had devastating fires in 2000, with a lesser amount this year \nbecause we got a little rain. But now when the rains come, we see the \nmud slides, devastating mud slides that take streams out, destroy water \nquality, damage watersheds. I have heard people give endless speeches \non watersheds. They have been damaged beyond repair. It will take years \nand years for them to be restored. It impacts municipalities and also \nimpacts wildlife--fish.\n\n  How much do we have to show America that the past 20 years have been \na disaster, an unmitigated disaster? This policy was recommended by \ngroups who, at times you have to believe on the management of forests--\nthere is an old saying that says they don't know the difference between \n``sic 'em'' and ``come here.'' Hocus-pocus science--a theory. Feel \ngood, warm and fuzzy--but it burns. That is what we are talking about \nhere and that is what should be at the crux of our discussions with one \nanother in this Senate.\n  How do we avoid continuing this in a commonsense way, where if you \nwant to debate the science or the decision made by an agency or a \nperson with regard to the management of that land, that it cannot be \nopen and all cards have to be on the table? That is what we are looking \nat here.\n  So I am going to work with my chairman, Mr. Byrd, as we try to move \nthis piece of legislation along. I will tell you, I have never seen \nmore earnest and dedicated people, people dedicated to solving a \nproblem, than those in this debate, in the private meetings, the \nendless hours that negotiation have gone on. I appreciate that because \nbasically I think we are driven to take care of our forests. But past \npractices have not given us much help.\n  Mr. President, I now yield time to my good friend from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nyielding some of his time to me. I thank him for his leadership, trying \nto bring some common sense to the way we manage our forests. It is a \npleasure for me to be on the Senate floor with my western colleagues \nwho face a lot of problems similar to those I am facing in the State of \nColorado.\n  The citizens of Colorado and the west are facing a challenging time. \nFaced with drought and fires across the state, our response to the test \nof mother nature is being measured, and will continue to be measured \nwith the passage of time. Yet the message I want to send home today, \nand one that my colleagues rising in support of forest health also wish \nto convey, is that we must not fiddle while our forests burn.\n  We have studied forest fires, forest health, and forest management. \nWe have studied while our forests burn and while our critical habitat \nturns to ash. Yet we continue to imperil life, property and nature with \ncatastrophic wildfires.\n  I want to thank the rescue workers, fire fighters, police, sheriffs \noffices, aid workers, and the thousands of volunteers who have battled \nthe blazes all summer long. I hope these brave firefighters realize \nthat their efforts are not in vain, and that new policies will restore \nsound forest health and revitalize our management of our great \nforestlands.\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\n  Unfortunately, today there is an increasing threat of fire in \nmillions of acres of forestlands and rangelands throughout the United \nStates. This threat is especially great in the interior States of the \nwestern United States, where the Forest Service estimates that \n39,000,000 acres of National Forest System lands are at high risk of \ncatastrophic wildfire.\n  Today's forestlands and rangelands are the consequences of land \nmanagement practices that emphasized the control and prevention of \nfires, disrupting the occurrence of frequent low-intensity fires that \nperiodically remove flammable undergrowth.\n  As a result of these management practices, forestlands and rangelands \nin the United States are no longer naturally functioning ecosystems, \nand drought cycles and the invasion of insects and disease have \nresulted in vast areas of dead or dying trees, overstocked stands and \nthe invasion of undesirable species.\n  Population movement into wildand/urban interface areas exacerbate the \nfire danger, and the increasing number of larger, more intense fires \npose grave hazards to human health, safety, property and infrastructure \nin these areas. In addition smoke from wildfires, which contain fine \nparticulate matter and other hazardous pollutants, pose substantial \nhealth risks to people living in the wildland/urban interface.\n  The budgets and resources of local, State, and Federal entities \nsupporting firefighting efforts have been stretched to their limits. In \naddition, diminishing Federal resources--including personnel--have \nlimited the ability of Federal fire researchers to respond to \nmanagement needs, and to utilize technological advancements for \nanalyzing fire management costs.\n  Now, I would like to share with my colleagues a little about \nColorado's devastating fire season. Several months ago, one third of \nthe State was blanketed in smoke from forest fires, blocking the sun, \nthe mountain view, and creating major pollution problems, and asthma \nrelated deaths. Over 500,00 acres of Colorado has burned this year. The \nnormal is 70,000 acres.\n  Over the course of the wildfires, safety and emergency personnel have \nhad to evacuate 142 subdivisions, 85,000 people, and ended up spending \nmore money on suppression because of the interface complexity. It is \ncritical for life and property protection to mitigate this problem.\n  The result of the catastrophic fires is a hardened surface that is \nimpenetrable by water. When the ground can't absorb the water, not only \nis the drought prolonged, but the water has to go somewhere. So it goes \ndownhill. As the volume of the water increases, it picks up rocks, \nadditional--possibly undamaged--soil and other debris.\n  This flow of tainted water and debris does not discriminate. It \nenters watersheds and people's homes. Right now in southwestern \nColorado roads are closed, homes are damaged and people are trying to \ndig their yards out of up to ten feet of mud.\n  In the past six years, six major forest fires have affected the \nmainstem of the South Platte river, a major source of water for the \nDenver metropolitan area. The Hayman fire this summer was the first of \nthese fires to destroy Denver Water property.\n  However, all of these fires have caused problems with the watershed \nwhich has negatively affected the quality of the water delivered to the \ntwo largest water treatment plants for Denver Water.\n  The Hayman fire completely consumed the trees on the acreage \nsurrounding Denver Water's Cheesman Reservoir, except where Denver had \napplied Forest Service procedures of thinning and brush removal. As a \nresult of the fire and the emulsified granite soil surrounding \nCheesman, the burned trees and ash has been washing into the Reservoir \nas well as into the mainstem of the South Platte along the burn area. \nAbout 90 percent of Denver Water's property was burned.\n  At Cheesman Reservoir where Denver Water used Forest Service-type \ntechniques, fire intensity was diminished and the fire did not destroy \nthe entire forest. Therefore erosion and attendant water quality \ndegradation will be minimized. One of the Forest Service mandates in \nits enabling legislation was protection of municipal water supplies. It \nis imperative that the Forest Service limit fire damage in municipal \nwatershed areas.\n  This will take money, personnel, quick response and long-term \ndedication of public resources. In order to protect and preserve \nwatersheds as public purpose resources, the Forest Service will need \nmoney and Congressional support to reverse policies that limit sound \nforest management.\n  It is estimated that damage to Denver Water facilities from sediment \ndeposits and degraded water quality will occur for the next thirty \nyears. To date, Denver Water's cost to try to mitigate some of the \nHayman fire damage is over $500,000 for erosion prevention and \nprotection of facilities.\n  It is estimated the cost for the next 8 weeks will be $100,000/week. \nAdditionally, the life of our reservoirs impacted by the fire will be \nreduced by about 40 years due to increased sediment. Dredging of the \nreservoir will solve some problems, but will not prevent the continued \ninflow of sediment.\n  It is conceivable the total cost of dredging Cheesman Reservoir will \nexceed $20 million.\n  These examples are just a few of the tragedies created by the fires. \nGlenwood Springs, Durango, Steamboat and many more, have suffered as \nwell. Yet the quiet tragedy of the fires will not be revealed for \nyears--what have we done to the ecosystem, to habitat, and wildlife? \nOnly after thousands of hours of human capital investment and millions \nof dollars in rehabilitation will we know.\n  We all value protection of our forests and the natural beauty of our \nland. But we can no longer respond and react--we must take the steps to \nachieve a healthy balance and return our forests to a state of good \nhealth.\n  We are facing some serious problems. My feeling on this is that the \nforest managers themselves--they are scientists--know how to best \nmanage our environment. I think we need to give them some more latitude \nin practicing good science and protecting forest health.\n  I will elaborate on this a little later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor not to exceed 2 minutes before the Senate reverts to the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will \nnot object--I wonder if we could agree that the time would not go \nagainst either side with regard to the debate of this amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent it not go against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I seek the floor at this time to ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside temporarily \nso that I may offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Mr. Stevens.\n  Mr. PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is it my \nunderstanding that we would still allow the Craig-Domenici amendment to \nbe in place when we return?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to know what it is.\n  Mr. BYRD. It will take me a little longer than 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask if it has to do with the budget or is in any \nway trying to perfect the budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. I think the Senator from New Mexico will embrace the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 2 minutes I \nasked for be extended to 4 minutes so that we would have two additional \namendments and I may show this amendment to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Chair will withhold temporarily until \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico has looked at the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request.\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. I have looked at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, September 10, 2002, the Attorney \nGeneral announced an increase in the national threat level to the \n``High Risk'' level. The President accepted the recommendation based on \nwhat the Attorney General described as specific intelligence received \nand analyzed by the full intelligence community and corroborated by \nmultiple intelligence sources.\n  The Attorney General indicated that the likely targets include the \ntransportation and energy sectors and symbols of American power such as \nU.S. embassies, U.S. military facilities and national monuments.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the Interior bill for $937 million \nof supplemental funding. The package includes $647 million of homeland \nsecurity funding that draws from the $5.1 billion emergency contingency \nfund that the President rejected those items that are most directly \nrelated to the increased threat. In addition, the amendment includes \n$200 million for international AIDS programs as was approved by the \nSenate 79-14 when Senator Frist offered the amendment last June. The \namendment also includes $90 million that the Congress had previously \napproved for providing long-term health screening and examinations for \nthe emergency personnel who responded to the attack at the World Trade \nCenter.\n  The Office of Management and Budget currently estimates that there is \n$940 million available under the discretionary caps for fiscal year \n2002 budget authority. Therefore, this amendment does not require an \nemergency designation by the President. If the President signs the \nbill, the funds will be made available.\n  Highlights of the $937 million package include $150 million for \nsecurity at our nuclear plants and labs, $150 million for the direct \ncosts of new security requirements for our Nation's airports, $150 \nmillion to equip and train our Nation's firefighters for dealing with \nweapons of mass destruction and other threats, $100 million for grants \nto fire and police departments to improve the interoperability of their \ncommunications equipment, $39 million for the Customs Service for \nimproved border security, $17.7 million for increased security at the \nWashington Monument and Jefferson Memorial, $18 million for USDA for \nsecuring biohazardous materials, $12 million for DC for law enforcement \ncosts of the September 28 IMF conference and other national security \nevents, $10 million for embassy security, $200 million for \ninternational AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria services, and $90 million \nfor long-term health monitoring of World Trade Center first responders.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the membership and advisors of the National \n                           Security Council)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I, add the following;\n\n     SEC. 173. MODIFICATION OF MEMBERSHIP AND ADVISORS OF NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) Members.--Subsection (a) of section 101 of the National \n     Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 402) is amended--\n       (1) in the fourth undesignated paragraph, by redesignating \n     clauses (1) through (6) as subparagraphs (A) through (G), \n     respectively;\n       (2) by designating the undesignated paragraphs as \n     paragraphs (1) through (4), respectively; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4), as so designated--\n       (A) by striking subparagraphs (E) and (F) and inserting the \n     following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(E) the Attorney General;\n       ``(F) the Secretary of Homeland Security; and''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (G), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``the Chairman of the Munitions Board,'' and all that follows \n     and inserting ``to serve at the pleasure of the President.''.\n       (b) Advisors.--That section is further amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (g) through (j) and \n     subsection (i), as added by section 301 of the International \n     Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292; 112 Stat. \n     2800), as subsections (i) through (m), respectively;\n       (2) by transferring subsection (l) (relating to the \n     participation of the Director of Central Intelligence on the \n     National Security Council), as so redesignated, to appear \n     after subsection (f) and redesignating such subsection, as so \n     transferred, as subsection (g); and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (g), as so transferred \n     and redesignated, the following new subsections:\n       ``(h) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     may, in the performance of the Director's duties as the head \n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and subject to the \n     direction of the President, attend and participate in \n     meetings of the National Security Council.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been speaking to the manager of the \nbill, Senator Lieberman. We have two amendments pending. Senator \nThompson opposes the Hollings amendment. It would seem that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee should have one-half hour in opposition to that \namendment. Senator Lieberman opposes the Thompson amendment. He should \nhave one-half hour in opposition to that. If the two managers agree \nwith that, we should have that in the form of an order so somebody can \ndesignate the time on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  This amendment is so simple that it becomes suspicious, in a sense. \nAll I amend here is the National Security Council so as to include the \nAttorney General, the future Secretary of Homeland Security, and the \nDirector of the\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nFBI in an advisory position similar to the CIA as presently included in \nthe 1947 law. The reason for this, of course, is to get not only the \nresponsibility of the Council fixed, but more particularly to realize \nnow that domestic threats are far greater than any international \nthreats. I don't believe Russia is going to attack us. I don't think \nChina is going to attack us. I don't think Saddam, after all he has \nheard about us attacking him, is going to attack us, except perhaps \nmaybe overseas but not the homeland. But homeland security must be \nemphasized.\n  Let me refer immediately to that section of the 1947 act signed by \nPresident Harry Truman on July 26, 1947. I quote:\n\n       The functioning of the Council shall be to advise the \n     President with respect to the integration of domestic, \n     foreign, and military policies relating to the national \n     security so as to enable the military services and the other \n     departments and agencies of the government to cooperate more \n     effectively in matters involving the national security.\n\n  In other words, the function of joining all the dots is with the \nNational Security Council.\n  You have all these entities now, here with a new one, to take certain \nanalyses: the Department of Homeland Security. But you still have the \nCIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency. You have intelligence \nsections of the State Department. They are all over the Government; \nIntelligence Committees within the Congress, and everything else like \nthat. Wherein is the responsibility fixed to join the dots?\n  Harry Truman said it best in 1947. He said: ``The buck stops here.'' \nSo my particular amendment is to fix that responsibility, and assist \nthe President, so there would be no misunderstanding.\n  Incidentally, only the President of the United States can change this \nculture of the so-called ``need to know.'' I speak advisedly. I was in \nthe intelligence game back in the 1950s. I was a member of the Hoover \nCommission. We investigated the CIA, the FBI, the Army, Navy, Air Force \nintelligence, the Defense Department, the Secret Service, the Q \nclearance, the atomic energy intelligence, and all the other functions.\n  I will never forget, in October of 1962, I got a call from my friend \nwho would later operate this desk as a Senator, Bobby Kennedy. Bobby \nsaid: I would like to get that report from you with respect to this \nCuban missile crisis, and the background on it. I turned over my \nreport, my particular one. I never have gotten it back.\n  But, in any event, the glaring error that persists this minute is \nthat there are no joining of the dots, people are not talking to each \nother. Intelligence has gone like economics and trade--globalization, \nglobalization. I cannot emphasize that too much in the little bit of \ntime that is given me.\n  Immediately after 9/11 the CIA, the FBI, the various intelligence \nagencies said: Oh, this was a surprise. They could know nothing about a \nplane going into a building.\n  Let me talk about terrorism and give you a dateline:\n  The bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 by the \nIslamic Jihad; the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in October \n1983, also by the Islamic terrorists; the Hezbollah restaurant bombing \nin April 1984; the Naples USO attack in April 1988; the attempted Iraqi \nattacks on U.S. posts on January 18 and 19 of 1991; the World Trade \nCenter bombing in February of 1993; the attempted assassination of \nPresident Bush by Iraqi agents in April of 1993; the attack on U.S. \ndiplomats in Pakistan in March of 1995; the Khobar Towers bombing in \nJune of 1996; the U.S. Embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es \nSalaam, Tanzania, in 1998; the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in October of \n2000; and the terrorist attacks on, of course, September 11. And they \nhave not stopped. We have the car bombing outside the U.S. consulate in \nKarachi, Pakistan, in June of 2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this document be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Terrorism Timeline\n\n       Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut, April 18, 1983: Sixty-\n     three people, including the CIA's Middle East director, were \n     killed, and 120 were injured in a 400-pound suicide truck-\n     bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. The \n     Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.\n       Bombing of Marine Barracks, Beirut, October 23, 1983: \n     Simultaneous suicide truck-bomb attacks were made on American \n     and French compounds in Beirut, Lebanon. A 12,000-pound bomb \n     destroyed the U.S. compound, killing 242 Americans, while 58 \n     French troops were killed when a 400-pound device destroyed a \n     French base. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.\n       Hizballah Restaurant Bombing, April 12, 1984: Eighteen U.S. \n     servicemen were killed, and 83 people were injured in a bomb \n     attack on a restaurant near a U.S. Air Force Base in \n     Torrejon, Spain. Responsibility was claimed by Hizballah.\n       Naples USO Attack, April 14, 1988: The Organization of \n     Jihad Brigades exploded a car bomb outside a USO Club in \n     Naples, Italy, killing one U.S. sailor.\n       Attempted Iraqi Attacks on U.S. Posts, January 18-19, 1991: \n     Iraqi agents planted bombs at the U.S. Ambassador to \n     Indonesia's home residence at the USIS library in Manila.\n       World Trade Center Bombing, February 26, 1993: The World \n     Trade Center in New York City was badly damaged when a car \n     bomb planted by Islamic terrorists explodes in an underground \n     garage. The bomb left six people dead and 1,000 injured. The \n     men carrying out the attack were followers of Umar and Abd \n     al-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric who preached in the New York \n     City area.\n       Attempted Assassination of President Bush by Iraqi Agents, \n     April 14, 1993: The Iraqi intelligence service attempted to \n     assassinate former U.S. President George Bush during a visit \n     to Kuwait. In retaliation, the U.S. launched a cruise missile \n     attack 2 months later on the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n       Attack on U.S. Diplomats in Pakistan, March 8, 1995: Two \n     unidentified gunmen killed two U.S. diplomats and wounded a \n     third in Karachi, Pakistan.\n       Khobar Towers Bombing, June 25, 1996: A fuel truck carrying \n     a bomb exploded outside the U.S. military's Khobar Towers \n     housing facility in Dharhran, killing 19 U.S. military \n     personnel and wounding 515 persons, including 240 U.S. \n     personnel. Several groups claimed responsibility for the \n     attack.\n       U.S. Embassy Bombings in East Africa, August 7, 1998: A \n     bomb exploded at the rear entrance of the U.S. embassy in \n     Nairobi, Kenya, killing 12 U.S. citizens, 32 Foreign Service \n     Nationals (FSNs), and 247 Kenyan citizens. About 5,000 \n     Kenyans, six U.S. citizens, and 13 FSNs were injured. The \n     U.S. embassy building sustained extensive structural damage. \n     Almost simultaneously, a bomb detonated outside the U.S. \n     embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing seven FSNs and \n     three Tanzanian citizens, and injuring one U.S. citizen and \n     76 Tanzanians. The explosion caused major structural damage \n     to the U.S. embassy facility. The U.S. Government held Usama \n     Bin Ladin responsible.\n       Attack on U.S.S. Cole, October 12, 2000: In Aden, Yemen, a \n     small dingy carrying explosives rammed the destroyer U.S.S. \n     Cole, killing 17 sailors and injuring 39 others. Supporters \n     of Usama Bin Ladin were suspected.\n       Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Homeland, September 11, 2001: Two \n     hijacked airliners crashed into the twin towers of the World \n     Trade Center. Soon thereafter, the Pentagon was struck by a \n     third hijacked plane. A fourth hijacked plane, suspected to \n     be bound for a high-profile target in Washington, crashed \n     into a field in southern Pennsylvania. More than 5,000 U.S. \n     citizens and other nationals were killed as a result of these \n     acts. President Bush and Cabinet officials indicated that \n     Usama Bin Laden was the prime suspect and that they \n     considered the United States in a state of war with \n     international terrorism. In the aftermath of the attacks, the \n     United States formed the Global Coalition Against Terrorism.\n       Car Bombing outside U.S. Consulate, June 14, 2002: A \n     suicide bomber drives a car filled with explosives into a \n     guard post outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, \n     killing 11 Pakistanis and injuring at least 45 people, \n     including one U.S. Marine who is slightly wounded by flying \n     debris.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, they say: Well, Senator, you point all those \nthings out. But, after all, we didn't know anything about a plane going \ninto a building.\n  Well, in December 1994, the al-Qaida hijacked an Air France plane \nthat was headed into the Eiffel Tower. Who has not heard of flying a \nplane into a structure?\n  In 1995, the CIA was hot on the Philippines and thwarted the blowup \nor the crashing of eight planes at one particular time. They learned of \nthe plan to do what? To crash a plane into the CIA building. That was \nback 6 years before 9/11.\n  And then, in January of 2000, in Malaysia, there was an article with \nrespect to al-Qaida. Let me read from the article. I quote:\n\n       At the time, the men had no idea that they were being \n     closely watched--or that the CIA already knew some of their \n     names. A few days earlier, U.S. intelligence had gotten wind \n     of the Qaeda gathering. Special Branch, Malaysia's security \n     service, agreed to follow and photograph the suspected \n     terrorists. They snapped pictures of the men sightseeing and \n     ducking into cybercafes to check Arabic Web sites. What \n     happened next, some U.S. counterterrorism officials say, may \n     be\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n     the most puzzling, and devastating, intelligence in the \n     critical months before September 11. A few days after the \n     Kuala Lumpur meeting . . . the CIA tracked one of the \n     terrorists, Nawaf Alhazmi as he flew from the meeting to Los \n     Angeles. Agents discovered that another of the men, Khalid \n     Almihdhar, had already obtained a multiple-entry visa that \n     allowed him to enter and leave the United States as he \n     pleased. (They later learned that he had in fact arrived in \n     the United States on the same flight as Alhazmi.)\n       Yet astonishingly, the CIA did nothing with this \n     information. Agency officials didn't tell the INS, which \n     could have turned them away at the border. Nor did they \n     notify the FBI, which could have covertly tracked them to \n     find out their mission. Instead, during the year and nine \n     months after the CIA identified them as terrorists, Alhazmi \n     and Almihdhar lived openly in the United States, using their \n     real names, obtaining driver's licenses, opening bank \n     accounts and enrolling in flight schools--until the morning \n     of September 11, when they walked aboard American Airlines \n     Flight 77 and crashed it into the Pentagon.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record, in addition to another article of this particular week \nwhere we had an informant from the CIA who was staying with them all \nthe time. And when he heard that they were the names, he said: Oh, I \nknew them. Yeah, they were terrorists and everything else.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 10, 2002]\n\n                      The Hijackers We Let Escape\n\n                (By Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman)\n\n       The CIA tracked two suspected terrorists to a Qaeda summit \n     in Malaysia in January 2000, then looked on as they re-\n     entered America and began preparations for September 11. Why \n     didn't somebody try to stop them? Inside what may be the \n     worst intelligence failure of all. A Newsweek exclusive.\n       Kuala Lumpur is an easy choice if you're looking to lie \n     low. Clean and modern, with reliable telephones, banks and \n     Internet service, the Malaysian city is a painless flight \n     from most world capitals--and Muslim visitors don't need \n     visas to enter the Islamic country. That may explain why Al \n     Qaeda chose the sprawling metropolis for a secret planning \n     summit in early January 2000. Tucked away in a posh suburban \n     condominium overlooking a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, \n     nearly a dozen of Osama bin Laden's trusted followers, posing \n     as tourists, plotted future terrorist strikes against the \n     United States.\n       At the time, the men had no idea that they were being \n     closely watched--or that the CIA already knew some of their \n     names. A few days earlier, U.S. intelligence had gotten wind \n     of the Qaeda gathering. Special Branch, Malaysia's security \n     service, agreed to follow and photograph the suspected \n     terrorists. They snapped pictures of the men sightseeing and \n     ducking into cybercafes to check Arabic Web sites. What \n     happened next, some U.S. counterterrorism officials say, may \n     be the most puzzling, and devastating, intelligence in the \n     critical months before September 11. A few days after the \n     Kuala Lumpur meeting, Newsweek has learned, the CIA tracked \n     one of the terrorists, Nawaf Alhazmi, as he flew from the \n     meeting to Los Angeles. Agents discovered that another of the \n     men, Khalid Almihdhar, had already obtained a multiple-entry \n     visa that allowed him to enter and leave the United States as \n     he pleased.

Last week, in \n     the aftermath of Minnesota agent Coleen Rowley's scathing \n     letter ripping the FBI for ignoring warnings from the field, \n     Director Robert Mueller announced a series of reforms aimed \n     at modernizing the bureau.\n       All along, however, the CIA's Counterterrorism Center--base \n     camp for the agency's war on bin Laden--was sitting on \n     information that could have led federal agents right to the \n     terrorists' doorstep. Almihdhar and Alhazmi, parading across \n     America in plain sight, could not have been easier to find. \n     Newsweek has learned that when Almihdhar's visa expired, the \n     State Department, not knowing any better, simply issued him a \n     new one in June 2001--even though by then the CIA had linked \n     him to one of the suspected bombers of the USS Cole in \n     October 2000. The two terrorists' frequent meetings with the \n     other September 11 perpetrators could have provided federal \n     agents with a road map to the entire cast of 9-11 hijackers. \n     But the FBI didn't know it was supposed to be looking for \n     them until three weeks before the strikes, when CIA Director \n     George Tenet, worried an attack was imminent, ordered agency \n     analysts to review their files. It was only then, on Aug. 23, \n     2001, that the agency sent out an all-points bulletin, \n     launching law-enforcement agents on a frantic and futile \n     search for the two men. Why didn't the CIA share its \n     information sooner? ``We could have done a lot better, that's \n     for sure,'' one top intelligence official told Newsweek.\n       The CIA's belated and reluctant admission now makes it \n     impossible to avoid the question that law-enforcement \n     officials have tried to duck for weeks: could we have stopped \n     them? Tenet has vigorously defended his agency's performance \n     in the months before the attacks. In February he told a \n     Senate panel that he was ``proud'' of the CIA's record. He \n     insisted that the terrorist strikes were not due to a \n     ``failure of attention, and discipline, and focus, and \n     consistent effort--and the American people need to understand \n     that.'' Yet last week intelligence officials acknowledged \n     that the agency made at least one mistake: failing to notify \n     the State Department and the INS, so the men could have been \n     stopped at the border.\n       CIA officials, who have been preparing for the start of \n     Senate intelligence committee hearings this week, seem at a \n     loss to explain how this could have happened. The CIA is \n     usually loath to share information with other government \n     agencies, for fear of compromising ``sources and methods.'' \n     CIA officials also say that at the time Almihdhar and Alhazmi \n     entered the country in January 2000, they hadn't yet been \n     identified as bin Laden terrorists--despite their attendance \n     at the Malaysia meeting. ``It wasn't known for sure that they \n     were Al Qaeda bad-guy operators,'' says one official.\n       CIA officials also point out that FBI agents assigned to \n     the CIA's Counterterrorism Center were at least informed \n     about the Malaysia meeting and the presence of Almihdhar and \n     Alhazmi at the time it occurred. But FBI officials protest \n     that they only recently learned about the most crucial piece \n     of information: that the CIA knew Alhazmi was in the country, \n     and that Almihdhar could enter at will. ``That was \n     unforgivable,'' said one senior FBI official. This led to a \n     series of intense and angry encounters among U.S. officials \n     in the weeks after September 11. At one White House meeting \n     last fall, Wayne Griffith, a top State Department consular \n     official, was so furious that his office hadn't been told \n     about the two men that he blew up at a CIA agent. (Griffith \n     declined to comment.)\n       To bolster their case, FBI officials have now prepared a \n     detailed chart showing how agents could have uncovered the \n     terrorist plot if they had learned about Almihdhar and \n     Alhazmi sooner, given their frequent contact with at least \n     five of the other hijackers. ``There's no question we could \n     have tied all 19 hijackers together,'' the official said.\n       It was old-fashioned interrogation and eavesdropping that \n     first led U.S. intelligence agents to the Qaeda plotters. In \n     the summer of 1998, only a couple of weeks after bin Laden \n     operatives truck-bombed two U.S. Embassies in Africa, the FBI \n     got a break: one of the Nairobi bombers had been caught. \n     Muhammad Rashed Daoud al-Owhali, a young Saudi from a wealthy \n     family who became a fierce bin Laden loyalist, was supposed \n     to have killed himself in the blast. Instead, he got out of \n     the truck at the last moment and fled. He was arrested in a \n     seedy Nairobi hotel, waiting for his compatriots to \n     smuggle him out of the country.\n       Questioned by the FBI, al-Owhali made a detailed \n     confession. Among the information he gave agents was the \n     telephone number of a Qaeda safe house in Yemen, owned by a \n     bin Laden loyalist named Ahmed Al-Hada (who, it turns out, \n     was also Almihdhar's father-in-law).\n       U.S. intelligence began listening in on the telephone line \n     of the Yemen house, described in government documents as a \n     Qaeda ``logistics center,'' where terrorist strikes--\n     including the Africa bombings and later the Cole attack in \n     Yemen--were planned. Operatives around the world phoned Al-\n     Hada with information, which was then relayed to bin Laden in \n     the Afghan mountains.\n       In late December 1999, intercepted conversations on the \n     Yemen phone tipped off agents to the January 2000 Kuala \n     Lumpur summit, and to the names of at least two of its \n     participants: Almihdhar and Alhazmi. The condo where the \n     meeting took place was a weekend getaway owned by Yazid \n     Sufaat, a U.S.-educated microbiologist who had become a \n     radical Islamist and bin Laden follower. He was arrested last \n     December when he returned from Afghanistan, where he had \n     served as a field medic for the Taliban. Sufaat's lawyer says \n     his client let the men stay at his place because ``he \n     believes in allowing his property to be used for charitable \n     purposes.'' But he claims Sufaat had no idea that they were \n     terrorists.\n       After the meeting, Malaysian intelligence continued to \n     watch the condo at the CIA's request, but after a while the \n     agency lost interest. Had agents kept up the surveillance, \n     they might have observed another beneficiary of Sufaat's \n     charity: Zacarias Moussaoui, who stayed there on his way to \n     the United States later that year. The Malaysians say they \n     were surprised by the CIA's\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\n     lack of interest following the Kuala Lumpur meeting. ``We \n     couldn't fathom it, really,'' Rais Yatim, Malaysia's Legal \n     Affairs minister, told Newsweek. ``There was no show of \n     concern.''\n       Immediately after the meeting, Alhazmi boarded a plane to \n     Bangkok, where he met a connecting flight to Los Angeles on \n     Jan. 15, 2000. Since the CIA hadn't told the State Department \n     to put his name on the watch list of suspected terrorists, or \n     told the INS to be on the lookout for him, he breezed through \n     the airport and into America. Almihdhar was also on the \n     plane, though CIA agents did not know it at the time.\n       The CIA is forbidden from spying on people inside the \n     United States. Had it followed standard procedure and passed \n     the baton to the FBI once they crossed the border, agents \n     would have discovered that Almihdhar and Alhazmi weren't just \n     visiting California, they were already living there. The men \n     had moved into an apartment in San Diego two months before \n     the Kuala Lumpur meeting.\n       The CIA's reluctance to divulge what it knew is especially \n     odd because, as 2000 dawned, U.S. law-enforcement agencies \n     were on red alert, certain that a bin Laden strike somewhere \n     in the world could come at any moment. There was certainly \n     reason to believe bin Laden was sending men here to do grave \n     harm. Just a few weeks before, an alert Customs inspector had \n     caught another Qaeda terrorist, Ahmed Ressam, as he tried to \n     cross the Canadian border in a rental car packed with \n     explosives. His mission: to blow up Los Angeles airport. \n     Perhaps agency officials let down their guard after warnings \n     about a Millennium Eve attack never materialized. Whatever \n     the reason, Alhazmi and Almihdhar fell off their radar \n     screen.\n       Free to do as they pleased, the 25-year-old Alhazmi and 26-\n     year-old Almihdhar went about their terrorist training in \n     southern California. They told people they were buddies from \n     Saudi Arabia hoping to learn English and become commercial \n     airline pilots. The cleanshaven Alhazmi and Almihdhar played \n     soccer in the park with other Muslim men and prayed the \n     required five times a day at the area mosque. They bought \n     season passes to Sea World and dined on fast food, leaving \n     the burger wrappers strewn around their sparsely furnished \n     apartment. And, despite their religious convictions, the \n     men frequented area strip clubs. Neighbors found it odd \n     that the men would rarely use the telephones in their \n     apartment. Instead, they routinely went outside to make \n     calls on mobile phones.\n       People who knew the men recall that they couldn't have been \n     more different. Alhazmi was outgoing and cheerful, making \n     friends easily. He once posted an ad online seeking a Mexican \n     mail-order bride, and worked diligently to improve his \n     English. By contrast, Almihdhar was dark and brooding, and \n     expressed disgust with American culture. One evening, he \n     chided a Muslim acquaintance for watching ``immoral'' \n     American television. ``If you're so religious, why don't you \n     have facial hair?'' the friend shot back, Almihdhar patted \n     him condescendingly on the knee. ``You'll know someday, \n     brother,'' he said.\n       Neither man lost sight of the primary mission: learning to \n     fly airplanes. Almihdhar and Alhazmi took their flight \n     lessons seriously, but they were impossible to teach. \n     Instructor Rick Garza at Sorbi's Flying Club gave both men a \n     half-dozen classes on the ground before taking them up in a \n     single-engine Cessna in May. ``They were only interested in \n     flying big jets,'' Garza recalls. But Garza soon gave up on \n     his hapless students. ``I just thought they didn't have the \n     aptitude,'' he says. ``They were like Dumb and Dumber.''\n       Had law-enforcement agents been looking for Alhazmi and \n     Almihdhar at the time, they could have easily tracked them \n     through bank records. In September 2000, Alhazami opened a \n     $3,000 checking account at a Bank of America branch. The men \n     also used their real names on driver's licenses, Social \n     Security cards and credit cards. When Almihdhar bought a dark \n     blue 1988 Toyota Corolla for $3,000 cash, he registered it in \n     his name. (He later signed the registration over to Alhazmi, \n     whose name was on the papers when the car was found at Dulles \n     International Airport on September 11.) Of course, agents \n     might have used another resource to pinpoint their location: \n     the phone book, Page 13 of the 2000-2001 Pacific Bell White \n     Pages contains a listing for ``alhazmi Nawaf M 6401 Mount Ada \n     Rd. 858-279-5919.''\n       By then, though, the case seems to have gotten lost deep in \n     the CIA's files. But Almihdhar's name and face surfaced yet \n     again, in the aftermath of the October 2000 bombing of the \n     Cole. Within days of the attack, a team of FBI agents flew to \n     Yemen to investigate. They soon began closing in on suspects. \n     One was a man called Tawfiq bin Attash, a.k.a. Khallad, a \n     fierce, one-legged Qaeda fighter. When analysts at the CIA's \n     Counterterrorism Center in Langley, Va., pulled out the file \n     on Khallad, they discovered pictures of him taken at the \n     Kuala Lumpur meeting. In one of the shots, he is standing \n     next to Almihdhar.\n       If, as the CIA now claims, it wasn't certain that Almihdhar \n     had terrorist connections, it certainly knew it now. And yet \n     the agency still did nothing and notified no one.\n       In mid- to late 2000, Almihdhar left San Diego for good. It \n     appears that he spent the next several months bouncing around \n     the Middle East and Southeast Asia. While he was away, his \n     visa expired--a potentially big problem. Yet since the CIA \n     was still not sharing information about Almihdhar's Qaeda \n     connections, the State Department's Consular Office in Saudi \n     Arabia simply rubber-stamped him a new one.\n       Almihdhar returned to the United States on July 4, 2001, \n     flying into New York. He spent at least some of the time \n     leading up to September traveling around the East Coast and, \n     at least once, meeting with Mohamed Atta and other September \n     11 plotters in Las Vegas.\n       Meanwhile, Alhazmi, having flunked out of two California \n     flight schools, decided to try his luck in Phoenix in early \n     2001. There he hooked up with Qaeda terrorist in \n     training, Hani Hanjour, who eventually piloted Flight 77. \n     In April 2001 Alhazmi headed east, and was pulled over for \n     speeding. Oklahoma State Trooper C. L. Parkins ran \n     Alhazmi's California driver's license through the \n     computer, checked to see if the car was stolen and made \n     sure there wasn't a warrant out for Alhazmi's arrest. When \n     nothing came up, he issued the terrorist two tickets, \n     totaling $138, and sent him on his way. (The tickets were \n     not discovered until after 9-11.) Like Almihdhar, Alhazmi \n     eventually went east, spending time in New Jersey and \n     Maryland. On Aug. 25, he used his credit card to purchase \n     two tickets for Flight 77.\n       Two days earlier, CIA officials finally, and frantically, \n     awoke to their mistake. That summer, as U.S. intelligence \n     picked up repeated signals that bin Laden was about to launch \n     a major assault, Tenet ordered his staff to scrub the \n     agency's files, looking for anything that might help them \n     thwart whatever was coming. It didn't take long to discover \n     the file on Almihdhar and Alhazmi. CIA officials checked with \n     the INS, only to discover that Almihdhar had traveled out of \n     the country, and was allowed back in on his new visa. On Aug. \n     23, the CIA sent out an urgent cable, labeled immediate, to \n     the State Department, Customs, INS and FBI, telling them to \n     put the two men on the terrorism watch list.\n       The FBI began an aggressive, ``full field'' investigation. \n     Agents searched all nine Marriott hotels in New York City, \n     the place Almihdhar had listed as his ``destination'' on his \n     immigration forms in July. They also searched hotels in Los \n     Angeles, where the two men originally entered the country \n     back in 1999. But it's unclear whether agents scoured public \n     records for driver's licenses and phone numbers or tried to \n     track plane-ticket purchases. In preparation for their \n     mission, the men had gone to ground.\n       Now, amid the escalating blame wars in Washington, federal \n     agents are left to wonder how different things might have \n     been if they'd started that search nearly two years before. \n     The FBI's claim that it could have unraveled the plot by \n     watching Alhazmi and Almihdhar, and connecting the dots \n     between them and the other terrorists, seems compelling.\n       The links would not have been difficult to make: Alhazmi \n     met up with Hanjour, the Flight 77 pilot, in Phoenix in late \n     2000; six months later, in May 2001, the two men showed up in \n     New Jersey and opened shared bank accounts with two other \n     plotters, Ahmed Alghamdi and Majed Moqed. The next month, \n     Alhazmi helped two other hijackers, Salem Alhazmi (his \n     brother) and Abdulaziz Alomari, open their own bank accounts. \n     Two months after that, in August 2001, the trail would have \n     led to the pilot's ringleader, Mohamed Atta, who had bought \n     plane tickets for Moqed and Alomari. What's more, at least \n     several of the hijackers had traveled to Las Vegas for a \n     meeting in summer 2001, just weeks before the attacks. ``It's \n     like three degrees of separation,'' insists an FBI official.\n       But would even that have been enough? There's no doubt that \n     Alhazmi and Almihdhar could have been stopped from coming \n     into the country if the CIA had shared its information with \n     other agencies. But then two other hijackers could have been \n     sent to take their place. And given how little the FBI \n     understood Al Qaeda's way of operating--and how it managed to \n     mishandle the key clues it did have--it's possible that \n     agents could have identified all 19 hijackers and still not \n     figured out what they were up to. That, one former FBI \n     official suggests, could have led to the cruelest September \n     11 scenario of all: ``We would have had the FBI watching them \n     get on the plane in Boston and calling Los Angeles,'' he \n     says. `` `Could you pick them up on the other end?' ''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From Newsweek, Sept. 16, 2002]\n\n               The Informant Who Lived With the Hijackers\n\n                  (By Michael Isikoff with Jamie Reno)\n\n       At first, FBI director Bob Mueller insisted there was \n     nothing the bureau could have done to penetrate the 9-11 \n     plot. That account has been modified over time--and now may \n     change again. Newsweek has learned that one of the bureau's \n     informants had a close relationship with two of the \n     hijackers: he was their roommate.\n       The connection, just discovered by congressional \n     investigators, has stunned some top counterterrorism \n     officials and raised new concerns about the information-\n     sharing among U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. \n     The two hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, were \n     hardly unknown to the intelligence community. The CIA was \n     first alerted to them in January 2000, when the two Saudi \n     nationals showed up at a Qaeda ``summit'' in Kuala Lumpur, \n     Malaysia. FBI officials have argued internally for months \n     that if the CIA had more quickly passed along everything it \n     knew about the two men, the bureau could have hunted them \n     down more aggressively.\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\n       But both agencies can share in the blame. Upon leaving \n     Malaysia, Almihdhar and Alhazmi went to San Diego, where they \n     took flight-school lessons. In September 2000, the two moved \n     into the home of a Muslim man who had befriended them at the \n     local Islamic Center. The landlord regularly prayed with them \n     and even helped one open a bank account. He was also, sources \n     tell Newsweek, a ``tested'' undercover ``asset'' who had been \n     working closely with the FBI office in San Diego on terrorism \n     cases related to Hamas. A senior law-enforcement official \n     told Newsweek the informant never provided the bureau with \n     the names of his two houseguests from Saudi Arabia. Nor does \n     the FBI have any reason to believe the informant was \n     concealing their identities. (He could not be reached for \n     comment.) But the FBI concedes that a San Diego case agent \n     appears to have been at least aware that Saudi visitors were \n     renting rooms in the informant's house. (On one occasion, a \n     source says, the case agent called up the informant and was \n     told he couldn't talk because ``Khalid''--a reference to \n     Almidhdhar--was in the room.). I. C. Smith, a former top FBI \n     counterintelligence official, says the case agent should have \n     been keeping closer tabs on who his informant was \n     fraternizing with--if only to seek out the houseguests as \n     possible informants. ``They should have been asking, `Who are \n     these guys? What are they doing here?' This strikes me as a \n     lack of investigative curiosity.'' About six weeks after \n     moving into the house, Almidhdhar left town, explaining to \n     the landlord he was heading back to Saudi Arabia to see his \n     daughter. Alhazmi moved out at the end of 2000.\n       In the meantime, the CIA was gathering more information \n     about just how potentially dangerous both men were. A few \n     months after the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in \n     Yemen, CIA analysts discovered in their Malaysia file that \n     one of the chief suspects in the Cole attack--Tawfiq bin \n     Attash--was present at the ``summit'' and had been \n     photographed with Almihdhar and Alhazmi. But it wasn't \n     until Aug. 23, 2001, that the CIA sent out an urgent cable \n     to U.S. border and law-enforcement agencies identifying \n     the two men as ``possible'' terrorists. By then it was too \n     late. The bureau did not realize the San Diego connection \n     until a few days after 9-11, when the informant heard the \n     names of the Pentagon hijackers and called his case agent. \n     ``I know those guys,'' the informant purportedly said, \n     referring to Almihdhar and Alhazmi. ``They were my \n     roommates.''\n       But the belated discovery has unsettled some members of the \n     joint House and Senate Intelligence Committees investigating \n     the 9-11 attacks. The panel is tentatively due to begin \n     public hearings as early as Sept. 18, racing to its end-of-\n     the-year deadline. But some members are now worried that they \n     won't get to the bottom of what really happened by then. \n     Support for legislation creating a special blue-ribbon \n     investigative panel, similar to probes conducted after Pearl \n     Harbor and the Kennedy assassination, is increasing. Only \n     then, some members say, will the public learn whether more 9-\n     11 secrets are buried in the government's files.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So what you have, in January of 2000, is not only the \ninformant, the CIA had the information. Again, like I said, they did \nnot communicate it. The dots are never going to get joined. I can see \npoor Condoleezza Rice standing up and saying: We didn't have anything \nspecific. We didn't have anything specific. She will never get anything \nspecific. She will not get a phone call saying, ``We are coming,'' like \nwe have already called Saddam with. We have told him, ``We are \ncoming.'' But that is not the way the world works with the al-Qaida \ncrowd.\n  So right to the point, on July 10, 2001, the FBI learned about the \nPhoenix, AZ, flight school. A memo was sent to the FBI. But it stopped \nat midlevel--never communicated to the White House, never communicated \nto the CIA. Again, the dots not joined. I can tell you that right here \nand now.\n  Here is a news story from July 21, 2001, before 9/11 of last year, in \nthe Iraqi news. The name of that particular newspaper is Al-Nasiriya.\n  Quoting from it:\n\n       Bin Ladin has become a puzzle and a proof also, of the \n     inability of the American federalism and the CIA to uncover \n     the man and uncover his nest. The most advanced organizations \n     of the world cannot find the man and continues to go in \n     cycles in illusion and presuppositions.\n\n  It refers to an exercise called ``How Do You Bomb the White House.'' \nThey were planning it.\n  Let me read this to all the colleagues here:\n\n       The phenomenon of Bin Ladin is a healthy phenomenon in the \n     Arab spirit. It is a decision and a determination that the \n     stolen Arab self has come to realize after it got bored with \n     promises of its rulers; After it disgusted itself from their \n     abomination and their corruption, the man had to carry the \n     book of God . . . and write on some white paper ``If you are \n     unable to drive off the Marines from the Kaaba, I will do \n     so.'' It seems that they will be going away because the \n     revolutionary Bin Ladin is insisting very convincingly that \n     he will strike America on the arm that is already hurting.\n\n  In other words, the World Trade Towers. Here, over a year ahead of \ntime in the open press in Iraq, they are writing that this man is \nplanning not only to bomb the White House, but where they are already \nhurting, the World Trade Towers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Al-Nasiriya, July 21, 2001]\n\n              America, an Obsession Called Osama Bin Ladin\n\n                        (By Naeem Abd Muhalhal)\n\n       Osama Bin Ladin says that he took from the desert its \n     silence and its anger at the same time.\n       He has learned how to harm America and has been able to do \n     it, for he gave a bad reputation to the Pentagon as being \n     weakened in more than one spot in the world. In order to \n     follow one step taken by Bin Ladin America has put to work \n     all its apparatus, its computers and its satellites just as \n     the governor cowboy of Texas has done. Bin Ladin's name has \n     been posted on all the internet sites and an amount of $5 \n     million dollars has been awarded to anyone who could give any \n     information that would lead to the arrest of this lanky, \n     lightly bearded man. In this man's heart you'll find an \n     insistence, a strange determination that he will reach one \n     day the tunnels of the White House and will bomb it with \n     everything that is in it.\n       We all know that every age has its revolutionary \n     phenomenon. In Mexico there was Zapata. In Bolivia there was \n     Che Guevara, during the seventies came out Marcos and the Red \n     Brigades in Italy, the Baader Meinhof Gang in Germany and \n     there was Leila Khaled the Palestinian woman and others. They \n     all appeared in violence and disappeared quietly. During the \n     nineties Bin Ladin came out in the open having been \n     completely overtaken in his mind by the robbery happening to \n     his country and its treasurers. For him it was the beginning \n     of the revolution. For this endeavor he mobilized everything \n     that he had of money, of investments and Sudan was his first \n     stop. Bin Ladin ended up in Afghanistan where his \n     revolutionary drive pushed this stubborn revolutionary to \n     plan very carefully, and in a very detailed manner, his stand \n     to push back the boastful American onslaught and to change \n     the American legend into a bubble of soap.\n       Because Bin Ladin knows what causes pain to America, he \n     played America's game, just as an oppressed man entertains \n     itself with the thing oppressing him. He countered with the \n     language of dynamite and explosives in the city of Khobar and \n     destroyed two US embassies in Nairobi and Dar al Salaam.\n       America says, admitting just like a bird in the midst of a \n     tornado, that Bin Ladin is behind the bombing of its \n     destroyer in Aden. The fearful series of events continues for \n     America and the terror within America gets to the point that \n     the Governor of Texas increases the amount of the award, just \n     as the stubbornness of the other man and his challenge \n     increases. This challenge makes it such that one of his \n     grandchildren comes from Jeddah traveling on the official \n     Saudi Arabia airlines and celebrates with him the marriage of \n     one of the daughters of his companions. Bin Ladin has become \n     a puzzle and a proof also, of the inability of the American \n     federalism and the C.I.A. to uncover the man and uncover his \n     nest. The most advanced organizations of the world cannot \n     find the man and continues to go in cycles in illusion and \n     presuppositions. They still hope that he could come out from \n     his nest one day, they hope that he would come out from his \n     hiding hole and one day they will point at him their missiles \n     and he will join Guevara, Hassan Abu Salama, Kamal Nasser, \n     Kanafani and others. The man responds with a thin smile and \n     replies to the correspondent from Al Jazeera that he will \n     continue to be the obsession and worry of America and the \n     Jews, and that even that night he will practice and work on \n     an exercise called ``How Do You Bomb the White House.'' And \n     because they know that he can get there, they have started to \n     go through their nightmares on their beds and the leaders \n     have had to wear their bulletproof vests.\n       Meanwhile America has started to pressure the Taliban \n     movement so that it would hand them Bin Ladin, while he \n     continues to smile and still thinks seriously, with the \n     seriousness of the Bedouin of the desert about the way he \n     will try to bomb the Pentagon after he destroys the White \n     House . . .\n       The phenomenon of Bin Ladin is a healthy phenomenon in the \n     Arab spirit. It is a decision and a determination that the \n     stolen Arab self has come to realize after it got bored with \n     promises of its rulers: After it disgusted itself from their \n     abomination and their corruption, the man had to carry the \n     book of God and the Kalashnikov and write on some off white \n     paper ``If you are unable to drive off the Marines from the \n     Kaaba, I will do so.'' It seems that they will be going away \n     because the revolutionary Bin Ladin is insisting very \n     convincingly that he will strike America on the arm that is \n     already hurting. That the man will not be swayed by the plant \n     leaves of Whitman nor by the ``Adventures of Indiana Jones'' \n     and will curse the\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n     memory of Frank Sinatra every time he hears his songs. This \n     new awareness of the image that Bin Ladin has become gives \n     shape to the resting areas and stops for every Arab \n     revolutionary. It is the subject of our admiration here in \n     Iraq because it shares with us in a unified manner our \n     resisting stand, and just as he fixes his gaze on the Al Aqsa \n     we greet him. We hail his tears as they see the planes of the \n     Western world taking revenge against his heroic operations by \n     bombing the cities of Iraq . . .\n       To Bin Ladin I say that revolution, the wings of a dove and \n     the bullet are all but one and the same thing in the heart of \n     a believer.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then on August 15, just prior to September 11 of last \nyear, we had Moussaoui arrested in Minnesota. He wanted to know how to \nfly a plane, but not how to take off in a plane. And the FBI's Coleen \nRowley, from Minnesota, testified before the Congress that she had \nwritten a memo, and the way she summed it up, they could crash the \nplane into the World Trade Towers.\n  Again, Mr. President, I could continue to go down the list, but we \nhave this USA Today article of September 2 of this year, where the \nhijacker allegedly bragged what they were going to do on September 11. \nThe year before the attacks, the Germans reported the particular \nterrorist saying that was exactly what they were going to do.\n  And there is a Time magazine article of May 27 of this year that sums \nup how the United States missed all of the clues. We have seen all the \nparticular articles, and now we have the amendment in to fix the \nproblem.\n  Let me just say a word about, and not in any criticism of our \ndistinguished Director of the National Security Council, but \nCondoleezza Rice is about as steeped in domestic security as I am in \nforeign policy.\n  You can't find anyone more qualified in foreign policy. This young \nlady graduated at 20 years of age Phi Beta Kappa from the University of \nDenver. Then she earned her master's at the University of Notre Dame a \nyear later, when she was 21. At the age of 27, she received her \ndoctorate from the School of International Studies at the University of \nDenver, and then in 1981 became a faculty member of Stanford University \nin foreign policy.\n  So she has been steeped in that particular discipline all her life. \nLet me quote from her particular biography:\n\n       The Bush administration has substantially restructured the \n     National Security Council during its first three weeks in \n     office, providing an early indication of how the new White \n     House plans to handle foreign policy.\n\n  She cut the NSC staff by a third, reorganized it to emphasize defense \nstrategy, national missile defense, and international economics.\n\n       In a White House first, Rice has expanded her regular \n     meetings with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to include Treasury Secretary \n     Paul O'Neill.\n\n  It also indicates:\n\n       . . . Bush's desire to decrease U.S. involvement in the \n     Balkans and signal to Russia ``that this administration is \n     not going to treat Russia as a special case.'' Other notable \n     changes have been the elimination of the divisions handling \n     international environmental and health issues, and of the \n     NSC's communications and legislative offices.\n\n  The reason I point this out is that prior to coming on board, the \nprevious Director of the National Security Council, Sandy Berger, had a \none-on-one meeting, telling Dr. Rice: Look, you are coming on board, \nand most of your time is going to be taken up with counterterrorism. \nThere isn't any question about it. But what does she do? Instead, she \ntakes action on everything that she knows about and she is absolutely \nauthoritative in, but is not the need of the moment.\n  My problem with this bill is that it doesn't include any of the \nagencies that had a failure on 9/11 in the proposed Department. The CIA \nfailed. The FBI failed. The National Security Agency failed. On \nSeptember 10, the NSA got a message in Arabic: Tomorrow is zero hour. \nBut they didn't translate it from Arabic into English until September \n12. And then the National Security Council, limply standing there, not \nbeing informed of anything, just said: Well, they didn't give us \nanything specific.\n\n  It is the National Security Council's function to bring all the \nelements together, the gathering of intelligence, the analysis of \nintelligence, the joining of dots, the fixing of responsibility. The \nbuck stops here. That is what this simple amendment does.\n  It puts the FBI Director on the Council. Now we have a domestic \nintelligence effort, something we never had. I met immediately with Bob \nMueller. I have his particular budget. I gave him some $750 million to \nup-date his computers and synchronize them with the FAA and the \nImmigration Service, the Border Patrol, and everything else, so that we \ncould have one-stop shopping on knowledge of any kind of a terrorist \nthreat.\n  We also gave him the money transfer of the funds last fall to \ninstitute his new Department of Domestic Intelligence. Now the Domestic \nIntelligence is supposed to give that over to the Department of \nHomeland Security. But the Homeland Department does not gather any \nintelligence. It only takes what it is given, and it only analyzes what \nis given and, in a sense, doesn't know what to ask for because they are \nnot in the game. It is the same with the CIA. I can see right now a \nbreakdown continuing between domestic and foreign intelligence.\n  I have talked to Director Mueller on this particular score. He has \nhired experienced CIA personnel at the FBI to help him set it up as a \nDepartment of Domestic Intelligence. He says he is talking with the \nCIA. But he hasn't really gotten all the way down to his agents and \ndirectors talking at the State level. They have yet to talk to the \nchiefs of police. I know because we have had meetings with respect to \nport security. It will take time. It may take 5 years for this new \nDepartment to really get in gear and work correctly.\n  But let me say here and now that we have to have this fixed. The only \nplace I know to be able to fix it is with the President himself--and we \nhave that type of President. That President is no nonsense. He wants to \nhave on his desk timely reports on intelligence, just like he gets from \nCarl Rove, timely reports on politics. Let's give the emphasis and \ntime--a little bit at least--to intelligence. Give me those timely \nreports. And that timely report has to be fused not just from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, or the office, or the bureau, or \nwhatever else they call Governor Ridge over there, but it has to be \nfused at the National Security Council level, with foreign \nintelligence.\n  I am not for the President having to get his director over here \nconfirmed by the Senate. I would favor the Thompson amendment. We don't \nwant the National Security Council Director to come here and be \nconfirmed. I think Governor Ridge, in contrast to Condoleezza Rice, \nknows law enforcement. He has been a Governor, been in Congress, been \nchief law enforcement officer of Pennsylvania. He knows domestic \nsecurity, which is something that Dr. Rice has never been into until 9/\n11. She will have a hard time learning at that level, unless she gets \nhelp.\n  So I think Governor Ridge is an excellent individual in that White \nHouse, or wherever they put him, to help her begin to report. But she \nhas to ultimately, as Director, fuse domestic with foreign \nintelligence, and all the other intelligence you might get from places \nlike the Drug Enforcement Administration. The financing of terrorism is \ndrugs. We know it. They have to follow the banks. She has to get \nintelligence from the Secretary of the Treasury. She has to work with \nall these particular entities, and the President doesn't have to take \nthis volumes and volumes of intelligence reports and sit down and read \nall day. It has to be not only analyzed but prioritized. So it is right \nin front of him, what he has to give his attention to at that moment \nand throughout the day, each day, on our homeland security.\n  I yield the floor temporarily.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was going to ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as our highly esteemed colleague knows \nfull well, he occupies a position in this Chamber almost second to none \nby virtue of his long experience and as a chief executive officer of \nhis State, a Governor. In listening very carefully to what he said, it \noccurs to me that there is merit in this amendment.\n  However, my question to our colleague, given the rather dramatic \npoints he makes here, is: Should we not allow the current President the \nopportunity to communicate with the Senate his views on this? It seems \nto me\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nthis council was established for the specific reason of being advisory \nto him. It is thought of as his means of establishing an \ninfrastructure, as all Presidents have done, that best serves the \nmethod by which they wish to govern and discharge their \nresponsibilities as President. My committee, Armed Services, the \nForeign Relations Committee, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and \nothers that possibly have some oversight on this type of amendment, it \nseems to me, could quickly gather the views and, in all probability, we \nmay end up with our colleague's amendment. But at least afford the \ncourtesy to the President to share with the Congress--and most \nspecifically the Senate--the views before they act on such a dramatic \npiece of legislation as this.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Of course, we have the President's views. He submitted \na bill. In general, that particular view is before the Senate in the \nform of the House bill. While we have our own views--and that is our \nresponsibility--this is not to preempt the President. In all fairness, \nwhen you see the distinguished chairman of Armed Services, he is who is \ndisturbed. Talk about turf--not of the Senator from Virginia, but the \nPentagon, the Department of State. Calls went out to the Department of \nState on this particular amendment. They don't want that FBI. They \ndon't want the domestic intelligence. They don't want that Secretary of \nHomeland Security. They want their National Security Council to be \nsolely engaged in foreign policy and foreign and international threats, \nnot domestic.\n  So no siree, that would be a put off, as it would be for the Pentagon \ncrowd. We worked very closely with the Army and Navy and their \nintelligence, and I have the greatest admiration for Secretary \nRumsfeld. But they have to report in, too, to this domestic \nintelligence. That still has to be--the intelligence--fused with CIA \nforeign intelligence at the level of the National Security Council. \nThere is no substitute for it.\n  If the President doesn't like it, he will say so to the House and it \nwill be knocked out in conference. So don't worry about that. I am not \nworried about it. I want everybody to know here and now this bill does \nnothing to avoid and prevent another 9/11. All the agencies that, on 9/\n11, performed admirably--the Coast Guard was doing its job, FEMA was \ndoing its job, and they got the agriculture people who were doing their \njob--they are the ones being included. Some 110,000 of the 170,000 \npeople to be in this proposed department, with respect to seaport \nsecurity, airline security, and rail security are already together in \nthe Department of Transportation. We have been working on that. We have \ninstituted an Office of Domestic Preparedness within the Justice \nDepartment. We have all of that going.\n  But the ones that failed are totally left out of the Department of \nHomeland Security--the ones that failed us on 9/11 go untouched. \nPlease, my distinguished colleague, don't come up and say let's find \nout what he thinks and put this off. We know what he thinks. Vote for \nthis amendment and send it to the House. If they knock it out, it will \nbe dropped out.\n  For one, I go along with Senator Thompson. We don't need to confirm \nDr. Rice at the National Security Council. Generally speaking, we don't \nhave her name over on her budget. We talk about that on the \nAppropriations Committee level--if there is an Office of Homeland \nSecurity there. I go along with the Senator from Tennessee not to \nrequire that office be confirmed over here because, as President, I \nknow good and well I would not depend on the legislative branch's \nintelligence. I can tell you that right now.\n  With any Department they would institute, I have a mammoth \nresponsibility. The buck stops here, and I cannot explain another 9/11 \nby going along with this bill and saying the problem is solved. It is \nnot solved at all. Don't delay me, Senator. You know and I know it will \nbe taken out if the President opposes it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Senator of South Carolina has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be yielded 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I wish \nto commend the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and our very \ndear, soon-departing friend from Tennessee for their very important \nwork on this bill, homeland security.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4513\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will now turn, I say to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, my remarks to the question of the pending amendment by \nthe Senator from Tennessee, and I thank my good friend for his reply to \nmy question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we were, as a body in recess--fortunately, \nthe leadership decided this body should go into recess so we could \nwatch the President of the United States deliver a speech which, in my \njudgment, is one of the most important speeches ever delivered before \nthe United Nations.\n  He laid out with specific clarity the threats to the world posed by \nSaddam Hussein, the threats to the world of inaction at this time, and \nthat those who say to him, there is concern this Nation is acting \nunilaterally--our President very clearly gave the United Nations a \nclear and respectful mandate to act now in the face of unrefuted facts \nthat in 16 instances, Saddam Hussein has defied the United Nations and \nthe Security Council. What better evidence?\n  He alluded to the fact that Saddam Hussein has provided evidence--\nclearly, it is there--of a highly increased tempo of activities toward \nthe manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, weapons which in no way \nare needed for the rightful defense of the sovereign Nation of Iraq, \nweapons that could only be manufactured and devised for offensive \nactions against other nations.\n  This is not a war, which we are alluding to, between Iraq and the \nUnited States. This is a war of free nations--many free nations--free \npeople, innocent people whose lives are at risk in the same way lives \nwere risked on 9/11 a year ago in New York, in my State of Virginia, \nand in Pennsylvania. I commend the President.\n  It is interesting, against his speech is the background of another \nPresident, President Clinton, who on February 19, 1998, referring to \nhis own perspective on terrorism, said, referring to the terrorists:\n\n       They actually take advantage of the freer movement of \n     people, information and ideas, and they will be all the more \n     lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver \n     them. We simply cannot allow this to happen. There is no more \n     clear example of this threat than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. His \n     regime threatens the safety of his people, the stability of \n     the region, and the security of all the rest of us.\n\n  Our President built on that foundation in this historic speech that \nwas delivered today. It is my fervent hope that the Congress of the \nUnited States, hopefully led by the Senate, will accede to the \nPresident's request made to a group of us from the House and Senate who \nwere in his office just weeks ago, when he called on the Congress, to \nact with respect to this situation such that the executive branch, led \nby President Bush, and the Congress are arm in arm as we carry forward \nour war against terrorism and, most specifically, the threats posed by \nIraq.\n  We are here on the issue of homeland defense, the issue of a new \nDepartment. We have had a good debate. We have our differences of view \nbut, nevertheless, I see the momentum, I hope, in this body to move \nforward with this legislation.\n  I support the overall intent of this legislation. I strongly agree \nwith the need to better organize our Government to protect our \nhomeland, but I do not support all the provisions of this bill.\n  Two such provisions are addressed by the pending Thompson amendment, \nwhich I strongly support, which would strike titles II and III of the \nunderlying legislation. These titles have been of concern to me for \nsome time, and in a letter dated July 17 of this year, which I ask now \nunanimous consent to print in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, I so expressed my concerns to the managers of this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, title II mandates the establishment of a \nNational Office for Combating Terrorism, and title III mandates the \ndevelopment of a national strategy for combating terrorism and homeland \nsecurity response. I note that the administration is strongly opposed \nto both of these titles.\n  The arguments against title II are not unlike the questions I posed \nto the distinguished Senator from South Carolina regarding his measure, \nwhich is also pending before the Senate. And that is, we should accord, \nas a legislative body, the Congress, the maximum flexibility to our \nPresident, be he Democrat or Republican, in establishing that structure \nhe deems necessary in his Department to best serve his style of \ndischarging the obligations of the Office of President.\n  Our President respectfully says to the Congress: I do not need what \nis proposed in title II.\n  Again, on October 8, 2001, following the tragic events of September \n11, President Bush formed the Office of Homeland Security in the \nExecutive Office of the President to oversee immediate homeland \nsecurity concerns and to propose long-term solutions.\n  Governor Ridge has discharged with great distinction the \nresponsibilities of that office. They worked hard under the President's \nguidance to produce a comprehensive plan that now deserves our serious \nconsideration and support.\n  Again, the mandate to establish an Office for Combating Terrorism \nwithin the Executive Office of the President of the United States, in \nmy judgment, would be redundant to the structure currently in place, \nparticularly since the President has already stated his intention to \nretain the position of Assistant to the President for Homeland \nSecurity. I urge the Senate to respect the right of the President under \nthe Constitution to establish his office, his infrastructure, which \nbest serves his style of management.\n  Turning to a second concern, and that is budget review and \ncertification authority provided for in this legislation to the \nproposed Director of the National Office for Combating Terrorism, in my \nview, such authority will undercut the ability of several Cabinet-level \nofficials, most notably the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, \nAttorney General, and the Director of Central Intelligence, as well as \nthe new Secretary of Homeland Security, assuming the Senate and the \nHouse act, to carry out their primary responsibilities.\n  In the case of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense--\nand I have had the privilege in my 24 years in the Senate of working \nwith a succession of those Secretaries--the Secretary of Defense has a \nwide-ranging responsibility to protect the vital U.S. interests and to \nprotect against the threats that are ever mounting against our Nation.\n  The Department, under the leadership of Secretary Rumsfeld, is \ncurrently engaged in an all-out global war against terrorism designed \nto bring to justice those responsible for the September 11 attacks on \nour Nation and to deter would-be terrorists and those who harbor them \nfrom further attacks. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that the \nDepartment is adequately and properly funded to carry out its many \nmissions.\n  Pending before the Congress is the largest increase in defense \nspending in many years, decades, but it is necessary. Our committee, \nthe authorization committee, together with the Appropriations \nCommittee, will soon bring their respective conference reports to this \nbody for approval, and I anticipate rapid approval by both Houses of \nCongress.\n  It would be unwise to subject portions of the budget of these \nrespective Cabinet officers to a veto in many respects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Would the Senator like additional time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I turn now to title III. The pending legislation requires \nthe development of a national strategy for combating terrorism and \nhomeland security response. I have been the author, with colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, Senator Nunn, who was chairman of our \nCommittee on Armed Services, and Chairman Levin, the current chairman, \nand urged that these various reports concerning the security of our \nUnited States be brought by the administration to the Congress in a \ntimely manner so we can make our appropriate decisions on the budget.\n  Time and again, our committees have done that. It has been, generally \nspeaking, a good response by successive administrations on this \nsubject.\n  When the President established the Office of Homeland Security, he \ndirected Governor Ridge to develop a comprehensive strategy to protect \nthe United States from attack, which is right here. Therefore, I think \nit is again redundant for this specific section in title III to be \nenacted which more or less formalizes, again, the necessity for \nproducing this report which the President has voluntarily done.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Connecticut in the Chamber. I \ncommend him for the hard work he has done, and I strongly urge that \nthis body be given the opportunity soon to make its final deliberations \nand that this important legislation be adopted in whatever form is the \nwill of the Senate.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Connecticut, as well as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson: On July 15, I \n     joined with Senator Levin in sending a letter to your \n     Committee on the Bush Administration's proposal to create a \n     Department of Homeland Security. That letter addressed issues \n     in the Administration's proposal which fall under the \n     jurisdiction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Today, I \n     am writing to express my concerns about certain aspects of S. \n     2452, the National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism \n     Act of 2002, which was reported out of the Government Affairs \n     Committee on June 24, 2002. While I support the overall \n     intent of the legislation and agree with the need to better \n     organize our government to protect our homeland, much has \n     changed since this bill was reported to the Senate.\n       In the intervening weeks, the President has proposed the \n     establishment of a Department of Homeland Security and the \n     most fundamental reorganization of the United States \n     Government since the passage of the National Security Act of \n     1947. This proposal is the logical culmination of a very \n     deliberate process that started when then-Governor George W. \n     Bush established homeland security as his highest priority \n     during a speech at the Citadel in September 1999, stating, \n     ``Once a strategic afterthought, homeland defense has become \n     an urgent duty.''\n       Following the tragic events of September 11, President Bush \n     formed the Office of Homeland Security in the Executive \n     Office of the White House to oversee immediate homeland \n     security concerns and to propose long-term solutions. \n     Governor Ridge and others have worked hard under the \n     President's guidance to produce a comprehensive plan that now \n     deserves our serious consideration and support.\n       While I support the establishment of a Department of \n     Homeland Security, I do not support creating a National \n     Office for Combating Terrorism as outlined in Title II of S. \n     2452. In my view, establishing this position within the \n     Executive Office of the President would be redundant to the \n     structure put in place by the President on October 8, 2001. \n     The President has already stated his intention to retain the \n     position of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.\n       I have serious concerns about the budget review and \n     certification authority provided to this proposed Director of \n     the National Office for Combating Terrorism by S. 2452. In my \n     view, such authorities would undercut the ability of several \n     Cabinet-level officials, including the Secretary of Defense, \n     the Secretary of State, the Attorney General and the Director \n     of Central Intelligence, to carry out their primary \n     responsibilities. In the case of the Department of Defense, \n     the Secretary has wide-ranging responsibilities to protect \n     vital U.S. interests and to prevent threats from reaching our \n     shores. The Department, under the leadership of Secretary \n     Rumsfeld, is currently engaged in an all-out global war \n     against terrorism--designed to bring to justice those \n     responsible for the September 11 attacks on our nation and to \n     deter would-be terrorists and those who harbor them from \n     further attacks. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that \n     the Department is adequately and properly funded to carry out \n     its many missions. It would be\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\n     unwise to subject the budget carefully prepared by the \n     Secretary of Defense to a ``decertification''--in essence, a \n     veto--by an official who does not have to balance the many \n     competing needs of the Department of Defense and the men and \n     women of the Armed Forces.\n       I also note that Title III of S. 2452 requires the \n     development of a National Strategy for Combating Terrorism \n     and the Homeland Security Response. When the President \n     established the Office of Homeland Security, he directed \n     Governor Ridge to develop a comprehensive strategy to protect \n     the United States from terrorist attacks. President Bush \n     unveiled his Homeland Security Strategy earlier this week, \n     precluding the need for the requirement in Title III, S. \n     2452. Legislating anything other than a periodic review and \n     update of this strategy would be burdensome and would divert \n     attention and resources away from the Administration's focus \n     on homeland defense and the global war on terrorism. As the \n     President stated in releasing the Homeland Security Strategy \n     on July 16, ``The U.S. Government has no more important \n     mission than protecting the homeland from future terrorist \n     attacks.'' We in the Congress should do all we can to help \n     our President achieve this goal.\n       I hope my comments are useful as you continue your work on \n     this important legislation.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am proud of the work our Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has done. It was a very open process. We included provisions \nrecommended by members of both parties. I think it is a strong \nproposal. Obviously, there is some disagreement with the White House \nabout parts of it, but I repeat what I have said before, that we are in \nagreement on: First, the basic necessity to better organize our \nhomeland defenses, because this disorganization which exists now is \ndangerous. Second, there is broad bipartisan agreement on this bill we \nhave reported out of our committee and the White House about what I \nhave estimated to be 90 percent of the components of the bill. We are \nhaving a series of tussles about the remaining 10 percent. The sooner \nwe resolve them, the better. The sooner we get this bill passed and on \nthe way to a conference committee with the House and authorize the \nadministration to set up this new Department, the safer the American \npeople will be.\n  I appreciate the Senator's call for expedited action, and I hope and \npray that others in the Senate heed that call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nopposition to the idea for a National Office for Combating Terrorism, \nwhich would be a position confirmed by the Senate, because I believe \nthe responsibilities which are enumerated in the bill can be handled by \nthe Secretary for Homeland Security so that it is not necessary to have \nanother position of Director for the National Office for Combating \nTerrorism.\n  As the responsibilities are set forth in section 201(c), first to \ndevelop national objectives and policies for combating terrorism, that \nis a core function for the Secretary of Homeland Security. Second, to \ndirectly review the development of a comprehensive national assessment \nof terrorist threats, again, I believe is something which can be \nhandled by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which is a position to \nbe confirmed.\n  Another responsibility enumerated in the statute is to coordinate the \nimplementation of the strategy by agencies with responsibilities for \ncombating terrorism, and there again it is my view that that can be \nhandled by the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Another responsibility is to work with agencies, including the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to address vulnerabilities identified \nby the Director of Central Infrastructure Protection within the \nDepartment. Again, that is a matter which can be handled by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  Another responsibility is to coordinate, with the advice of the \nSecretary, the development of a comprehensive annual budget for the \nprogram and activities under the strategy, including the budgets of the \nmilitary departments and agencies within the national foreign \nintelligence program related to international terrorism, but excluding \nmilitary programs, projects, or activities relating to force \nprotection.\n\n  I believe there is sound reason for having budget authority to \ncoordinate overall the intelligence functions. However, again, I think \nto the extent we grant that overall budget authority, the logical place \nto put it is in the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  As the other responsibilities are enumerated, to have the exercise, \nfunction, and authority for Federal terrorism prevention and response \nagencies, again, these are matters for the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The intent of the drafter of these provisions is correct in seeking \nto provide the coordination, but to have another officeholder confirmed \nby the Senate and in the West Wing is not advisable. The analogy to the \nNational Security Council position now held by Dr. Condoleezza Rice, I \nthink, is inapposite and does not apply to making the Director for the \nNational Office of Combating Terrorism a confirmed position.\n  There is a real need on the overall coordination, to be sure we have \nall of the agencies responsible for intelligence and analysis under one \numbrella, such as the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nthe National Security Agency, and all of the intelligence agencies.\n  A point worth repeating is that had we put all of the dots together \non matters known prior to September 11, 2001, there was a veritable \nblueprint and September 11 might well have been prevented. There was \nthe Phoenix office of the FBI reporting on a man taking flight \ntraining, a big picture of Osama bin Laden on his wall, and other \nrespective connections to al-Qaida. We had the two terrorists known by \nthe CIA in Kuala Lumpur who turned out to be terrorist pilots of planes \non 9/11. The information was not given to the FBI or the INS in a \ntimely fashion. There was the threat given to the National Security \nAgency on September 10, 2001, which was not transcribed, that something \nwas going to happen the next day. It was not interpreted until \nSeptember 12, after the events of 9/11 had occurred.\n  Perhaps most importantly, there was the effort to obtain a warrant \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as to Zacarias \nMoussaoui, and had that warrant been obtained, there was an actual \ntreasure trove of information linking Moussaoui to al-Qaida.\n  The FBI used the wrong standard, as disclosed in the testimony of \nSpecial Agent Coleen Rowley, who appeared with FBI Director Mueller on \nJune 6 at an oversight hearing by the Judiciary Committee. In Agent \nRowley's letter, she talked about the U.S. attorney in Minnesota \nrequiring 75 to 80 percent probabilities. Agent Rowley thought that was \nwrong. She thought the standard should be a preponderance of the \nevidence, more likely than not--51 percent, as she put it. However, she \nwas wrong as well because the standard is articulated in the case \ncaptioned Gates v. Illinois, an opinion written by then-Justice \nRehnquist, saying the standard was suspicion, and Justice Rehnquist \nwent back to the Krantz case with Chief Justice Marshall talking about \nsuspicion on the totality of the factors. However, there was ample \nevidence to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for \nZacarias Moussaoui.\n  It would have been thought that the FBI would have had its house in \norder after their experience on Wen Ho Lee, when at the highest levels \nof the Justice Department, the matter rightfully went to the Attorney \nGeneral at that time and they declined to issue a vice warrant and \nlater determined, even by the review of the Justice Department, there \nwas probable cause. That matter was subjected to very intense oversight \nby the Judiciary Committee at that time.\n  We have pursued the oversight on Zacarias Moussaoui. We found in \nclosed hearings--this much can be disclosed--the FBI agents are still \nnot applying the correct standard. I wrote to FBI Director Mueller on \nJuly 10, 2002. We had the hearings on July 9. I asked when they would \napply the right standard. Earlier this week on Tuesday there was \nanother oversight hearing by the full Judiciary Committee, this time \npublicly, and the Department of Justice representative acknowledged\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nthe wrong standard had been applied, but says they have corrected it \nwith examples. We are waiting to see the specifics.\n  The impact of this is that there ought to be one umbrella under which \nthe analysis of all of the intelligence agencies occurs. The amendment \nwhich has been offered here, the provision of section 201, which the \npending amendment seeks to strike, has a laudable purpose. It is \nseeking that kind of coordination, but it simply does not require a \ndirector for a national office of combating terrorism, which would be a \nconfirmed position.\n  The language in the bill needs to be specified so the burden is on \nthose who oppose the coordination to come forward. I wrote to Governor \nRidge on August 1 referring to a meeting which had been held the \nprevious day. I think it appropriate to quote briefly from this letter. \nI was very pleased to hear the President's affirmative response \nyesterday to the proposal to have analysis from every intelligence \nagency--CIA, FBI, DIA, et cetera--under the umbrella of the Department \nof Homeland Security with the Secretary having the authority to direct \nthose intelligence agencies to supply his Department with the requisite \nintelligence data.\n  The key language of the responsibilities which I believe should be in \nthe bill, and I intend to offer an amendment if we cannot get this \nworked out by agreement is that the Directorate of Intelligence within \nthe Department of Homeland Security shall be responsible for the \nfollowing:\n\n       (1) On behalf of the secretary, subject to disapproval by \n     the President, directing the agencies described under \n     subsection (a)(1)(B) to provide intelligence information, \n     analyses of intelligence information and such other \n     intelligence-related information as the Directorate of \n     Intelligence deems necessary.\n\n  The thrust of this language would give the Secretary the authority to \ncommand all the analyses unless the President disapproves. However, the \nlanguage to have the President direct the Secretary to have this \noversight responsibility is unworkable because you cannot take it to \nthe President to ask for his authority on each occasion. However, if \nthere is strong reason to disallow the Secretary's authority in a \nspecific case, then it is subject to disapproval of the President. I do \nnot think that is necessary, but in order to avoid any controversy, the \nlanguage ought to be included in the statute.\n  Although I have already put this letter in the Record before, I think \nit is worth including at this stage of the debate, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Ridge,\n     Director of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: I was very pleased to hear the President's \n     affirmative response yesterday to the proposal to have \n     analysts from every intelligence agency (CIA, FBI, DIA, etc.) \n     under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security \n     with the Secretary having the authority to direct those \n     intelligence agencies to supply his Department with the \n     requisite intelligence data.\n       As I said in the meeting in the Cabinet Room yesterday, I \n     think that had all of the intelligence information known \n     prior to September 11th been under one umbrella, the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11th might have been \n     prevented.\n       Senator Thompson, as I understand him, did not disagree \n     with that ultimate approach except to express the view that \n     he thought that changes in the structure of the intelligence \n     community should await further studies. My own strongly held \n     view is that we have a unique opportunity to make the changes \n     in the intelligence community now because of the imminent \n     terrorist threats; and, if we don't act now, we will be back \n     to business as usual.\n       As you and I discussed in our meeting of July 29, 2002, \n     there have been many proposals to place the intelligence \n     agencies under one umbrella, including legislation which I \n     introduced in 1996 when I chaired the Intelligence Committee, \n     and the current proposals which have been made by General \n     Scowcroft.\n       I suggest that Section 132(b) of the bill reported by the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee be modified by adding at the \n     beginning a new paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       (b) Responsibilities.--The Directorate of Intelligence \n     shall be responsible for the following:\n       (1) On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by \n     the President, directing the agencies described under \n     subsection (a)(1)(B) to provide intelligence information, \n     analyses of intelligence information and such other \n     intelligence-related information as the Directorate of \n     Intelligence deems necessary.\n       I am sending copies of this letter to Senator Lieberman and \n     Senator Thompson so that we may all discuss these issues \n     further.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his remarks and his support of the Thompson amendment. I thank the \nSenator from Virginia for the same. I think both of these Senators, \nwithout dispute, would be recognized as people who have been students \nand have been leaders in the areas we are dealing with today. I think \ntheir support on this important amendment is crucial.\n  I was particularly taken with the comments of Senator Warner as he \nrelated his thoughts listening to the President a little while ago \nbefore the United Nations. I had the same thoughts. The President made \na magnificent speech. In part, it was a legal brief, where he outlined \nad seratim the various instances where Saddam Hussein had rejected the \nsanctions that had been placed on him by the United Nations, rejected \nthe resolutions that had been passed by the Security Council time and \ntime and time again, rejected inspectors, rejected sanctions, basically \nrendering what the United Nations and the international community as a \nwhole and specifically the Security Council, what they had done, \nrendering it a nullity.\n  I thought it was a very effective walk through history. There was no \nsecret information disclosed. It was a rendition of what we all should \nhave known. The people who were listening to him today were taken on \nthat walk down memory lane of all the things that have happened since \n1990 and the attempts that the United Nations have made, the attempts \nthe Security Council have made, all thwarted by this one country, as he \ncontinued to oppress his own people, as he continued to either attack \nor plan attacks for others, as he continued to develop his weapons of \nmass destruction, as he finally acknowledged, yes, he did have chemical \nand biological weapons after lying about it for all those years and our \ninspectors telling us he had a virtual Manhattan nuclear project the \nlast time we went in there. And now he has closed us out and we are \nwringing our hands over what we know and what we do not know.\n  That is our position. Internationally, the entire world is, because \nhe has put us in that position, once again, and deprived us of any \nknowledge of exactly what he is doing, although we know he has the \nintelligence, he has the scientists, he has the infrastructure, the \ncapability, the know-how, the desire, everything, except possibly \nenriched uranium with which to make a nuclear weapon. Unfortunately, \nthere is a lot of that in the world. We do not know whether he has it.\n  Part of it was an effective legal brief. Part of it was \ninspirational. It was an appeal to the United Nations for it not to \nbecome irrelevant in terms of world peace. If the U.N. and the Security \nCouncil allow a country such as this, a regime such as this, to thwart \nthe very purpose of the creation of the United Nations, then what \nauthority, what standing, what moral suasion is it going to have in the \nfuture when the next tinhorn dictator comes along and hunkers down and \ntakes a little bombing and goes on with his suppression of people and \nkilling of innocents and using weapons of mass destruction on his own \npeople as he prepares for the next attack. I thought it was very \neffective.\n  And what is the relationship between Saddam Hussein and terrorism? \nThe President pointed out one of the most dangerous circumstances we \ncan contemplate is having a regime such as his with the ability to \ntransfer his capabilities over to terrorists.\n  We know he has a long history of relationships with various terrorist \norganizations, including some with al-Qaida. Are we to assume he would \nnot ever use as a surrogate someone to do his dirty work? It is \nextremely relevant to the battle on terrorism. I think those who urge \nthat we totally clean up the battle on terrorism over here, because it \nis a distinct problem, before we address the situation in Iraq are \nmissing that point.\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n  Which brings us to the bill we are considering today. It is very \nrelevant. It is a homeland security bill. This is where all the \nchickens come home to roost in regard to our Nation's security.\n  What concerns me about this bill is that in more than one instance \nthere is an attempt to diminish the President's authority. This bill \nwould not give the President authority that other Presidents have had. \nMost all of the Members serving here today served under President \nClinton. It would take away authority President Clinton had with regard \nto national security. This bill would lessen--give less authority, in \nterms of the management of this monolithic new Department we are about \nto create, than the head of the FAA has to manage the FAA.\n  With regard to the subject matter that is addressed by the Thompson \namendment, we would not give the President the right to have his own \nadviser inside the White House as he deals with all these issues. That \nconcerns me. I do not think that is going in the right direction.\n  We are not going to do anything in this Congress to diminish \nCongress's traditional role. Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens have made \nit clear that they are not going to stand back and let the traditional \nappropriations authority of the Congress be set aside. Senator \nLieberman has made that clear. The bill reflects that position. I am \nsure we will be able to work out something along those lines that does \nnot diminish our authority in any way. We have the power of the purse. \nWe have the power of the purse.\n  This bill creates many positions, including the new Secretary, that \nwill be Senate confirmed. He will have to come before this body. So we \nare not diminishing the authority of the Congress. What we are doing is \nestablishing a brandnew, important Department that we are going to have \nto approach in a bit of a different way than we have approached other \nDepartments at other times because we have not been very successful \nwith other Departments at other times. This Government is rife with \nDepartments and governmental agencies that have waste and fraud and \nabuse, sending out checks for billions of dollars to people who are not \neven alive; losing large pieces of equipment, at least on the books, \nsuch as ships and things of that nature; having the GAO come before us \nyear after year after year, saying these agencies are not doing any \nbetter. They cannot pass an audit. Government as a whole cannot pass an \naudit. We do not know what assets and liabilities we have. We cannot \nkeep up with them. It is a mess.\n  We are pulling 22 of these agencies into a new Department. We cannot \napproach it the same old way. We have to have a 21st century paradigm \nin order to address a 21st century problem.\n  Most of the rules we are operating under now were created in the \n1950s when we had a paperwork Government. People came into Government \nat this position, worked for 20 years, and were promoted in lockstep in \nthese 15 steps, with 10 steps within each of the 15, totally unable to \naddress modern-day problems.\n  As the GAO tells us we cannot handle the information technology \nchallenge that faces our Government, private industry has been able to. \nWe have been trying to incorporate information technology capability in \nthe IRS for years. We have spent billions of dollars and still the \ncomputers will not talk to each other--and they are not the only ones. \nWe have human capital problems. We have financial management problems--\nyear after year.\n  So that is all the background for considering an amendment such as \nthis, which addresses the bill where it creates a new Office of \nCombating Terrorism.\n  We are suggesting the President ought to have a little flexibility, a \nlittle traditional flexibility to have, in the White House--not over at \nthe new Department but in the White House--a person he chooses to \ncoordinate not only what is going on in the new Department but the \nimportant national security, or homeland security, entities that are \nnot in the new Department. Coordination is needed.\n  We have that coordinated. The President established an Office of \nHomeland Security. The President established an Office of Combating \nTerrorism within the NSC. Those are already there. You say we need them \nSenate confirmed. NSC is not Senate confirmed. We have a Senate-\nconfirmed position we are creating in the new Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  This bill, as it is drafted now, mandates the development of a \nnational strategy. We have a national strategy. We have had it since \nJuly. I don't know whether the idea is to set the old one aside and \ncome up with a new one or submit the one the President has already put \nout again. This was a good idea back several months ago. Time has \npassed it by.\n  The suggestion is made that this new person inside the White House, \nconfirmed by the Senate over the President's objection, would have \nbudgetary authority that would allow this new person to decertify the \nhomeland security budget. The budget goes to him before it even goes to \nOMB. What kind of situation is that going to be? What if you were asked \nto take on the job of new Secretary of Homeland Security knowing that \nyour budget was going to go to some guy over in the White House and he \nhad to be satisfied before it even got to you? How would you like it \nover at the OMB, when we are going into a period of deficit, when \npeople, apparently in this Congress, still think we can have guns and \nbutter indefinitely, we don't have any problem spending helter-skelter, \nleft and right?\n  He has to balance all that. And he has a guy over in the White House \nwho has only one priority, homeland security. And as important as it \nis, it is not the only priority this Government has. But he has veto \npower over the Government.\n  There never has been a circumstance like this in the history of \nGovernment. There never has been a big Department, like the Department \nof Homeland Security, and what we are creating, with authority and \nresponsibility and jurisdiction over the issue at hand, homeland \nsecurity in this case, and a White House-confirmed position with \ndecertification budget authority all at the same time.\n  I think it would absolutely be havoc for any administration, Democrat \nor Republican. I think it would lessen accountability, not increase \naccountability. Goodness knows, we need increased accountability.\n  The President has said he is going to keep Governor Ridge. I don't \nknow whether the idea is we will give this new fellow an office down at \nthe other end of the hall or that the President is not being square \nwith us, that he will really get rid of Ridge or that he will give \nRidge this job. I don't know what the idea is. The President said he is \ngoing to keep up the office. He is entitled to have his own counsel, as \nPresidents traditionally have.\n  So I urge we not do that. I urge we maintain the status quo there; \nthat we not take another step to restrict the President, to restrict \neither his national security authority that Presidents traditionally \nhave, restrict the new Secretary's authority to manage the Department, \nin the new age and time and challenge that we face, and we not restrict \nthe President within his own office in terms of whom he wants to bring \nin and have confidential conversations with, who cannot be called up to \nthe Hill at any time.\n  I said early on in this discussion before these bills were presented \nthat ultimately it was clear Congress was going to have somebody's leg \nto chew on. Congress needed to have somebody who is accountable to come \nup here and testify. I didn't particularly welcome this back and forth \nas to who was going to talk and what office they would talk in and what \nother office they would not talk in. I don't think that would do any of \nus any good. I knew that ultimately somebody was going to have to come \nup here and be a spokesman and be accountable. We now have that. That \nis the new Secretary. That is the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  We don't need it with regard to the position in the White House. The \nPresident said he doesn't want it. I believe on these close questions, \nif indeed my colleagues believe it is a close question, that we ought \nto give the President the benefit of the doubt. He is now, without \nboast, the leader of the free world. As we are facing the challenge of \nterrorism and the challenge that is presented by Saddam Hussein, as \nevidenced by his speech today, the\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nears of the entire world were trained upon him. That is not anything to \ndo with him personally. That is the position of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  In times such as these, if you can compare any other time with this--\nespecially in times of war, especially in times of issues of war and \npeace--whoever is President of the United States is the leader of the \nfree world and is the leader in espousing those values that we hold \ndear, knowing as the entire world does that we are going to be on the \nfront lines of any enforcement action the world deems necessary for the \ncause of freedom and democracy.\n  That is not a hokie sentiment. That is not Democrat-Republican. That \nis just reality.\n  I hope as we consider these issues that my colleagues will give on \nbalance the call for a bit of flexibility, at least as much as we have \ngiven prior Presidents, and at least as much as we have given heads of \nthese other agencies when facing challenges that are much less than \nwhat we are facing today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Thompson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the Craig- \nDomenici amendment to improve the tragic health of our Nation's \nforests. Years of complete fire suppression has resulted in unnaturally \ndense forests. In many places out West where nature would have 50 trees \nper acre, there are 500 trees per acre, this tremendous build-up in \nhazardous fuels significantly increases fire danger and makes trees \nmore prone to insect infestations.\n  The facts are clear: Unnaturally dense forests result in unnaturally \nhot burning and fast moving fires. The Forest Service and other land \nmanagement agencies have known the facts for years but have been \nhamstrung, in large part due to shifting political winds.\n  And here is the dilemma: interest groups and agencies argue about \nwhat needs to be done while forests go up in flames, endangered species \nare destroyed, and human life and property are jeopardized.\n  The amendment that we are proposing does not point the finger at any \none group or agency. Rather, this amendment moves beyond the politics \nand focuses on results consistent with plans developed by the Western \nGovernors' own ``10-Year Comprehensive Strategy for a Collaborative \nApproach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the \nEnvironment.''\n  Where the agencies are unable to proceed with hazardous fuels \nreduction, this amendment directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and \nInterior to expedite responsible forest management projects in a \nbalanced way and is very similar to language previously passed by this \nbody to allow for fuel reduction in certain other western States.\n  This amendment looks at the facts. In this year alone, 62,924 fires \nhave scorched more than 6.3 million acres of land across this Nation. \nBut what about people, how has wildfire affected our communities?\n  Since April of this year in my State of Colorado, 12 communities, 141 \nsubdivisions totaling 81,068 people have been evacuated because of \nwildfire. When those Coloradans returned after being evacuated, they \nfound 384 homes burned to the ground and 624 other structures \ndestroyed.\n  Although property damage and widespread dislocation are devastating \non communities, the wildfire season of 2002 has proved even more \ntragic. Wildfires have claimed the lives of 10 firefighters in \nColorado, and 21 in the nation. Returning to a pile of ash instead of \nyour home is one thing, coming home without a father or sister is \nanother altogether.\n  Without responsible hazardous fuel reduction, this year's fire \nsituation is bound to repeat itself and I cannot allow this to happen. \nThis year's fires came close enough to my own front porch at one point, \nthat it was difficult for my wife and me to breathe. Given the drought \nconditions that the West is enduring, the situation on the 181 million \nacres that are currently classified as a Class 3 fire risk is not going \nto get any better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to reduce the threat \nunhealthy forests pose nationwide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, being obviously the first anniversary of \nthe horrific attacks against us on September 11 of last year, we \ncommemorated with very moving--and I thought unifying--purpose at \nevents here in the Capitol in Washington, at the Pentagon, in New York, \nand Pennsylvania--and really throughout America and so many places. Our \nattention was riveted again on what happened to us and how urgent it is \nto act to prevent that horror from ever happening again.\n  I will state again what I have said on the floor before. I am not one \nwho believes that another September 11 type of attack against America \nis inevitable. It is not inevitable if we are aggressive in searching \nout and destroying the remaining al-Qaida terrorists, if we are wise \nand strong in marshaling the unique capabilities we have in America to \nbetter organize our homeland defenses. Of course, that is what this \nbill is about.\n  I think the President's statement today at the United Nations is \nfurther testimony and further draws our attention to the urgency of the \nchallenges we face.\n  I want to say parenthetically that I thought the speech the President \ngave at the United Nations today was a powerful and convincing \nindictment of Saddam Hussein and the grave threat he poses--not just to \nthe United States and to his neighbors in a most critical region of the \nworld, but to the legitimacy and the authority of the United Nations in \nthe world community, a United Nations which Saddam has outrageously and \nconsistently defied and deceived for more than a decade.\n  I fully support the President's call to action by the United Nations. \nI hope the nations of the world will take a look at the record. I think \nmy friend from Tennessee said it was in some sense a lawyerly \nstatement. It really was an indictment of the 16 resolutions of the \nUnited Nations that Saddam Hussein has ignored, and he has defied and \nthumbed his nose at every one of them. How can the United Nations be \nthe institution we want it to be--bringing peace and resolving \nconflicts--if one rogue leader of one nation treats its orders and \nresolutions with such disrespect?\n  This is a moment of decision for the members of the United Nations. I \nhope they rise to the challenge that President Bush has quite correctly \nput before them today.\n  This does bring us back to where we are on this amendment and Senator \nThompson's motion to strike titles 2 and 3 of this amendment which is \nbefore the Senate and which was reported out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. These were authored largely by Senator Graham of \nFlorida, who has spoken on them. They are part of an attempt in this \nbill to deal not just with homeland security, but to deal with the \nproblem of terrorism that the President spoke about so eloquently and \nconvincingly today at the United Nations.\n  Homeland security is just one part of the battle against terrorism. \nWe obviously have other parts that are critically important as well--\ncertainly the Defense Department, certainly our intelligence community, \nthe State Department, the Treasury, and various foreign aid and public \ndiplomacy programs, and law enforcement agencies, a lot of which will \nnot in any sense come under the purview of this new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  That is why it was the wisdom of the committee--I believe it was \ncertainly the judgment of the committee--that in addition to creating \nthe Department of Homeland Security, we would guarantee the kind of \naggressive antiterrorism effort that the country needs now and in the \nyears ahead by creating in the White House an office to combat \nterrorism, to coordinate not just the Homeland Security Department but \nthe other agencies of our Government that are involved in the fight \nagainst terrorism.\n\n  It is my understanding that many have spoken in support of Senator \nThompson's amendment to strike these sections. Perhaps some at the \nWhite House agree that there will be an office in the White House, but \nthey object to the confirmation requirement in our proposal that the \ndirector of that office be confirmed by the Senate. And there was also \nobjection to the budget certification authority that we give the \ndirector of the office.\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  Senator Graham is a practical and realistic man on matters of this \nkind. We know there is concern in the Senate about the requirement of \nconfirmation of the director of this office and the budget \ncertification authority. We are consulting with our colleagues to see \nif they will support a proposal that would modify these titles by \nsimply removing the Senate's authority to confirm and the budget \nauthority given to the director and leave an office of \ncounterterrorism. This office would be appointed by the President \nwithout confirmation by the Senate, but with a guarantee that the \nbroader counterterrorism war that we will be fighting for years will \nhave in the White House, close to the President, an adviser for whom \nthat is his or her only responsibility.\n  We think this proposal is a way that Congress, respecting the \nPresident and his authority--this President and Presidents to follow--\ncan guarantee as much as we can by the law that is in a quieter time \nfurther from the pain and shock of September 11, 2001; that America \nwill not fall into a slumber and allow itself to be vulnerable once \nagain as we were a year ago yesterday to terrorism's awful sword.\n  I report that to my colleagues. I hope members of both parties and \nour friends at the White House will consider that as a good-faith \npossibility and see whether we can build a consensus to go forward on \nit.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nconsumed by the quorum calls be taken equally from both sides on the \ntime remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and, again, suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also yield myself 10 minutes on the side \nof Senator Lieberman in opposition to the Thompson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, President Bush could not have made a \nbetter choice for Director of the White House Office on Homeland \nSecurity than Gov. Tom Ridge. We served together in the House of \nRepresentatives. We are personal friends. And I hold him in the highest \nregard. He is clearly the right person for this extremely difficult \ntask and assignment and has done a great job under trying circumstances \nand in a very brief period of time.\n  However, I believe we must keep title II in the bill, which \nestablishes a National Office for Combating Terrorism in the White \nHouse, with a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed Director, not \nas any rebuke to the President or Governor Ridge, but to give Governor \nRidge the tools he needs to be even more effective.\n  I cosponsored Senator Graham's bill, S. 1449, to establish this \noffice and supported its inclusion in Senator Lieberman's original bill \nto establish a Department of Homeland Security, which I also \ncosponsored.\n  I refer my colleagues to testimony given by Retired General Barry \nMcCaffrey, before the Governmental Affairs Committee, on October 12 of \nlast year. He spoke about organizing our Government to protect America. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       Our government does best when it establishes institutions \n     for the long haul that are based on rationality, not \n     personality. . . . The terms of this office--how its \n     leadership is appointed, where its monies come from, what \n     powers it wields, who it is accountable to--must have the \n     permanence of law. . . . Any Cabinet member, current or \n     former, will tell you how important it is to have the \n     Commander-in-Chief in your corner. However, when push comes \n     to shove, it is even more important to have the law on your \n     side.\n\n  General McCaffrey's experience as our antidrug czar at the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy brought him to his strong conclusion that \nthe White House Office on Homeland Security must have its own budget \nand the position must be confirmed by the Senate. Without those \ningredients, the Director would have neither the clout to fight \nWashington's bureaucracy nor the accountability before Congress to do \nhis job effectively.\n  General McCaffrey's testimony was borne out by our experience here in \nCongress when numerous committees asked Governor Ridge to testify about \nhomeland security. He was unable to because he said: I am a staffer of \nthe President. I am not appointed by the Senate.\n  Governor Ridge was finally allowed to testify by the White House but \nonly after the President decided he wanted to create this new \nDepartment.\n  Title III, which the Thompson amendment would strike, gives the job \nof developing a national strategy to combat terrorism and a \ncomprehensive antiterrorism budget to the National Office for Combating \nTerrorism.\n  Having clout in the budget process is essential. President Bush says \nCabinet Secretaries know that Governor Ridge has his trust and must put \naside turf wars. But what we are setting up here are institutional \nstructures.\n  Government officials come and go. Not all will have the close \npersonal relationship that Governor Ridge enjoys with President Bush. \nThe President certainly has the right to structure his staff and his \nadvisors as he pleases, but we have the responsibility in Congress to \npass legislation to establish structures of Government which will \nendure.\n  Let me say this as a parenthetical observation: One of the things I \nadded to this bill--and in which I have particular pride--is an effort \nto try to establish some sort of architecture for computers and \ninformation technology in this new Department. I could go on for some \ntime about the dismal state of computers at the premier law enforcement \nagency of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is \na fact, if you look at the various agencies we will count on to protect \nAmerica, that in terms of computer capability, it is almost as if you \nwere traveling across the world and you picked countries that were \ncomputer illiterate and asked them to communicate with those that were \nthe most sophisticated. That is what we have in the Federal Government.\n  What I tried to do with this bill is to establish a standard for \ncoordinating computer architecture, a Manhattan project. I put it in \nthe Office of Management and Budget, frankly, because I couldn't assign \nit to a higher level and get it passed by committee. That is sad. But \nit is a fact. What I believe we are trying to establish in this bill is \nto make sure that within the White House there will be someone always \nclose to the President who is willing to rip through the bureaucracy \nand to establish the standards and procedures to make sure that America \nis safe. Unless you have someone at that high level close enough to the \nPresident to get it done, someone who is going to deal with it, you \nwill run into a problem. Saying in this situation that we are going to \nhave in a Department of Homeland Security someone who is going to be \nsubjected to Senate confirmation, separate budget authority, is to give \nthem enhanced authority as well.\n  Departments and agencies with major responsibilities for homeland \nsecurity, including the Department of Defense, State, and Treasury, the \nFBI, the entire intelligence community, among many others, are properly \nnot included in the new Department. There will be a critical job to do \nto develop a national strategy for computers, for information \ntechnology and beyond, and coordinate this strategy so that the \nagencies of this new Department can effectively combat the threat of \nterrorism against the United States.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support the language put in \nthis bill by Senator Lieberman after deliberation in committee and \noppose the Thompson amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment, \nwhich would strike titles II and III from this legislation.\n  These two titles together will provide, within the community \nconcerned about securing the homeland, the direction and capacity to \ndevelop a comprehensive strategic plan of how to accomplish that very \ndifficult objective, and then to place within the White House an \nofficer who is responsible for the specific function of combating \nterrorism. The subfunctions of that office will be to coordinate the \nvariety of agencies that will have some responsibility for implementing \nthe strategic plan.\n  Some have thought that no office such as this is necessary because we \nare about to bring a whole Department of Homeland Security. We have a \nDepartment of Defense, but we also have within the White House a \nnational security adviser whose job is to coordinate national security \nissues. The reason is because, as broad as the Defense Department is, \nit does not contain all of the activities of the Federal Government \nthat relate to national security. It does not include the State \nDepartment, which has our diplomatic and foreign relations function. It \ndoes not include the Department of Treasury, which has some important \nnational security responsibilities as it relates to economic issues. It \ndoes not include the Department of Energy, where most of our nuclear \ndevelopment responsibility is placed.\n  So we have an agency in the White House to bring all those \nDepartments that have some national security function behind a common \nstrategy. This is exactly the purpose of this office within the White \nHouse, and that would be deleted if this amendment were to be adopted. \nThere will be no entity that has statutory status that will be \nresponsible, or capable, of trying to bring all of these agencies \ntogether. That is the most fundamental reason.\n  But there is another reason why I think this office is very \nimportant. In my judgment, the threats the United States will be facing \nin our homeland and abroad are likely to escalate over the next period \nof time. No. 2, it is exactly during this period of time that this new \nDepartment of Homeland Security is going to be trying to integrate \nalmost two dozen agencies that have had their homes elsewhere--in some \ncases, for a century or more.\n  It is at this very time that there is likely--I suggest not likely, \nbut there almost certainly will be considerable resistance to achieving \nthe cohesion that is going to be necessary to accomplish this \nobjective. I suggest that it will not be long before we have a debate \non the floor about why did a certain misstep occur or why was a gap \nallowed to go unfilled, as we try to put together a structure to \nprotect our homeland.\n  I suggest that an answer to those questions is going to be that there \nwas so much support for the status quo and resistance to the sort of \nchange that could not be overcome sufficiently and in time to avoid an \nunnecessary vulnerability. That is my prediction. I don't believe there \nis any suggestion that will give absolute certainty that my prediction \nwill prove to be false. But I believe that having this office within \nthe White House, where there is somebody who wakes up every morning \nthinking about fighting terrorism, and who is in an office within \nwalking distance of the President of the United States, will give us a \ngreater opportunity to achieve the speedy, expeditious, and effective \ncoordination activities that will be necessary to protect our homeland.\n\n  This office has some considerable powers. For instance, it has the \npower to certify budgets. Why does it have that power? Because I can \ntell you that there is going to be a tendency of an agency that has \nbeen doing a set of functions for a long time, and now they suddenly \nhave a homeland security function, and when that new function is \nbattling inside the agency with all of those that have had a long \nhistory and a constituency and a political support base, any new \nfunction is not likely to do very well. We learned that lesson in the \nwar against drugs. The very fact that Congress made this a priority \ndidn't result in it being a priority in the agencies that had their \noperational responsibility. I suggest the same thing is likely to occur \nhere.\n  Unless you have somebody to tell that agency that unless you put an \nadditional $15 million into carrying out your part of the strategic \nplan of homeland security, we are going to decertify that part of your \nbudget--that is the kind of clout it is going to take--if we don't feel \nthat this issue is worthy of giving this office that kind of \nresponsibility, then I am afraid we are going to be coconspirators in a \nplot which is going to have a bad conclusion.\n  So I urge that if, as I anticipate, there will be a motion to table \nthe Thompson amendment, that motion be supported so we can retain this \nimportant position within the White House, recognizing that its \nultimate power is going to come from the President himself, but it will \ngive the President, who wants to have the most effective homeland \nsecurity, an agency that we in Congress have established and, \ntherefore, have invested our confidence in, which he appoints, and \nwhich will have the capability to give us the best hope that we can \naccomplish our objective of defending the homeland against terror.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, for his hard work on this part of our bill. It is \nwork that really goes back to last fall. I think he is absolutely \nright. I appreciate his accommodation to the fact that there may be \nMembers of the Senate who support the basic idea of an office in the \nWhite House to coordinate our antiterrorism efforts in various agencies \nbut are concerned about the power the current language gives the Senate \nto confirm the nominee to that position. Therefore, we will offer a \nmotion to table at the time the vote on Senator Thompson's motion to \nstrike comes up, with the intention of offering a second-degree \namendment to give Members the opportunity to vote on the concept of an \noffice of counterterrorism in the White House, to coordinate our \nantiterrorism efforts, without the necessity for Senate confirmation, \nwhich the President, we know, opposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the \nremainder of our time. It is imperative that we have a vote in 2 \nminutes. The Senator from Utah wanted a moment. From looking at the \nclock, we have 2 minutes until 2 o'clock; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. How much time does each side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 12 \\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Connecticut has 28 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator from Connecticut has how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 28 seconds.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Thompson's \namendment to strike the portions of Senator Lieberman's substitute \namendment that would create a National Office for Combating Terrorism \nin the White House. Senator Lieberman's substitute would create this \nOffice in the White House in addition to creating the Department of \nHomeland Security. I initially question the wisdom of creating two \nseparate offices with identical goals and overlapping jurisdiction, \nwhen the entire point of creating a single Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to oversee and coordinate the efforts of many different \nagencies in this immensely important area. But I have another, more \npressing concern: encouraging good decision-making.\n  Senator Lieberman's bill would make the heads of both the National \nOffice for Combating Terrorism and the Secretary of Homeland Security \nsubject to confirmation by the Senate and congressional oversight \nhearings. So far as the office in the White House is concerned, I \ndisagree with such an\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\ninvasive approach. We need to be mindful of the important role that \nconfidential communications play in the deliberative process for all \nimportant decisions--including the decisions that we as lawmakers make \nafter careful and candid discussions with our staff. Just as we would \nbe wary of those who would seek to intrude into these communications, \nso too should we be reluctant to interfere with the President's \ndeliberative process and the frank communications he has with his \nadvisers in the White House on critically sensitive issues such as our \nnation's security. Of course, I have no objection that the head of the \nnew Department of Homeland Security be Senate-confirmed, but it simply \ndoes not follow that such an approach should be extended to the \nPresident's own advisor on these issues.\n  As responsible lawmakers, we must recognize that we simply do not \nhave the same license to specify the duties of the President's senior \nadvisers in the White House as we do to specify the duties of agency \nofficers and staff members who exercise legislative duties. We should \ntake our cue in this area from the National Security Act of 1947, which \nestablished the National Security Council. As we all know, the \nPresident may appoint very senior advisors to the NSC--like Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice--who are not subject to confirmation by the Senate. \nThat fact certainly does not detract from Dr. Rice's stature, but in \nfact enhances it. Anyone who deals with Dr. Rice knows that she has the \nbacking of the President--precisely because she has his confidence and \nis beholden to no one else.\n  There certainly must be an advisor within the White House who advises \nthe President on matters that pertain directly to our homeland \nsecurity, as the President has recognized. But there is absolutely no \nreason why that office should be made--and micro-managed--by Congress. \nWhy does both the head of the Department of Homeland Security and the \nPresident's Homeland Security Advisor need to be confirmed by the \nSenate? There is no doubt that Homeland Security is of paramount \nimportance, but so is national security in general. And does this mean \nwe are going to require that Dr. Rice be Senate confirmed? How about \nKarl Rove and Andy Card? A step in this direction is simply misguided \nand unwise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back our time if \nthe Senator is.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am. I yield back our time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield now to the Senator from Florida, my cosponsor \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier today and, to a greater extent, at \nthe end of last week, we had a debate on the issue of the establishment \nwithin the White House of an office to combat terrorism.\n  The rationale for that office is several-fold. One, not all of the \nagencies that will have responsibility for protecting the homeland \nagainst terrorism are in the Department of Homeland Security. There are \na number of important functions--all of the intelligence agencies, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Justice, to mention three, \nwhich clearly have a significant role in protecting the homeland--which \nare not within the Department of Homeland Security. So that creates the \nneed for someone who is in a position of responsibility to coordinate \ntheir activities in order to achieve a cohesive, comprehensive plan to \nprotect the people of the United States.\n  That also raises a second necessity, which is that there be a \nconsistent strategic plan of action around which all of these agencies \nwill organize their antiterrorism activities. That is title III of the \nlegislation that has been introduced by our colleague from \nConnecticut--the requirement that there be such a comprehensive \nstrategic vision of how we are going to protect this very open and free \nsociety of America against terrorist attacks.\n  A third reason why I think this office is important is because we \nknow the resistance that is going to occur to the changes that we are \nnow suggesting. We are asking agencies which, in some cases, are a \nhundred years or more old to change those old habits, to reprioritize, \nto put at the top of their list defending the homeland against \nterrorists. There will be, both within the agencies and among the \nagencies, some conflicts, inevitably. We need someone who has the \nvoice, who has the ear, who has the appointment of the President of the \nUnited States to be able to moderate and resolve those conflicts, and \nto do so in a clear and expeditious manner so we do not exacerbate \nunnecessarily the vulnerability of the American people while agencies \nare engaged in bureaucratic catfights.\n\n  A final reason why I think this is important is that we need someone \nto perform a function that, frankly, has not been adequately performed \nin the last decade, vis-a-vis our intelligence agency. That function is \nto constantly challenge the agencies that have homeland security \nresponsibility as to their relevance.\n  There is a tendency for an agency that has been doing its business in \na particular manner for a long time to be resistant to taking on new \nhabits--maybe it is the governmental equivalent that it is hard to \nteach old dogs new tricks, that it is hard to teach old bureaucracies \nnew patterns of activity. I use the intelligence community as an \nexample of that truth. They grew up, beginning with the establishment \nin 1947, as agencies which had as their role of being to develop and \nanalyze information relative to the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact \nallies.\n  It has been largely since the end of the cold war that the \nintelligence community has broadened its focus on the rest of the \nworld, where the United States has important interests that it wishes \nto know more about and to have a greater analytical capability to \ndecide what we ought to do about it. The intelligence community, in my \njudgment, was slow to make that transition. Part of the reason is that \nthey were not produced adequately. They were not asked with sufficient \nfrequency and aggressiveness: Are you relevant to the kinds of \nchallenges that you face today?\n  I believe that is part of the responsibility of Congress, part of our \noversight. It also will be a responsibility of this new office within \nthe office of the President to be asking these agencies that have \nhomeland security responsibilities: Are you relevant to the kinds of \nchallenges that we have facing our Nation today? So those are the \nessential rationales.\n  Now, the concern that was expressed last week was not that we were \ngoing to have such an office. In fact, at one point, the Senator from \nTennessee and I, I thought, had a common agreement that there was the \nneed for an entity in the White House that could perform those \nfunctions. The question, then, became calibrating just how much \ninfluence and power should that Department have.\n  I personally was, and continue to be, an advocate for a strong, very \nrobust office of counterterrorism in the White House because I think \nthe challenges of inertia and resistance to change are going to be \nsignificant, and there will have to be an effective, even more \nassertive force in the other direction to get the kinds of changes the \nAmerican people expect our Federal Government to make in order to give \nthe priority that we expect to protect the homeland against terrorists.\n  But it is clear from the vote that we have just taken that the \nmajority of the Members of the Senate feel that goes a little too far. \nSo what Senator Lieberman and I have been doing over the past several \ndays is trying to think through what could be essentially jettisoned \nfrom this legislation as it relates to the office within the White \nHouse that would still maintain the essential credibility of the office \nto perform its function but would make it acceptable to a majority of \nour colleagues.\n  The two issues that we have identified for such discharge are, first, \nthe provision that the Presidential appointee to the office of \nantiterrorism be subject to Senate confirmation, and, second, the \nprovision that gave this office the capacity to decertify budgets of \nthe agencies which had some homeland security responsibility if it were \ndetermined that they were not allocating sufficient funds to that \nfunction within the agency, which was that agency's part of the \ncomprehensive plan to fight terrorism in the homeland.\n  I offered this amendment with my colleague, Senator Lieberman, with \nsome anguish because I think those two levels of accountability and \ncapability are important to assure us that we can achieve what we must \nachieve in defending the homeland. But in order to be able to save the \nlarger concept of such an office in the White House, which now will be \nalmost a parallel to the office that is held by Dr. Condoleezza Rice, \nas the National Security Adviser--that office is a statutory office, \nappointed by the President, created by Congress, but not subject to \nconfirmation. That will be this office. It will be an office created by \nstatute by the Congress, so it will have the legitimacy of law. The \nhead of the office will be appointed by the President and not subject \nto Senate confirmation. That is the model we will have if this \namendment is adopted.\n\n  What happens if we do not adopt this amendment and then proceed to \nadopt the Thompson amendment which will delete both title II and title \nIII? There will be no congressional directive that it is important to \nhave an agency to coordinate the multiple Departments of the Federal \nGovernment with homeland security responsibility. In fact, it could be \ninterpreted as a congressional statement that we affirmatively do not \nwant there to be a place in the Federal Government that can bring these \nDepartments together; that, for some reason, the experience we learned \nsince 1947 as to the importance of a National Security Adviser who can \nperform that function for national security is not relevant to the kind \nof challenges we are now going to face in terms of domestic security.\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n  Second, with the elimination of title III, we will have no \ncongressional directive to establish a strategic plan for homeland \nsecurity and to have the strength of Congress in support of that plan. \nI think it is worth giving up the confirmation and the budget \ncertification if we can retain the fundamental principles of the \nimportance of an agency that can achieve collaboration, can organize \nbehind a strategic plan, will have the strength that comes from \ncongressional creation and Presidential appointment, and will be able \nto move us as rapidly as possible into the best posture to defend our \nhomeland and be a constant product to see that these agencies are \ncognizant of the changes that will inevitably be occurring in the \nenvironmental threat in which they will be operating and that they are \nprepared to constantly be reinventing themselves, adapting themselves \nto effectively respond to the challenges that will be different 10 \nyears from now than they are today, and much different 30 years from \nnow than they are today.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment which I consider a compromise \noffered in good faith that meets the primary concerns that were \nexpressed in this Chamber last week and again today but allows us to \nmove forward with a totality of national policies, including Department \nof Homeland Security, the responsibilities that will continue to be \nvested in other agencies outside of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and an entity within the White House with the ear and the \nconfidence of the President capable of seeing that the whole of these \nwork together in a cohesive team for the defense and protection of the \npeople of America.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment and then the defeat of the \nunderlying amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 2928 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leaders for \nallowing me this time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, for not only his eloquent statement and his spirit \nof accommodation that leads him to offer this second-degree amendment, \nbut also for the work he has put into this idea.\n  It is an excellent idea--I have said this before and I will say it \nagain briefly--the pending amendment, which is to say the underlying \namendment that came out of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \nis our best effort to respond to the terrible events of September 11 \nand to protect the American people from anything like that ever \nhappening again. That is done, first, with the creation of a Department \nof Homeland Security, and second, with, in the White House, this \nNational Office for Combating Terrorism--one focused on homeland \ndefenses and the other serving as an adviser to the President, \ncoordinating all our antiterrorism activity which goes well beyond \nhomeland security to defense, law enforcement, foreign policy, foreign \naid, economic policy, et cetera.\n  Senator Graham has worked hard on this issue, and I think presented a \nvery good proposal. It was, as the last vote indicates, not the will of \nthe Senate to accept it in its current form. Many of our colleagues \nindicated to Senator Graham and me that they might be able to support \nthis office if there were no Senate confirmation. Senator Graham has \nagreed by this amendment to remove that requirement.\n  What would be left then would be quite similar to what the National \nSecurity Adviser has been doing for some period of time since that \nstatute was created, a statute which coordinates advice to the \nPresident in a particular subject area. In this case, that subject area \nis terrorism, which according to most experts outside and inside the \nCongress, will likely be the dominant threat to our security in the \nnext period of our history.\n  So the best proposal, which we had hoped would be accepted, would be \nto provide for Senate confirmation. The Senate has expressed its will \nthere, and I think Senator Graham has now offered the next best idea. I \nam privileged to be a cosponsor of this amendment with him, and I do so \nwith some sincerity, particularly because of the other section of this \nlegislation which does create a Secretary of Homeland Security who, of \ncourse, is subject to Senate confirmation and is accountable to the \nSenate.\n  So the concerns I had, the Senator had, and so many others had about \nthe previous Office of Homeland Security being occupied by an \nindividual not subject to Senate confirmation, and therefore not \naccountable to the Congress, has now been overcome with the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security; that no matter what its shape, \nwhich I think we all agree will be created by the end of this session, \nnow allows us to take a step forward, not as large as the committee \nproposal would have taken but nonetheless a significant step forward in \ncreating the office and thereby giving this President and future \nPresidents one individual within the White House whose direct function \nis to coordinate the entire antiterrorism effort of the United States \nof America.\n  I support the amendment before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am sorry I have not been in a position to \nbe following the debate. Without losing my right to the floor, Mr. \nPresident, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Lieberman \nsecond-degree amendment to the Thompson first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. When was this second-degree amendment introduced?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Within the last 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have not had an opportunity to study this amendment. I \ndid hear, though, the distinguished manager of the bill say something \nto the effect that this amendment would eliminate the requirement for \nSenate confirmation of the--is it the Director of Homeland Security?\n  I ask that I retain the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from West Virginia, this \namendment, which is suggested by Senator Graham, who was the originator \nand implementer of the idea of a separate White House office on \nantiterrorism, would leave the Secretary of Homeland Security \nunchanged.\n  The Secretary would be nominated by the President and confirmed by \nand accountable to the Senate, and the new office on antiterrorism that \nwould be created in the White House in our original proposal was \nsubject to Senate confirmation, as well. We heard from many colleagues, \nparticularly on our side of the aisle, who thought that since we were \ncreating a Department of Homeland Security with a confirmable \nSecretary, it was a mistake to require confirmation of an office in the \nWhite House. Senator Graham has responded to that and, as a result, \noffered this second-degree amendment to create the Director, who would \nbe appointed by the President, without confirmation by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill. I strongly disagree with those who believe the Director within \nthe White House need not be confirmed. I am very opposed to that idea. \nI am ready to speak at some length on this. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. While I am speaking, I hope my staff will bring \nsome of the materials I have prepared to use. I am not going to go \nalong with an immediate vote on this, I can tell Senators that. I am \nsorry I had to get to the floor ahead of Mr. Thompson--I saw him \nstanding--but I was concerned. I will yield to the Senator if he has an \namendment to beat this amendment, but I am not yielding the floor now.\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And I would not try to take it, even if I thought I \ncould.\n  I respond to my friend from West Virginia by saying, I was simply \ngoing to address the issue very briefly and ask for the yeas and nays, \nfrankly, on the second-degree amendment.\n  I might add, I think the Senator is correct in the way he described \nit, but we had three basic concerns. One had to do with the Senate \nconfirmation. The other one had to do with the fact that it put this \nperson in a position of being a strategy maker, a statutory strategy \nmaker, when we already have a national strategy.\n  I have no objection to reporting to Congress periodically, but being \nin on the front end of that, I think that horse has already left the \nbarn.\n  Mr. BYRD. When?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In July.\n  Mr. BYRD. How?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. When the President presented the national strategy.\n  Thirdly, the new Director is still a pretty big player as far as \nbudget authority is concerned.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Those were three things we had concern about, and now \nit is down to two. I was going to make those points, move to table, and \nask for the yeas and nays. That was my intention.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have been saying to my Senate colleagues that we had \nbetter take some time and look at what we are doing. What was about to \nhappen, in my judgment, would have borne out my concerns and my \nwarnings. An amendment has been offered by the distinguished manager of \nthe bill. He certainly has far more expertise with respect to this bill \nthan I have. He has spent days, nights, and weeks, I would say, on it. \nSo in taking the floor at this time, as far as I am concerned, it is a \nlabor of love. I am not on the committee, but this is a good example. \nSenators--at least one Senator--did not know what we were doing. An \namendment was called up, I understand, 15 minutes ago. I do not think I \nhave inaccurately stated what Senator Thompson had indicated with \nreference to when this amendment was called up. We will say within the \nlast half hour. I suppose that is accurate.\n  The amendment comes from my side of the aisle. Normally, I might not \npay quite that much attention to it, but I have spent a lot of time on \nthe House bill and on the Lieberman substitute, and I have been very \nconcerned that Senators really are not paying attention. That is my \nobservation. I may be very wrong in that. I am sure the Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who are members of the Lieberman committee know \nwhat is going on.\n  But I don't know about the rest of us.\n  Here we have an amendment before the Senate, as I understand it, that \nwould eliminate the requisite confirmation by the Senate of the \nHomeland Security Director, the individual who is in the White House, \noccupying a place which is now occupied by Mr. Ridge. It would seem to \nme we ought to require confirmation of that person.\n  I heard Mr. Lieberman say that it is somewhat similar to the National \nSecurity Director, Condoleeza Rice. She does not require confirmation. \nWe have a State Department, Secretary of State and the Secretary of \nDefense we can call up at any time and find out what we want to know \nwith respect to defense and international security matters. I made that \nsame argument with respect to Condoleeza Rice back in the days when \nSenator Stevens and I were trying hard to get the President to send Mr. \nRidge before the Senate Appropriations Committee to answer questions \nwith respect to the appropriations budget. There were those who said \nDr. Rice does not have to come before the Congress and answer \nquestions, and I said we can get the Secretary of Defense or Secretary \nof State. That is quite true.\n  However, Mr. President, the Homeland Security Department is going to \nbe in a far different position than Dr. Rice is in. The Director of \nHomeland Security will be the person who knows all the answers with \nrespect to homeland security. That persons's powers will be far broader \nin many ways than Dr. Rice and her powers.\n  The first Secretary of State was appointed in the very early days of \nthe Republic. The same was true with the Secretary of War and the \nSecretary of the Treasury. We have something before the Senate that is \nnew, a situation that has never prevailed in this country, where it is \nattacked from within by terrorists and where the President has used an \nExecutive order to create a homeland security agency. I don't think \nmuch of this Executive order, as a matter of fact. I am afraid we are \nseeing too many of them, too often. The position that Governor Ridge \nhas now held was created by an Executive order. This is not just a \nlittle clerk down there in the bowels of the White House working. This \nis not just an ordinary adviser. This is a new type of war. This is a \nnew type of agency, a new kind of department.\n  Yes, we need it. I have been in favor of creating a Department of \nHomeland Security. But having read the administration's proposal with \nrespect to the creation of the Department, and having read the House \nbill, H.R. 5005, in regard to the creation of the Department, I have \nbeen more and more constrained to believe that we have a new ``animal'' \nin this Department of Homeland Security. It is not like the Department \nof Energy. It is not like the Department of Interior or the Department \nof Transportation. It is not like most of the Departments that have \nbeen with this Government for a long time, several of which have been \ncreated while I have been a Member of Congress.\n  This is an entirely different breed of Department. This is a \nDepartment that is going to encompass many issues that are of interest \nto several of the Departments, the Secretaries of which were not even \naware of when the President announced his intention to create a \nhomeland security agency, and an agency answerable to him. Many of the \nSecretaries who are in the Departments that were to be ultimately \ninvolved were not aware of this until the day the President announced \nit, I am told, or at least I read that in the newspaper. So this is a \nnew animal.\n\n  If all Senators would read the House bill, they would get a \nreflection of the administration's wishes with respect to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--not entirely. I believe the House bill \nis in some respects better than the administration's proposal, but the \nbill by Mr. Lieberman's committee, as reported out of his committee, is \nbetter than the House bill.\n  However, we have had too much of this lately: An administration that \nwants a program run out of the White House. And now the administration \ndoes not want this position confirmed. Let me restate that. The \nadministration does not want the Director to be confirmable by the \nSenate. That alone makes me very suspicious. We have an administration \nthat operates a great deal in secret, wants to operate even further in \nsecret, wants to be more secretive.\n  It was very secretive about the so-called shadow government. I didn't \nknow anything about shadow government until I read about it in the \nnewspaper. The administration tried to claim that I had been told what \nthat was. The administration was wrong 100 percent. I had never been \ntold. Of course, after this appeared in the newspapers, the \nadministration was willing to try to come up and explain what this is \nabout. And we have seen this whole Executive order with respect to a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the way in which that suddenly emerged \nfrom the dark mists of secrecy, we have seen the same path.\n  We have an administration that looks upon the Congress of the United \nStates as a subordinate body. I am sure some of the administration \nofficials look upon Congress with utter contempt. They don't want \nCongress in this position. The Senate, of course, is one-half of the \nCongress, being one of two branches. I don't want that. And I am not \ngoing to knuckle under to what they want. This Senator is not--now, \ntomorrow, or the day after tomorrow in this respect.\n\n  I may be overridden. The Senate, I said myself, is more than the 100 \nhearts, and the Senate will eventually work its will on this, I \nsuppose. But it is not going to do so in the next 15 minutes. This is a \nposition that ought to be confirmed. It doesn't make any difference \nwhat President Bush wants or what he doesn't want. The Congress is an \nequal branch.\n  This Congress is unlike, perhaps, the State Legislature of West \nVirginia. The State Legislature of West Virginia may\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nfeel it has to go along with its Governor. I have been in the State \nLegislature of West Virginia. I know a little about how legislatures \nwork and how Governors operate at the State level. They generally are \nvery concerned about the State constitution, what it allows with \nrespect to the budgets and so on, the State budgets. I have seen some \nother Governors come to Washington as President and they think that, \nwell, they did it this way in the government of Georgia or they did it \nthis way in the State of California or they do it this way in the State \nof Texas. Well, things here are not done as they are done at the State \nlevel in West Virginia.\n  Why should we bend to the administration's opposition to this point? \nWhy shouldn't this individual be confirmed? It is not enough to say: \nWell, the National Security Adviser doesn't require confirmation.\n  It is not enough to say that. That does not win the jury, I would \nhope, in regard to a Homeland Security Director. Just because Dr. Rice \nisn't required to be confirmed is no good reason why the Director of \nHomeland Security--be it Mr. Ridge, eventually, or John Doe--there is \nno good argument as to why that person should not be confirmed.\n  Are we going to sheath our sword and leave the field on that flimsy \nargument: Well, Dr. Rice is not confirmed so I see no harm in not \nhaving the Director of Homeland Security confirmed.\n  It is an entirely different argument. It is as different as day and \nnight. That is no argument. Why should I say I take my seat now and let \nthis vote occur in the next 15 minutes--or the next 30? That is no \nargument. Who is here to hear the argument? There may be a good many \nSenators in their offices listening to it. That is how I kind of caught \non to it.\n  I am prepared to speak for several hours, if I can get the materials \nI want that I have gone over during the recess. I don't know how other \nSenators spent their time. I am sure they were very busy during the \nrecess, but I spent most of the time during the recess studying the \nHouse bill and the Lieberman substitute. I had objected, as Senators \nwill recall, to going to the bill before the recess. I had objected to \ntaking up any substitute before the recess. I felt that it was a matter \nworthy of considerable time and debate.\n  I was here when we created the Department of Energy. I was here when \nwe created the Department--today they call it Health and Welfare or \nsomething like that. Abe Ribicoff was the Secretary of that Department. \nHe later came here as a U.S. Senator. I was here when the Department of \nVeterans Affairs was created. Thank God I am here now when we are \ndiscussing the creation of this Department. This is a far different \nkettle of fish.\n  Why should this Senate kowtow to any President, whether it be \nDemocrat or Republican? If former President Clinton were in the White \nHouse today, I would take the very same position. It is not because we \nhave a Republican in the White House. It is because we have an \nadministration that is intent on being secretive, has only a sneer, as \nit were--at least some of the people down there--for the Congress of \nthe United States. It looks upon the Congress with contempt.\n\n  Some of the people in the administration don't want to live by the \n``rules'' that have governed for many years. I use the word ``rules'' \nbecause I am remembering, in one case, one of the Cabinet officers \nusing that word. We are tied down by rules.\n  The administration people read ``Gulliver's Travels.'' It must have \nbeen required reading because they continue to talk about the \nLilliputians. That is the attitude toward the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  I do not want to give any administration too much power. I want any \nPresident to have whatever power he needs to deal with the protection \nof this country, homeland security. But I do not want to give any \nPresident power that he does not need but wants, and so I am a little \nbit aghast at the willingness of some of our people on my own side to \njust bow down and scrape and say: Well, no, that's not too important. \nWe don't confirm Dr. Rice. We didn't confirm her predecessor. We don't \nconfirm the security advisers. Therefore I see no reason why we need to \nconfirm the Director of Homeland Security.\n  I do. There is a great deal of difference. And, also, I haven't had \nan opportunity to read this amendment. I had an opportunity to talk \nwith Senator Lieberman, perhaps for 2 minutes here, and with Mr. \nThompson for less than that. I haven't read this amendment, but I have \nheard enough about it to oppose it--to oppose Mr. Lieberman's \namendment.\n  Of course I will be against Mr. Thompson's amendment, also. I am \nagainst his amendment, too. But the first vote would come on or in \nrelation to the Lieberman amendment--I believe that is right. The first \nvote would come on or in relation to the Lieberman amendment as against \nthe Thompson amendment. I assume Mr. Thompson is going to move to table \nthe Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from West Virginia is correct. It is a \nLieberman-Graham amendment, and I think it is Senator Thompson's \nintention to move to table it.\n  Mr. BYRD. And the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, for whom I have tons and tons and tons of respect, is \nopposed and he has offered an amendment now, as I understand it, that \nwould run up the white flag. I will use my own words. I am sure the \nofferor of the amendment wouldn't use those terms, but in my words, \nwould run up the white flag insofar as confirmation, required \nconfirmation of the Homeland Security Director by the Senate is \nconcerned.\n  I would like to have the Senator's response. He is entitled to \nrespond. I ask unanimous consent that I may retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from West \nVirginia, I need to say that I wouldn't describe it as running up a \nwhite flag. Senator Graham, who has constructed this section of the \nbill which I have supported, felt in the exercise of practicality but \nalso because he feels so strongly about the importance of at least \nputting in law a requirement--again, exercising the power of Congress. \nThere are some in the Chamber who believe Congress should never tell \nthe President what to do about anything, and if the President wants to \ncreate an adviser on counterterrorism he should have the right to do \nthat or not do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. There are monarchists--not anarchists--in the \nCongress, I will admit.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is a word I would embrace. That is quite right. \nOur Framers did not create a monarchy. They created a Republic with a \nPresident with substantial powers--accountable to the Congress with \nsubstantial powers--and to the people we are all ultimately \naccountable. The Senator from West Virginia is not just a Senator but \n``the Senator.'' He has had so much experience over some years here. He \nknows, as we have all experienced these days, that sometimes we come to \na moment where we can't quite achieve--Senator Graham is at an \nIntelligence Committee meeting, so I am taking the liberty of speaking \nfor him--the ideal that we aspire to because the votes have been \ncounted and we don't have the votes. That was the clear message from \nthe vote.\n  It was important, nonetheless, to take a significant step forward and \ncreate the office, with a law to guarantee that there would be somebody \nin the White House whose sole responsibility is to coordinate our \ngovernment-wide antiterrorism program. I must say that I am quite \npersonal about this issue.\n  I said to the Senator from Florida when we talked about introducing \nthe second-degree amendment that we may not have the votes for this, \neither. I understand the Senator from West Virginia has a different \npoint of view on what has been done. But Senator Graham feels so \nstrongly about the importance of at least creating the office, even if \nwe can't achieve the ideal of Senate confirmation, that he wanted to \noffer this amendment notwithstanding the possibility that the White \nHouse is not negotiating very much at this point. They are just wanting \nit their way or no way. But he wanted to give this option to the \nvarious Members of the Senate, particularly on this side of the aisle, \nwho say, Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, I like your idea but I \ndon't like the idea of Senate confirmation.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\n  That is the purpose of this amendment. I know how strongly the \nSenator from West Virginia feels about the prerogative of the Senate. I \nagree with him in this case. It is just that we haven't been able to \nachieve what we wanted here, although we hoped we might achieve a good \npart of it.\n  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to respond. It is \nnot my nature to settle for less than the ideal, but, as the Senator \nknows, sometimes in our democratic system we have to do it to achieve \nsome progress.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend, the distinguished \njunior Senator from Connecticut, and the standard bearer for the \nDemocratic Party in the last election, and a man whom I greatly respect \nfor other reasons. He and I have many kindred feelings when it comes to \nthe discussion of religion. I admire him for many, many things in that \nregard. If we wanted to get into the discussion of the cosmological \nprinciples that guide the operation of this universe, and if we wanted \nto talk about Charles Darwin, that great English naturalist and his \ntheory of survival of the fittest, the Senator and I have a lot of \nkindred thoughts.\n  I understand Senator Graham. He is a former Governor. There is \nnothing wrong with being a former Governor. But Governors have a way of \nlooking at things a little differently than those lowly peons like \nmyself who served in the House of Delegates and the State Senate of \nWest Virginia. I can understand how a Governor sees things--even at the \nFederal level--because sometimes they see things through the lens of \ntheir experiences as Governor dealing with State matters and State \nconstitutions. I can understand that. I wish I had been a Governor of \nthe State of West Virginia at some point. I would like to have that \nadditional experience.\n  But I cannot yield without more than just a clash of sword against a \nshield, even to Senator Graham. I have great respect for him, but he is \nwrong in this instance. When he gets to the floor, I will tell him I \nsaid that. I say that out of respect to him. We can all disagree. I \nsometimes try to remember that I can be wrong, and often am. But this \nis wrong.\n  I would be happy to debate this with Senator Graham until the cows \ncome home, if he wishes. He feels strongly, as Senator Lieberman says. \nI take that exactly the way Senator Lieberman says it. Senator Graham \nfeels strongly. Well, so do I.\n  I am going to see that there is some debate on this matter before we \nvote on it. I am not as young as I once was. I once spoke 14 hours--or \nsomething like 14 hours--on this floor. I once sat in that chair for 22 \nhours. I sat in the chair 22 hours, and I would still have been setting \nin it had Richard Nixon, the Vice President, not come to the Senate \nChamber. He naturally had the right to the gavel. I had been a Senator \na while, but I had not been a Senator a long time. But I knew who the \nPresident of the Senate was.\n  Incidentally, the President of the Senate can't address the Senate \nwithout unanimous consent of the Senate.\n  I noticed the Vice President the other day in New York. I saw what \nwas going on on television. I saw that he spoke at that meeting in New \nYork when the two Houses convened up there. Of course, when they first \nconvened in New York, John Adams was Vice President, and he talked at \nlength. He was quite a gregarious person in that respect, somewhat \nunlike the current Vice President. He is not gregarious, and neither am \nI, for that matter. But the Vice President doesn't speak these days--I \nhave an audience of one here, but even one individual is of great \nimportance. So I want my friend from Connecticut to hear what I had to \nsay here, not that it will be read even as a footnote.\n  But at this time, the Vice President cannot address the Senate except \nby unanimous consent of the Senate. At the time of the beginning of the \nRepublic, the Vice President was John Adams. And he was one who would \nspeak at the drop of a hat. He spoke quite at length.\n  That is a little bit besides the point here, but I just have to say \nthat I cannot--I suppose the Senator will win over my objection because \nnot many people here seem to be paying much attention to what is being \nsaid at the moment. I think they take for granted it is a bill like \nother bills that come here that have come through the committee, and: \n``I am going to vote with my party,'' or ``I am going to vote against \nthe party,'' or whatever.\n\n  But I have been trying to get their attention. And if it had not been \nfor my objections, this bill would have probably been passed already. \nBut some attention, at least, is being paid to it now. And I hope that \nmore attention will be paid to it.\n  On the business of having the Director of Homeland Security \nconfirmed, Senator Stevens and I had our experience--and it was not a \nvery happy experience--with this administration when it came to the \nhearings that both Senator Stevens and I thought we ought to have on \nappropriations. That was the supplemental appropriations bill, I \nbelieve. That was in the very early part of this year. And at that \npoint the memories of September 11 of last year were almost as vivid--\nin January and February of this year--as they were the day after the \nevent.\n  But Senator Stevens and I joined in asking Governor Ridge to come up \nbefore our Appropriations Committee and testify on the budget for \nhomeland security. Oh, he didn't want to come up. He was just a staff \nperson at the White House. I believe I saw the President, Mr. Bush, on \ntelevision, on one occasion, saying: He doesn't have to go up there. He \ndoesn't have to go. He's a staff person.\n  And so I said, at the time, probably in a low voice: Well, \ntechnically speaking, the President has a point. The person, Mr. Ridge, \nis on the President's staff.\n  So far so good. But Mr. Ridge is far different from the ordinary \nstaff person. And he is far different from the ordinary adviser to the \nPresident. The President has lots of advisers. He has the Secretaries \nof all the Cabinets. They are his advisers. And a confirmed Director of \nthe Office of Homeland Security can still be an adviser to the \nPresident. He still would be, and he certainly would carry more weight \nthan he carries as an adviser incognito. Those are my words.\n  But keep in mind that this so-called staff person, this person on the \nPresident's staff, is running all over the country speaking to chambers \nof commerce, going down to Mexico and meeting with the authorities \nthere, going up to Canada, meeting with the authorities there. Ordinary \nstaff people do not do that. This is more than just an ordinary staff \nperson. This is more than just an ordinary adviser to the President.\n  And he was quite willing to come up and ``brief'' Members of \nCongress. Well, that doesn't fill the bill as far as I am concerned. I \nam chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I don't know how long I \nwill be chairman, but as long as I am chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, that doesn't fill the bill.\n  We have briefings, if we want them. But when we want to spread the \nRecord for the American people to see, and for the American people to \nhear what is said by witnesses and by Senators who are asking \nquestions, it should be done in formal hearings--hearings, not \nbriefings behind closed doors.\n  I think there was some offer, even, to have a briefing with the doors \nopen, but that still does not--still does not--meet the bill. Here is a \ncommittee of the Congress, the Appropriations Committee, created in \n1867, doing its work, doing its duty, as we have always done it. When \nwe have had Republican chairmen of the committee and when we have had \nDemocratic chairmen of the committee, the committee has always had \nhearings. And they have been public hearings.\n\n  If we want closed hearings, we can vote to have a closed hearing. And \nthen we might vote to have the Record cleaned up a little bit and made \npublic. But ordinarily when we are hearing testimony on the budget, the \nFederal budget--the people's money, and the way the taxpayers' money is \nto be spent--the taxpayers are entitled to hear that. They are entitled \nto hear what the administration person says.\n  What was it that had to be secret? There was nothing. There was \nnothing about the testimony that he would give on these budget matters, \non the appropriations for the next year--nothing--that it needed to be \nsecret.\n  If we had had briefings, they would not have been kept secret. Ten \nminutes\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\nlater, those who would be in the briefings would go out and tell what \nwas said because it was not classified. That was a sham. That was a \ncharade on the part of the administration to try to make it appear that \nthe administration was trying to be reasonable. Yes, they would let Mr. \nRidge come up and brief Members. Why, my foot. Have him come up and \nbrief Members of the Congress? Why, that is laughable.\n  When I first came to this Congress, John Taber of New York was \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Would John Taber have \nagreed to have an administration person in the position that Tom Ridge \nis in--I am talking about John Taber, the Republican chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee--would John Taber have agreed to have \nthe administration witness come up and just give the Appropriations \nCommittee a briefing? Heavens, no.\n  And so I feel the same way about it. Why should the Appropriations \nCommittee of the Senate, after 135 years--after 135 years--through all \nadministrations, Republican and Democrat--settle for having a briefing, \nletting the administration's point man on homeland security just come \nup and give a briefing? Why, the American people are entitled to more \nthan that. The American people are entitled to more than that. That is \ntrivializing the appropriations process. No, I would not agree to that.\n  That is what we are about to do here. We are about to say, yes, we \nwill have a Secretary of the Department. I am for a Department of \nHomeland Security. And in my amendment, I certainly subscribe to \nSenator Lieberman's committee proposal in having a Department, having a \nSecretary of the Department. I go along with that. Yes, let's have a \nSecretary. But in my amendment, I am still proceeding under the \nunderstanding that the Director of Homeland Security within the White \nHouse will also be confirmed.\n  In an appropriations bill which Senator Stevens and I brought to the \nfloor several months ago, we had language requiring the confirmation of \nthe Director of Homeland Security. It was in the appropriations bill. \nWe tried and we tried--Senator Stevens and I tried more than once--to \nhave the Director of Homeland Security come before the Appropriations \nCommittee in the Senate and testify.\n  I assured those from the administration who talked with me about \nthat, we were not interested in knowing anything about Mr. Ridge's \nsecret conversations or private conversations with the President; we \nwere not interested in any of that stuff. We are not interested in that \nDick Tracy stuff. We only want to know the facts concerning the \nappropriations. We are not going to ask him questions like that. It is \nnot going to be classified.\n  If Mr. Ridge wants the committee to hear him in secret, we will vote \non that in the committee. And if the committee wants to close the door \nfor an hour to hear what he has to say that is so secretive and so \ndemands secrecy, we will vote on that. But we are not interested in \nembarrassing Mr. Ridge. We are not interested in embarrassing Mr. Bush. \nWe only want the facts concerning the moneys that are going to be \nneeded for homeland security.\n  No, they wouldn't let him come up. The administration had its feet in \nconcrete and was determined not to let Mr. Ridge come up and testify \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  The President said he was going to change the tone in Washington. \nWell, as far as I was concerned, that was not changing the tone in the \nright direction. That was a sour note, and I am sorry the \nadministration ever took that position. But here we are today and the \nadministration still doesn't want it. Why?\n  Why did they have their feet in concrete a few months ago with \nrespect to Governor Ridge? We could have gotten off on a much better \nfooting if Mr. Bush had said: Go on up there and answer their \nquestions. If they are asking questions on dollars and cents, the \ntaxpayers' money, the appropriations needs, go on up there and answer \nthose questions.\n  It would have struck a much sweeter note. But it kind of, in a way, \npoisoned the well. So that wasn't changing the tone for the better. \nThat made it worse. And to this day, the administration doesn't want \nthat position to be one that requires confirmation by the Senate.\n  Here we are, the loyal opposition when it comes to this bill, I \nguess, saying: We think that position ought to be confirmed. If we are \ngoing to create it, it is going to be confirmed. That is the way the \nSenate ought to look at this.\n  If there were a Democrat in the White House, I would say the same \nthing. It should be the Senate's will.\n  Now, the President can veto the bill. He can do that if he wants. He \ncan do that. I believe it is the seventh section of article I of the \nConstitution which lays out the veto power of the President--the \nseventh section, article I.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if I could ask a question \nwithout the Senator losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator consent to my suggesting the absence of a \nquorum, with the order being that as soon as the quorum is called off, \nwhich would be very quickly--I want to visit with the Senator and the \nmanagers of the bill--the Senator from Virginia would retain the floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't know about the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is perfectly OK.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that when the quorum call I will \nshortly suggest is called off, the Senator from West Virginia have the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, time being of the essence and realizing \nSenators want to get out of here and go home and how badly they want to \nget rid of the pending amendment, I will try to move on a little \nfaster. My thanks to the pages for brining me a lectern.\n  Mr. President, I have heard the concerns of some of my colleagues \nabout establishing a statutory office within the Executive Office of \nthe President with a Director confirmed by the Senate. I have heard the \narguments that Congress would be intruding upon the President's right \nto receive confidential advice and it would tie his hands with regard \nto the internal management of the White House.\n  These arguments misrepresent the realities of coordinating the \nexecutive branch and the management challenges it will involve, even \nafter this new Department is up and running.\n  The point has been made many times during the crafting of this \nlegislation that the functions involved in homeland security are \nscattered throughout the Federal Government. That is an important \npoint. Let me state it again: The point has been made many times during \nthe crafting of this bill that the functions involved in homeland \nsecurity are scattered throughout the Federal Government. That is not \nlike the State Department. It is certainly not like the Defense \nDepartment.\n  We are talking about a Department with functions scattered throughout \nthe Federal Government, the functions involved in homeland security. \nThat does not stop just at the water's edge. It goes on to the other \nside of the river. Many of those functions will not be transferred into \nthe Department by this legislation.\n  The legislation before the Senate today and which the Senate will \nvote on--I suppose, eventually, if this legislation is passed--creates \na Department of Homeland Security. I am for creating a Department of \nHomeland Security, but the bill creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity is not the end. That is not the alpha and the omega. That is \nnot the end-all. We really will not have done our work. We will have \nonly begun.\n  Many of those functions, I say again, will not be transferred into \nthe Department by this legislation. That is why I say we ought to stop, \nlook, and listen\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nto what we are doing. The administration would like Congress to pass \njust a mere piece of paper, as it were, handing the Department of \nHomeland Security over to the administration, saying here, Mr. \nPresident, here it is. It is yours, lock, stock, and barrel. Take it. \nWe are out of it. We will stand on the sidelines.\n  That is what we would do if we were to pass the legislation supported \nby the White House. If we were to pass the legislation that has been \nsent to us from the House, we would be doing just that. We would be \npassing a bill creating a Department of Homeland Security in the \nLieberman bill, legislation that would say: A Department is created. \nHere it is, Mr. President. It is yours. Take it. Do what you want with \nit. You have the next 13 months in which to implement this legislation. \nIt is yours.\n\n  I am not in favor of doing that. I am in favor of creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, but I am not in favor of Congress \ndoing that and then walking away and saying: It is yours, Mr. \nPresident; for the next 13 months we will go to the sidelines. I am not \nin favor of that.\n  I don't know why some Senators seem not to be exercised about it, but \nmy blood pressure has gone up a little bit about the very idea of \nhanding this over to the President and to this administration and \nsaying: Here it is. It is yours.\n  That legislation, when we send it to the President, will not be all; \nwe will have created, under Mr. Lieberman's bill, we will have created \na Department, we will have created six directorates, we will have \ncreated the superstructure of a Deputy Secretary, six Under \nSecretaries, five Assistant Secretaries, and so on.\n  That is OK with me. Let's create that superstructure. That is fine. \nBut when it comes to transferring the agencies into that Department, \nhow many agencies are there? Some say 22. Some say 28. Some say 30. How \nmany agencies are there? What agencies are they? By what criteria were \nthose agencies selected? Who said that this agency ought to go in but \nnot that one? And why should this agency go there and not that one? Why \nshould that one go in? Why not this one?\n  So all that is going to be left up to the administration. We are \ngoing to leave it up to the administration as to the agencies that will \ngo in, as to their functions, as to their objectives, as to their \nassignments. We are just going to turn it all over--lock, stock, and \nbarrel--to the administration.\n  That is the way it would be under the administration plan. That is \nthe way it would be under the House plan. That is the way it would be \nunder the Lieberman plan. I am trying to improve the Lieberman bill. I \nam saying, OK, let's do the superstructure. Let's have a Secretary. \nLet's have a Department of Homeland Security. Let's have a Secretary. \nLet's have a Deputy Secretary. Let's have six directorates, as Mr. \nLieberman proposes. Let's have five Assistant Secretaries. I am in \nfavor of that. That is all in title I.\n  But I am saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not go too fast now. \nLet's create this over a 13-month period. Let's have the work done \nunder a 13-month period, as the Lieberman bill would do. Let's create \nall this. Let's create the superstructure. Let's have it completed in \n13 months, as Mr. Lieberman would do.\n  He would have the Department and the superstructure and the agencies, \ntheir functions, and everything within 13 months, beginning with 30 \ndays after the bill is enacted into law. Then there would be 12 months \nin what is called a transition period. Mr. Lieberman would have that. I \nwould have that, too. But I would say, let's wait a little bit. Let's \nslow down a little bit. Let's not just turn this over to the \nadministration and let them have it and we walk away.\n  When I say ``we,'' I mean the Congress, the people's representatives. \nI am saying Congress should stay front and center in the mix. Let's \nhave, say, one of the directorates go forward beginning on February 3. \nThere are six directorates. One is in title XI. I don't touch title XI. \nThat deals with immigration. I don't touch that, certainly not at this \npoint.\n\n  But for the other directorates, I would say, OK, on February 3 we \nwill create one directorate and, Mr. Secretary, you send up to the \nCongress your proposal as to how we flesh out that directorate, as to \nwhat agencies go into that directorate--what agencies. Of course, that \ndirectorate is going to deal with border and transportation security.\n  Mr. Lieberman and his committee and Mr. Thompson have created six \ndirectorates. One of them is Border and Transportation Security. My \namendment would say, OK, let's take border and transportation security \nin that first directorate, and, Mr. Secretary, you send up your \nproposals for transferring agencies into that directorate to make it \nwork. You have 120 days to do that--that is 4 months. That is February \n3 that we start, because that is the day the President sends up his \nbudget.\n  Then we say, 120 days later--4 months later--Mr. Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, you send up your proposals for the \nnext two directorates. The next two directorates are the Directorate of \nIntelligence and the Directorate of Critical Infrastructure--the \nDirectorate of Intelligence and the Directorate of Critical \nInfrastructure, those two directorates that are created by Mr. \nLieberman's bill. See, I am with Mr. Lieberman on that.\n  But I am saying: Wait just a little bit. Let's hold our hands on the \nbridle here. Let's not let this horse run away with this wagon. Let's \nhold up here. You send up your proposal, Mr. Secretary. I assume that \nmight be Mr. Ridge or somebody else, I don't know who; it is the \nSecretary we are talking about. Yes, you send up your proposals 120 \ndays after February 3 while the fleshing out of the Border and \nTransportation Directorate is going forward. Then, 120 days later, we \nsay to the Secretary: Send up your proposals for these next two \ndirectorates, the Directorate of Intelligence and the Directorate of \nCritical Infrastructure.\n  All right. The Secretary, then, will send up his proposals for those \ntwo directorates. And as far as time is concerned, 120 day later, \nthen--that would be June 3--120 days later would be something like \nOctober 1. All right. Let's have the Secretary send up his proposals \nfor the fourth and fifth directorates.\n  Here they are, the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and the \nDirectorate of Science and Technology. I did not create these \ndirectorates; these directorates are to be created under Mr. \nLieberman's bill, under his substitute for the House bill. I am taking \nhis words for gospel, and I am saying: OK, let's go along, let's have \nthose directorates. But I am saying, February 3 we will have the \nproposal for the first directorate; June 3, let's have the proposals \nfrom the Secretary of Homeland Security for the next two directorates; \nthen, on October 1, we say to the Secretary, now send up your \nrecommendations to Congress concerning the last two directorates in \ntitle I: that is, the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and the \nDirectorate of Science and Technology.\n  So, there you are, we do it in a staged fashion. One directorate; 4 \nmonths later, two more directorates; 4 months later, two more \ndirectorates. By the end of that next 4 months, the 13 months would be \nup, so we will be within the same total timeframe as is envisioned by \nMr. Lieberman's committee. It envisions all this being done within 13 \nmonths--13 months following the passage of the Act.\n  We are saying the same thing, but we are saying don't do it all at \nonce, and we are not going to give you authority, Mr. President, to do \nit all at once. We are saying do it, some here, some there, and some \nthere, and let Congress be in on all this all the time--all the way.\n  How does that come about? All right, each set of proposals from the \nSecretary of Homeland Security will come to the Congress, and they will \ngo to the committee, the Lieberman committee, and its counterpart in \nthe other body. So both the House and Senate will be working on these \nsets of directorates in stages. Congress will be front and center. \nCongress isn't going to hand this thing over and then abdicate its \nresponsibility and walk away and stand over here on the sidelines. \nCongress is going to stay involved. That is what my amendment is about. \nLet's keep Congress involved.\n  What happens then? All right, let's take the first directorate. That \nis Border Transportation. The Secretary\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nsends up his proposals to Congress. The proposals, as far as the Senate \nis concerned, go right straight to the Lieberman committee. Mr. \nLieberman and Mr. Thompson stay right front and center. They take these \nproposals in their committee; they amend them, they adopt them, or \nwhatever. Whatever that committee wishes to make of the proposals that \nare sent to it by the Homeland Security Director, that committee \nreports that out as a bill. It comes to the Senate.\n  Oh, that is going to delay. Oh, my goodness, you say, that committee \nis going to report out another bill and the Senate is going to have to \nwork on it?\n  Yes, that is true. But we can prepare expedited procedures. So I say \nlet's prepare expedited procedures. If we do it in that fashion, we can \nprepare expedited procedures where the bill is not delayed, where it is \nnot filibustered--it can't be filibustered under expedited procedures--\nand the Senate will take that and, under expedited procedures, will \nconsider it. It is not going to be a--what is that infernal thing \ncalled?--fast track. That is right, fast track. Under fast track, the \nSenate doesn't get a chance to amend, but under these expedited \nprocedures I am thinking about, the Senate will be able to work its \nwill and amend the bill that is reported out by Mr. Lieberman and by \nhis committee's counterpart on the other side, in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  That committee would report the bill out to the Senate, the majority \nleader would call up the bill, and it would be acted upon under \nexpedited procedures and disposed of.\n  Four months later, when the next item came up here, the Directorate \nof Intelligence and the Directorate of Critical Infrastructure, the \nsame thing, same procedure would obtain. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity would send his proposals to the Congress.\n  The reason I don't say the President is that if I did, I would make \nmy amendment fall, if cloture were to be invoked on my amendment. If \ncloture were to be invoked, it would fall because it would not be \ngermane. I have tried to construct this amendment so it would stand the \ntest of germaneness in the event cloture were invoked on this \namendment.\n  So instead of the President sending it up, it would be his man--it \nhas to be his man, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Secretary would send the proposals to the committee, to \nMr. Lieberman's committee. Mr. Lieberman's committee, under expedited \nprocedures, would go over the recommendations from the Secretary and \nsend them, in amended form perhaps, to the Senate floor to be taken up \nhere and passed.\n  So the same thing, the same procedure, would obtain in each instance \nwhere a directorate or directorates were being fleshed out by agencies.\n  Are we talking about 22 agencies here? No. Twenty-six agencies? No. \nTwenty-eight agencies? No. Are we talking about 30 agencies? Maybe no, \nmaybe yes. Who knows?\n  In any event, the concept is this:\n  That we avoid the chaos of just passing this bill today--say this is \nthe bill before the Senate today, and it is passed by the House and the \nSenate and sent to the President. We avoid the chaos that will prevail \nthroughout the affected agencies of Government if this bill is passed \nand sent to the President because it is all done at once. We hand it \nover to the President lock, stock, and barrel. We walk away. And the \nPresident may take 6 months or he may take 8 months or he may take 13 \nmonths before he sends up all of the recommendations dealing with 6 \ndirectorates and 22 agencies--or 28. He may take all.\n  Under my amendment, we say no. Let us just take some at a time. Let \nus see how it works. Let us create that first directorate. Let us have \nthe recommendation of the Secretary of the Department. Let us have his \nrecommendations. Let the Senate, Mr. Lieberman, and the committee look \nat it. His committee looks at it and reports the bill to the floor. Let \nus have the Senate look at it, and the same thing in the House but all \nunder expedited procedures.\n  We do some here, do some there, and do some later on. We stage it. We \nphase it in. We don't just hand it over lock, stock, and barrel, and \nsay: Here it is. It is yours.\n  We avoid the chaos of doing it that way. Let us do it in an orderly \nway. Let us have an orderly process so we really do not do damage to \nthe proposal by Mr. Lieberman. As a matter of fact, in my way of \nlooking at it, we don't vote. My amendment will say we will create the \nDepartment just as Mr. Lieberman creates the Department. We will create \nsix directorates just as Mr. Lieberman creates six directorates. We \nwill have a Secretary and a Deputy Secretary, and we will have seven \nother Secretaries, and five Assistant Secretaries just as Mr. Lieberman \nhas the same number.\n  We are with you, Committee, Mr. Lieberman's committee. We are with \nyou. But instead of just passing this bill and wiping our hands and \nwalking away, saying, I shall have no more to do with this, it is all \nyours, Mr. President, we are going to say: Here is the concept. Your \nSecretary will send up recommendations in intervals. There will be some \nof it at a time. We will do the first directorate. While that is going \nthrough the mill and during the 4 months when those agencies are being \nmoved in, we are going to be taking a look at the next two \ndirectorates. But we will have in mind the flaws and the warts that we \nfound in the first transactions. We will have had an opportunity to \ntry. Let us see how it works. If there are flaws, if there are \nmistakes, we can correct them as we go along, and the next two \ndirectorates will not make those same mistakes.\n  When we set up the next phase, the final two directorates we will \nhave benefited by whatever mistakes or whatever shortcomings may have \nsurfaced during the creation of the preceding directorates.\n  It seems to me this is much more logical. It is an orderly process. \nIt keeps Congress--the elected representatives of the people--in the \nprocess. And it keeps Mr. Lieberman's committee--which is the committee \nthat has jurisdiction over the subject matter--front and center.\n  Why not do it that way? Why not do it in an orderly way rather than \njust turning the whole thing over all at once and just washing our \nhands of it, and saying, that is it, it is up to somebody else?\n  That is not the way to do it. I think the concept is one that is \nunassailable. That is the way it would work under my amendment.\n\n  We think we are all in agreement. We are talking about at least two \ndozen agencies and 170,000 Federal employees. That is a big shakeup in \nour Government. There is virtually little debate going on here. There \nwas a big rush to get this through in a hurry, pass it by September 11, \nor pass it before we go out for the August recess.\n  Norman Ornstein wrote an article in the Washington Post some several \nSundays ago in which he pointed out the chaos. He referred to the chaos \nthat will occur in this Government of ours if we go down the road \nmeekly like lambs to the slaughter and pass this as the administration \nconceived it in the darkness of midnight in the subterranean caves of \nthe White House; just go along like that with all of these agencies in \nturmoil, and we transfer 170,000 Federal workers.\n  Here they are--all moving their desks up Pennsylvania Avenue, and \nthey are having to move the telephones and get new telephone numbers. \nThey are having to move their computers, and they are having to do all \nthis. And the people who work in those agencies are going to be shifted \nto another building with a new mailing address. All of that is going on \nat the same time. All of these agencies with 170,000 Federal employees \nall at once--all is going on in the 13-month period. They are going to \nbe working in a different culture, in a different kind of atmosphere \nwith different associations with different assignments than what they \nhave been accustomed to--all of this at once.\n  What pandemonium will have taken over Pennsylvania Avenue. In \n``Paradise Lost,'' Milton wrote about the fall of some of the angels \nfrom heaven. He wrote about the rebellion against the Creator by these \nangels and how they conspired to take over. And they fell. They were \nrun out of heaven. Satan and his angels of like mind fell with them. \nThey fell like Lucifer from heaven, and they fell upon the boiling \nlake. Lucifer sat and built himself a palace there. That palace was \ncalled Pandemonium.\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\n  Do you remember that--those of you who have read Milton's ``Paradise \nLost''? He created a palace called Pandemonium.\n  That is exactly what will happen--pandemonium.\n  Go back and read Norman Ornstein. By the way, go back and read \nMilton's ``Paradise Lost.'' But also go back and read Norman Ornstein's \narticle in the Washington Post of some several weeks go. I will get it. \nWe are going to be debating this beyond today. We certainly won't pass \nthis bill today. I think we are sure of that.\n  So you have an opportunity to go back and read Norman Ornstein's very \nthoughtful and thought-provoking article about the pandemonium that \nwill reign on Pennsylvania Avenue. He didn't put it in those exact \nwords, but that is what you will be reading about--the pandemonium that \nwill reign and the chaos that will reign when all of these angels--22, \n30 of them--so many that nobody knows exactly how many agencies--but \n170,000 employees have to rip up their telephones and their computers \nand carry them off and up and down the avenue. What chaos that will be. \nWho is going to be minding the store when all of this chaotic exercise \nis being carried out?\n  Who is going to be minding the store? Who will be watching the \nterrorists? What will happen to those people right now who are in the \nagencies of this Government right today? At 5:30, I suppose most of \nthem are not still around; but certainly a lot of them are around, and \nwill be around until midnight and after midnight. They will be out on \nthe borders, securing the borders. They will be out there at the \nairports. They will be at the ports of entry to this country. They will \nbe all along the border between Canada and the United States and the \nsouthern border between Mexico and the United States. They will be out \nthere every hour of the 24 hours. They are out there right now, and \nthey will be there tonight when, Mr. President, you and I are sleeping. \nThey are out there right now.\n  But will these people be at their posts of duty when all of this \nchaos reigns, when we are going through all this big uprooting of the \nGovernment here in Washington, the uprooting of men and women who are \nat their jobs, at their desks, at their telephones today and every day?\n  They are at their desks securing our country, protecting our country, \nprotecting you and me, and my grandchildren and yours. What will happen \nwhen all of this chaos reigns? These people will not know--``Let's see, \nwhere am I supposed to go? What room am I in? What is the number and \nthe place I am supposed to go in this new Government?''\n  They will be saying: ``Where is my computer? Where is my laptop? \nWhere is it? And what is my new telephone number? And, by the way, what \nis the name of my agency here? Who is in charge here?''\n  Imagine the chaos. But under my proposal, we will do this in an \norderly fashion. We will do the same thing Mr. Lieberman does. In the \nend, we come out with the same Department, come out with the same \ndirectorates, the same number of directorates, named exactly like his \ndirectorates. We come out with the same number of Under Secretaries and \nAssistant Secretaries, the same thing. And we will do all that up \nfront, the superstructure.\n  But the rest of it, flushing out the directorates, determining what \nagencies go in--we want to know, Mr. Secretary, what are your \nrecommendations with regard to the agencies that go in here.\n  We will be doing all that in an orderly way, 120 days at a time: \nFebruary 3, the first directorate; June 3, the second and third \ndirectorates; October 1, the fourth and fifth directorates. We do not \ndeal with the sixth one because that is in title II. My amendment only \ngoes to title I because I did not want to go and get mixed up and have \nany problems with germaneness in the event that cloture is invoked on \nmy amendment or on the bill. So that is it. Why the opposition to my \namendment?\n  So with Congress dumping the job of dealing with over two dozen \nagencies and 170,000 employees into the lap of the Secretary, he will \nno doubt be too busy trying to get his own house in order to spend his \ntime worrying about what the rest of the Federal Government is doing. \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security will not be in a position to \ncoordinate agencies outside of his Department, so who will do it? Who \nwill be responsible for managing and overseeing homeland security \nfunctions and resources across the entire Federal Government?\n  That is not like Condoleezza Rice. That is not like the Secretary of \nState. That is not like the Department of State. Hear me now. That is \nnot like the Secretary of State. They do not concern themselves with \nagencies all across the whole Federal Government. But this one will. \nThis Homeland Security Department will be concerned with functions and \nresources that cut across the whole Federal Government.\n\n  Who will be able to dedicate the time necessary to follow up on the \noperations of so many agencies in so many different Departments?\n  This is a brandnew Department. Let me tell you, this is a brandnew, \nshiny toy, unlike the State Department, unlike Condoleezza Rice's \nDepartment. I say what I say with great respect to her. But you cannot \nequate Condoleezza Rice's position with the position of the Director of \nHomeland Security. Why, her Department was created more than 200 years \nago. But not this Department.\n  This is a brandnew Department. It cuts across virtually all agencies \nof Government; something new. Then how could we equate the National \nSecurity Adviser and her position with this new Secretary, this new \nDirector of Homeland Security, who will be in the White House, \nuntouchable?\n  One of my favorite movies, in the old days, when we had black and \nwhite television--I can remember back in 1953, I believe it was, or \n1954, when my wife and daughters went to one of the stores around here \nand bought a new television set. Yes, television had not been around \nlong. It just came upon the scene in 1926. I did not have a television \nset in my house.\n  One evening, I went home from my daily work in the office of mine \nrepresenting the old Sixth Congressional District in West Virginia, \nwhere the current Presiding Officer was born, the distinguished junior \nSenator from Delaware, who sits in the chair today and presides over \nthis body with such dignity and poise. He was born in that old Sixth \nCongressional District. That was the district that I represented. Well, \nthat was back in the years 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, and 1958.\n  And one day, when I went home for supper--we called it supper over at \nour house. We are just country folks. I went home to supper. I had my \nsupper. My wife and I and our two daughters walked into the living room \nand sat down. And she said: Do you see anything new? I looked around. \nShe said: Do you see anything new in the living room today? I had not \nseen anything new, but as I looked around, there it was, a brand \nspanking new black and white television set--black and white.\n  Well, my favorite movies in those days were clean. And they were \nwholesome movies. There are a few of them left but not many in this day \nand age. We talk about other people being evil, about Saddam Hussein \nbeing evil; just take a look at the television programming in the \nevenings. I saw, on one of the evening shows--I turned the TV on the \nother night. I seldom turn it on, but you can't help but see some of \nthem. And I saw some beautiful young women on there, and they were \nsaying words that I wouldn't say, and I have said them all in my time. \nBut I don't like that kind of language in the living rooms of the \ncountry.\n  How can we say somebody is evil? We need to take a look at our own \nself. I cannot look in the mirror and say I am not evil. Nor can any \nother man, truthfully. Because we have a little bit of Satan in us. We \nhave a spark of the Divine in us. That is why there is an afterlife. \nAnd we will have to answer for what we have done in this life.\n  So there is that black and white television set over there. And I \nliked ``Gunsmoke.'' I kind of liked old Matt Dillon in those days. And \nI liked ``The Honeymooners,'' Jackie Gleason. And I liked the \n``Untouchables'' in those days, Eliott Ness.\n  But here we have the untouchables at the White House. Don't touch \nthem. Don't have them come up here. Don't have them come up. They are \nthe untouchables. Don't have them come up before the committees.\n  This administration thinks we should not have someone of that \nstature, the stature of Tom Ridge, come up before a\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\ncommittee of the Senate. Who will be responsible for managing and \noverseeing homeland security functions and resources across the entire \nFederal Government? Who will be able to dedicate the time necessary to \nfollowup on the operations of so many agencies in so many different \nDepartments?\n  Now, I don't want Senators to go home yet. I have been trying to tell \nSenators that this is a very important step we are being asked to take, \nand we ought to be paying attention to it. I have been saying that to \nthe administration. Don't push it too fast.\n  Let's don't be stampeded by this administration. The President is out \nthere with his backdrops saying: Contact Congress. Tell them to pass my \nbill, pass this bill on homeland security.\n  Well, let's just slow down a little bit. So I say, I wouldn't go home \nquite yet if I were Senators because there might be a vote here yet, or \nthere may not.\n  Who will have enough authority to twist the arms of bureaucrats when \nimplementing homeland security policies in the field proves harder than \ndreaming them up in the basement of the White House?\n  Who will do all this? Tom Ridge, will he do it, the man who refused \nto testify before Congress when the Nation most needed to hear from \nhim? No. He had time enough to run around all over the country and \nspeak to chambers of commerce and this organization and that \norganization about his Homeland Security Department and to say awful \nnice things about what he was going to do and all of that. He had time \nto go to Canada. He had time to go to Mexico and talk to the heads of \nstate in some of those areas. He had time to do that, but he didn't \nhave time to come up here and talk with these peons who are sent here \nby the people out there on the prairies and on the plains and on the \nmountains and in the valleys and in the fields and in the mines and on \nthe stormy deep. He didn't have time to talk with us.\n  I think he would have come, but the President wouldn't let him \nbecause of this misguided perception that, well, because Tom Ridge was \nan ``adviser'' to the President, he didn't have to go up there; because \nhe is on the President's ``staff,'' he didn't have to go there.\n  This is a different kind of staff. This is a different kind of \nadviser. Here is a man who goes all over the country speaking about \nhomeland security, about his plans, about what is going to be \nhappening, what is going to be done, what are the concerns, what are \nthe fears, what are the things we have to guard against. But don't go \nup there in that briar patch. Don't go up there to Congress. Don't go \nup there and talk to those people. They are the elected representatives \nof the people. Tom Ridge isn't elected by anybody.\n  But those people up there, those men and women up there in the Halls \nof Congress, they are elected, and they have to go back at times and \nanswer to the electorate for what they have done or not done. They have \nto cast votes. They have to show down, and they have to go back home \nand explain the votes to the people. No, don't go up there to them.\n  And there is that fellow Byrd up there and that fellow Stevens. One \nis a Democrat and the other one is a Republican. They want Tom Ridge to \ncome up there. And those two guys--I will say ``guys'' because that is \nall right; that term is used a lot around here these days--those two \nSenators. The President could even say: I have a letter on my desk \nwritten to me by Ted Stevens and by Senator Byrd asking me for an \nappointment. They want to make their case about having Tom Ridge come \nup there.\n\n  But the President of the United States didn't show Senator Stevens or \nme the courtesy of even writing a letter back to us or calling us on \nthe telephone saying: I received your letter, Senators, but I am of a \ndifferent opinion. This is why I don't want to send him up there.\n  No, the President didn't show us that courtesy. He had some \nunderling--and I say that with great respect--a person who wrote the \nletter. I think there were one or two of them down there who wrote \nletters back to me and to Senator Stevens saying: The President has \nreceived your letter and this is why it can't be done or won't be done.\n  Now, how do you like that? Here is the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, the senior Democrat in the Senate of the United States has \nwritten asking the President for an invitation, asking for an \ninvitation to come to the White House to discuss having Mr. Ridge come \nup before the Senate Appropriations Committee when it holds important \nhearings. Is that changing the tone in Washington? Is that changing the \ntone in Washington?\n  Here is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, former \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee from the Republican side of \nthe aisle, a man, who knows, who could be the next President pro \ntempore of the Senate, the man right here at this desk who sits in this \nchair on which I hold my hand at this moment. Here are two very senior \nMembers. Not that all wisdom flows from the limbs and joints and brains \nof these two Senators, but they have been here a while. They are the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  We wanted an opportunity. We had been turned down in our letters. We \nhad been rejected. We asked for an invitation. We asked for the \nPresident to give us an appointment. Let us come down and explain our \ncase for having Tom Ridge come down.\n  Did the President ever invite us down? No. No. Was that changing the \ntone in Washington? That didn't do any good. That didn't help at all.\n  Here we are with the same thing. Here we have this administration \nwanting to turn hands down on the idea of having the Homeland Security \nDirector come up to the Hill and testify on his confirmation and have \nthe Senate vote to confirm. Why not? Why not?\n  This Constitution that I hold in my hand tells me that the Senate may \nconfirm or will confirm. Certain offices will be appointed by the \nPresident, by and with the consent of the Senate. And up until this \npoint, I don't remember Presidents dictating to the Senate as to what \noffices the Senate may create and which will be confirmed and which \nwill not. I don't remember that happening. This is a new leaf in my \nbook of 50 years here in Congress, the very idea.\n  And now we want to say, OK, Mr. President, we will do it your way. We \nwill yield on this. You can appoint your man. We won't require him to \nbe confirmed.\n  So are we going to hand over this responsibility to Tom Ridge, to \nentrust him with these important duties that extend far beyond the \nWhite House gates, after he has already clearly demonstrated an \nunwillingness to cooperate with Congress on a matter that directly \naffects the hearts and lives of every one of our constituents?\n  That is how important it is. This is a matter that affects the hearts \nand lives of every one of our constituents. Senator Thompson says we \nshould. He trusts the President to command the secret war on terror \nwithout input from Congress. I guess Senator Thompson--and I have great \nrespect for him--feels confident that Tom Ridge has enough clout to do \nthe job. But I am not sure that one man's clout will be enough. On my \nside of the aisle there are Senators who are willing to say the same \nthing.\n  Well, they say that vote has been decided earlier today. I don't \nbelieve that has been decided earlier today. The question we voted on \nearlier today went beyond that. John Dean, the former counsel to \nPresident Nixon, knows something about putting Executive power in the \nhands of White House advisers and beyond the reach of congressional \noversight. This past April, Mr. John Dean wrote a column in which he \nexpressed concerns about entrusting such responsibilities of \ncoordinating homeland security to a White House aide with no statutory \nauthority.\n  Where is the statutory authority for this White House aide? Oh, I \nknow the President issued an Executive order, but where is the \nstatutory authority for it? Somebody has to ask for money once in a \nwhile. Money doesn't grow on trees. They have to come here at some \npoint. This old Appropriations Committee is a waterhole. Out there in \nthe great forest are a lot of animals. They roam around out there, and \nwhen the night comes and the shadows and the curtains of night come, \nyou will hear something rustling in the leaves and you will hear a limb \ncrack and a twig break. By golly, there are animals out\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\nin that forest. At some point, they all have to come to the waterholes, \ndon't they? The birds, the bees, and the animals on four legs--don't \nthey have to come to the waterhole at some point? Well, the \nAppropriations Committee is the waterhole. At some point, these people \ndown at the other end of the avenue also have to come to the waterhole.\n  I know the President is Commander in Chief, whether he is a Democrat \nor a Republican. It is so stated by this Constitution, which I hold in \nmy hand. But the Commander in Chief, the President, shall be the \ncommander in chief of the Army and the Navy and the militia when called \ninto service to the country. But suppose Congress doesn't provide an \nArmy and Navy for the President to command? Yes, he is the Commander in \nChief.\n  Charles I of England, in 1639, I believe, was the first to use that \nterm, ``commander in chief.'' That goes back a long ways, to 1639.\n  But in 1649, Charles I lost his head. His head was severed from his \nbody. That was Charles I of England. Some Senators may have forgotten \nit, but the Parliament and the King of England had a war. There was a \nwar between the King and Parliament. Can you imagine a war in this \ncountry between the President of the United States and Congress? That \nis the way it was in England.\n  You can change history all you want and you can talk about political \ncorrectness all you want, but the people who wrote this Constitution \nwere British subjects. Some had been born overseas. Alexander Hamilton, \nJames Wilson, and several of them were first immigrant descendants. \nThere was Franklin and there were others, and I believe James Morris \nmay have been born in England. In any event, these were British \nsubjects. Some were Irishmen, some were Scots, but they were British. \nYou can say all you want, and political correctness is not going to \nchange that. This Constitution was written by men--not women. In that \nday they did not have women elected as delegates to the convention, but \nthere were the men, British subjects. They knew about the history of \nEnglishmen. They knew about the struggles of Englishmen. They knew \nabout the Magna Carta, which was wrung from a despot in 1215, along the \nbanks of the Thames River. On June 15, 1215, they knew about that. They \nknew that the barons stood there with their swords in their scabbards. \nThey knew that Englishmen, going back for many years under the Anglo \nSaxons, after William of Normandy came to England in 1066 and brought \nfeudalism to England, they knew the Englishmen had fought and shed \ntheir blood for the concept that the people should be represented by \nelected representatives in the Commons. They knew--those men who shed \ntheir blood--the power of the purse would be vested in the Commons, in \nParliament.\n\n  Englishmen fought for centuries in order to win that battle over the \npower of the purse. They knew that in 1688--let me go back to 1649 for \njust a minute. I was earlier talking about the war between King Charles \nI, who believed in the divine right of Kings, and his father, James I \nof Scotland, was also a devotee of the idea that the King was God's \nimmediate representative on Earth. So they believed in what is called \n``divine right of Kings.'' James I was a very strong devotee of that \nidea. His son, Charles I, was as much a devotee of that misguided \nidea--maybe more so--than James. But Charles I carried it a little bit \ntoo far. The High Court of Justice was created January 3, 1649; and on \nJanuary 30--less than a month later--Charles I lost his head before \nperhaps 200,000 people.\n  What followed that, in quick measure, was the Commons outlawed the \nLords. There would be no more King, no more House of Lords.\n  So our forefathers knew all about this. They knew how Englishmen had \nshed their blood to wrest from tyrannical monarchs the power of the \npurse because the power of the purse is the greatest raw power that \nthere is in government.\n  Cicero, that great Roman orator said, ``There is no fortress so \nstrong that money cannot take it.'' So there you have it. The \nEnglishmen knew that. Our forebears knew that. So the men who wrote the \nConstitution knew that. And they knew that this right that elected \nrepresentatives of the people have control over the public purse had \nbeen set as an example back in the British Isles from which they--most \nof them or their forebears--had lately come.\n\n  So there you have it. That is history. There is more to it than that, \nbut that is just a little of it.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, going back to Mr. Dean's column--as I say, \nhe wrote it back in April of this year--he expressed concerns about \nentrusting responsibilities, such as coordinating homeland security, to \na White House aide with no statutory authority.\n  John Dean raised a number of important questions which I will now ask \nthe Senate. I quote John Dean:\n\n       Would the departments and agencies fall into line when a \n     senior White House aide so directed them?\n  How about it? We are talking about just an aide. He has not been \nconfirmed by the Senate. How about the Secretaries of the Departments \nwho have been confirmed, who come before the Congress, who come before \ncongressional committees and answer questions and give testimony and \nare witnesses? Would those senior White House aides fall into line when \nthis upstart, who has not been confirmed by anybody, except the \nPresident appointed him to this position--he is a White House aide--are \nthose Department heads going to stand and salute when Tom Ridge tells \nthem to fall into line? How about that?\n  What authority does he have? Does he have authority over these \npeople, these men and women who are in Cabinet positions, who have \nstood before the bar of the Senate and been confirmed to their \npositions?\n\n       Would the Cabinet officers follow orders from anyone other \n     than the President himself? Could a senior White House aide \n     resolve long-time department rivalries?\n\n  How about that? We know there have always been Department rivalries \ngoing back to the early days of this Republic. Would this senior White \nHouse aide, who does not have to come before Congress and answer \nquestions about his own budget, would these Department heads, these \nCabinet officers who do come before the Congress and they have been \nconfirmed by Congress--they come here about their budgets--would they \nbe brought into line by this upstart, this fellow who is here?\n  I know he is here by the grace of the President, but could a senior \nWhite House aide resolve long-time Department rivalries such as those \nbetween the CIA and the FBI? We have heard about that, haven't we?\n  Can this White House aide crack the whip, and these heads of \nagencies, such as the CIA and FBI, will they jump to attention, salute, \nand say, yes, sir; yes, sir; no, sir; yes, sir? Could the senior White \nHouse aide resolve long-time Department rivalries like those between \nthe CIA and the FBI, or Treasury and Justice, law enforcement \nresponsibilities?\n\n       Could this White House aide get the Border Patrol, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service, and Customs operating \n     like they all belong in the same Government?\n\n  What authority does he have? He is just the President's man; that is \nit. He does not have any statutory authority. He is not confirmed by \nthe Senate. How would you feel, Mr. President, if you were a Cabinet \nofficer in this administration, and you had someone who was not a \nCabinet officer, who had not been confirmed by the Senate, a new man \non the job, a new office on the street; it is a brandnew office. It is \na new office, what will be a new Department. But this fellow down here \nwho really runs things does not have to go up before Congress. Here I \nam, a poor old Cabinet officer, and I lie awake at night worrying about \nhow I will answer these questions when I am called up before that \ncommittee tomorrow and all those klieg lights will be on me, and they \nwill ask me questions about money, how I have been spending it all. \nHere I have to go up there tomorrow. This man does not have to go up. \nAll he has to do is go up to the ``Commander in Chief.''\n\n  By the way, the Commander in Chief--let me read from this book so \npeople will know this is bona fide. If I had to, I could say it from \nmemory. Here is the Commander in Chief. He is not the Commander in \nChief of industry.\n\n       The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States,\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n     and of the Militia of the several States, when called into \n     the actual Service of the United States. . . .\n\n  But he is not the Commander in Chief of industry. He is not the \nCommander in Chief of the Congress. But here I am, a Cabinet officer, \nand I have to go up there and listen to those people up there. I have \nto go up there and sit at a table, way past the lunch hour, and listen \nto those Senators, be criticized by them. And here is this man. He is \nnot confirmed by anybody. He just stands at the Commander in Chief's \ndesk and salutes and says: Yes, sir; no, sir; not my will but thine be \ndone.\n  I do not believe a man or a woman who is thrust into that kind of a \nposition is going to relish being in that position because he does not \nhave any statutory authority behind him. It would seem to me a person \nin that position would want statutory authority behind him; get the \nstatute behind him. He would want to be confirmed. Yes, he then has the \nauthority, the authority of the legislative branch, as well as his own \nappointment by the Chief Executive, behind him.\n  The next question:\n\n       Could an aide, such as the homeland security director, get \n     the Border Patrol, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n     and Customs operating like they all belong in the same \n     Government?\n\n  I have been quoting Mr. John Dean.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Dean concluded that homeland security is too \nimportant an issue for a Nixon-style executive leadership.\n  Here is a man who was in the Nixon administration, the counsel to \nPresident Nixon, John Dean. Mr. Dean concluded that homeland security \nwas too important an issue for a Nixon-style executive leadership and \nthat congressional oversight and the collective wisdom of Congress are \nessential in dealing with a threat of such magnitude.\n  I agree. Why do we have to fuss and fume and fight over whether or \nnot this person should be confirmed? The President ought to say: Okay, \nlet's get on with it; let's confirm him. I will name the person, and, \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, he will serve.\n  What is wrong with that? That has been the case for over 200 years. \nSome Presidents have suffered defeat when it came to their nominees. I \ncan think of John Tyler, especially when he was fuming and fussing \naround with the Whig leaders in the Congress. What is so bad about \nthat? After all, I would welcome that. Let him be confirmed by the \nSenators. That will give him more authority. It makes him more bona \nfide in the eyes of the people. He would stand before the American \npeople with more authority. What is so bad about that? That is not \nanything damaging to the President. Requiring a person to be confirmed \nis not demeaning to the President. So why should we Democrats be \nwilling to roll over and play dead on it?\n  They say: Oh, they have the votes on the other side.\n  Well, that is all right. Let's have a vote at some point; let's not \njust say roll over and play dead. It is far more important for us to \nstand for what we can look back on 10 years from now and say we did the \nright thing, we were right, than just for a day to say, well, we will \navoid this fight, they have the votes, and let's go on.\n  That is not enough. Let us make the case for confirmation, and if we \ngo down to defeat, the record will be there. And later, when the pages \nof history are turned one by one and we can then look back on the \nmistakes that may have flowed from that very act of having an \nindividual in that position, not confirmed by the Senate of the United \nStates, we will know that we stood for the right; we stood for what was \nbest for our children and grandchildren.\n  This job is too important to be left to Tom Ridge alone. I do not say \nthat with any disrespect to Tom Ridge. I could not speak of him with \ndisrespect if I wanted to. The man was a Governor; he was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives in earlier days. He is a respectable man. \nSo I do not speak of him as a person; I speak of him as an officer who \nwill be in a key position for the first time in over 200 years, an \nuntried position, an untried office, in times that are trying but not \nyet tried really. This job is too important.\n  So if you want to beat me, beat me. Go ahead. Roll over me. I will \nnot get on your wagon. This is a principle, and I think a lot of \npeople, if they listen to me and hear what is being said and if they \nwill study this bill, sooner or later they are going to come around to \nmy viewpoint. I think the American people, if they heard it, would say: \nSenator, you are right; this position is too important to be left to \nTom Ridge alone, too important to be left to a President to appoint, \nand that ends it.\n  I know the President is elected, but an electoral college sends him \nhere, an electoral college sends Vice President Cheney here, but no \nelectoral college sends me here. The Senator from the great State of \nMinnesota, who is now presiding--by the way, one of his ancestors was a \nsigner of the Declaration of Independence. He signed from the State of \nNew Jersey. His name was Jonathan Dayton, and Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota today sits in the chair. So we were sent here by the people.\n\n  We cannot rely on a confidential adviser to the President to \norchestrate Federal homeland security policy unilaterally and in \nsecret. What is going on here? What is this all about? Why the stiff \njaws down at the other end of the avenue against having this man come \nup and testify? He knows the answers. That is why Senator Ted Stevens \nand I wanted him up before the Appropriations Committee--because he \nknows the answers. He is the President's point man on homeland \nsecurity. That is the way it will be.\n  I do not mean to drag over the old ashes all the time, but that is \nthe same way it will be if the Congress puts its rubber stamp on this \nlegislation and goes forward with the administration's desire of being \nable to appoint this adviser to the President in this very untried, \nreally untested up until the last 8 or 10 or 12 months, position. That \nman has not been confirmed by the Senate. He has not answered questions \nfor his confirmation, does not have to go up to the Senate and the \nHouse and answer questions before the Appropriations Committees. He \ndoes not have to answer questions from any other committees. He is the \nPresident's man.\n  Have you read about all the King's men? Well, this is not quite a \nmonarchy yet, although I am afraid there are some Members of both \nHouses, I am sorry to say, who, by my perceptions at least, would be \nmonarchists. They will do anything the President says should be done, \nand they will do it in the name of his being the Commander in Chief.\n  Well, the Commander in Chief of what? The Army and the Navy and the \nmilitia when it is called into service. But suppose Congress does not \ncall the militia into service? That is done by statute. It has been on \nthe statute books a long time. The Congress calls the Guard into \nservice. It passes the laws. Who creates the Navy and the Army? Look in \narticle I, section 8, and you will find out who. Congress shall have \npower. Who provides the money to keep these agencies running? Our \nEnglish forbears said: We will appropriate money for an army, but just \nfor a year at a time. In our Constitution, we took a leaflet out of our \nEnglish forbears at the time and said 2 years at a time, not more than \n2 years. This Constitution still governs. I have not heard much about \nit in recent days.\n  I listened last Sunday to all the talking heads and everybody on \ncertain programs because I saw in the newspaper that some pretty \nimportant people were going to be on television. I saw that the Vice \nPresident was going to be on, Secretary of State Powell was going to be \non, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was going to be on, and National \nSecurity Adviser Condoleezza Rice was going to be on. I thought I had \nbetter listen to all of these people. So I did. I listened to them. I \nlistened to every one of them. Not once, and not once in all of the \ndebate I have been hearing around here and downtown and at the U.N. and \neverywhere else, not once have I ever heard the Constitution of the \nUnited States mentioned. Now, it may have been on one of those Sunday \nprograms. I may have missed it somehow, but not once did I hear the \nword ``Constitution'' mentioned.\n\n  These smart lawyers down at the White House--and they are smart; I \nstudied law, never with any intention of being a lawyer. I probably \nwouldn't have been a good one anyhow. But in any event, these smart \nlawyers down at the White House say the President has legal authority \nto unilaterally deliver an unprovoked attack against\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nIraq as a sovereign State. I have as much fear and as much concern and \nas much contempt for Saddam Hussein as does any other man or woman. But \nit takes more than just legal authority.\n  These smart lawyers can line up on either side. You can hire a good \nlawyer on either side. You can hire a good lawyer to take this side of \nthe case over here or you can hire that same good lawyer for this side \nof the case. A smart lawyer can come in with an almost impenetrable \ncase.\n  But that is not the point. The Constitution is there. The \nConstitution is there. I hold a copy of that Constitution in my hand. \nIt is, other than the Bible, my guiding light, this Constitution. \nConstitutional scholars in this land agree with me. Just legal \nauthority is not enough. It is the Constitution. It is there. It is \nalways there morning, noon, afternoon, night. The Constitution is \nalways there. But not once, not once was this Constitution mentioned on \nany of the networks that I listened to last Sunday in the discussions \nabout a possible war into which this country was being--at least in \nsome quarters--stampeded into. We were going to war. We were going to \nbe in a war. Our collective minds at the head of Mount Olympus had been \nmade up already. The President had the legal authority.\n  Legal authority, my foot. It is the Constitution we are talking \nabout. The Constitution says the Congress shall have power to declare \nwar. I know that only five wars have been declared, but that \nConstitution is still there. And there are at least six other wars to \nwhich statutes have been passed by Congress, dependent upon as \nauthority. What has happened to us all when we just go forward blindly \nwithout looking to the left or the right, saying we will go to war. We \nwill change this regime. We will do it, I will do it, or it will be \ndone.\n  How about those 535 Members who sit up there on Jenkins Hill? How \nabout them? They have certificates showing that they were duly elected \nby the people--not by an electoral college but they were sent here by \nthe people. Are we going to disregard them? And these people who sit up \nhere on Jenkins Hill ought to read this Constitution again. Many of \nthem have, I am sure. But let us not disregard this Constitution.\n  The President has legal authority to do this and do that. When it \ncomes to war, this Constitution says the Congress shall declare war. We \ncan talk a long time about this subject, too, and probably will. As far \nas I am concerned, we will, if the Lord lets me live.\n  Legal authority: We have an organic law that says Congress shall \ndeclare war. I know the President has inherent authority and that it \ncomes from this Constitution, too--inherent authority to act to repel a \nsudden attack upon this country or upon its military forces. He may not \nhave time to talk with Congress. He may not have time to get a \ndeclaration of war from Congress. He may not have time to get an \nauthorizing measure from Congress. He may have to act. In that case, \nthis Constitution gives him that inherent authority.\n\n  We are talking about an unprovoked attack by this country, an \nunprovoked attack upon a sovereign state. It does not make any \ndifference if we do not like the person who is the head of that State \nor who is running it or who is a dictator, of course. The fact we do \nnot like him is not enough. Congress shall have the power to declare \nwar. We are going to talk about that a while.\n  I noticed a column in one of the great newspapers this morning which \nvirtually had our minds made up for us. We are just going to go. We are \ngoing to do this.\n  Incidentally, I will have more to say on that subject at another \ntime.\n  This job we are talking about is too important to be left to Tom \nRidge alone. It is too important to be left to Tom or Dick or Harry \nalone. We cannot rely on a confidential adviser to the President to \norchestrate Federal homeland security policy unilaterally and in \nsecret--in secret. This administration wants to act in secret too much. \nThe Government's fight against terrorism is bigger than a Department of \nHomeland Security. Isn't it? They want to fight over this little \nfellow--he is not just a little fellow once he is down there behind \nthat desk--but they want to wage a big fight against terrorism, and it \nis a fight that is bigger than the Department of Homeland Security and \nit is too big for Tom Ridge or any other Tom, Dick, or Harry.\n  He needs the authority of the legislative branch behind him. In \naccordance with the Constitution, the President shall appoint thus and \nso by and with the consent of the President.\n  His position ought to be made subject to the confirmation of the \nSenate.\n  My Appropriations Committee brought an appropriations bill to the \nfloor. This bill was the fiscal year 2002 supplemental that was brought \nbefore the Senate in the early part of the year, sometime around June \nor July. In that bill, as reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, made up of 29 Senators, 15 Democrats and 14 \nRepublicans, that bill had a provision that provided that the Director \nof Homeland Security must be someone confirmed by the Senate of the \nUnited States. That was in the bill.\n\n  It was brought here before this body, and it passed the Senate by a \nhuge margin. I think there were more than 70 votes cast for that \nappropriations bill. That provision was in it. Senators knew it was in \nit because we brought it up in the Appropriations Committee of the \nSenate. It was there. There was never any attempt to strike it. There \nwas no attempt to amend it. In that provision all Senators knew, they \nhad their eyes open, they didn't have blinders on, and it wasn't \nsomething done in secret. It was right there in the bill, and we had it \nin the Senate here, everybody knew about it, and not one, not a peep \ndid we hear against that provision here in the Senate. It passed the \nSenate and went to conference.\n  Then the administration saw the handwriting on the wall. They must \nhave been reading about Belshazzar in the Book of Daniel.\n  Belshazzar had a great party, a great dinner thrown. And he had his \nsoothsayers and his lords and his highfalutin officers and all. \nBelshazzar, King. He was having all this mirth. He invited a thousand \nof his lords. This was a great function there on the banks of the \nEuphrates River.\n  All the mirth was going on. Everybody was laughing, drinking, \ntoasting, feasting. And all at once, there, over near the candlestick, \nappeared a man's hand, and that man's hand wrote something on the wall \nnear the candlestick. And Belshazzar, the great King, wondered what it \nwas, and he became obsessed with fear, and his knees buckled, and his \nhand trembled, and he brought forth his magicians, his medicine men, \nand his soothsayers, and he asked them: What is that saying? What are \nthose words over there?\n  And somebody said: Well, we can't answer this. We don't know what \nthose words are. But there is a man, a young man, who can interpret \nthese words for you, O King, and his name is Daniel. He is in prison. I \nbelieve he was still in prison. They said: This young man can interpret \nthese words.\n  The King said: Bring him to me. And the King said to Daniel--I hope I \nam not getting two of my Biblical stories crossed up. It is late in the \nday. I hadn't counted on saying this. But I believe the King promised \nDaniel that he would have half the kingdom if he could interpret this \ndream. He would be clothed in the richest of garb and be made ruler of \nhalf the kingdom.\n  Anyhow, Daniel said: These are the words, O King:\n\n       MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.\n  Meaning this:\n\n       Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.\n       Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and \n     Persians.\n\n  That is not the entire interpretation, but that is most of it.\n\n       MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. Thou art weighed in the \n     balances and are found wanting. Thy kingdom is divided, and \n     given to the Medes and Persians.\n\n  And that night, Belshazzar was slain and his kingdom was divided.\n  Why have I told this story? I told the story about Belshazzar, the \nhandwriting on the wall. This administration saw the handwriting on the \nwall. Here was this appropriations bill coming right down the road like \na Mack truck, and it had in it the language to the effect that the \nDirector of Homeland Security would be appointed by the President with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\n\n  The administration saw that coming, and it was coming like a Mack \ntruck. So the administration, as it sometimes\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\ndoes--and I don't blame it for doing it--decided it would try to get \nahead of this wave that was coming. The administration, lo and behold, \ncame up with this grand idea of having this homeland security agency, \nand this was all cooked up and hatched down at the White House, down \nthere in the subterranean caverns.\n  I don't think it would matter if electricity were cut off. If there \nhad been a big storm and all the electricity cut off, it wouldn't have \nmattered because they probably had lanterns, candles, down in those \nsubterranean, dark caverns where shadows can be seen flitting around--\nshadows in the cave. That brings up another story, but I won't tell it \nright now.\n  In any event, here these people were, and they saw this Mack truck \ncoming down the road, this bill that had been passed by the Senate, an \nappropriations bill saying that we are going to have the homeland \nsecurity man answer to those Senators up there.\n  You see, we had invited him, Ted Stevens and I invited him time and \ntime again. He wouldn't come. We had written to the President of the \nUnited States, thinking: Well, he will hear us, he will listen to us. \nHe is a man who said he wanted to change the tone in Washington. He \nwill hear us: Mr. President, please let us come down and visit with \nyou, and let us make our case for the Director of Homeland Security \ncoming before the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Not a word did the President say, by telephone or by pen--not one. \nNo. The President was going to change the tone. But here he wouldn't \nlet this man come up. Why not?\n  So here is this bill coming down here saying: Yes, he will come. He \nwill have to be confirmed by the Senate or he won't be the man in that \nposition.\n  So the administration got busy and said: OK, we will get ahead of \nthat wave. And here came the President, come out with this and he \nunveiled this beautiful new toy. And, by the way, it just swept over \nthe country, the media grabbed onto it, and here we are now. We have \nthis bill up before the Senate.\n  So the administration saw the handwriting on the wall and got ahead \nof the truck.\n  But it is still the same question before the Senate. Are we going to \nhave this important position be filled by someone who will come up \nbefore the Senate, the committees in the Senate and the committees of \nthe House and answer questions about the budget? So let us see that he \ndoes that, and we will make sure of that by making him confirmable by \nthe Senate.\n  Oh, no. Now, that is going too far, says the administration and some \nof my friends on this side of the aisle and on that side of the aisle. \nThey are perfectly willing out here today to accede to that and not \ncontest that any longer. After all, Condoleezza Rice doesn't come up \nthere. She is the National Security Adviser. The Congress doesn't \nrequire her to come up. Why should they require Tom Ridge to come up?\n  What kind of an argument is that? Where would that get you in law \nschool? Where would that get you in moot court? What kind of a lawyer \nis that? I would hate to have been that kind of a student down at \nAmerican University and gone up before Dean Myers in moot court and \nsaid: Well, I will tell you now, Dean. Condoleezza Rice, the National \nSecurity Adviser, doesn't have to. Congress doesn't require her to come \nup there before them and be confirmed. So why would we say that the \nhead of the Homeland Security Department has to come up there?\n  What an argument. What kind of lawyer would make that argument? Yet \nSenators are willing to roll over and play dead with that argument. \nThey don't require Condoleezza Rice to come up?\n  Is that a case winner? My word, what kind of high-priced lawyer is \nthat? Would that have won the case for William Jennings Bryan in \nTennessee? That great lawyer, that great orator, is the man who argued \nthe case in the John T. Scopes trial, and his opponent. That was a real \ncase. I don't think they would have won the case just to say: Well, \nthis fellow over here, say what you want to him about him. But over \nhere, we don't require this person to go up there and be confirmed. So, \nlet's get home early for supper. We don't want to argue about that. \nThey have the votes. Let us just give it to them. They have the votes. \nWhy not give it to them?\n  I am talking about William Jennings Bryan in the John T. Scopes \ntrial. That is not quite enough of a case, I don't believe, to be \npersuasive. It might be persuasive among good lawyers, but it is not \nquite persuasive among Senators.\n  The Government's fight against terrorism is bigger than a Department \nof Homeland Security, and it is too big, I say to Tom Ridge, or Tom, \nDick, and Harry--nothing derogatory about the person. Oh, no, you are \nnot going to hang me with that. I don't mean that. But it is too \nimportant to the American people to have just an aide to the President \ndoing it.\n  Only an office that can act with the authority of both the White \nHouse and the Congress can realistically guarantee that homeland \nsecurity policy will be fully implemented in the farthest corners of \nthe Federal Government.\n  That is a sound statement. It is based on specifics, and it is based \non logic. It is based on common sense. I don't have much of it anymore. \nI get tired early. I am quite tired now. My voice is getting faint, and \nmy hands tremble and my hair is white. But I still believe the people \nback in West Virginia sent me here to represent them to my best \nability. I swore when I came here, before God and man, standing up \nbefore that desk there, that I would support and defend the \nConstitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I am not saying \nthere are enemies in this body or in this country. No. I am not saying \nthat at all. But there are some people who are willing to go the easy \nway and take the line of least resistance on that Constitution. Oh, \nthat Constitution is an old piece of paper. Those men back there in \n1787 didn't have any telephones. The telephone didn't come along until \n1875. No. Those people back there at the time the Constitution was \nwritten didn't have the incandescent light. No. That just came along in \n1878. No. Back in those days, they didn't have automobiles. They had \nhorses and buggies. They pulled the shades and drew the blinds so they \ncouldn't hear the wagons out there on the streets. The automobile \ndidn't come along until 1887 or 1888. They couldn't tell what was going \non outside the place. They did not have the cell phones. They didn't \nhave radios. They didn't have television sets, and radios didn't come \nalong until the turn of the century.\n\n  There was Marconi, and wireless telegraph didn't come along until \n1848. The steam engine was invented back in 1869. That was just a few \nyears before the convention met. You couldn't expect those people back \nthen to write a constitution that would endure for the ages. You can't \nexpect that.\n  The Constitution? What do you mean, Senator Byrd? The Constitution?\n  Well, the Constitution was written in 1787. There were not any women \nthere. The youngest person there, I believe, was Johnathan Dayton. He \nmay have been the youngest person there. Benjamin Franklin was 81.\n  They did not have television. Television didn't come along until \n1926. We are the bright ones. We are the people who should have written \nthe Constitution in our age. We have the radio, and all of these \nthings.\n  I know that Isaiah, of course, prophesied that certain things would \nhappen. Isaiah said: Make straight the desert highway for our God. \nEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be \nlaid low. The crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places low. \nThe glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it \ntogether.\n  But Isaiah? That was a long time ago. Back in those days, how could \nhe have foreseen? But he did.\n  Take these marvelous inventions I have been talking about--the \ntelephone, the radio, television, the cable under the oceans, the jet-\npropelled plane, the automobile--they have exalted the valleys, have \nlaid low the mountains and the hills, have made the rough places plain, \nhave made a straight line in the desert.\n  Isaiah's predictions have come true. And the glory of the Lord has \nbeen preached in all corners of the Earth, on every continent and every \ncorner of the globe. The glory of the Lord has been revealed.\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\n  Those people weren't old fogies. Isaiah knew what he was talking \nabout. Here were the Kings with all of these marvelous inventions.\n  When Nathaniel Gorham and Rufus King and John Langdon and Roger \nSherman and George Read and Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris and \nGouverneur Morris and Elbridge Gerry were up there working, they did \nnot have all these wonderful inventions; and they met behind closed \ndoors. They didn't let anybody know what was going on. And they wrote \nthat little old book they called the Constitution of the United States.\n  By the way, this book contains both the Constitution and the \nDeclaration of Independence. It certainly isn't very much, is it? These \nsmart lawyers say that the President has legal authority. And these \nsmart lawyers had to go through--what?--was it 4 years or 3 years or 2 \nyears, or whatever, to get that law degree? I had to go 10 years to get \nmine. And I read far more books than this little book. It took a long \ntime. I had to burn a lot of midnight oil to get my law degree.\n  Yes, these smart lawyers can say: Oh, the President has legal \nauthority. But this is what counts in the final analysis, the \nConstitution.\n  Yes, I listened to all those programs last Sunday. There was the Vice \nPresident of the United States. There was Condoleezza Rice. There was \nthe Secretary of Defense. There was the Secretary of State. And there \nwere others there. And not one time did any one of them ever mention \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  They are all saying: The President has authority. Congress has \nalready authorized them. It authorized them in the 1991 resolution. It \nauthorized them in the resolution last year. And he also has the robes \nof Commander in Chief wrapped around him. Oh, he has all the authority \nhe needs.\n  No, he doesn't. This says: Congress shall have the power to declare \nwar. Now, you may argue all you want, but I took an oath. And I have \ntaken it many times. I have stood at the desk up there, and I put my \nhand on the Holy Bible, the King James version, which was published in \n1611. And I have sworn before God and man to support and defend this, \nthe Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic. Here it is in my hand.\n  Have we grown so far, have we grown so big, have we come so far, have \nwe gained so much power, so much wisdom, so much judgment, so much \nauthority, that we can just nonchalantly push aside this dear old book \nthat holds the Constitution of the United States? No. I took that oath. \nIt was a serious oath. Every Senator in this body has taken that oath. \nEvery Senator in this body has taken that oath. It is not to be taken \nlightly.\n  Someday we will talk about the oath and how the ancient Romans \nrevered their oath, the oath they took, the oaths. But we just lightly \ncast this Constitution aside: This is an old piece of paper. Ha, that \nthing was written in 1787, and it was ratified by the few States that \nmade up this people, as we have it. It only needed to be ratified by \nnine States. That was long before our time. We are much smarter than \nthey were then. We know more now than they knew then. We are \nexperienced. We are living in the real world. The Constitution was for \nyesterday. The Constitution was for yesteryear. The Constitution was \nfor the 18th century. It was all right, still, in the 19th century. And \nfor the first half of the 20th century it was probably all right. But \nthese are different times.\n  Is that what John Marshall said? Tell that to John Marshall. I will \ntell you, folks, the thing is much deeper than this. Senators have not \nseen, really, what events will flow--and I have not, either--from our \ncreation of this Department. And I want to create a Department. But \nfrom an unconfirmed Director, a Director that is unconfirmed by the \nSenate, they will look back and say: Robert Byrd, for once, was right. \nAnd maybe just for once. Or some may be a little more lenient and \nliberal than that and say: Well, I have known a couple times he was \nright; but he was right. And those men who wrote the Constitution were \nright. They were writing a constitution that would protect the common \npeople, the people of this country, against tyranny, against unlimited \npower. They were protecting the liberties of the people.\n\n  There was no Democratic Party, there was no Republican Party when \nthose men, those 39 signers of the Constitution of the United States, \nsat down on September 17, 1787, and wrote their names on the dotted \nline.\n  Old Benjamin Franklin said: ``We shall all hang separately or we \nshall hang together.'' They pledged their fortunes, their lives--think \nof that--their sacred honor.\n  The men who signed this Declaration of Independence were committing \ntreason--treason--when they signed that Declaration of Independence. \nThey could have been taken to England, tried, and hanged, or gone to \nthe guillotine, like Charles I. It may not have been a guillotine, but \nit was certainly an accurate axman.\n  But they wrote this Constitution to create limited government, \ndivided government, with tensions separating the various Departments. \nYes, they were written on parchment, these barriers to tyranny, to \npower. And there had to be jealousy among those three Departments. It \nwas thought they would defend the prerogatives of that Department \nagainst the encroachments of another Department. That was the way it \nwas meant to be.\n  And when I came here to this Senate, there were men and one woman, \nMargaret Chase Smith, who sat right over there, where my hand is \npointing to that desk over there in the front row on the Republican \nside. Those men and one woman, what would they have said? Would they \nhave said: ``Let's go home to supper early. Let's just give it to them. \nThey have the votes''? No, not those Senators; not Styles Bridges; not \nSenator Hickenlooper; not Senator Bennett of Utah; not Senator Javits \nof New York; not George Aiken of Vermont; not Mike Mansfield of \nMontana; not Richard B. Russell of Georgia who sat at this desk; not \nWillis Robertson of Virginia; not Harry Byrd, Sr., of Virginia; not \nSenator O'Mahoney of Wyoming; not Stuart Symington of Missouri; not \nJohn McClellan of Arkansas; not William Fulbright of Arkansas; not \nEverett Dirksen of Illinois, who wanted the marigold the national \nflower; not Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who sat on this side of \nthe aisle, my side; not Olin D. Johnston of South Carolina; not Samuel \nErvin of North Carolina; not Norris Cotton of New Hampshire; no, not \nthose men and that lady who wrote her declaration of conscience as she \nsat at that desk, Margaret Chase Smith.\n\n  Those Senators on both sides of the aisle would have had none of \nthis. They wouldn't have stood still for that kind of halter to be \nplaced over their heads, for that kind of noose to be placed around \ntheir necks. They would not have stood for that.\n  We have great Senators today. I have always thought, as I have looked \nback and I have thought about the Senators we have today, how \nintellectually advanced they are. They are really smart. And a lot of \ntheir hearts are in the right place. But something happened to the \nSenate. It is too partisan anymore. It is guided too much by partisan \npolitics.\n  But back to the question at hand. There have been a lot of changes in \nthe White House, too. I don't believe that Dwight D. Eisenhower would \nhave wanted to see this. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a President who \nprayed himself. He prayed in his first inaugural address. The President \nof the United States, Dwight Eisenhower, spoke the prayer and asked for \ndivine guidance.\n  George Washington, the greatest of all, he said, no, I can't do this. \nThis is something that Congress will have to decide, when it came to \nusing the military.\n  Well, those days are gone. I say again that only an office that has \nthe authority of both the White House and the Congress can act in a way \nthat will realistically guarantee that homeland security policy will be \nfully implemented in the farthest corners of the Federal Government. \nThat man who sits down there in the White House, who will be the new \nHomeland Security Director, needs the authority of the Senate behind \nhim. He needs the constitutional authority of the confirmation by the \nSenate behind him.\n  Then he can go out and speak to the American people with the \nknowledge that he has the authority--not just the\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\nauthority of someone who has been created by an Executive order but \nsomeone whose position has been created by the Congress of the United \nStates, and he himself, as the person, has been confirmed by the Senate \nof the United States.\n  I should think that he would be viewed by the American people, if \nthey stop and think, as having more real authority if he is confirmed \nby the Senate of the United States. I have a feeling that his \ncolleagues would look upon him as somebody who is an equal over them. \nHe had to go before the Senate and answer the questions of Senators and \ncommittees, and he had to be confirmed. He had to be reported favorably \nby the committee in the Senate, and he had to stand before the bar of \njudgment, as it were, and be confirmed by the votes of the Senators. \nNot only was he appointed by the top Executive order of the land, but \nhe was confirmed by the top legislative authority in the land, the \nlegislative branch, meaning the Senate in this instance, according to \nthe Constitution.\n  By giving the new Director statutory authorities, statutory \nresponsibilities, we will ensure that he will have independent \nauthority to act from within the White House, without having to compete \nwith other advisers to secure the President's support for his \ncoordination efforts. If he is not required to be confirmed by the \nSenate, he will have to compete with other advisers who don't have to \nbe confirmed by the Senate, other staff people who don't have to be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  He will have to compete with many others who require confirmation. He \nwill have to compete with them to secure the President's support for \nhis coordination efforts because his coordination efforts, as they are \ncarried out, are going to cut across a lot of lines of authority. They \nare going to cut across lines of authority that run between and among \ntwo or more agencies, many agencies of the Government.\n  He is going to have to cut through that redtape. He is going to have \nto cut through it. What authority does he have? He is the President's \nstaff man. He is the President's adviser. Who is the President's \nadviser? Did he ever go before the people's elected representatives in \nthe Senate and get their confirmation? No.\n  Well, some of his competition does have to go before those Senators, \nhis competitors.\n  Its competitors will be other Department heads--men and women who \nhave had to come before the Senate Committee to be confirmed by the \nwhole Senate. He has to compete with them. But his confirmation would \nensure that he would have independent authority to act from within the \nWhite House. He has the authority, the stamp of approval not just of \nthe President but, more importantly, the stamp of approval of the \npeople of the United States through their elected Representatives. In \nfact, we will not only allow the Director to act independently, we will \nrequire him to do so. How about that?\n  The Director will have to follow up on the implementation of homeland \nsecurity strategy, because he will have to answer to Congress if he \ndoesn't. Also, by requiring Senate confirmation of this new Director of \nthe National Office for Combating Terrorism, Congress will ensure that \nits concerns over the implementation of homeland security strategy will \nnot be subordinated to the political agenda of the White House. Even \nwhen the President's advisers want to conceal agency mismanagement or \nshift public focus toward a war with Iraq, Congress can make sure that \nthe Director's job is getting done because Congress can ask him \ndirectly and say: All right, Mr. Director, we want to know about your \nstewardship.\n  We are all going to have to answer for our stewardship--we Senators, \nwho are viewed with contempt by many of the people in the \nadministration, who have to be confirmed by Senators. We Senators have \nto answer for our stewardship. I have answered for my stewardship many \ntimes over a political career of 56 years now, in all legislative \nbranches of government, both at the State level in both houses, and in \nboth Houses at the Federal level. I have had to answer for my \nstewardship. I have to go back every now and then and say: Here is my \nname. I want to put it up again. Here is my filing fee. I want to stand \nfor office again. I have to answer for my stewardship, and so would the \nDirector of Homeland Security have to answer to the people's \nRepresentatives for his stewardship in that office.\n  Oh, no, no, he is the President's staff man. He is the President's \nadviser. Well, he is an important adviser, and he certainly is an \nimportant staff man. He is above the grade level of ordinary staff \npeople, ordinary advisers. He should be confirmed.\n  So we will not only allow the Director to act independently, we will \nrequire him to do so. The Director will have to follow up on the \nimplementation of homeland security strategy because he will have to \nanswer to Congress if he doesn't.\n  I have only read three and a half pages thus far. I am a slow reader. \nHow did I ever get through that? Talk about poor readers, my goodness. \nI have only read three and a half pages, and I have been talking--how \nlong have I been talking, may I ask the clerk through the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The Senator has been speaking \nfor 2 hours 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. My lands, that is a lot of time. Was it 2 hours and a half?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has been \nspeaking for 2 hours 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I have just read three and a half pages. I am a slow \nreader. I had a feeling that Senators just wanted me to keep on. They \ndon't want to come over and hear this. I am trying to get their \nattention. Three and a half pages in 2 hours 15 minutes.\n\n  Mr. President, while I am speaking, it reminds me of Cicero, who was \nasked the question: ``Which of Demosthenes' speeches do you like \nbest?'' Cicero answered: ``The longest.'' That is how good Demosthenes \nwas.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Is it a question the Senator thinks I might be able to \nanswer?\n  Mr. REID. Easy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then, yes, always.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware he has spoken 2 hours 15 minutes just \nthis last round? Prior to that, he spoke for an hour. So this is \nactually 3 hours 15 minutes, other than the short quorum call after \nwhich I requested that the Senator have the floor. So, actually, it has \nbeen closer to 3 hours 15 minutes. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. BYRD. I wasn't really aware of the passage of time. Along that \nline, may I say, let me see if I can quote a little verse by someone \nelse:\n\n     The clock of life is wound but once,\n     And no man has the power to know just when the hand will \n           strike, at late or early hour.\n     Now is all the time we have, so live, love, and work with a \n           will.\n     Take no thought of tomorrow, for the clock may then be still.\n\n  Mr. REID. May the Senator ask another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the majority leader has \nauthorized me to announce that there will be no more rollcall votes \ntoday?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not aware of that. That might change my outlook.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I was thinking might be the case.\n  Mr. BYRD. That might send me home to my dear wife of 65 years and 3 \nmonths and 14 days.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask one other question. It would also send me home to \nmy wife. We were married 43 years ago today, September 12. So it is my \nanniversary today. But I don't want the Senator to feel any compulsion \nthat I should get home early.\n  Mr. BYRD. I really feel guilty in detaining the distinguished \nSenator, the very able Senator, my friend. He is one I have admired all \nthe time I have known him. I am sorry I have detained him on his \nwedding anniversary. I wish the Senator would have let me know that a \nlittle earlier.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say one more thing. I was looking for an \nopportunity. In fact, I suggested it, but they said it would be very \nunsenatorial. I was considering waving a white flag because they \nsurrendered some time ago and indicated that they had left. There was \ngoing to be a motion to table made when the Senator decided to sit \ndown, but there was a decision made that maybe that might take a long \ntime. So they decided to go home some time ago. I indicated it would be \nvery\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nunsenatorial to wave a white flag in the Senate, so I thought this \nwould be a better way of telling you there is going to be no motion to \ntable made tonight.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I see a more colorful hue as I look for it out here. My \nlittle dog's name is Trouble. My wife named the dog. Obviously, she was \nlooking at me when she named the little dog Trouble. That little dog \nTrouble loves me, but he loves my wife more.\n  My wife is in the hospital right now. I should go over to visit her. \nI am a little too late already.\n  I am trying to remember what the great Englishman, Edmund Burke, said \nabout the origin of the term ``whip.'' The ``whipper-in'' was the \nperson who kept the hound from running away from the field in the fox \nchase.\n  The English had the whip in the 14th century, certainly in the 17th \ncentury, the 1600s. The whip at that time would send what they called a \n``circular letter'' to the King's supporters, or if there was a whip in \nthe opposition, he would send a circular letter to the opponents of the \nKing and tell them to come in and meet in Parliament at a certain day \nand a certain time about a certain piece of business. That was the \nwhip. That was the English whip. That is where the whip system started.\n  The House has a whip. The Senate has not had a whip as long as the \nother body has had a whip. The Senate has a great whip in the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Nevada. I have been a whip, and \nbefore that I served under whips. I was a whip for 6 years, and I was a \ngood whip. I stayed on the Senate floor all the time.\n  But I say right here and now, as far as I am concerned, Senator Reid \nof Nevada is the best whip the Senate has ever had, notwithstanding \neven that I was a Senate whip. I served as whip when Mr. Mansfield was \nmajority leader. I put everything I had into being a whip. I stood by \nthe gate. If I had been told to guard that gate, I would have been at \nthat gate alive or dead when Mr. Mansfield came back.\n  This Senator from Nevada, as far as I am concerned, is the best whip \nwe have ever had. He is right here on this floor all the time, or \nwithin a voice from this floor. He works here on this floor. He is very \nloyal to his majority leader, and he is loyal to his duties, to his \npeople back home. He tells me every now and then he has a delegation \nfrom Nevada that he has to go and see. But this whip is here at all \ntimes, and he is here to protect me. If I to leave the floor, he will \nprotect me. I know he will. He is a good whip. He is a great whip.\n  I will take my hat off any day and say: Gunga Din, you are a better \nwhip than I am. That is saying a lot. I don't say that often. I was a \ngood whip, but the Senator is a better whip than I was because he \nprobably is more loyal to his party than I was and more loyal to his \nmajority leader than I was.\n  I stood on this floor offering an amendment during the Vietnam war to \nsay the President of the United States--who happened to be Richard \nNixon at the time--had a duty to do whatever it took. If it meant \nbombing the Vietcong across the lines in Cambodia, the President had a \nduty to do that to protect our American servicemen.\n  I offered that amendment, and my majority leader was opposed to it. I \nstood by it; I fought the fight and lost. Mr. Nixon called me on the \ntelephone that same afternoon from Camp David. He said: You did a great \nthing down there. He called me Bob. My wife does not call me Bob. She \nis kind enough to call me Robert. He said: Bob, that's a great thing \nyou did. In his words, he said: You did a statesmanlike job. You stood \nfor what you believed in, and you offered an amendment on behalf of the \nservicemen, the men in the field. You stood by what you thought, and \nyou even stood against your own party, the leadership.\n\n  That was all right, and that was well and good for me because I have \nmy own views of what is required of me. But the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada, he is not disloyal to his leader, not to the people over \nhere who elected him to his position in the Senate, nor to the people \nback in Nevada who sent him here. I salute him.\n  I will quietly fold my tent and fade away from the Chamber if he is \nabout to tell me that there will not be any more votes and that \ntomorrow, when we come back, I may have the floor again.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief comment in response to \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The plan tomorrow is to come in and we will be on the \nInterior appropriations bill until noon. Senator Daschle is planning on \nhaving a vote on a judge around 10 o'clock, and that will be by voice. \nSenator Dodd, and whoever is opposing his legislation, will debate for \na half hour, and that vote will occur at 10:15 tomorrow morning. \nTomorrow morning, we will be on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I, frankly, do not think we can work anything out on forest fire \nsuppression. I will try, but I do not think it can be done. So the \nleader has to make a decision as to whether he is going to file cloture \non the Craig amendment. We may have to do that tomorrow.\n  At noon, we will go back to this bill. I have been told that the \nSenators who offered this amendment, Senators Graham and Lieberman, are \nconsidering withdrawing the amendment, which would leave the amendment \npending being the Thompson amendment which, of course, will be subject \nto another amendment.\n  That will be the status at noon tomorrow, if the leader decided to \nwork on this bill Friday afternoon. As the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia knows, Friday afternoons are really tough to get things \ndone around here. We are going to have votes tomorrow, one on the judge \nand one on the Dodd amendment.\n  Before signing off, I say to my friend, the Senator's comments did \nnot go unnoticed. I am flattered and a little embarrassed, but I do \nappreciate very much what the Senator said. As I have said publicly and \nprivately, every day that I have been able to serve in the Congress and \nthe Senate with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is a day I \nconsider to be very lucky. To think someone from where I came could be \non the same floor as a Senator speaking with the great Robert Byrd is \ndifficult for me to imagine.\n  I understand the importance of the job I have. I appreciate very much \nthe statements of the Senator. But that is our plan for tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Democratic whip. I am very \nwilling to take my tent and fold it silently and slip away.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate next takes up homeland \nsecurity----\n  Mr. REID. Which will be tomorrow at noon or thereabouts.\n  Mr. BYRD.--I be recognized at that time.\n  Mr. REID. I am the only one in the Chamber and I certainly would not \nobject to that. I do not think anyone from the minority is present, and \nthey do not have any basis for objecting anyway. The Senator has the \nfloor now.\n  We would attempt tomorrow morning--of course, the Senator is the \nmanager of the other bill. We would attempt during that period of time \nto see what we can work out on this homeland security bill so we can \nattempt to move forward in some way, because certainly what we do not \nwant, at least tomorrow, is to be in a position where we have to file \ncloture. I do not think that is necessary.\n  We will be happy to meet with the Senator tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate next goes to S. 5005, \nthe first recognition be given to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech I \nhave made not be counted as a speech under the two-speech rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say to the distinguished Senator, I am quite happy to \ngo home. These old legs of mine have been carrying me around now for a \nlong time. I always had heard that when one gets to be up in years a \nlittle bit, the feet and the legs first start to trouble one. So I can \nbear witness to that.\n  In case there are any Senators who think the distinguished majority \nwhip did wrongly in saying we could go home if the Senator would take a \nseat, let me say I have only spoken 2 hours and 15 minutes--is that \naccurate?\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Three hours and 15 minutes. Now it is about 3 \\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I am only on page 3 of page 4. Well, that is just a \nstart. As John Paul Jones said, ``We have just begun to fight.''\n  I have in my pocket the Constitution of the United States and the \nDeclaration of Independence. Once I finished page 4 tonight, I intended \nto start reading the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution \nof the United States to follow.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I do not think he would have to read \nit, would he?\n  Mr. BYRD. I think reading it makes it better.\n  Mr. REID. Does not the Senator have that memorized anyway?\n  Mr. BYRD. I know something about the Constitution, but I will save \nthat for another day. I have a number of poems which I would be glad to \nquote even though these old legs are getting tired. Shall I quote one?\n  Mr. REID. I personally would like to hear a poem.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I never was a show-off so I am not going to \nquote any poetry tonight. That would be showing off. I just wanted the \nSenator to know I could quote some poems. I can read the Constitution \nand comment on it as I go along. I can read the Declaration of \nIndependence. I can read the Bible. I can read Milton's ``Paradise \nLost.'' I could read Carlyle's ``History of the French Revolution.'' I \ncould even read Daniel Defoe's ``Robinson Caruso.'' Just because my \nlegs are hurting and I am growing quite frail and my voice is a little \nweak, I am not quite ready to say, well, they have the votes and let us \nquit.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Democratic whip. The Senator knows I am \ngetting tired, which is the reason I am not saying things just right.\n  Let me see if there is anything else for which I need consent. I \nbelieve not, but it is my understanding that I will be recognized when \nthe Senate next returns to the homeland security legislation. I thank \nthe Chair and I thank the whip.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not think a good steward would want to \nleave his job unfinished quite so abruptly. I do have a half page of my \nprepared remarks to read. I do not like to put items in the Record, so, \nif I may, I ask unanimous consent that again this not be counted as a \nsecond speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. By requiring Senate confirmation of this new Director of \nthe National Office for Combating Terrorism, Congress will ensure that \nits concerns over the implementation of homeland security strategy will \nnot be subordinated to the political agenda of the White House.\n  Remember, we are not just talking about a Director of Homeland \nSecurity under the Bush administration. We are not just talking about a \nDirector of Homeland Security under a Republican administration. There \ncan very well come a time there will be a Director of Homeland Security \nunder a Democratic administration, and I hope the Senators will see the \nwisdom in looking forward to a time when the worm will turn, the wheel \nwill turn, and there will be a Democrat in the White House.\n  I am thinking of Senate confirmation as something that will be \nimportant under a Democratic administration as well as under a \nRepublican administration, as important to the people of this country \nunder a Democratic President as under a Republican President, under Mr. \nBush. For the moment, it is a Republican President. A thousand years is \nbut a day in God's reach. And there will probably be a Department of \nHomeland Security after my life on this globe has run its span.\n  The war against terrorism may not end soon. It may go on and on. Who \nknows? The President himself has said it will not be quick, it will not \nbe easy, and it will not be short. Therefore, it is not difficult to \nimagine that there will come a day when there will be a Democratic \nPresident in the White House, and I say that my Republicans friends, \nwhen that time comes, will be glad if we in our day have required the \nDirector of Homeland Security to be confirmed by the Senate.\n  So we are not legislating for a day, a week, or the remaining 2 years \nof this Republican administration. We are debating and acting for a \nlong time.\n  Once this is on the statute books, it is not easy to change it \nbecause a President can veto a change. If Congress sees the unwisdom of \nits ways today and seeks to change the statute books, maybe a President \nin the White House would veto that bill if it came to his desk. So its \neasier, in a way, to make a law than it is to change a law, in some \ninstances. We had better do it right the first time, rather than just \ndo it fast. Do it right. That is what I am seeking to do.\n\n  Even when the President's advisers want to conceal the agency \nmismanagement or shift public focus toward a war with Iraq, Congress \ncan make sure that the Director's job is getting done because Congress \ncan ask him directly. So I tell my colleagues that I understand their \ndesire to style the statutory office by yielding to the urge that I \nknow some Members do.\n  Let's do it right. There may be a different administration, maybe a \ndifferent party at the White House, Mr. Bush may not be at the White \nHouse at that time, I may not be at my desk. Let's do it right. Let's \ndo it the way we ought to do it. If the war on terror is to be with us \na long time, a Director of Homeland Security will be with us a long \ntime, and Tom Ridge, if he is to be the Director in the future, even he \nmay be gone and another Director may stand in his stead.

Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I firmly believe that the issue of Iraq is not about \npolitics. It's about national security. We know that for at least 20 \nyears, Saddam Hussein has aggressively and obsessively sought weapons \nof mass destruction through every means available. We\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\nknow that he has chemical and biological weapons today. He has used \nthem in the past, and he is doing everything he can to build more. Each \nday he inches closer to his longtime goal of nuclear capability--a \ncapability that could be less than a year away.\n  I believe that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime represents a clear \nthreat to the United States, to our allies, to our interests around the \nworld, and to the values of freedom and democracy we hold dear.\n  Saddam has proven his willingness to act irrationally and brutally \nagainst his neighbors and against his own people. Iraqi's destructive \ncapacity has the potential to throw the entire Middle East into chaos, \nand poses a mortal threat to our vital ally, Israel.\n  What's more, the terrorist threat against America is all too clear. \nThousands of terrorist operatives around the world would pay anything \nto get their hands on Saddam's arsenal, and there is every possibility \nthat he could turn his weapons over to these terrorists. No one can \ndoubt that if the terrorists of September 11 had had weapons of mass \ndestruction, they would have used them. On September 12, 2002, we can \nhardly ignore the terrorist threat, and the serious danger that Saddam \nwould allow his arsenal to be used in aid of terror.\n  Iraq has continued to develop its arsenal in definance of the \ncollective will of the international community, as expressed through \nthe United Nations Security Council. It is violating the terms of the \ncease-fire that ended the Gulf War and ignoring as many as 16 U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions--including 11 resolutions concerning \nIraq's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  These U.N. resolutions are not unilateral American demands. They \ninvolve obligations Iraq has undertaken to the international community. \nBy ignoring them. Saddam Hussein is undermining the credibility of the \nUnited Nations, openly violating international law, and making a \nmockery of the very idea of international collective action which is so \nimportant to the United States and our allies.\n  The time has come for decisive action. With our allies, we must do \nwhatever is necessary to guard against the threat posed by an Iraq \narmed with weapons of mass destruction, and under the thumb of Saddam \nHussein. The United States must lead an international effort to remove \nthe regime of Saddam Hussein and to assure that Iraq fulfills its \nobligations to the international community.\n  This is not an easy decision, and its carries many risks. It will \nalso carry costs, certainly in resources, and possibly in lives. After \ncareful consideration, I believe that the risk of inaction is far \ngreater than the risk of action.\n  As we set out on this course, we must be as conscious of our special \nresponsibility as we are confident in the rightness of our cause.\n  The United States has a special role of leadership in the \ninternational community. As America and its allies move down this path, \nwe must do so in a way that preserves the legitimacy of our actions, \nenhances international consensus, and strengthens our global \nleadership.\n  First, this means making the strongest possible case to the American \npeople about the danger Saddam poses. Months of mixed messages, high-\nlevel speculation and news-leaks about possible military plans have \ncaused widespread concern among many Americans and around the world.\n  I am encouraged that the President has overruled some of his advisors \nand decided to ask for the support of Congress. From the support of \nCongress, this effort will derive even greater and more enduring \nstrength.\n  Second, the Administration must do as much as possible to rally the \nsupport of the international community under the mandate of the United \nNations Security Council. We should tap into the strengths of existing \nalliances like NATO to enforce such a mandate. And let me be clear: \nAmerica's allies deserve more than just token consultation. The Bush \nadministration must make a full-court press to rally global support, \nmuch like the impressive effort President Bush's father made to rally \nthe first international coalition against Saddam in the fall of 1990. \nIf they do, I believe they will succeed.\n  If, however, the United Nations Security Council is prevented from \nsupporting this effort, then we must act with as many allies as \npossible to ensure that Iraq meets its obligations to existing Security \nCouncil resolutions. After all, that's what the U.S. and its NATO \nallies did during the 1999 war in Kosovo, when a U.N. Security Council \nresolution was impossible.\n  Third, we must be honest with the American people about the \nextraordinary commitment this task entails. It is likely to cost us \nmuch in the short-term, and it is certain to demand our attention and \ncommitment for the long-haul. We have to show the world that we are \nprepared to do what it takes to help rebuild a post-Saddam Iraq and \ngive the long-suffering Iraqi people the chance to live under freedom.\n  Working with our allies, we have to be prepared to deal with the \nconsequences of success--helping to provide security inside Iraq after \nSaddam is gone, working with the various Iraqi opposition groups in \nshaping a new government, reassuring Iraq's neighbors about its future \nstability, and supporting the Iraqi people as they rebuild their lives. \nThis is a massive undertaking, and we must pursue it with no illusions.\n  Ensuring that Iraq complies with its commitments to the international \ncommunity is the mission of the moment. Rebuilding Iraq and helping it \nevolve into a democracy at peace with itself and its neighbors will be \nthe mission of many years.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's record to date gives me cause for \nconcern. They must not make the same mistakes in post-Saddam Iraq that \nthey are making in post-Taliban Afghanistan, where they have been \ndangerously slow in making the real commitment necessary to help \ndemocracy take root and flourish.\n  Finally, the administration must show that its actions against Iraq \nare part of a broader strategy to strengthen American security around \nthe world.\n  We must address the most insidious threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction--the threat that comes from the ability of terrorists to \nobtain them. We must do much more to support the many disarmament \nprograms already in place to dismantle weapons and prevent access to \nweapons-grade materials in Russia and the former Soviet states; we must \nfully fund Nunn-Lugar; and we should work hard to forge international \ncoalition to prevent proliferation.\n  We must be fully and continuously engaged to help resolve the crisis \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians. Disengagement was a mistake. The \nUnited States cannot deliver peace to the parties, but no agreement is \npossible without our active involvement.\n  We also must have a national strategy for energy security, working to \nstrengthen relationships with new suppliers and doing more to develop \nalternative sources of power.\n  And we must do far more to promote democracy throughout the Arab \nworld. We should examine our overall engagement in the entire region, \nand employ the same kinds of tools that we used to win the battle of \nideas fought during the Cold War, from vigorous public diplomacy to \nassistance for democratic reform at the grassroots.\n  The path of confronting Saddam is full of hazards. But the path of \ninaction is far more dangerous. This week, a week where we remember the \nsacrifice of thousands of innocent Americans made on 9/11, the choice \ncould not be starker. Had we known that such attacks were imminent, we \nsurely would have used every means at our disposal to prevent them and \ntake out the plotters. We cannot wait for such a terrible event--or, if \nweapons of mass destruction are used, one far worse--to address the \nclear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8554-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8554-S8555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SEPTEMBER 11 REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, yesterday we marked the anniversary of one \nof the most horrific events in our Nation's history. On September 11 of \nlast year, without provocation or warning, extremists took control of \nfour of our planes and used them as weapons of destruction against us \nto cowardly take from our lives our friends and neighbors, our mothers \nand fathers, and our sons and daughters.\n  As we watched those events unfold, during the subsequent rescue \nattempts,\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\nwe saw more of our Nation's brave men and women lose their lives in the \nsupport and defense of others. It was not only a terrible loss of life. \nIt was a loss of our most vital and valuable resource, our Nation's \npeople and the potential they carried within them for greatness in so \nmany different fields and endeavors of importance to them and to us.\n  As we watched the images broadcast around the world, we all made a \ndecision in our hearts to do everything we could to respond to the \nattack on our nation, our freedom, our liberty and our way of life. For \neach of us it meant something different, but for all of us, it helped \nto know there was something we could all do to help.\n  For Congress, that meant expressing our strongest support for the \nPresident and his ambitious and necessary plan to end the global \nnetwork of terror that has sown the seeds of despair and hatred \nwherever it has found fertile ground. The President's plan is to do \nmore than defeat the forces of terror. It is to replace those seeds of \nanger and hatred with seeds of hope and peace.\n  For our Nation's Armed Forces, it meant answering the call to duty \nand taking arms against an enemy who placed no value on human life.\n  The rules of war are not many, but one unavoidable one is that it \ntakes the lives of our young men and women. One of those we lost in the \nearly stages of the war was one of Wyoming's own, Jonn Edmunds, an Army \nRanger from Cheyenne, who gave his life in Afghanistan as he fought and \ndied for a cause that he believed in.\n  For all Americans, it meant an awakening of our sense of patriotism \nand our love of country, as we put aside our differences and unfurled \nour flags and proudly displayed them on our porches and windows. We \ncame together as one, united, in support of our leaders and our \nPresident.\n  We know from past experience that the effort to respond to challenges \nlike this is not a quick or easy one. It takes a lengthy and determined \ncommitment to principle if we are to succeed.\n  I have no doubt our resolve will remain strong and we will be united \nin purpose, as we have done before when called to respond to a threat \nto our way of life.\n  A little over fifty years ago, on a day that has been compared to \nthis one, those who opposed us were heard to say after their attack \nthat they may have done nothing more than awaken a sleeping giant. On \nthat day in December and this one in September, we may have been a \nsleeping giant, but when the time came to respond, we did, and by so \ndoing, we changed the world.\n  We have to respond with strength and determination because those who \nattacked us chose their targets with such clear and evil intent. They \nattacked the World Trade Center, because of its symbolic representation \nof our economic power. They attacked the Pentagon because of its \nsymbolic representation of the power of our military. And they sought \nto attack our Nation's capital because it is the heart of our \ngovernment and it represents our democracy and our way of life.\n  No one will ever forget where they were or what they were doing as \nthey first heard the news of the terrorist attack on our Nation. We all \nsat and watched in stunned silence as events unfolded that are now \nforever etched in our mind.\n  In the days that have passed since then, we have kept alive the \nmemory of those we lost, repaired and restored what we could, and made \nplans to recreate what could not be saved. It has been a difficult and \ndaunting task.\n  Through it all the President has led a united Nation, committed to \nending the threat of terrorism, not just for us, but for our children, \nand for all the children of the world who deserve to grow up and pursue \na dream of peace, hope and opportunity.\n  When the terrorists struck at the heart of our Nation that day they \ntook something more precious than our buildings, and the symbols of \nAmerican pride and ingenuity we all hold dear. When they took our loved \nones from us, they also took the innocence of our children who had to \nlearn quickly, and at a young and tender age, that there are bad people \nin the world who do bad things. And that all too often, bad things \nhappen to good people.\n  But, when they looked at us with questioning eyes, did any of us have \na good answer to the question they wanted answered the most, ``Why?''\n  Fortunately, the President's leadership has enabled him to put \ntogether an international coalition dedicated to dismantling the \nnetwork of terror and to bringing those responsible to justice, \nwherever they may try to hide.\n  The conspiracy of terrorism can only survive in the darkness of \nhatred. It can not long survive when we bring the light of peace to \nbear on all the Nations of the world. That light is the symbol of \nfreedom that our Statue of Liberty holds proudly and with purpose in \nthe harbor of New York, not far from where the Twin Towers once stood. \nIt is a light that will someday shine for everyone in every country in \nthe world, and we will all live in peace and freedom.\n  We are, and always will be, a Nation of individuals. We all have our \nown stories, our own goals and ambitions, and our own plans for our \nlives. But, when faced with a crisis, as we were last year, we come \ntogether as one united in our commitment that no one will ever have to \nendure a tragedy as terrible as the events that unfolded last year.\n  Yesterday was a day of remembrance. It will always be so. May it \nserve as a constant reminder that we are one Nation, under God, with \nliberty and justice for all.\n  The lives of all those who were lost are like an unfinished symphony \nthat has been left to us to continue and complete. We carry their \ndreams, their hopes, their ambitions, their challenges and their plans \nfor the future with us. With God's strength and the support of each of \nus we will complete the work they started and ensure the safety and \nsecurity of all people, of all countries, and of all regions of the \nworld for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8555-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8555-S8557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CBO ESTIMATES ON REPORTED BILLS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1777, the \n     International Disability and Victims of Landmines, Civil \n     Strife, and Warfare Assistance Act of 2002.\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Joseph C. \n     Whitehill, who can be reached at 226-2840, and Jeanne M.

Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 1777--International Disability and Victims of Landmines, \n         Civil Strife, and Warfare Assistance Act of 2002\n       Summary: S. 1777 would authorize the President to furnish \n     assistance to individuals with disabilities in foreign \n     countries, including victims of landmines and other war \n     injuries. The bill also would authorize the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide such \n     assistance, and would authorize the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to provide advice and expertise to U.S. agencies \n     and private voluntary agencies undertaking such programs. \n     Currently, the U.S. Agency for International Development \n     (USAID), the CDC, and VA provide some assistance in this area \n     under more general authority. CBO estimates that implementing \n     S. 1777 would cost about $4 million over the 2003-2005 \n     period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. \n     Because S. 1777 would not affect direct spending or receipts, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       S. 1777 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: For this \n     estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be enacted \n     near the beginning of fiscal year 2003, that the estimated \n     amounts will be appropriated each year, and that outlays will \n     follow historical spending patterns. The budgetary impact of \n     S. 1777 is shown in the following table. The costs of this \n     legislation fall within budget\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n     functions 550 (Health) and 700 (veterans benefits and \n     services).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal year, in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        2003   2004   2005   2006   2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated authorization level........      2      2      0      0      0\nEstimated outlays....................      1      2      1      0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of estimate: S. 1777 would authorize the President to \n     furnish assistance to individuals with disabilities in \n     foreign countries, including victims of landmines and other \n     war injuries. Under more general authorities in current law, \n     USAID, the CDC, and VA provide roughly $15 million a year in \n     assistance in this area. The bill would expand current \n     programs.\n       U.S. Agency for International Development.--Section 3 would \n     authorize assistance to individuals with disabilities, \n     including victims of landmines and other victims of warfare \n     and civil strife. USAID currently provides such assistance, \n     primarily through the Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, with a \n     funding level of $10 million each year. CBO estimates that \n     under S. 1777, funding for individuals with disabilities \n     would continue at that rate.\n       Centers for Disease Control.--Section 4 would authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary in fiscal \n     years 2003 and 2004 for the CDC to conduct programs in \n     foreign countries for individuals with disabilities, \n     including persons injured by landmines and civil strife. \n     Those programs could include research on trauma and \n     rehabilitation, evaluating treatment interventions, \n     developing medical instruction tools for responding to \n     traumatic injuries, and facilitating and training peer-\n     support networks. The bill would authorize the CDC to provide \n     grants to nongovernmental organizations to carry out \n     research, prevention activities, and public awareness \n     campaigns, as well as other activities to share information \n     about research on limb loss and best practices in treatment \n     programs.\n       Under current law, the CDC provides $5 million a year for \n     some of the activities authorized by the bill, most of which \n     are directed toward a network for victims of landmines. S. \n     1777 would authorize the CDC to carry out additional \n     activities such as trauma research and evaluation of medical \n     treatments. According to the CDC, those additional activities \n     would require $2 million a year in additional funding. Thus, \n     CBO estimates that the bill would increase agency spending by \n     $4 million over the 2003-2005 period, subject to \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       Department of Veterans Affairs.--Section 5 would authorize \n     VA to provide advice and expertise to federal agencies and \n     technical assistance to private voluntary organizations \n     (PVOs) with respect to planning, development, operation, and \n     evaluation of landmine assistance, research, and prevention \n     programs. The VA currently provides advice to other federal \n     agencies on a nonreimbursable basis. The bill would authorize \n     VA to provide technical assistance to PVOs on a reimbursable \n     basis. Based on information from VA, CBO estimates the cost \n     and collections from providing this technical assistance \n     would be less than $500,000 a year.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1777 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state, \n     local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On November 8, 2001, CBO prepared an \n     estimate for H.R. 3169, the International Disability and \n     Victims of Landmines, Civil Strife, and Warfare Assistance \n     Act of 2001, as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     International Relations on November 1, 2001. That bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of $15 million in 2002 and 2003 \n     for programs to assist individuals with disabilities, \n     including victims of landmines and other victims of warfare \n     and civil strife administered by USAID and such sums as may \n     be necessary in 2002-2004 for the CDC. H.R. 3169 also would \n     authorize VA to provide advice and expertise to federal \n     agencies and technical assistance to PVOs with respect to \n     planning, development, operation, and evaluation of landmine \n     programs. CBO's estimate of the costs associated with the CDC \n     and VA programs are the same in both bills.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal spending: USAID--Joseph C. \n     Whitehill (226-2840), CDC--Jeanne M.

Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n     H.R. 2121--Russia Democracy Act of 2002\n       Summary: H.R. 2121 would expand the U.S. government's \n     authority to provide assistance to democratic institutions \n     and media in Russia and would authorize the appropriation of \n     $50 million in 2003 for programs to strengthen the rule of \n     law and an independent media in that country. (In 2002, \n     appropriations for various types of assistance to the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union totaled $784 \n     million.) Assuming the appropriation of the authorized \n     amount, CBO estimates that implementing the act would cost \n     about $50 million over the 2003-2007 period. Enacting H.R. \n     2121 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       H.R. 2121 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 2121 is shown in the following \n     table. The estimate assumes that the authorized amount would \n     be appropriated and that outlays would follow historical \n     spending patterns for similar activities. The costs of this \n     legislation fall within budget function 150 (international \n     affairs).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nAuthorization level...........      0     50      0      0      0      0\nEstimated outlays.............      0      9     21     11      5      2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 2121 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state, \n     local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On November 6, 2001, CBO prepared an \n     estimate for H.R. 2121 as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on International Relations on November 1, 2001. \n     That earlier version of the legislation would have authorized \n     the appropriation of $50 million in 2002.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Joseph C.

Those \n     individuals work or study in the United States for up to \n     three years. This program is currently scheduled to terminate \n     on October 1, 2005. H.R. 4558 would extend it until October \n     1, 2006.\n       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4558 would cost about \n     $4 million in fiscal year 2006 for the Department of State to \n     administer this program, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations. Enacting the legislation also would affect \n     direct spending and receipts, but CBO estimates that any such \n     effects would not be significant. Because the act would \n     effect direct spending and receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply.\n       H.R. 4558 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 4558 is shown in the following \n     table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     functions 150 (international affairs) and 750 (administration \n     of justice).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2002   2003   2004   2005   2006   2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending under current law:\n    Estimated authorization         4      4      4      4      0      0\n     level \\1\\................\n    Estimated outlays.........      4      4      4      4      0      0\nProposed changes:\n    Estimated authorization         0      0      0      0      4      0\n     level....................\n    Estimated outlays.........      0      0      0      0      4      0\nSpending under H.R. 4558:\n    Estimated authorization         4      4      4      4      4      0\n     level....................\n    Estimated outlays.........      4      4      4      4      4      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2002 level is the amount appropriated for that year for the\n  Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program. The estimated\n  authorization levels for 2003 through 2005 are CBO baseline estimates.\n\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\n       Since the program's inception, there have been about 250 \n     participants each year. Thus, CBO estimates that any effects \n     on fees collected by the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service (INS) or the State Department as a result of \n     extending the program would be insignificant. INS fees are \n     classified as offsetting receipts (a credit against direct \n     spending), and the State Department fees are classified as \n     governmental receipts (i.e., revenues).\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act specifies pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and \n     receipts. Those procedures would apply to H.R. 4558 because \n     it would affect both direct spending and receipts, but CBO \n     estimates that the annual amount of such changes would not be \n     significant.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: H.R. 4558 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On July 22, 2002, CBO transmitted a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 4558 as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on the Judiciary on July 17, 2002. The two versions \n     of the legislation are identical, as are our cost estimates.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Mark Grabowicz (226-\n     2860); impact on state, local, and tribal governments: Angela \n     Seitz (225-3220); impact on the private sector: Paige Piper/\n     Bach (226-2960).\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in July 2000 \nin San Diego, CA. Four Mexican migrants were attacked and shot with \npellet guns. The assailants, several neo-Nazi skinheads, chased the \nvictims, beat them, and shot them with high-powered pellet guns. Two of \nthe victims had to have the pellets surgically removed. Police \ninvestigated the incident as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8557-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SPEECH OF YASSER ARAFAT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, Palestinian leader Yasser \nArafat delivered a speech to the Palestinian Legislative Council that I \nfound extremely disappointing.\n  The speech, which was given Monday, did not outline specific steps to \nend terrorism against the Israeli people and did not offer any new \nideas on how to achieve peace in the Middle East. As one senior \nEuropean diplomat said, ``It was a very shallow speech, repeating the \nstandard phrases he's used for years now.''\n  Perhaps most disturbing of all was Yasser Arafat's outright refusal \nto call for an end to the practice of suicide bombings, even after his \nown interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, said that all Palestinians \nshould abandon suicide attacks. The omission is especially glaring \ngiven that drafts of the speech made available to the media beforehand \nexplicitly called for the parliament to outlaw suicide bombings against \ncivilians. As someone who has continually worked to rally international \nsupport against this disgraceful practice, I am greatly saddened that \nYasser Arafat did not have the courage to call for a complete ban on \nsuicide bombings.\n  Given this most recent failure of Yasser Arafat, I want to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues a report issued by Amnesty International \ntitled ``Without Distinction--Attacks on Civilians by Palestinian Armed \nGroups.'' This report, which was released just weeks before the August \nrecess, documents 128 attacks between September 29, 2000 and May 31, \n2002 in which 338 civilians were killed. In the press release issued \nwith the report, William Schultz, Executive Director of Amnesty \nInternational USA, says, ``there is no justification for attacking \ncivilians, and Palestinian leaders must clearly state that all such \nattacks must cease, whether they take place in Israel, the West Bank or \nGaza.'' I ask unanimous consent that the entire press release be \nprinted in the Record. The full report can be found on the Internet at \nhttp://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/israel__and__occupied__territories/\nindex.html.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Amnesty International, July 11, 2002]\n\n           Israel/Occupied Territories/Palestinian Authority\n\n       Washington, DC.--In a report released today, Amnesty \n     International condemned attacks by Palestinian armed groups \n     against civilians as crimes against humanity and possible war \n     crimes, and called for the perpetrators to be arrested and \n     prosecuted.\n       ``There is no justification for attacking civilians, and \n     Palestinian leaders must clearly state that all such attacks \n     must cease, whether they take place in Israel, the West Bank \n     or Gaza,'' said William F. Schulz, Executive Director of \n     Amnesty International USA (AIUSA). ``Action must then follow \n     words, with those responsible for these attacks arrested and \n     brought to justice in line with international human rights \n     standards.''\n       Amnesty International examined 128 attacks between \n     September 29, 2000 and May 31, 2002 in which 338 civilians \n     were killed. Based on analysis of the attacks and the armed \n     groups claiming responsibility, Amnesty International \n     concludes that the attacks are widespread, systemic, and part \n     of an explicit policy of attacking civilians. Those \n     individuals who order, plan, or carry out such attacks are \n     therefore guilty of crimes against humanity, and the attacks \n     may constitute war crimes. Attacks on civilians are expressly \n     prohibited by the Geneva Conventions and the principles of \n     international humanitarian law.\n       The report profiles the groups claiming responsibility for \n     these attacks and reviews the statements of their leaders and \n     officials. For example, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, formed \n     by Fatah members in 2000, has claimed responsibility for 23 \n     attacks. Marwan Barghouti, Secretary General of Fatah, stated \n     to Amnesty International that Fatah considers that Israelis \n     in the West Bank and Gaza are not civilians because ``it is \n     all in occupied country.'' Amnesty International asserts that \n     international law prohibits attacks on civilians wherever \n     they are.\n       Despite an obligation to investigate and prosecute the \n     perpetrators of attacks on civilians, many of the detentions \n     of alleged members of armed groups by the Palestinian \n     Authority appear to be motivated by considerations other than \n     a genuine concern to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n       ``The Palestinian Authority has the responsibility to stop \n     attacks by Palestinian armed groups and claims that the \n     Palestinian Authority has acted with due diligence to stop \n     these attacks lack credibility,'' said Marty Rosenbluth, \n     AIUSA's Country Specialist for Israel, the Occupied \n     Territories and the Palestinian Authority. ``However, the \n     investigation and prosecution of those responsible must not \n     result in further violations. To date, the measures taken by \n     both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have included \n     torture and violations of the right to a fair trial.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, Yasser Arafat had the \nopportunity to follow the advice of Dr. Schultz and strongly state that \nterrorist attacks, including suicide bombings, must end. Unfortunately, \nYasser Arafat has again fallen short of what he must do so that peace \ncan be achieved in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8557-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8557-S8558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am proud to take this \nopportunity to recognize the period beginning on September 15 and \nending on October 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. This month celebrates \nthe rich and varied heritage of Hispanics in the United States, who \ncome from as far away as South America and the islands of the \nCaribbean, and as nearby as our neighbor to the south, Mexico. I urge \nall Americans to\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\ntake this opportunity to learn more about the culture and important \ncontributions Hispanics have made and continue to make to the United \nStates.\n  It is fitting that what originally started out as Hispanic Heritage \nWeek in September of 1968 has been lengthened to a month-long \ncelebration of the culture and contributions of Hispanics to the \nAmerican experience. This is in large part a reflection of the growing \nprominence of Hispanics in all sectors of American society. As a U.S. \nSenator, though, I am especially interested and encouraged by the \ngrowing role Hispanics are playing in our Nation's government.\n  Hispanics have a long history of service to the United States as \nelected officials. The first Hispanic to serve in the Congress was \nDelegate Joseph Marion Hernandez of the Territory of Florida in 1822. \nThe first Hispanic elected from a State was Romualdo Pacheco of \nCalifornia, who won his race by one vote in 1876. Dennis Chavez of New \nMexico became the first Hispanic Senator after being elected in 1936.\n  In recent years, Hispanic women have also successfully been elected \nto the Congress. In 1988, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen became both the first \nCuban-American and first Hispanic woman elected to serve in the House \nof Representatives. Four years later, she was joined in the House by \nLydia Velasquez, the first Puerto Rican woman, and Lucille Roybal-\nAllard, the first Mexican-American woman. I am pleased that the number \nof Hispanics now serving in the House of Representatives has more than \ndoubled in the years from 1984 to 2000, from 9 to 21, and I look \nforward to working with Hispanic colleagues in the Senate as well.\n  Government is not the only area where Hispanics are breaking new \nground. Hispanics are enriching all aspects of our Nation's cultural \nand economic life. Hispanic entrepreneurs, who open up small businesses \nat a higher rate than that of the general population, fuel our economy \nand create jobs. Hispanic writers, such as Isabel Allende, are not only \nenriching our literature, but are also redefining the American \nexperience through their novels, such as Portrait of Sepia and Daughter \nof Fortune. Hispanic labor leaders, following in the footsteps of Cesar \nChavez, continue to fight for livable wages and safe working \nconditions. Roberto Clemente, an athlete and humanitarian, who died \nwhile delivering much-needed relief supplies to Central America, was \nthe first Hispanic elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame following a \nstellar career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Hispanics have also served \nhonorably in every military engagement since the Revolutionary War--38 \nhave earned the military's highest decoration for their bravery, the \nMedal of Honor. Louis Caldera, the eldest son of Mexican immigrants, \nfollowed in this tradition of military service and became the first \nHispanic Secretary of the Army from 1998-2001.\n  As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, let us take the time to \nlearn more about these and other Hispanic leaders. But let us also take \na moment to recognize the many hardworking Hispanic members of our own \ncommunities as well. Let us welcome them when they are new arrivals and \nensure that our diversity remains one of our greatest strengths. Their \ncontributions serve to enrich our common culture and we are all the \nbetter for it. The truest testimony of our greatness as a nation is the \nenduring power of the American Dream and the sacrifices people \neverywhere are willing to make to attain it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8558-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION FOR INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL \n                           WORKERS LOCAL 309\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \ncentennial of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local \n309 in Collinsville, IL. On September 11, 1902, eleven electrical \nworkers from my hometown of East St. Louis, IL committed to support a \nunited labor effort by forming their own local chapter. Despite the \ndangers in developing the electrical industry, the group continued its \nwork and advanced to become highly trained and skilled journeymen.\n  The group has grown from its eleven original members to 1,100 and has \nhelped shape the Metro-east and surrounding areas of southern Illinois. \nLocal 309 has been a leader in the electrical industry, with \nadvancements in training, organizing, market recovery, and member \nservices. Its apprentice program has been registered in the United \nStates Department of Labor Bureau of Apprenticeship and has been \nproducing skilled and experienced workers for the past 100 years. It \ncontinues to show its commitment to the education of its members in \nthis, its centennial year.\n  Through their expertise and solidarity, today's members of Local 309 \ncontinue the legacy of their founders by uniting the electrical workers \nof southern Illinois under the common goals of fairness, justice, and \nleadership in their field.\n  Congratulations to the members of Local 309 on their centennial \ncelebration. Best wishes for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8558-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL KIDS VOTING WEEK\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize Kids Voting USA and its efforts to educate our children about \ncivic participation, democracy, and the electoral process. Kids Voting \nUSA is an organization that began in my State, but now reaches nearly \nfive million students nationwide.\n  What began as a fishing trip to Costa Rica by three Arizona \nbusinessmen has blossomed into an organization that involves 9,000 \nschools, 200,000 teachers, 80,000 volunteers, and countless sponsors \nand donors. With 38 States and more than 140 communities across the \nNation participating, Kids Voting USA teaches students from \nkindergarten through high school about the importance of civic \nparticipation and their rights and responsibilities as citizens. \nThrough an acclaimed, interactive core of service-based curricula, \nyoung people gain the knowledge, skills, and motivation for democratic \nliving.\n  Combined with a civics education, students participate in local and \nnational elections in communities across the country. Kids Voting USA \nenables students to visit official polls on election day, accompanied \nby a parent or guardian, to cast a ballot that replicates the official \nballot. During the last national election, more than 1.5 million \nstudents voted as part of the Kids Voting USA program. In last year's \nlocal elections students actively participated in over 114 cities, \ncounties, and school districts.\n  This year, National Kids Voting Week is September 11-17, and will \ncoincide with the inauguration of National Civic Participation Week.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 15th \nanniversary of one of the largest and most successful public/private \npartnerships in health care in the developing world, the Merck MECTIZAN \nDonation Program. Today, this program provides hope to millions, and I \nam proud to pay tribute to Merck & Co., a leading New Jersey \ncorporation, for its work on this critical issue.\n  On October 21, 1987, Merck & Co., Inc. announced plans to donate \nMECTIZAN, ivermectin, a medicine Merck discovered to combat river \nblindness, for as long as it might be needed, wherever needed. \nOnchocerciasis, ``river blindness'', is a leading cause of blindness in \nthe developing world. It is a debilitating and disfiguring disease, \naffecting millions in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Central and South \nAmerica and Yemen in the Middle East. The disease, which has infected \n18 million people and has left an estimated one million people visually \nimpaired or blind, is caused by parasitic worms that infiltrate, \nmultiply, and spread throughout the human body.\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\n  In the global fight against infectious diseases, the lack of public \nhealth infrastructure contributes to widespread and needless suffering \neven when valuable drug treatments are available for use. When Merck \nmade the decision to donate MECTIZAN to treat river blindness, the \ncompany understood that while providing the drug for free was \nnecessary, it was not sufficient. They also understood that it was \ncritical to create a reliable, effective distribution system that would \nensure MECTIZAN reached the affected millions for as long as necessary.\n  The lack of public health care infrastructure was a tremendous \nchallenge even though MECTIZAN is an easy to administer oral medication \nthat requires only a single annual dose. To that end, a multisector \ncoalition involving Merck, the World Health Organization; the World \nBank; UNICEF; the Carter Center; Ministries of Health of endemic \ncountries; more than thirty non-governmental development organizations, \nand local community health workers was created. The Merck MECTIZAN \nDonation Program is now considered by many to be the most important \nmodel for public/private partnerships for addressing health care issues \nin the developing world.\n  The success and sustainability of the Merck MECTIZAN Donation Program \nover the past 15 years demonstrates the power and possibilities in \nstrong and creative public/private partnerships to help address the \nenormous public health challenges facing developing countries today. As \na result of the MECTIZAN Donation Program, more than 30 million people \nare now receiving treatment for river blindness annually. Since the \nprogram's inception, Merck has donated more than 700 million MECTIZAN \ntablets. Access to MECTIZAN has spared millions of children and their \nfamilies from the risk of infection and the fear of going blind due to \nriver blindness.\n  Building on the success of the program's fight against river \nblindness, Merck expanded the program in 1998 to include the donations \nof MECTIZAN for the prevention of lymphatic filariasis, more commonly \nknown as elephantiasis, in African countries where river blindness and \nlymphatic filariasis co-exist. It is estimated that 300 million people \nin Africa are at risk of this disease.\n  On this, the 15th anniversary of the Merck MECTIZAN Donation Program, \nI offer praise and gratitude to the many partners who have made life \nbetter for millions of people in the developing world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8559-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALAN KRANOWITZ\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great friend \nand outstanding public servant, Alan Kranowitz, who passed away on June \n3, 2002, following a long battle with cancer. Alan's loss continues to \nreverberate throughout the Washington D.C. area, a testament to the \nenormous impact he had and the plethora of lasting friendships he made \nduring his 25 years of service as a top advisor to Congressmen and \nPresidents.\n  Alan was born and raised in New Britain, CT, and educated at Yale. He \nfirst came to Washington in 1965 to serve as executive assistant, and \nlater as chief of staff to my father, Senator Thomas Dodd. By the time \nAlan left my father's office in 1971, he was one of my father's most \nvalued and trusted aides.\n  But Alan did not only add knowledge and outstanding political \ninstincts to my father's office. Alan's wit, good nature, and personal \nappeal made him beloved beyond measure by everyone who was fortunate \nenough to have known him, or to have worked with him, in my father's \nSenate office, and beyond.\n  After 1971, Alan moved easily between top congressional staff \npositions and key policy positions in the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan \nadministrations. Starting off as Senate liaison for the U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development under President Nixon, Alan soon \nbecame the chief lobbyist for the Office of Management and Budget in \nthe Nixon and Ford Administrations.\n  In the mid-1980s, Alan joined the Reagan White House as a chief \nlegislative advisor and liaison, where his encyclopedic knowledge of \npolicy and his personal ability to bridge differences between Democrats \nand Republicans made him a key player in shaping the legislative agenda \nof President Reagan's second term.\n  Ken Duberstein, President Reagan's Chief of Staff, told The \nWashington Post and The New York Times that Alan was an invaluable part \nof Reagan's legislative team; that the White House ``relied heavily on \n[Alan] in determining what was possible and doable'' because Alan \nalways offered ``absolutely unbiased, straightforward advice.''\n  Aside from working in the White House, in the 1980s, Alan also served \nas chief of staff to former Representative Tom Loeffler of Texas, and \nas a senior advisor to House Republican leader Bob Michel.\n  In 1989, Ronald Reagan appointed Alan as an original council member \nof the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n  For the past 12 years, Alan served as a senior vice president of the \nNational Association of Wholesalers-Distributors.\n  I believe that Alan is best remembered in Washington as someone who \nbrought integrity wherever he went, and excelled at whatever he did. In \na town where one's political and institutional affiliations often \ndefine their career options, Alan moved easily from the Senate to the \nHouse, from Congress to the White House, and from Democratic to \nRepublican positions.\n  That's because it was Alan the man, not Alan the Democrat, or Alan \nthe Republican, who lit up a room, who brought charm and grace along \nwith him wherever he went, and who touched the hearts of everyone with \nwhom he came in contact.\n  Alan's was a life cut short, and he will be sorely missed. To Carol, \nhis wife of 35 years, and to his sons, Jeremy and David, and everyone \nelse in Alan's family, I offer my most heartfelt condolences for your \nloss.\n  But I came to the floor of the Senate today not simply to mourn a \nloss, I came to the floor to celebrate a life. The life of Alan \nKranowitz was truly a life well-lived. He touched so many and every one \nof us he touched is a better person because of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8559-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8559-S8560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VANESSA SHORT BULL IS MISS SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I publicly commend Vanessa \nShort Bull, a resident of Rapid City, South Dakota, on her selection to \nrepresent South Dakota in the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, \nNJ.\n  Vanessa Short Bull's extraordinary dedication to educational \nexcellence, efforts to increase political awareness, prodigious ballet \ntalent, and years of dedicated practice helped her win the title of \nMiss South Dakota. Vanessa will now be traveling to Atlantic City to \ncompete against other highly talented women from across our nation for \nthe title of Miss America 2002.\n  Vanessa obtains the honor of being the first American Indian to be \ncrowned Miss South Dakota. She was born on the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation, and currently resides in Rapid City. She is an enrolled \nmember of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and a direct descendent of several \ngreat Lakota leaders. Thomas and Darlene Short Bull are Vanessa's proud \nparents, and they deserve special recognition for their roles in \nhelping Vanessa obtain this prestigious honor.\n  ``Political Awareness and Participation'' is the center of Vanessa's \nplatform. She believes it is important for Americans, especially young \npeople and minorities, to become more involved in the democratic \nprocess. She has been actively helping her cause by registering voters \nand encouraging them to get out and vote. Vanessa will perform the \nclassical ballet piece ``The Dying Swan'' for the talent portion of the \ncompetition. She has danced for more than 15 years and has studied at \nthe School of Cleveland Ballet, Ballet West Conservatory, and the \nUniversity of Utah.\n  The Miss America Organization has maintained a tradition of \nempowering American women to achieve their personal and professional \ngoals, while providing a forum for them to express their opinions, \ntalents, and intelligence. Vanessa exemplifies this tradition, and \nprovides an excellent example for other gifted young women to emulate. \nAll of South Dakota is proud to have her represent our great state.\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\n  Vanessa Short Bull is an extraordinary woman who richly deserves this \ndistinguished recognition. I strongly commend her years of hard work \nand dedication, and I am very pleased that her substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated. I wish her the best at the Miss \nAmerica competition, and it is with great honor that I share her \nimpressive accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8560-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CHARACTER COUNTS AND ALBUQUERQUE'S SEPTEMBER 11 COMMEMORATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the \ncontributions of a community, dedicated to the spirit of the Character \nCounts education movement, in its commemoration of the first \nanniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks on our Nation.\n  The Nation as a whole this week took time to honor the victims, \nsalute our military men and women fighting the war on terrorism, and \nreaffirm our faith and belief in our great Nation. New Mexico \ncommunities joined in this effort, not least among them our largest \ncity, Albuquerque.\n  I rise today to highlight Albuquerque's tribute because it fused the \nnearly decade-long effort to build character education into the day-to-\nday life of the city with the community's desire to commemorate \nSeptember 11.\n  This week, some 4,200 Albuquerque school children simultaneously \nreleased helium-filled balloons as part of a ``Character Counts Soaring \nSpirits Salute'' to commemorate September 11. This balloon launch gave \nthe students a chance to honor the people who lost their lives in last \nyear's terrorist attacks.\n  But the Character Counts rally had a second purpose. We designed this \nballoon launch to lead into the celebration of National Character Week. \nSupporters of the Character Counts initiative hope this will become a \nyearly observance built around September 11, and the purpose of the \nweek is to celebrate the acts of kindness and courage we see in our \ncommunities every single day.\n  The Character Counts Soaring Spirits Salute involved some outstanding \nNew Mexico community leaders and business owners who worked together to \nmake this event happen, and serve as evidence of a community working \ntogether to improve itself by promoting the tenets of good character. I \nam proud to say these are people who routinely rally behind our youth.\n  I believe some deserve to be singled out, including: the New Mexico \nState Fair; Excel Staffing Companies; MCI; Albuquerque Public Schools, \n(APS); KISS-FM; Public Service Company of New Mexico; Valley \nDistributing; Greg Cook Productions; Dave Garduno of Garduno's \nRestaurants; as well as the men and women of the 58th Special \nOperations Wing and the New Mexico National Guard of Kirtland Air Force \nBase in Albuquerque.\n  A measure of gratitude is also owed to a number of individuals, \nincluding: Gabe Garcia and Chris Montano of Duranes Elementary School; \nJudi Preston of Video Wizard; Eric Hampleman of Simmons Media; Steve \nStucker of KOB-TV; Bill Wood of KRQE-TV; Bruce Bortner and Ed O'Leary \nof the Albuquerque Character Counts Leadership Council; Carole Smith of \nAPS; Terry Eisenbart of Southwest Airlines, who sponsored State Fair \nfestivities for the day.\n  I am very fortunate to represent a community like Albuquerque where I \nknow we can always count on daily acts of Respect, Responsibility, \nTrustworthiness, Citizenship, Fairness and Caring. Those are the \npillars of Character Counts, and it's why today I congratulate and I \ndeeply thank my neighbors in New Mexico for their daily acts of \nkindness, courage, and character as we mark our progress as a nation \nand a united community a year after the terrible attacks on our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8560-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY UNITAS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to a man who passed away too soon, the Man with \nthe Golden Arm, the great Baltimore Colt, Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas. \nHe was known to many as the greatest quarterback to ever play in the \nNational Football League. Yet to those of us in Baltimore and Maryland, \nhe was our own Johnny U. He was the man who put professional football \non the national map, who embodied the strong spirit of our city and \nState.\n  Johnny Unitas was born in Pittsburgh, but he spent most of his life \nin Baltimore. He was as much a part of the fabric of the city as crab \ncakes and Cal Ripken.\n  After high school, he wanted to play football in college at the \nUniversity of Notre Dame. Yet the coaches there told him he was too \nsmall to play football. Johnny wound up playing at the University of \nLouisville, and was drafted in 1955 by his hometown Pittsburgh \nSteelers. The Steelers promptly cut him from the team before the 1955 \nseason started, telling him that he wasn't smart enough to be a \nquarterback.\n  Pittsburgh's loss was Baltimore's gain. The Baltimore Colts signed \nhim in 1956, and the rest is history. In 1958, he led the Colts to an \nimprobable victory in the NFL Championship Game against the New York \nGiants, a game that is now referred to as ``The Greatest Ever Played.'' \nUnitas engineered the famous 80-yard game-tying drive with less than 2 \nminutes to play in regulation, then led the Colts to victory in \novertime. This was the first overtime game ever played in the NFL. The \nlegend of Johnny Unitas was soon born.\n  His trademark crew-cut and black high-top cleats were copied by boys \nall over Baltimore, Maryland, and the entire country. Every kid wanted \nto be number 19.\n  His toughness was legendary. Many times he played with broken bones, \nthrough unbearable pain. The words he said to his teammates before \nevery game embodied his spirit: ``Talk is cheap, let's go play.''\n  His accomplishments are too numerous to mention, but among them are \nthese: 3-time Player of the Year; 3- time NFL Champion; first \nquarterback to pass for over 40,000 yards; a touchdown pass in 47 \nconsecutive games, a feat which is compared to Joe DiMaggio's 56-game \nhitting streak; 10 Pro Bowl selections; Player of the Decade for the \n1960's; Greatest Player in the First 50 Years of the NFL; NFL 75th \nAnniversary Team; and Hall of Fame Inductee, 1979. When he retired in \n1973, Johnny Unitas held 22 NFL records.\n  It is not just his accomplishments on the field that endeared him to \nthe fans in Baltimore. He was an unassuming superstar, a reluctant \nhero, a regular guy who happened to be a tremendous athlete. He \nunderstood that a smile or a handshake or an autograph could make a \nfan's day.\n  He was generous with charities, too, even as he fell upon difficult \nfinancial times. He established the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm \nEducational Foundation, and supported various organizations dedicated \nto children's causes, cancer research, and victims of sexual assault \nand domestic violence.\n  Johnny Unitas was the underdog who became the greatest quarterback in \nthe history of the National Football League. Yet beyond that, he was a \nfine person who will be sorely missed, not only in Baltimore and \nMaryland, but across the country. My thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily, his friends, and his many, many fans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8560-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8560-S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPULSION OF THE ACADIANS\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to address the \ninjustices the British Crown inflicted upon the Acadian people over 200 \nyears ago. Due to their refusal to take an oath of loyalty to the King \nof Great Britain that would require them to bear arms against their \nFrench ancestors, the British governor exiled them from their homes and \nconfiscated their property in Eastern Canada beginning in 1755.\n  This action caused great suffering among the Acadian people as they \nstruggled to find a new home. Forced from their homes, many left for \nthe American colonies. Ultimately, a small group of Acadians found \ntheir way to the Spanish colony of Louisiana in 1764. In the next \ntwenty-five years, over 2,600 made the journey to Louisiana.\n  These refugees ultimately settled in Louisiana and created the Cajun \nculture which has so richly influenced Louisiana since that time. While \nLouisiana culture benefited greatly from the Acadian expulsion, the \nsuffering of the Acadian people must never be forgotten.\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\n  Great Britain is one of our closest allies. We have a long history of \ncooperation and friendship. It is for this very reason I believe and \nhope the British government would acknowledge this tragic incident and \nthe difficulties it caused for thousands of my Cajun ancestors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8561-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8561-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8561-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTICE STATING THAT THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \nRESPECT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES OF SEPTEMBER 11, \n    2001 IS TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT BEYOND SEPTEMBER 14, 2002--PM 107\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to modify provisions \nrelating to the Lake Champlain basin; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I rise on behalf \nof myself and Senators Leahy, Clinton, and Schumer to introduce the \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002.\n  This legislation will bring the Lake Champlain Basin Program into the \n21st century.\n  In 1990, along with Senators Leahy, Moynihan, and D'amato, I \nintroduced the Lake Champlain Special Designation Act which designated \nLake Champlain as a resource of national significance.\n  The program began as a management conference with a charter of \ndeveloping a comprehensive pollution prevention, control, and \nrestoration plan for Lake Champlain.\n  The management conference began work immediately after passage of the \nLake Champlain Special Designation Act of 1990 and developed the Plan \nentitled, ``Opportunities for Action.''\n  The conference evolved into today's Lake Champlain Basin Program \nwhich works cooperatively with partners throughout the region to \nprotect and enhance the environmental integrity and the social and \neconomic benefits of the Lake Champlain Basin.\n  A key element of the success of this program is the active \nparticipation of the local partners.\n  State and local governments, nonprofit entities, and the regional \nrepresentatives of the Federal agencies involved in the Basin Program \nare the best fuel behind this program's success.\n  It is their efforts that have made this program an international \nmodel for lake restoration programs.\n  The program completed its first 5-year update of ``Opportunities for \nAction'' in January 2002.\n  Our legislation authorizes the implementation of this plan through a \npartnership between the Basin Program and the Federal Government.\n  Before I get into the specifics of the legislation, let me take a \nminute to describe the Lake Champlain Basin to you.\n  For those of you who have not visited either the Vermont or the New \nYork side, I recommend that you take the time to see this magnificent \nspot which is the sixth largest freshwater lake in the world, after \nonly the Great Lakes.\n  Lake Champlain flows north along the borders of Vermont, New York, \nand Canada.\n  It is 120 miles long and just 12 miles wide at its widest point.\n  Lake Champlain is home to a diverse array of 81 species of fish, 318 \nspecies of birds, 56 species of mammals, 21 species of amphibians and \n20 reptile species.\n  The floor of Lake Champlain boasts some of the best-preserved \nsubmerged cultural heritage resources in North America.\n  Shipwrecks in the lake reflect virtually every era of human activity \nin the Basin.\n  The Lake Champlain Basin stretches from the Adirondacks to the Green \nMountains and north into Quebec.\n  It is an area about the size of Massachusetts with 56 percent of the \nBasin in Vermont, 37 percent in New York, and 7 percent in Canada.\n  The Basin not only offers natural beauty, but also plays a key role \nin the life of Vermonters, New Yorkers, and Canadians.\n  It is a recreation mecca in the region with over 7,500 motorboats, \nmore than 3,000 sailboats, and thousands of swimmers, windsurfers, \nkayakers, canoers, and scuba divers visiting Lake Champlain on a \ntypical summer day.\n  Recreation generated $3.8 billion in the Basin in 2000. The \npopulation in the Basin has been steadily growing over the last 40 \nyears.\n  Today, approximately one-third of the Basin's over 600,000 residents \nuse the lake as a source of drinking water. It is also a key source of \nwater for agriculture and industry. All of this human activity has \ntaken a toll on Lake Champlain.\n  Although it remains a generally healthy lake today, it is plagued by \nexcess phosphorous loadings, toxics such as mercury, and invasions of \nnonnative species such as the zebra mussel and sea lamprey.\n  We must take action to prevent future degradation.\n  The Lake Champlain Basin Program issued a revised Plan in January \n2002, also entitled ``Opportunities for Action,'' that provides a path \nto protect the health of the lake well into the future.\n  The bill we introduce today, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lake \nChamplain Basin Program Act of 2002, authorizes the Federal side of the \npartnerships required to implement Opportunities for Action.\n  This legislation authorizes $5 million per year for 5 years for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to make grants to implement \nOpportunities for Action.\n  These funds will be coupled with a 25-percent local match as well as \nwith $6 million per year for 5 years from the Department of the \nInterior, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  This bill also revises an authorization that Congress passed in the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000 for the Army Corps of Engineers \nto provide design and construction assistance of up to $20 million for \nimplementation of Opportunities for Action to make it more usable for \n``Vermont-style'' projects.\n  These funds will be used to protect and enhance the environmental \nintegrity and social and economic benefits of the Lake Champlain basin \nand to achieve the environmental goals described in the plan, \nincluding: the reduction of phosphorous inputs; the reduction of toxic \ncontamination; the control of the introduction, spread, and impacts of \nnonnative nuisance substances and species; the minimization of risks to \nhumans from water-related health hazards, and the protection of \nnatural, recreation, and cultural heritage resources.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Washington, in New \nYork, and, most of all, in Vermont to pass this legislation and to \nimplement this program that is so critical to the long-term health of \nLake Champlain.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Vermont in \nsupporting this bill that he is introducing today, the Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002.\n  I thank Chairman Jeffords, with whom I have the honor and pleasure of \nserving on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, for \nworking on this legislation, for being devoted to Lake Champlain, and \nfor giving my distinguished predecessor, Senator Moynihan, the honor of \nnaming it after him.\n  Senator Moynihan was in my office on Tuesday. I told him of Senator \nJefford's plans, and he was surprised and delighted. But he certainly \ndeserves this great honor because, along with Senator Jeffords, he has \nbeen a champion of this natural and cultural resource that our States \nshare: the Lake Champlain Basin and Champlain Valley.\n  We are joining with our colleagues--Senator Leahy and Senator \nSchumer--in introducing this legislation because we know how \nsignificant this lake is. It is the sixth largest natural freshwater \nlake in the United States. Some of us consider it a ``Great Lake.'' It \nis home to an array of fish, birds, and other wildlife.\n  It also has significant historic, social, and economic consequences \nfor our entire country. What we aim to do with this legislation is to \ngive the Champlain Valley Basin the kind of support it needs to \ncontinue its recovery.\n  This is an area that Senator Jeffords and Senator Moynihan paid \nparticular attention to. They have worked very closely together over \nthe last many years. And it builds on legislation that Senator Moynihan \nplayed a key role in during the 101st Congress, as well as a plan that \ncame out of the 1990 legislation entitled ``Opportunities for Action'' \nthat enabled the Lake Champlain Steering Committee to create the new \nguiding document on which our legislation, in great measure, draws.\n  This will provide new and important resources for counties in Vermont \nand also counties in New York, including Clinton, Essex, Franklin, \nHamilton, Warren, and Washington Counties.\n  This is very important environmental legislation, but it is equally \nimportant economic, social, and historic legislation. That is why I am \nvery proud to sponsor this legislation with my chairman, Senator \nJeffords, and to join him in naming this legislation after our \nillustrious and esteemed colleague, Senator Patrick Moynihan.\n  There is no more fitting tribute to Senator Moynihan than to give him\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nthe recognition that he is due for the leadership role he played in \nbringing to national attention places of great national importance, \nsuch as Lake Champlain.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Jeffords, introduced \nlegislation, the Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002, in honor of \nformer Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. With the forbearance of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, I will only speak for a couple minutes.\n  I, obviously, strongly support what Senator Jeffords has done and \nappreciate his work and the work of the members of his staff.\n  In Vermont, we are extremely pleased with the success of the Lake \nChamplain program to date. With the additional resources in this bill, \nwe are confident that the problems that Lake Champlain encounters--the \nproblems of pollution and of other matters--can be addressed.\n  Lake Champlain is a magnificent lake standing between Vermont and New \nYork. It is a lake that is enjoyed by people who fish, sail, who are \ninvolved in economic activities, and, of course, it has tremendous \neconomic and historical value to this Nation, from the time of the \nRevolutionary War on.\n  The basin program shows what happens when two States, Vermont and New \nYork, and one province, the Province of Quebec, get together and work \non a common watershed and link their people, their governments--local, \nState, and Federal--together in almost unprecedented cooperation to \nsave this great big beautiful lake. It has been a model for watersheds \nthroughout the Nation.\n  I am pleased to join in introducing this legislation. I believe it \nwill ensure that our children and our grandchildren will enjoy this \nlake in the same way Senator Jeffords and I did when we were children.\n  I am very pleased to join with my colleagues from Vermont and New \nYork as we introduce the Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002 in \nhonor of former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  I was with Senator Moynihan in 1990 that we were able to enact the \nfirst comprehensive piece of legislation to make Federal resources \navailable to help our states address the challenges facing Lake \nChamplain.\n  I want to thank Senator Jeffords and his staff for all the work they \nhave put into this effort. I know that many hours have gone into the \nresearch, discussion and editing to get where we are today.\n  I also want to thank Senators Clinton and Schumer who are our \nvaluable New York partners in all things related to Lake Champlain.\n  Our initial 1990 Lake Champlain legislation was very successful. It \nbrought together various agencies, interest groups and government \nentities to develop a comprehensive pollution prevention and \nrestoration management plan for the Lake.\n  Through long hours and a cooperative effort, the Vermonters and New \nYorkers involved came up with a good plan which was signed by Governors \nDean and Pataki in 1996.\n  While we have several priority action items ranging across a wide \nspectrum of Lake related issues, the Big three remain phosphorus \nreduction, toxic contaminant prevention and clean-up and management of \naquatic nuisance species.\n  Our legislative proposal today rightfully moves from an emphasis on \nresearch and planning to one of clean-up implementation and, quite \nimportantly, monitoring the progress of that clean-up.\n  We are very pleased with the success of the Lake Champlain Basin \nProgram to date, and with the additional resources envisioned in this \nbill, we are confident that the problems Lake Champlain is encountering \ncan be addressed successfully.\n  The Basin Program stands as a fine example of how two States and one \nprovince can work together as a common watershed linking its citizens \nand their governments at all levels--local, State and Federal.\n  Indeed, the Lake Champlain model has been held up many times in \nrecent years as an example for other watersheds around the world.\n  We are happy to share our successes, and even our failures, with \nconservation initiatives internationally.\n  I am excited about the prospects of this legislation and I hope the \nfull Senate will give Vermont and New York its ringing endorsement once \nit has received committee review.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 265 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, \nas the ``Nat King Cole Post Office''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Boxer \nto introduce legislation that would name a post office in Los Angeles, \nCA after Nathaniel Adams Coles, whom we all know as Nat ``King'' Cole.\n  Nat ``King'' Cole was a great American vocalist and entertainer, and \nthe best selling African-American recording artist of his generation.\n  Born in 1919 in Montgomery, AL, Mr. Cole proved, at an early age, to \nbe quite musically adept. At the age of four, he gave his first public \nperformance playing the piano and singing at Chicago's Regal Theater.\n  In 1937, as a struggling young musician, he moved to Southern \nCalifornia.\n  While in Los Angeles, Mr. Cole was asked to put together a small \nmusical group which was to play at the Sewanee Inn, a Los Angeles \nnightclub.\n  The owner of the Sewanee Inn is responsible for the nickname ``King \nCole'' because he asked him to wear a golden paper crown. Though the \ncrown was short lived, the nickname stuck and the musical group became \nknown as the King Cole Trio.\n  In 1943, the King Cole Trio signed with a fledgling record company \nknown as Capital Records. The next year, Capital Records released a \nsong written by Nat ``King'' Cole and recorded by the King Cole Trio \ncalled ``Straighten Up and Fly Right.''\n  The song became a huge hit due to its popularity with audiences of \ndifferent races. The King Cole Trio went on to have a series of musical \nhits that include ``For Sentimental Reasons'' and ``The Christmas \nSong.''\n  Nat ``King'' Cole went on to sell so many records that Capital \nRecords' headquarters became known as the ``House that Nat built.''\n  Nat ``King'' Cole's legacy not only encompasses his musical genius, \nbut also his bravery in overcoming racial intolerance. During his \ncareer, he played in some clubs where he was the first ever Black \nentertainer to perform. He also endured an attack from white \nsupremacists while on stage in Birmingham, Alabama in 1956.\n  Mr. Cole holds a special place in the hearts of Los Angeles \nresidents, as a man who brought down racial barriers. In 1948, Mr. Cole \nand his family purchased a home in the exclusive Hancock Park section \nof Los Angeles. His would-be neighbors formed an association to prevent \nhim from moving into the all-white community.\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\n  Overcoming these protests and threats, Mr. Cole moved in and became \nthe first family to integrate the community.\n  In honor of this distinguished former resident, members of the \ncommunity surrounding the Oakwood Station Post Office, have advocated \nthat the post office at 265 South Western Avenue in Los Angeles be \nnamed after Nat ``King'' Cole.\n  It is my pleasure to introduce such legislation, and I hope that my \ncolleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2931. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 5805 White Oak Avenue in Encino, California, as the \n``Francis Dayle `Chick' Hearn Post Office'', to the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nBoxer, to introduce legislation that would name a postal facility in \nLos Angeles, California after the great Los Angeles Laker's announcer, \nFrancis Dayle ``Chick'' Hearn.\n  Chick Hearn was born on November 27, 1916, in Buda, IL.\n  His interest in broadcasting began when he worked for the Armed \nForces Radio, while he was stationed in the Philippines during World \nWar II.\n  Soon after he was discharged, he began announcing Bradley University \nbasketball games for a radio station in Peoria, IL.\n  Mr. Hearn's desire to work in radio broadcasting soon led him to \nSouthern California, where he worked for CBS radio announcing \nUniversity of Southern California football games.\n  Then, in 1961, Chick Hearn began announcing Lakers' game when the \nfranchise moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles.\n  His contributions to the game go far beyond giving the fans the play-\nby-play. Mr. Hearn pioneered basketball phrases, such as ``airball'' \nand ``slam dunk'' and ``finger role'' which are now well known and \noften used by Americans who participate or have an interest in \nbasketball.\n  Perhaps the most distinguished characteristic of Chick Hearn's career \nis his extraordinary dedication to his work. Beginning on November 21, \n1965, Mr. Hearn announced a record 3,338 consecutive games for the Los \nAngeles Lakers.\n  This streak ended on December 16, 2001, three days before Mr. Hearn \nunderwent heart surgery. Until his death on August 5, 2002, Hearn had \nbeen the only play-by-play announcer the Los Angeles Lakers had ever \nhad.\n  During his distinguished career of more than 40 years with the Los \nAngeles Lakers, Mr. Hearn saw the Lakers capture nine NBA titles.\n  He had the opportunity to watch the careers of basketball stars such \nas Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, \nand he spread his love of basketball to all who listened.\n  He is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and the Sportcasters \nHall of Fame.\n  In honor of Chick Hearn's dedicated service, it is my pleasure to \nintroduce legislation to name the post office at 5805 White Oak Avenue \nin Encino, CA.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will approve this legislation, and \nhonor the memory of Chick Hearn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 2932. A bill to make technical amendments to the Higher Education \nAct of 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce, along with \nmy colleagues Senator Enzi, Senator Collins, and Senator Cochran, the \nHigher Education Technical Amendments of 2002. This legislation makes \nseveral technical and non-controversial changes to the Higher Education \nAct, HEA, and is designed to provide relief from burdensome legal \nrequirements, improve the financial aid process, and bring greater \nclarity to the law.\n  Most importantly, it provides for a one-year extension of two \nprovisions in the HEA that are of great importance to students, their \nfamilies, and schools. These provide schools having low student loan \ndefault rates with exemptions from the requirement that loan proceeds \nbe disbursed in multiple installments, and the requirement that the \ndisbursement of loan proceeds to first-time undergraduate borrowers be \ndelayed for 30 days after classes start. Under current law, these \nprovisions are set to expire at the end of this month.\n  Thousands of institutions of higher education across America count on \nthese exemptions to save them time and money in the disbursement of \ntheir limited financial aid resources. These provisions also serve as \nan incentive for schools to keep their default rates low. Additionally, \nfailing to act now means that students needing loan proceeds for books \nor living expenses could be seriously disadvantaged. At a time when \nboth student and institutional budgets are being squeezed, we should do \nwhat we can to provide them with relief.\n  The bill makes a number of other beneficial changes to the HEA. Most \nnotably, it: Helps protect home-schooled students by making it clear \nthat institutions of higher education will not lose their institutional \neligibility for Federal financial aid by admitting home-schooled \nstudents. Clarifies the Federal policy on the return of financial aid \nfunds when students withdraw, to better protect students' grant aid. \nRemoves barriers to students seeking forbearance from lenders on \nstudent loan payments, by eliminating the requirement that new \nagreements between lenders and borrowers be in writing. Instead, the \nbill allows a lender to accept a request for forbearance over the \ntelephone, as long as a confirmation notice of the agreement reached is \nprovided to the borrower and the borrower's file is updated. Makes \nclear that under the Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational Opportunity \nProgram, the U.S. Department of Education can provide scholarship aid \nto low-income and minority students to prepare for and attend law \nschool. Eases requirements for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, by \nallowing them to apply for Federal HSI grants without waiting two years \nbetween applications. Corrects a drafting error in current law that \nmistakenly bars students attending certain nonprofit schools of \nveterinary medicine from eligibility for the Federal Family Education \nLoan Program. Allows financial aid administrators to use ``professional \njudgment'' to adjust a student's financial need in cases where the \nstudent is a ward of the court. Expands the use of technology to \nprovide voter registration material directly to students in a timely \nmanner.\n  I am well aware that extending the two provisions set to expire on \nSeptember 30 for another year will cost $10 million. However, we intend \nto find the necessary offsets to pay for these extensions as the bill \nprogresses through the Senate. It is my sincere hope that we can all \nwork together in these final weeks of the session to see that this \nlegislation becomes law.\n  The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 2002 will improve the \nfinancial aid process for everyone involved, but most importantly, for \nour nation's postsecondary students. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8570-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8570-S8571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 253--RESOLUTION DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER \n          2002 AS ``NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nMurkowski, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Shelby, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Helms, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Miller, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Corzine, \nMr. Craig, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \nMrs. Clinton, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Ensign, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Thurmond, and Mrs. Carnahan) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 325\n\n       Whereas over 1,000,000 American families live with prostate \n     cancer;\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\n       Whereas 1 American man in 6 will be diagnosed with prostate \n     cancer in his lifetime;\n       Whereas over the past decade prostate cancer has been the \n     most commonly diagnosed nonskin cancer and the second most \n     common cancer killer of American men;\n       Whereas 189,000 American men will be diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer and 30,200 American men will die of prostate \n     cancer in 2002, according to American Cancer Society \n     estimates;\n       Whereas fully \\1/4\\ of new cases of prostate cancer occur \n     in men during their prime working years;\n       Whereas African-Americans have the highest incidence and \n     mortality rates of prostate cancer in the world;\n       Whereas screening by both digit rectal examination and \n     prostate-specific antigen blood test (PSA) can diagnose the \n     disease in earlier and more treatable stages and has reduced \n     prostate cancer mortality;\n       Whereas the research pipeline promises further improvements \n     in prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and \n     treatments; and\n       Whereas educating Americans, including health care \n     providers, about prostate cancer and early detection \n     strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men and \n     preserving and protecting our families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of September 2002 as ``National \n     Prostate Cancer Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding that is commensurate with \n     the burden of the disease so that the causes of, and improved \n     methods for screening, treating, and curing prostate cancer \n     may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider ways for improving access to, \n     and the quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States, interested groups, and \n     affected persons to promote awareness of prostate cancer, to \n     take an active role in the fight to end the devastating \n     effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their families, \n     and the economy, and to observe the month of September 2002 \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit, along with \nSenator Reid and 36 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle, a \nresolution to designate September 2002 as National Prostate Cancer \nAwareness Month. As a prostate cancer survivor myself, I understand the \nimportance of public awareness and early detection, and I hope that by \ndesignating this month as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we \ncan help save lives.\n  Since the tragic events on September 11, 2001, Americans have \ncontinued to honor their heroes of that day with respect, gratitude \nand, too often, the memory of lives lost. The ``first responders'' \nprotected our safety and well-being, not only in New York and \nWashington, but also in cities and towns across the country, where \npolice, fire, emergency service, National Guard and the military have \nbeen laden with banners and bouquets of thanks, recognition and \nremembrance. September is also ``Prostate Cancer Awareness Month'', \nPCAM, a time to remember those who have perished from the disease and \nto celebrate those who are surviving, and a time to work together to \naccelerate a cure. Along with The National Prostate Cancer Coalition, \nNPCC, I look forward to raising awareness in September with \ncommemorations of ``911'' joining the NPCC's special campaign, \n``Protecting Our Protectors'' which encourages men in law enforcement, \nfire service, and current and former servicemen to get screened for \nprostate cancer.\n  This resolution is an effort to help increase awareness and educate \nAmerican men and their families about prostate cancer and early \ndetection, as well as emphasize the need for more prostate cancer \nresearch. It will designate September 2002 as National Prostate Cancer \nAwareness Month. Together, Senator Reid and I ask for your support and \nencourage all of our colleagues to join us in raising awareness. With \nyour help, prostate cancer can be preventable, controllable, and \ncurable.\n  Today prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed nonskin \ncancer in America. According to estimates by the American Cancer \nSociety and the National Cancer Institute, NCI, more than 189,000 \nAmerican men will learn that they have the disease during 2002. Nearly \n30,000 American men will lose their lives to prostate cancer this year, \nmaking it the second most common cause of cancer death among men. These \nstatistics translate into devastating realities for men and families \nacross this country.\n  This disease will affect one in six men in the United States during \nhis lifetime. More than 25 percent of those battling this disease are \nunder the age of 65, prime years of productivity for families and for \nthis nation. The number of Americans impacted by cancer, and prostate \ncancer, is also expected to grow. If unchecked during the next decade, \ncancer incidence and mortality rates could increase by 25 percent-30 \npercent. In too many cases, prostate cancer remains undetected until \nadvanced stages of the disease, when conventional therapies no longer \nwork. This makes it critical that all American families understand the \nrisks of prostate cancer and take measures to ensure early detection.\n  If a man has one close relative with prostate cancer, his risk of the \ndisease is double that of the average male. With two close relatives, \nhis risk is fivefold. Should he have three close relatives with \nprostate cancer, his likelihood of a prostate cancer diagnosis is \nnearly 97 percent.\n  African American families are at particular risk. African American \nmen have the highest incidence and mortality rates in the world. \nAccording to the National Prostate Cancer Coalition, we must raise \npublic awareness about the impact of prostate cancer and emphasize \nearly detection with the PSA, prostate specific antigen, blood test and \nDRE, digital rectal examination. Over the last five years prostate \ncancer mortalities have decreased by 27 percent. This shows that, with \nthe right investment in education and research, we are already saving \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8571-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8571-S8572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 326--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 18, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL \n                           MAMMOGRAPHY DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bingaman, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \nCarnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. DeWine, \nMr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, \nMs. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 326\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2002, \n     203,500 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,600 \n     women will die from this diease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 18, 2002, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 18, 2002, as ``National Mammography Day''. I am \npleased that 54 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by \nagreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have introduced \na similar resolution each year\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nsince 1993, and on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for \nthe fight against breast cancer by approving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2002, it is estimated that over 203,000 women will \nbe diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly fewer than 40,000 women \nwill die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be \noptimistic. The number of deaths from breast cancer is falling from \nyear to year. Early detection of breast cancer continues to result in \nextremely favorable outcomes: 97 percent of women with localized breast \ncancer will survive 5 years or longer. New digital techniques make the \nprocess of mammography much more rapid and precise than before. \nGovernment programs will provide free mammograms to those who can't \nafford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for treatment if breast \ncancer is diagnosed. Information about treatment of breast cancer with \nsurgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting \nenormous research advances in this disease. So I am feeling quite \npositive about our battle against breast cancer. A diagnosis of breast \ncancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter long-term survivors of \nbreast cancer nearly daily.\n  In recent months, the newspapers have been filled with discussion \nover whether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion \nthat periodic screening mammography saves lives. It seems that much of \nthis controversy relates to new interpretations of old studies, and the \nrelatively few recent studies of this matter have not clarified this \nissue. Most sources seem to agree that all of the existing scientific \nstudies have some weaknesses, but it is far from clear whether the very \nlarge and truly unambiguous study needed to settle this matter \ndefinitively can ever be done.\n  So what is a woman to do? I do not claim any expertise in this highly \ntechnical area, so I rely on the experts. The American Cancer Society, \nthe National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography, and I \nendorse the statements of these distinguished bodies.\n  On the other hand, I recognize that some women who examine these \nresearch studies are unconvinced of the need for periodic screening \nmammography. However, even those scientists who do not support periodic \nmammography for all women believe that it is appropriate for some \ngroups of women with particular risk factors. In agreement with these \nexperts, I encourage all women who have doubts about the usefulness of \nscreening mammography in general to discuss with their individual \nphysicians whether this test is appropriate in their specific \nsituations.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram, or at the very \nleast discuss this option with your own physician.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some women to avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To those who \nare fearful, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, \nand the latest one comes out positive, even before you have any \nsymptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to \nbe optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I \nwould suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' comes in. \nOn that day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific \ndate on which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't \nforget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her \ntaxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: \npick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of \nyour child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise \nyourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself \nand for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives \nfor as long as possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, I say let \nNational Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this question \neach year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast \ncancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate \nOctober 18, 2002, as National Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/12/senate-section/article/S8572-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4532.
