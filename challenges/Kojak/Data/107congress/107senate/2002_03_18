Mr. President, I rise to speak on a subject that I hope \nwill be on the Senate's agenda after we come back from Easter recess, \nwhich I think starts at the end of this week. That issue is Trade \nPromotion Authority for the President.\n  It is time for the Senate to pass Trade Promotion Authority, not only \nfor President Bush, because he has asked for it, but because every \nPresident ought to have this authority. The President needs this \nauthority to help in the reduction of non-tariff trade barriers as well \nas tariffs and to negotiate international trade agreements.\n  It has been over a decade since our Nation has had Trade Promotion \nAuthority for the President. Since that time, we have fallen further \nbehind. This map shows how far behind we are. It shows that the rest of \nthe world is no longer going to stand around and wait for the United \nStates to show leadership on trade.\n  Here you can see all these countries in red. That sea of red \nrepresents 111 countries that are a party to more than 130 free trade \nagreements that do not include the United States of America. The United \nStates was not at the negotiating table for these 130 free trade \nagreements. How many free trade agreements do we have with other \ncountries? Three!\n  Until just last year, with the passage of the Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement, it had been over 6 years since the United States enacted a \nfree trade agreement with another country. Our failure to act, in fact, \ndoes make a difference.\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\n  While we stay on the sidelines, the rest of the world moves ahead, \nconcluding an average of twenty new free trade agreements every year. \nThe European Union alone has signed preferential agreements with 27 \ncountries and is right now working on 15 more. That means other \ncountries are writing the rules of trade, and the United States is not \nat the table. The rules these other countries write are not designed to \nbenefit U.S. companies and U.S. workers. When other countries write the \nrules of trade, we lose.\n  In the absence of Trade Promotion Authority, we have allowed our \nforeign competitors to make deals that have placed U.S. interests at a \ndisadvantage. If we do not pass Trade Promotion Authority soon, then we \nare going to continue to fall further and further behind. We will sit \non the sidelines and our competitors will continue to make deals that \nexclude us--it's a game plan for failure.\n  Without Trade Promotion Authority, American negotiating power to \nbring down trade barriers is severely limited. Foreign competitors will \ncontinue to weave a web of preferential trade and investment \nopportunities for themselves, and we will fall further behind. American \ncompanies, workers, and farmers are paying a high price for our \ninaction. Compared to their foreign counterparts, U.S. exporters often \nface higher tariffs, higher costs, and greater administrative delays, \nand even less favorable investment opportunities and protection.\n  While other countries negotiate free trade agreements, ensuring that \ntheir products sail across borders tax free, American workers face high \ntariffs that erode their competitive edge.\n  I will just give one example: Caterpillar, a corporation \nheadquartered in the State of Illinois. Caterpillar's motor graders, \nmade in the United States for export to Chile, face nearly $15,000 in \ntariffs whereas Caterpillar, making those same motor graders in Brazil \nfor export to Chile, only face a tariff of $3,700. That ought to get \nanybody's attention about the importance of negotiating down these \nbarriers.\n  Further, when Caterpillar's competitors produce the same product in \nCanada, it can be exported to Chile free of tariffs because of the \nCanada-Chile free trade agreement.\n  We cannot continue to put U.S. workers at a disadvantage in the \ninternational marketplace. Isolationism is a failed policy that damages \nU.S. interests on many levels. This year the Senate has the ability to \nreject this failed policy by bringing up and passing Trade Promotion \nAuthority. This is not the time for us to take a pass on policies that \ncould enhance our global competitiveness and increase our economic \nstature worldwide.\n  Presidential leadership is very obvious in the war on terrorism. We \nhave a strong diplomatic component to that. We have a strong military \ncomponent to that. But we also need a strong economic component to the \nPresident's leadership, and that can come in part through this \nPresident having Trade Promotion Authority.\n  The Senate Finance Committee reported Trade Promotion Authority out \nof our committee last year in its usual way of doing business, by a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 18 to 3. I am confident when this bill comes \nto the floor it will receive bipartisan support from the entire Senate.\n  So it is time to get this bill, Trade Promotion Authority, on the \nSenate floor and get it passed. Renewing Trade Promotion Authority will \nhelp level the global playing field and create countless opportunities \nfor our workers, our farmers, and our businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining on \nSenator Grassley's request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent he be allowed an additional 10 \nminutes so I may address some questions to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues for allowing that.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Grassley from Iowa that I appreciate \nhis remarks today, and I appreciate the work he has done in this area. \nI know he feels very strongly about the need for free trade and having \nopen markets, but also that it be fair trade.\n  I know it is very important to a State such as Iowa, which not only \nis very much involved in the manufacturing area but particularly in \nagriculture because we could export a lot more of our agricultural \nproducts. So I thank him for the position he takes as a Senator from \nthe great State of Iowa but also as a leader on the Finance Committee, \nboth as former chairman and now as ranking member.\n  I emphasize, once again, the point he made that this Trade Promotion \nAuthority was reported out of the Finance Committee by a vote of 18 to \n3, which was a very wide, bipartisan vote.\n  I should note both the majority leader and minority leader voted for \nthat package. Yet this bill has been languishing. The House passed this \nlegislation on December 6 of last year. I think the Senate should have \nacted last year. It did not. I think it is imperative that we act \nwithin the near future.\n  I inquire of Senator Grassley, has he been given any indication as to \nwhen this might come to the Senate for full Senate action? Does he know \nwhat commitments have been made?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We were told sometime this spring. Spring is fleeting. \nThat is why I hope we can get a date definite that it will be brought \nup and it can be passed.\n  It will be particularly fruitful and beneficial to the President to \nhave Trade Promotion Authority now as he goes to the international \nconference at Monterey this week. It would be nice if he had it as he \nis going to visit Peru; as he is going to visit El Salvador. Wherever \nthe President is going to go, this issue always comes up.\n  As I talked to Bob Zoellick, the U.S. Trade Representative who does \nour negotiations, the fact that the President does not have this \nauthority weakens our position at the international conferences we \nattend, particularly now as we are beginning negotiations in Geneva, on \nwhat is called the Doha Round--it was agreed to last November, a brand \nnew round of negotiations that hopefully will be finalized for about 3 \nyears--for the President to be credible and his people to be credible \nat the negotiating table, we must have Trade Promotion Authority.\n  Mr. LOTT. My impression is that after we complete the energy \nlegislation, and presumably the campaign finance reform issue--I guess \nthat could be even after the Easter recess--the next order of business \nwould be the budget resolution. Then Senator Daschle indicated we would \ngo to trade at that point. I am not sure exactly what that means I \npresume sometime in late April or May.\n  But I do agree we need to act on this legislation. It is very \nunfortunate we did not move the Andean Trade Promotion Authority, which \nhas also been reported by the House and been reported out by the \nFinance Committee but has not been cleared by the Senate. The President \nwill be going to Peru this very week. The ambassadors and foreign \nministers and Presidents of those countries, the Andean countries, had \nrequested this legislation be passed, and indicated to me it had gone \nbeyond being an issue of trade; it had gotten to be a very serious \npolitical problem in those countries. I am wondering about what exactly \nis the U.S. commitment to opportunity, trade options, and prosperity in \nthose regions.\n\n  Of the countries which Senator Grassley has listed, more and more \ncountries are trading with these countries in Central and South \nAmerica. We are really not in there the way we should be.\n  Recently, I had occasion to be in Spain, and I was surprised to find \nhow much involvement Spain has in Central and South America, including, \nI believe, Spain owning the second largest bank in Central America.\n  That is just one example of what has happened there. These countries \nhave an ever-growing number of free trade agreements. Yet the United \nStates has only three trade agreements.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We negotiated three trade agreements. Of these \ncountries, 111 have negotiated 130 trade agreements.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am also very much worried. It appears that \nthe way this will be brought to the floor, once again, is setting it up \nin such a\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\nway that the Senate may not be able to act. On bill after bill, we have \nseen that recently. That happened with the stimulus bill. It happened \nwith agriculture. We are not sure what the outcome is going to be on \nthe energy bill.\n  When you bring a bill to the floor, and the substance of that bill is \nsuch that we have to write it on the floor of the Senate, that is a \nproblem. But in the case of trade, I also see that we are being told it \nhas to be coupled with trade adjustment assistance.\n  While there is a bipartisan feeling that there needs to be some \nassistance available in dealing with dislocated workers, at least on \nthe interim basis, it includes, for instance, health care provisions \nthat are going to be extremely controversial.\n  To say that bill has to come to the floor providing COBRA health \ninsurance provisions for trade adjustment assistance in order to get \ntrade promotion authority is to set ourselves up in such a way that it \nwill be very hard--and maybe even impossible --to get this very \nimportant legislation through.\n  Does Senator Grassley care to comment on that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is a very divisive issue. As Senator Lott brought up \nabout tax benefits for COBRA insurance, there was divisiveness during \nthe debate on economic stimulus, and it kept economic stimulus from \npassing.\n  It seems to me that a bill that was voted out of committee by 18 to 3 \nshould not be handled in any other spirit than the spirit of that vote \nwithin the Finance Committee, which is typical of the way the Senate \nought to work, and also a follow-on of how our committee has always \nworked to produce good bills which have come out of the committee most \nof the time with bipartisan support.\n  In so many other areas other than just this one, I compliment my \nDemocrat counterpart, Senator Baucus, and his staff for trying to work \nthrough some of the disagreements that might come up on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I think there is a terrible pressure for more to be done, and that it \nis going to be divisive. I hope we can get past that. For instance, in \nthe case of health insurance and incentives for the unemployed to have \nhealth insurance, that is a very worthy issue. But that ought to come \nup in the context of dealing with the issue, as the President has \npresented it, of tax credits for all of the uninsured so they will be \nable to buy health insurance. We should not take that issue up with \nthe very narrow part of the unemployed because of the relationship to \ntrade. That should come up as an issue for all of the uninsured, and we \nshould deal with that as a separate issue.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his comments. I \ntake this occasion to emphasize that particular point, and serve notice \nthat this could be an area of major concern and a serious problem in \nproducing a result on trade promotion authority. It would be a tragic \nexample if we do not succeed in this area. Once again, that would mean \nthe Senate has failed to do its work, especially after such good \nbipartisan work has been done in committee.\n  I encourage Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus to continue in the \nspirit in which they reported this bill from committee to the full \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, CNN broke the news that, six \nmonths after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service finally provided a \nconfirmation notice to a Florida flight school that two of the suicide \nhijackers who died on September 11 had been approved for student visas.\n  The American people must have been be shaking their heads in dismay. \nCertainly many politicians viewed the incident with incredulity and \nanger. Our President said he was ``plenty hot.'' The Attorney General \npromised an investigation. Legislators and pundits have called for the \nrestructuring--and even for the abolishment--of the INS.\n  I find it hard to understand the apparent shock. That this incident \noccurred should come as no surprise to anyone who has read anything in \nrecent months about the inept manner in which our immigration system is \napparently operating. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the \nAmerican people heard repeatedly about the lapses in our immigration \nlaws that allowed these terrorists to enter our country. Three of the \nterrorists were in the country on expired visas and should have been \ndeported. Countless federal reports and investigations have concluded \nthat INS is plagued by backlogs and delays. The agency has little sense \nof who is crossing our borders, and can't track individuals once they \nare inside the country.\n  As if to try to provide some logic for its bumbling, the INS said in \na statement last week that it had no information at the time that it \napproved these student visas that either man was tied to terrorist \ngroups. I hardly find any comfort in that. It doesn't explain why \nMohammed Atta's visa extension kept winding its way through the \nbureaucratic process for months after he became recognized \ninternationally as a brutal terrorist.\n  Since September 11th, the Administration has sought to reassure the \nAmerican people that this government was taking steps to reinforce that \ninvisible barrier that ostensibly protects our citizens from foreign \nthreats. The American people were told that this government is doing \nall that it can to strengthen our borders and make Americans safe.\n  But then this CNN report is unveiled, reinforcing the negative \nimpression that most Americans have of our Nation's border security.\n  If the American people went to bed last Tuesday night in dismay over \nthis latest INS debacle, they must have been absolutely dumbfounded \nwhen they awoke Wednesday morning to learn that the House of \nRepresentatives had passed, at the request of the President, what \namounts to an amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, many \nof whom have not undergone any--any--background or security check.\n  Supporters of the House-passed extension of the so-called Section \n245(i) provision were quick to claim that it is not an amnesty. The \nissue, they argue, is where you fill out your paper work--here or \nabroad. That is nonsense--\nN-O-N-S-E-N-S-E, nonsense. Section 245(i)--amnesty is amnesty--pure and \nsimple.\n  The section 245(i) provision, which expired last April, allows \nundocumented immigrants to seek permanent residency without leaving the \nUnited States, if--if--they pay a $1,000 fee and have a close relative \nor employer sponsor them. Without the provision, these immigrants would \nbe forced to leave the country, and under tougher illegal immigration \nreforms passed in 1996, be barred from reentering for up to 10 years.\n  If waiving tougher penalties for illegal aliens is not a form of \namnesty, then I don't know what is.\n  Those who support reviving the 245(i) provision impress upon us that \nthere are many, many individuals who came to this country legally, but \nbecame lost in the huge backlog of paperwork at the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. Thus their visas expired while they were \nawaiting the processing of paperwork and they continued to live in the \nUnited States illegally and undetected.\n  I don't doubt that many of these individuals are well-meaning and \nhave attempted to follow the law. I recognize that many of these \nindividuals, if not for some type of legal exemption, will have to \nleave the country and be separated from their families. But we must not \nforget that three of the September 11 terrorists were living in the \nUnited States on expired visas. An additional two terrorists--Mohammad \nAtta and Marwan al-Shehhi tried to change their visa status while they \nwere in the United States, and, thus, were allowed to begin their \nflight training at a Florida school. And as we learned in these last \nfew days, not only did the Immigration and Naturalization Service never \ncatch them, but months after September 11, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service was still issuing paperwork clearing the way for \nthese two terrorists to enter the stream of American society.\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\n  These terrorists weren't hiding from the system, they were exploiting \nthe flaws in the system. Reviving the 245(i) provision reopens another \ncrack in the system through which a potential terrorist can crawl. What \nthe CNN story says to me is not that we should be more lenient with \nvisa applicants, but that we should be much tougher, with visa \napplicants.\n  The section 245(i) provision poses a dangerous risk to our border \nsecurity by compromising the all-important State Department background \nchecks being conducted on potential immigrants in their home countries. \nBy allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to apply for \npermanent residency in our country, section 245(i) allows them to \nsidestep face-to-face interviews at U.S. consulates in their own \ncountries. U.S. consular officers abroad offer unmatched expertise in \ntheir host country's social conditions. They are knowledgeable of \npolice records. They are knowledgeable of fraudulent document \noperations. They are knowledgeable of political extremist groups. Under \nsection 245(i), U.S. consulate officers would not fully exercise this \nexpertise in screening immigrants for permanent residency.\n  Supporters of the 245(i) provision will tell us that we can rely on a \nthorough INS background check. Ha-ha. Don't forget that if the visa \napplicants fail the INS security check, they are already inside the \ncountry. If they fail that check, they are already inside this country. \nAnd because of the ineptitude of the INS, they may have been living in \nthis country for months and, who knows, perhaps years. We cannot afford \nto have a weaker visa screening standard for illegal aliens who are \ngiven the opportunity to permanently reside in our country.\n  Moreover, an extension of the 245(i) provision would contribute \nsignificantly to the INS' dangerously overloaded processing backlog. \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service currently faces a backlog of \nroughly 4 million cases, and we can expect an additional half a million \nvisa application filings if section 245(i) is revived. The fact that \nthe INS is notifying a Florida flight school of Mohammed Atta's student \nvisa approval 6 months after the September 11 attacks clearly suggests \nthat the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot handle further \nincreases in its workload. What's more, it does not make a whit of \nsense to place these new obligations on an agency that both the \nadministration and Members of Congress are suggesting will undergo \ndramatic reforms in the coming months.\n  All of that is to say nothing about the message that we send abroad \nto potential immigrants who are waiting patiently to legally enter this \ncountry. Section 245(i) acts as an incentive, a lure, for illegal \nimmigration by suggesting that it is quicker and more convenient to \nenter the country illegally than to wait outside the United States to \ncomplete the visa application process.\n  These are serious concerns that the Senate will need to address \nbefore it acts on this issue. The American people and the Congress \nshould know the answers to these questions. In fact, there are a number \nof questions that ought to be raised as we consider changes to our \nimmigration system, but I am becoming increasingly doubtful that the \nadministration really wants to provide the answers.\n  The administration has been very quiet about its reasons for asking \nthe Congress to renew the 245(i) provision. The White House issued only \na three-paragraph statement last week in supporting the House-passed \nextension of 245(i), which states in the first paragraph:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. \n     1885 . . . This legislation reflects the Administration's \n     philosophy that government policies should recognize the \n     importance of families and help to strengthen them.\n\n  Mr. President, I support recognizing the importance of families. I am \nsure that every Senator here is all for families. In fact, I have yet \nto meet an anti-family politician.\n  But this Government's first obligation, especially in light of what \nhappened on September 11, ought to be that of protection of American \nfamilies, and the 245(i) provision does not meet that test in the wake \nof September 11.\n  Last week, the Homeland Security Director unveiled a color-coded \nsystem to alert Americans of varying levels of terrorism threats. \nGovernor Ridge warned that the United States remains on an elevated \nthreat level and that the corresponding yellow light signifies that \nthere is still a ``significant threat'' of a terrorist attack. \nCertainly, the administration would want to explain to the American \npeople, as well as to the Congress, why an amnesty that streamlines and \nshortcuts background checks for illegal aliens is not a threat to our \ndomestic security.\n  The suggestion has been raised in the media that the House passed \nthis amnesty, at the President's request, so that Mr. Bush would have a \nlegislative achievement to tout at his meeting with Mexican President \nVicente Fox this week. The broader amnesty for 3 million illegal \nMexican immigrants that the President proposed prior to the September \n11 attacks has been indefinitely shelved, and it has been suggested \nthat an extension of the section 245(i) provision is a substitute for \nthat proposal. Last week the Washington Times quoted the majority whip \nin the other body as saying, ``The president says he needs it, and \nwe're going to do it.'' The paper also quoted a Republican aide saying, \n``That's the only reason we're doing it. What the president wants, the \npresident gets.''\n  I hope that is not the case. I hope that party politics is not the \nsole consideration in a matter as grave as this.\n  The suggestion has also been raised that the House passed an \nextension of Section 245(i), and included it as part of a so-called \nborder security bill, to pressure the Senate into quickly passing \nsimilar border security legislation that is pending before it. Well, \nthis Senator from, West Virginia will not be pressured into passing \nlegislation. The Senate is a deliberative body. Senators have a \nresponsibility to consider and to throughly debate legislation that \ncomes before this body, especially legislation that raises as many \nconcerns as section 245(i). I raise these concerns and I shall continue \nto raise them. The administration chose not to address these concerns \nlast week when the House acted on the 245(i) provision.\n  Mr. President, the American people and the Congress cannot be \nexpected to have confidence in our efforts to secure our borders, if \nthey see the administration advocating legislation that seems to fly in \nthe face of tighter border security. The administration must explain \nwhy, on the same day that the Homeland Security Director would issue an \nelevated state of alert, the White House would push through the House \nan amnesty for illegal aliens that would weaken our visa screening \nprocesses. Doesn't make much sense, does it? The right hand seems not \nto know what the left hand is doing.\n  It is lunacy--sheer lunacy--that the President would request, and the \nHouse would pass, such an amnesty at this time. That point seems \nobvious to the American people, if not to the administration.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S1988-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1988-S1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CREDIT CARD USE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is quite obvious to everybody that \nthe United States is at war and that every effort must be made to \nsupport our men and women in uniform, particularly those who are \nputting their lives on the line. And who knows, that might be anybody \nwho is in the military at a time of war. You don't go to war if you \ndon't go to war to win.\n  It is with some frustration that I address the Senate on a problem \nwithin the Department of Defense where it seems as if everybody is not \npulling together as a team ought to pull together in order to win the \nwar.\n  I want to share my views on the latest results of an ongoing \noversight investigation of the Department of Defense credit card use. \nThis is a joint effort supported by the General Accounting Office. I \nhave had the privilege of\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nteaming up with Congressman Horn of California on this issue. What we \nare trying to do is put the spotlight on a very costly problem at the \nDepartment of Defense. The Pentagon is a bureaucratic place and, as \nmost bureaucratic places, if there are problems, the glare of the \npublic spotlight is never welcome. But shedding light is the heart and \nsoul of one of our most important responsibilities as Members of \nCongress, and that is to do oversight and make sure the laws are \nfaithfully executed and that the money is spent according to the intent \nof Congress. Too often, we just spend our time worrying about passing \nlaws rather than making sure laws are followed and money is spent \naccording to the intent of Congress. So oversight is very important.\n  This is a way of bringing exposure to problems, and exposure is a \ngreat remedy enhancer. Every time I peer into the inner recesses of the \nDepartment of Defense credit card account, I see more abuse and fraud \nand that makes me ask myself: How bad can it really get? So we need to \nkeep the spotlight on full power and the beam focused until we get to \nthe bottom of the pit and figure out what needs to be done.\n  Today there are 1.7 million Department of Defense credit cards in \ncirculation that generate over $9 billion in expenditures annually. \nThere are two types of credit cards: purchase cards and travel cards. \nThere are 1.4 million travel cards versus only 200,500 purchase cards. \nMost of the dollars, however, are on purchase card transactions, albeit \nthat there is only about 12 percent as many purchase cards as travel \ncards. So we have $6.1 billion per year generated versus $3 billion for \nthe travel cards.\n  A credit card, as everybody knows, is a financial instrument. It is, \nin fact, a license to spend money. Every shred of evidence that I have \nseen says that the internal controls at the Pentagon are weak or \nnonexistent. Credit cards in a zero-controlled environment are very \ndangerous and not very good for the taxpayers of this country. That \nmeans there is an army of 1.7 million strong, authorized to spend money \nwith no checks and balances. The potential for abuse and fraud is \nvirtually unlimited.\n  I understand the thinking behind the credit cards when they were \nfirst put out by the Defense Department. That thinking and the theory \nbehind it is very good. Unfortunately, it is the execution that is so \npoor. We want the men and women serving in the Armed Forces to have the \ntools they need to carry out their duties effectively. A credit card is \none of those modern devices that is supposed to make it easier for them \nto get the job done quickly and effectively, without a whole lot of \nwasteful paperwork. Who is going to argue with Government having less \npaperwork? But in simplifying the travel and purchase processors, each \ncardholder is given the authority to spend money. The authority to \nspend money in the name of the taxpayers is an awesome responsibility. \nThat authority carries heavy responsibilities.\n  Unfortunately, this awesome responsibility is not taken very \nseriously at the Pentagon. That criticism is not directed at Secretary \nRumsfeld. He is trying hard to clean up a longstanding financial mess. \nMy criticism is directed at the bureaucrats who are supposed to oversee \nthe program. The Department of Defense credit cards are issued willy-\nnilly with no credit checks. Just think of that--credit cards to people \nwho are not given credit checks. The results are predictable. The cards \nare being abused with impunity. The Department of Defense credit cards \nare being taken on shopping sprees and the cardholders think they are \nimmune from punishment. The sad commentary is that they are immune from \npunishment. They should not be, but they are. That is the way it works \nout, I guess.\n\n  We have zero accountability with purchase cards and zero \naccountability with travel cards--until recently. There is a little \nimprovement in the area of travel cards. Now, the fact that there is \nzero accountability is a root cause of the problem. That is why we have \nto be overseeing this issue regularly--because of the lack of \naccountability. If there was accountability, none of this would be \nhappening.\n  The General Accounting Office is reporting on how bad the problem \nreally is. The General Accounting Office has examined 300 transactions \nat two Navy offices in San Diego. Now, just 300 transactions might \nsound to be too little to draw some conclusions, but the results just \nfrom those 300 are devastating and supports the evidence of a lack of \naccountability. Despite such a small sample, the General Accounting \nOffice has uncovered extensive fraud and abuse, and more is being found \neach day.\n  This is the tip of the iceberg, and here is a sample of how these \ncredit cards are abused: in bars, strip joints, and gambling casinos; \nfor large cash withdrawals from ATM machines; clothing at upscale \ndepartment stores, such as Macy's and Nordstrom; designer leather goods \nand expensive luggage; gift certificates, $1,500 each; $200 robots at \nToys 'R Us; groceries, kitchen appliances, and home computers. Get \nthis. They were even used for breast enlargement operations. You name \nit, it seems as if the people who have these credit cards do it, and it \nis all personal business. If they need it, they buy it with Department \nof Defense plastic, and they keep what they buy, no questions asked.\n  Now, there is a proposal to raise the purchase limit from $2,500--\nwhere it is now--to $25,000. As I see it, if that price goes up, if \nthat purchase limit goes up, new cars and homes are next, rather than \ngroceries and home computers.\n  The General Accounting Office's 300-transaction sample, with just 300 \npeople being investigated, yielded over a half million dollars in \nfraudulent and abusive purchases. Either the taxpayers or the bank gets \nstuck with the bill, depending upon which card is used. So in the case \nof the purchase card, when shopping is done, the Government is \nresponsible for paying the bill, and most bills are paid promptly with \nno questions asked. With a purchase card, the taxpayers get shafted \nupfront. To my knowledge, the Government has never asked anyone to \nreturn an unauthorized purchase or repay the money, even when abuse is \nknown to the authorities.\n\n  In the case of travel cards, by comparison, the responsibility of the \nindividual cardholder goes with the travel card expenses. The taxpayer \nat this point is out of the loop, at least upfront, but I will tell you \nhow they get stuck in the end.\n  When the cardholder of a travel card incurs legitimate travel \nexpenses, that person is supposed to file a travel voucher, get \nreimbursed, and then pass the money on to the bank; in this case, the \nBank of America has all these credit cards.\n  All too often, the cardholder simply pockets the money, the tax \ndollars, and then the bank, when the cardholder does not pay the bill, \nis left holding the bag. When the travel card is used to cover personal \nexpenses, which happens with alarming regularity, those bills are paid \nlate, very late, sometimes never, and in this case the military \npersonnel or the Department of Defense employees have no interest \ncharges, so the abuser gets an interest-free loan.\n  The bank has equipped the Pentagon with an antifraud detection \ndevice. It is called EAGLS. It gives agency program coordinators an \nonline capability to detect unauthorized transactions on any account, \nand it only takes a second to determine if a trooper is getting cash at \na local ATM machine without orders, but it does not work because no one \nis minding the store.\n  As I said at a hearing last July when I first brought this up, if the \nPentagon knows this is happening and if the Pentagon does nothing, it \nseems to me that makes the Department of Defense party to this bank \nrobbery, and the robbery is still in progress.\n  We have a bank upfront sustaining unacceptable losses and all \nconsumers doing business with that bank pay higher prices, and in the \nend the taxpayers get shafted, too, because when the bank has to write \noff this bad debt, it is written off as a business expense and that \nbank pays less corporate taxes to the Federal Treasury.\n  The only difference with the purchase card is the taxpayers get \nshafted upfront. In the case of Bank of America being shafted first, if \nthey have to write this off as bad debt--and there is a lot of bad \ndebt--they do not pay as much taxes, and so the taxpayers pay anyway.\n  The bank has reached a breaking point. Remember, this is the Bank of \nAmerica. It is losing too much money. So on February 11, 2001, the bank \nfired\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\na warning shot across the bow. The bank is turning up the pressure. It \ndeclared its intent to cancel the U.S. Army account, 413,029 of these \ncards at midnight, this month, this year. That got somebody's attention \nin a hurry, and negotiations are underway between the Bank of America \nand the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, you might say there is a glimmer of hope on the \nhorizon, and the reason for hope comes from a brandnew Department of \nDefense policy called salary offsets. One might call it garnishment of \nsalary.\n  Before I explain this new policy, it is important to understand why \nthe Department of Defense travel card program is teetering on the brink \nof disaster.\n  As of November last year, 46,572 Department of Defense personnel had \ndefaulted on more than $62 million in official travel expenses, and the \nbad debt was growing at the rate of $1 million per month, making the \nDepartment of Defense default rate six times the industry average.\n\n  Here is a government, which is supposed to be setting a good example, \nhaving a default rate six times what the bank would normally expect \nfrom anybody else using credit cards.\n  For a business that is interested in profit, a pile of bad debt, like \nwhat I am talking about, with no accountability makes for an \nintolerable situation. Something had to give.\n  In October of last year, the bank and Department of Defense agreed to \ntake action. The salary offset program was born. There are now 31,579 \naccounts enrolled in the offset program; in other words, a garnishment \nof wages. So far, the offset payments total $5.2 million.\n  Salary offsets provide some measure of accountability, but there are \nlimitations. For one, the money was taken from the bank in big chunks, \nbut it is repaid in little dribbles here and there over a long period \nof time. There are loopholes. Ten percent of the unpaid accounts will \nslip right through the net due to retirements, bankruptcies, and dollar \noffset limits. The bank still expects about $2 million to $4 million a \nyear to fall through the cracks and be written off as bad debt, but \nthat is considered somewhat better because that is consistent with the \nindustry average.\n  In addition, most of the older accounts in default will never be \ncaptured by offsets. The bank will still have to eat $40 million of \nunrecoverable debt. Even though there is not any hard data yet, the \nbank expects salary offsets to reduce the default rate, in their words, \nto negligible levels. That is the good news, but there is still bad \nnews.\n  Salary offsets are having little or no effect on the high delinquency \nrates. Delinquencies have actually risen since the salary offset policy \nhas been put in place. That is because offsets do not kick in for 120-\nplus days, 4 months past billing. Payments are due within 30 days of \nbilling.\n  Today the Department of Defense has outstanding balances of $370 \nmillion. About 30 percent of the dollars owed for official travel \nexpenses are more than 30 days past due, and 15 percent are 60 days \npast due. One in five Department of Defense accounts is overdue for \npayment. That is four to five times the industry average.\n  The 3-month gap between the payment due date and offsets means the \nbank has to float a loan--it is a free loan for Department of Defense \nabusers--that costs the bank $4 million to $5 million a year.\n  Wouldn't you like to get an interest-free loan this way by using a \nGovernment credit card?\n  A prime driver behind delinquencies is the use of the card to cover \npersonal expenses. Mr. President, you may remember I mentioned several \ncases in a speech last year about egregious abuse of the Department of \nDefense credit cards. There is the case of Marine Sgt. A. Lopez who ran \nup a $19,581 bill for personal expenses and then left the service and \nthe unpaid bill when his enlistment was up.\n  We have a person by the name of P. Falcon, Army, with an unpaid bill \nof $9,847, including $3,100 spent at a nightclub. We have a dead sailor \nnamed T. Hayes who spent $3,521; Q. Rivera, Army Reserve, whose wife \nspent $13,011 on a shopping spree in Puerto Rico. And we have R. \nWalker, Air National Guard, with an unpaid balance of $7,428, including \nhis wife's gambling debts.\n  Now, in the past 8 months, since this was exposed, only one of these \naccounts has been paid off, and that was P. Falcon, who had the bill \nfor $9,847, including $3,100 spent at the nightclub. He has paid his \nbill. Every expense posted to his account was personal. However, he is \nunder investigation.\n  The others have the same large, unpaid balances that I told my \ncolleagues about last July. Some are under investigation. More \naggressive offsets and late fees might help to bring this kind of abuse \nto a screeching halt. I hope the Defense Department proceeds down that \ncourse.\n  Some real leadership at the top would also help. One of the most \npowerful elements of leadership is a setting of examples of excellence. \nSetting a good example should include paying credit card bills on time.\n  Officers in our military branches should always set the example. \nUnfortunately, the bad news is there are 713 commissioned officers who \nhave defaulted on $1.1 million in charges. All of these accounts are in \nchargeoff status or unpaid for 7 months or more. The rank of these \nofficers ranges from junior lieutenants up to senior colonels and a \nNavy captain. Individual unpaid balances top out at $8,000. Some of the \ncharges on these accounts look suspicious and need investigation.\n  Commissioned officers who run up $1.1 million in bad debts set a \nterrible example for the rank and file. Somebody over in the Pentagon \nneeds to come down hard on officer scofflaws.\n  Credit card abuse in the military will never stop until officers \nclean up their act. I have provided a list of these 713 commissioned \nofficers who defaulted on their accounts, along with the unpaid balance \nfor each officer. I have also sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld \nbecause I want him to see the list and determine what action should be \ntaken in this matter because officers should be setting an example, \nalthough anybody who commits this sort of action is doing wrong, \nparticularly in time of war when every resource we have in the Defense \nDepartment and elsewhere ought to go towards winning that war.\n  One last example: The General Accounting Office has uncovered a \ndisturbing case involving alleged purchase and travel card fraud by one \nperson, Ms. Tanya Mays. She was assigned to the Navy Public Works \nDepartment San Diego. Ms. Mays took her purchase card on a Christmas \nshopping spree, and in a few short days ran up a bill of $11,551 at \nMacy's, Nordstrom, and Circuit City. She bought gift certificates worth \n$7,500, a Compaq computer, Amana range, groceries, and clothing, all at \ntaxpayer expense.\n  She presented the bill to her Navy supervisor who signed and \ncertified for payment, and it was paid in full. She also used her \ntravel card to buy airline tickets for her son that cost another $722. \nWhen Ms. Mays left the Public Works Department, she was allowed to keep \nher purchase card. I guess they figured she might need it again, and \nthey were right. She did, this time for a personal car rental, and \nPublic Works gladly paid the bill.\n  I find this Mays case very troublesome. She has allegedly made a \nnumber of fraudulent purchases. Yet there seems to be a total disregard \nfor accountability. Ms. Mays has not been asked to repay the money she \nallegedly stole. No disciplinary action has been taken. In fact, she \nwas moved to a bigger job and given a promotion in October 2001. She is \nnow assigned to the Army's top level financial management office in the \nPentagon, and I am told she is in charge of cash integration.\n\n  When one of these cases is put under a microscope, it seems as if the \nwhole problem comes into sharper focus.\n  Her case is not unique. There is another one. I am going to call him \nNick. His last name is Fungcharoen. I am not going to repeat that, \nobviously. He used his travel card exclusively for personal expenses. \nOver a period of 2 years, he charged nearly $35,000, including medical \nexpenses of $4,000. On the surface, it appears as if he spent most of \nthe money romancing a waitress he met at the Hooter's Bar and Grill in \nJacksonville, FL. Her name was Jennifer Gilpin.\n  After they got to know each other, she asked him for money to have \nher breast enlargement operation. He agreed and took her to a surgeon. \nDr. John J. Obi, M.D., performed the operation, and Nick used his \nDepartment of Defense credit card to pay the bill.\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n  When the relationship soured, the case ended up in small claims \ncourt. Nick had retired on disability and wanted his money back. The \njudge became alarmed that Nick testified proudly he had used his \ngovernment-issued credit card to pay the doctor. Nick whipped out the \ncard in the courtroom and showed it to the judge. The judge examined \nthe card and read the inscription that says, ``for official government \ntravel only.''\n  The judge stated in total disbelief, ``You paid for this breast \nenlargement with a government credit card?''\n  After the revelation, the judge simply said, ``Let's not go there.''\n  That case is unique. It is unique because the cardholder paid his \nbill, though not always on time. So I have two problems with all of \nthat.\n  The point is, we have to get this stopped. We have to make sure all \nof the resources of the Defense Department are not used for playing \ngames with government credit cards but are used to make sure we win the \nwar on terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2356) to amend the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today with the opening of this debate, \nwe take the first step toward passing the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan \nbill in the Senate and take one of the final steps toward banning soft \nmoney.\n  I am grateful for all the hard work that has brought us to this \nmoment--of course, the work done by the reform community, the work done \nby the outstanding leaders in the other body to pass this bill last \nmonth, and, most of all, the work done by my colleagues here in the \nSenate, under the leadership of Senator McCain of Arizona.\n  A year ago, we had an excellent debate about campaign finance reform \nhere on this floor. In fact, it began almost exactly a year ago, on \nMarch 19. We had an outstanding exchange of ideas, we held numerous \nvotes, and we worked hard on both sides of the issue. I believe that \nthat debate enriched this body, and that it enriched the McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  In the end, the will of the Senate was done, and we passed the bill \nin a strong bipartisan vote of 59-41. A year later, we are here again \non the floor working to pass reform. But this time it is different. \nThis time, we already know where the Senate stands. And we know that \nall that stands between this bill and the President's desk is the \nSenate's final consideration of the bill this week.\n  With the strong vote for McCain-Feingold last year, the Senate \nrecognized the importance of our responsibility as representatives of \nthe people and as stewards of democracy. As long as we allow soft money \nto exist, we risk damaging our credibility when we make the decisions \nabout the issues that the people elected us to make.\n  The people sent us here to wrestle with some very tough issues. They \nhave vested us with the power to make decisions that have a profound \nimpact on their lives. That is a responsibility that we take very \nseriously. But today, when we weigh the pros and cons of legislation, \nmany people think we also weigh the size of the contributions we got \nfrom interests on both sides of the issue. And when those contributions \ncan be a million dollars, or even more, it seems obvious to most people \nthat we would reward, or at least listen especially carefully to, our \nbiggest donors.\n  So a year ago we voted to change the system. And now, both bodies \nhave fully and fairly debated the issues and discussed the merits of \nthis bill. We have given this important issue the time and \nconsideration it deserves. Now, very simply, it is time to get the job \ndone. It is time to get this bill to the President.\n  I believe the Senate is ready to repair a broken system. And make no \nmistake about it, the way the soft money and issue ad loopholes are \nbeing abused today has devastated the campaign finance system. More \nthan that, these loopholes have weakened the effectiveness of this body \nand cast doubt on the work we do. They have weakened the public's trust \nin government; in a very real sense, they have weakened our democracy.\n  I know many of us here are tired of seeing headlines that imply that \nlegislative outcomes here are not a result of our own will or good \njudgment, but a result of our desire to please wealthy donors. We are \ntired of those headlines, and so are the American people. The people \nknow that the system can function better when soft money doesn't render \nour hard money limits meaningless, and when phony issue ads don't make \na joke of our election laws. And they also know that this is our best \nchance in years to do something to effect real change.\n  This week we can show them, just as we did a year ago in this Senate, \nthat we are ready for change, and that we are going to make that change \nhappen.\n  As we embark on this discussion about campaign finance reform on the \nfloor today, it is remarkable how much has changed since the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I introduced this bill in September of 1995, and even \nsince we stood here a year ago. Both sides of Capitol Hill have finally \nacknowledged the demand of the American people that we ban soft money \ncontributions, after years of soft money scandals and embarrassments \nthat have chipped away at the integrity of this body.\n  As many commentators have noted, the collapse of Enron gave the \ncampaign finance reform issue momentum prior to the House vote in \nFebruary. But I would note that our effort has been given momentum by \nmany other campaign finance scandals that have occurred just in the \nlast few years. I think they are actually more than we care to \nremember.\n  Soft money has had an increasingly prominent role in party \nfundraising over the last 12 years. In 1988 the parties began raising \n$100,000 contributions for the Bush and Dukakis campaigns--an amount \nunheard of before the 1988 race. By the 1992 election, the year I was \nelected to this body, soft money fundraising by the major parties had \ndoubled, rising to $86 million. In successive election cycles the \namount of soft money raised by the parties has simply skyrocketed. In \n2000 soft money totals were more than five times what they were in \n1992. It was already a lot in 1992. In 2000, it was five times already \nwhat it had been 8 years earlier.\n  And along with the money, came the scandals--soft money and scandals \nhave gone hand in hand for more than a decade now. First, the mere fact \nthat soft money was being raised in such enormous amounts was a scandal \nin the early 1990s. But then we had the Lincoln Bedroom, and the White \nHouse\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nCoffees, and Charlie Trie and John Huang and Johnny Chung. And then, of \ncourse, the Presidential pardons coming under suspicion at the \nconclusion of the Clinton administration. We faced questions in this \nbody as we considered bills regulating tobacco and telecommunications \nand the Patients' Bill of Rights, while at the same time we raised soft \nmoney from the industries and interest groups that had a huge stake in \nthose bills. The public watched with increasing skepticism as we \nappeared to act--or fail to act--on legislation based on the demands of \nwealthy soft money donors. With the enormous influx of soft money being \nraised by both parties, with every vote we cast the public wondered, \nand had reason to wonder, was it the money?\n  Of course of late we have seen yet another scandal take shape--the \nEnron debacle. As the Enron story unfolded, I think many of us were \nreminded why the Supreme Court, in its famous 1976 Buckley versus Valeo \ndecision, said that the appearance of corruption, not just corruption \nitself, justifies congressional action to place some limits on our \ncampaign finance system.\n  In the Buckley case, the Supreme Court understood that public \nmistrust of government is destructive to democracy. From a \nconstitutional point of view, it hardly matters whether that mistrust \nis based on actual misconduct or simply its appearance.\n  In the case of Enron's collapse, the need to address public mistrust \nhas been paramount for Congress and the administration as they have \ninvestigated the company's alleged wrongdoing. When a corporation such \nas Enron leaves devastated employees and fleeced shareholders in its \nwake, the public depends on us--on Congress and the administration--to \ndetermine what went wrong and defend the public interest. But the \npotential for a conflict of interest in a case such as this is clear: \nMany of the elected officials who were asked to sit in judgment of \nEnron, including Members of Congress, the Attorney General, and the \nPresident of the United States, have been accepting, and even asking \nfor, campaign contributions from Enron for years. And the political \nparties have pocketed more than $3.5 million in unregulated, unlimited \nsoft money from Enron since 1991.\n  Congress has moved forward with the investigations into Enron's \nconduct, despite the potential conflict of interest the political \ncontributions might pose. The reality is that this is all too familiar \nterritory for Congress. Every day Members of Congress accept huge \ncampaign contributions with one hand and vote on issues affecting their \ncontributors with the other. And, every day the public naturally \nquestions whether their Representatives are giving special treatment to \nthe wealthy interests that fund their campaigns and bankroll their \npolitical parties.\n  The Enron scandal, and all the soft money scandals that have come \nbefore, illustrate the permanent conflict of interest--the permanent \nconflict of interest--that unlimited soft money contributions to the \nparties have created for elected officials in the Capitol and at the \nWhite House. Both parties have gladly accepted Enron's soft money \ncontributions over the years, and now those contributions are \ncompromising our ability to address the Enron collapse, and countless \nother issues that come before the Congress. More than that--more than \nthat--they compromise the public's confidence in our ability, and our \nwill, to do anything about it.\n  While eliminating soft money will not cure the campaign finance \nsystem of every ill, it will, in fact, end a system of unlimited \ndonations that has blatantly put political access and influence up for \nsale. Enron is just one in a long line of corporations, unions, and \nwealthy individuals that has exploited the soft money loophole to buy \ninfluence with Congress and the executive branch at the very highest \nlevels. So banning soft money will help to untangle the web of money \nand influence that has made Congress and the White House so vulnerable \nto the appearance of corruption for far too long.\n  In the coming days we will face the final test of this long \nlegislative battle and take our final steps toward enacting these hard-\nfought reforms into law. Passing campaign finance reform is within our \ngrasp, and so, finally, is a renewed integrity for our democratic \nprocess.\n  Of course, while the soft money ban is central to the bill, and is \nthe most important feature of the bill, this bill contains reforms on a \nvariety of other issues.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, of course, you were one of the \nprincipal authors of very important provisions relating to so-called \nphony issue ads that make the bill even stronger.\n  A number of amendments were added on the Senate floor last year that \nimproved and strengthened the bill. Almost all of them are in the bill \nnow before us that we hope, by the end of the week, will be sent to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the debate is finally here. Our bipartisan coalition \nis strong and resolute. And the moment for reform has arrived.\n  After 6\\1/2\\ years of work on this bill, and more than a decade of \nscandals that have threatened the integrity of our legislative process, \nI do believe this body is ready to get the job done for the American \npeople. I believe the American people have waited long enough.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\nThe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002--Section by Section Analysis\n\n            TITLE I: REDUCTION OF SPECIAL INTEREST INFLUENCE\n\n       Sec. 101(a). Soft Money of Political Parties. Creates new \n     Section 323 of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to \n     prohibit soft money in federal elections.\n       Sec. 323(a). National Committees. Prohibits national party \n     committees and entities controlled by the parties from \n     raising, spending, or transferring money that is not subject \n     to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements \n     of the FECA (i.e., soft money).\n       Sec. 323(b). State, District and Local Committees. Subject \n     to the Levin amendment, requires any money spent on ``Federal \n     election activities'' by state or local parties, and entities \n     controlled or acting on behalf of those parties or an \n     association of state or local candidates to be subject to the \n     limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of the \n     FECA (i.e., hard money.) This will close the state party \n     loophole. ``Federal election activities'' are defined in \n     Section 101(b) of the bill.\n       Under the Levin amendment, the section permits state or \n     local parties to spend soft money on voter registration and \n     get out the vote activity that does not mention a federal \n     candidate as long as no single soft money donor gives more \n     than $10,000 per year to any state or local party \n     organization for such purposes, the money is not spent on \n     broadcast advertising other than ads that solely mention \n     state or local candidates, the money is not raised by federal \n     candidates, national parties, or party committees acting \n     jointly. The spending of this money will require an \n     allocation of hard money to soft money. The state or local \n     party organization must raise the hard and soft money for \n     this allocation on its own, and money to be spent under this \n     provision may not be transferred between party organizations.\n       Sec. 323(c). Fundraising Costs. Requires national, state, \n     and local parties to use hard money to raise money that will \n     be used on Federal election activities, as defined by the \n     bill.\n       Sec. 323(d). Tax-Exempt Organizations. Prohibits national, \n     state, and local parties or entities controlled by such \n     parties from making contributions to or soliciting donations \n     for 501(c) organizations which spend money in connection with \n     federal elections or 527 organizations (other than entities \n     that are political committees under the FECA, state/district/\n     local party committees, or state or local candidates' \n     campaign committees). This provision will prevent the parties \n     from collecting soft money and laundering it through other \n     organizations engaged in federal electioneering.\n       Sec. 323(e). Federal Candidates. Prohibits federal \n     candidates or individuals holding federal office and any \n     entities established, financed, controlled, or acting on \n     behalf of such candidates or officeholders from raising or \n     spending soft money in connection with federal elections. The \n     restrictions of this section do not apply to federal \n     officeholders who are running for state office and spending \n     non-Federal money on their own elections, so long as they do \n     not mention other federal candidates who are on the ballot in \n     the same election and are not their opponents for state \n     office. The restrictions also do not prevent a federal \n     candidate or officeholder from attending, speaking at, or \n     appearing as a featured guest at a fundraising event for a \n     state or local political party.\n       Candidates are permitted to solicit up to $20,000 from an \n     individual per year specifically for voter registration and \n     get out of\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n     the vote activities carried out by 501(c) organizations. The \n     provision also clarifies that candidates may solicit \n     unlimited funds for 501(c) organizations where the \n     solicitation does not specify the use of the money, and the \n     organization's principal purpose is not voter registration or \n     get out the vote activities.\n       Sec. 323(f). State Candidates. Prohibits candidates for \n     state or local office from spending soft money on public \n     communications that promote or attack a clearly identified \n     candidate for Federal office. Exempts communications which \n     refer to a federal candidate who is also a candidate for \n     state or local office.\n       Taken together, these soft money provisions are designed to \n     shut down the soft money loophole as comprehensively as \n     possible. By including entities established, maintained, \n     controlled, or acting on behalf of federal and state \n     officeholders and candidates, they also prohibit so-called \n     ``leadership PACs'' or ``candidate PACs'' from raising or \n     spending soft money in connection with Federal elections and \n     are designed to prevent the evasion of the law by federal or \n     state candidates or officeholders using 501(c)(4) or 527 \n     organizations.\n       Sec. 101(b). Definitions. Provides definitions for certain \n     terms used in the soft money ban.\n       Federal election activity means voter registration \n     activities within 120 days before a federal election, get out \n     the vote activity and generic campaign activity in connection \n     with an election in which federal candidates are on the \n     ballot (even if state candidates are also on the ballot), and \n     public communications that refer to a clearly identified \n     federal candidate and support or oppose a candidate for that \n     office (regardless of whether those communications expressly \n     advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.) These are \n     the activities that state parties must pay for with hard \n     money (except as specifically provided under the bill).\n       Generic campaign activity means campaign activities like \n     general party advertising that promote a political party but \n     not a candidate.\n       Public communication means a communication to the general \n     public by means of broadcast, cable, satellite, newspaper, \n     magazine, outdoor advertising, mass mailing, telephone bank, \n     or any other general public political advertising.\n       Mass mailing is a mailing of more than 500 identical or \n     substantially similar pieces within any 30 day period.\n       Telephone bank means more than 500 calls of an identical or \n     substantially similar nature within a 30 day period.\n       Sec. 102. Increased contribution limits for state \n     committees of political parties. Increases the amount that \n     individuals can give to state parties from $5,000 to $10,000. \n     See Section 307 for additional increases in contribution \n     limits.\n       Sec. 103. Reporting requirements. Requires national \n     political party committees, including congressional campaign \n     committees to report all receipts and disbursements and state \n     party committees to report all receipts and disbursements and \n     state party committees to report all receipts and \n     disbursements for Federal election activities and receipts \n     and disbursements for activities permitted by the Levin \n     amendment (i.e., spending of capped soft money donations on \n     certain forms of voter registration and get-out-the-vote). \n     Requires itemized reporting of receipts or disbursements of \n     over $200. Eliminates the building fund exception to the \n     FECA's definition of contribution. Accounts to raise money \n     for office buildings were one of the original soft money \n     accounts before the loopholes exploded in the 1996 election \n     with the use of soft money for political advertising.\n\n             TITLE II: NON-CANDIDATE CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES\n\n\n               Subtitle A--Electioneering Communications\n\n       Section 201-203 have come to be known as the ``Snowe-\n     Jeffords amendment.''\n       Sec. 201. Disclosure of Electioneering Communications. \n     Requires anyone who spends over $10,000 in a calendar year on \n     electioneering communications to file a disclosure statement \n     within 24 hours after reaching that amount of spending and \n     again within 24 hours of each additional $10,000 of spending. \n     Electioneering communications are defined as broadcast, cable \n     or satellite communications that mention the name or show the \n     likeness of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office \n     within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary \n     election, convention, or caucus, and which is targeted to the \n     candidate's state/district. Electioneering communications do \n     not include news broadcasts, communications that constitute \n     independent expenditures because they contain express \n     advocacy, or candidate debates and advertisements for \n     candidate debates. The FEC may promulgate additional \n     exceptions for advertisements that do not attack, oppose, \n     promote or support a clearly identified Federal candidate.\n       The disclosure statement must identify the person or entity \n     making the disbursement, the principal place of business of \n     that person if it is not an individual, the amount of each \n     disbursement of over $200 and the identify of the person \n     receiving the disbursement, and the election to which the \n     communication pertains and the candidate or candidates who \n     are identified. If the disbursement is made from a segregated \n     account to which only individuals can contribute, the \n     disclosure statement must also reveal the names and addresses \n     of the contributors of $1,000 or more to that account. If the \n     disbursement is not made from such a segregated account then \n     all donors of $1,000 to the organization making the \n     expenditure must be disclosed. Money in the segregated \n     account can be used for purposes other than electioneering \n     communications, and the spending on other activities need not \n     be disclosed, but all contributors to the account must be \n     informed that their money might be used for electioneering \n     communications.\n       Sec. 202. Coordinated Communications As Contributions. \n     Makes clear that electioneering communications that are \n     coordinated with candidates or with political parties are \n     deemed to be contributions to the candidate supported by the \n     communication. Because contributions to candidates are \n     limited in the case of individuals, or prohibited in the case \n     of groups (other than through a PAC), this provision \n     essentially prohibits electioneering communications from \n     being coordinated with candidates or parties.\n       Sec. 203. Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements \n     for Electioneering Communications. Bars the use of corporate \n     and union treasury money for electioneering communications. \n     Corporations and unions are prohibited from spending their \n     treasury money on electioneering communications, and groups \n     and individuals may not use corporate or union treasury money \n     for such ads (corporations and unions could finance such \n     advertisements through their political action committees). \n     The provision includes a number of special operating rules \n     designed to prevent evasion of this prohibition through pass-\n     throughs, laundering, or contribution swaps. 501(c)(4) and \n     527 organizations, which are technically corporations, are \n     permitted to make electioneering communications as long as \n     they use individual money contributed by U.S. citizens, U.S. \n     nationals, or permanent legal residents and make the \n     disclosures required by Section 201 (but see Section 204). If \n     they derive income from business activities or accept \n     contributions from corporations or unions, they must pay for \n     electioneering communications from a separate account to \n     which only individuals can contribute.\n       Sec. 204. Rules Relating to Certain Targeted Electioneering \n     Communications. Withdraws Section 203's exemption for \n     501(c)(4) or 527 organizations that run electioneering \n     communications targeted to the electorate of the candidate \n     mentioned in the communications. The net effect of this \n     provision is to apply the Snowe-Jeffords prohibition on \n     running sham issue ads paid for with corporate or union \n     treasury funds to non profit advocacy groups (501(c)(4)'s) \n     and political organizations (527's). Should this provision be \n     struck down as unconstitutional, the prohibition on the use \n     of union or for-profit corporation treasury money for \n     electioneering communications would remain intact, as would \n     the disclosure requirements.\n\n\n          Subtitle B--Independent and Coordinated Expenditures\n\n       Sec. 211. Definition of Independent Expenditure. Clarifies \n     the statutory definition of independent expenditure to mean \n     an expenditure expressly advocating the election or defeat of \n     a clearly defined candidate that is not made in coordination \n     with a candidate.\n       Sec. 212. Reporting Requirements for Certain Independent \n     Expenditures. Requires any person, including a political \n     committee, who makes independent expenditures totaling \n     $10,000 or more until the 20th day before the election to \n     file a report with the FEC within 48 hours. An additional \n     report must be filed within 48 hours of any additional \n     independent expenditures of $10,000 or more. In the last 20 \n     days before the election, a report must be filed within 24 \n     hours of each independent expenditure totaling more than \n     $1,000.\n       Sec. 213. Independent Versus Coordinated Expenditures by \n     Party. Requires political parties to choose in each election \n     between making the limited expenditures permitted to be \n     coordinated with a candidate under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441a(d) and \n     making unlimited independent expenditures. Parties would make \n     that choice with their first expenditure with respect to a \n     particular election after their nominee has been chosen. If a \n     party makes an independent expenditure, it may not make a \n     coordinated expenditure with respect to that election. If it \n     makes a coordinated expenditure, it may not make an \n     independent expenditure. For purposes of this section, all \n     national and state party committees are considered to be one \n     entity so a national party cannot make an independent \n     expenditure if a state party has made a coordinated \n     expenditure with respect to a particular candidate.\n       Sec. 214. Coordination with Candidates or Political \n     Parties. Provides that an expenditure made by a person, other \n     than a candidate, in coordination with a political party will \n     be treated as a contribution to the party. In addition, the \n     FEC's current regulations on coordinated communications paid \n     for by persons other than candidates are repealed nine months \n     after enactment. The provision instructs the FEC to \n     promulgate new regulations on coordination between candidates \n     or parties and outside groups, addressing a number of \n     different situations where coordination might be found. It \n     provides that the new regulations shall not require formal \n     collaboration or agreement to establish coordination.\n\n                        TITLE III: MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Sec. 301. Use of Contributed Amounts for Certain Purposes. \n     Codifies FEC regulations\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\n     relating to the personal use of campaign funds by candidates. \n     Contributions will be considered converted to personal use if \n     they are used for an expense that would exist irrespective of \n     the campaign or duties as an officeholder, including home \n     mortgage or rent, clothing, vacation expenses, tuition \n     payments, noncampaign-related automobile expenses, and a \n     variety of other items.\n       Sec. 302. Prohibition of Fundraising on Federal Property. \n     Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 607 to provide controlling legal \n     authority that it is unlawful to solicit or receive a \n     campaign contribution from a person who is located in a \n     federal room or building. It is also unlawful to solicit or \n     receive a campaign contribution while located in federal room \n     or building.\n       Sec. 303. Strengthening Foreign Money Ban. Prohibits \n     foreign nationals from making any contribution to a committee \n     of a political party or any contribution in connection with \n     federal, state or local elections, including any \n     electioneering communications. This clarifies that the ban on \n     contributions to foreign nationals applies to soft money \n     donations.\n       Section 304. Modification of Individual Contribution Limits \n     in Response to Expenditures From Personal Funds. Allows \n     Senate candidates who face opponents who spend large amounts \n     of their personal wealth to raise larger contributions from \n     individual donors. The provision sets up three different \n     ``triggers'' that vary according to the size of the \n     candidate's state. When a wealthy candidate's personal \n     spending passes the first trigger amount, the individual \n     contribution limits are tripled. At the second trigger, the \n     opposing candidate can raise six times the limits from \n     individual donors. And at the third trigger, party \n     coordinated spending limits are lifted. The amount of \n     additional fundraising or spending at all trigger levels is \n     limited to 110% of the amount of personal wealth spent. The \n     provision also prohibits all candidates from raising \n     contributions to repay loans they make to their own campaigns \n     of over $250,000. Section 316 further limits the amount of \n     additional fundraising that can be done by Senate candidates \n     under this provision: See section 319 for a similar provision \n     applicable to House candidates.\n       Sec. 305. Limitation on Availability of Lowest Unit Charge \n     for Federal Candidates Attacking Opposition. Requires \n     candidates seeking to avail themselves of the lowest unit \n     charge for advertising available under Section 315(b) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 to provide written certification \n     that if they refer to another candidate in the advertisement \n     they will include in the advertisement a photo of themselves \n     and a clearly legible statement that they have approved and \n     paid for the ad. Both items must appear in the ad for no less \n     than four seconds.\n       Sec. 306. Software for Filing Reports and Prompt Disclosure \n     of Contributions. Requires the FEC to promulgate standards \n     for software vendors to develop software that will allow \n     political committees to report receipts and disbursements to \n     the FEC immediately, and allow the FEC to immediately post \n     the information on the Internet immediately. Once such \n     software is available, the FEC is required to make it \n     available to all persons required to file reports. Once \n     software provided to a person required to report, it shall be \n     used notwithstanding the current time periods for filing \n     reports.\n       Sec. 307. Modification of Contribution Limits. Provides for \n     increases in certain contribution limits. The maximum amount \n     that an individual can give to a federal candidate is \n     increased from $1,000 to $2,000 per election. These limits \n     will be indexed for inflation. The maximum amount that an \n     individual can give to a national committee of a political \n     party each year is increased from $20,000 to $25,000. The \n     maximum aggregate amount that an individual can give to \n     parties, PACs, and candidates combined per year is increased \n     from $25,000 per year (current law) to $95,000 per cycle, \n     including not more than $37,500 per cycle to candidates, and \n     reserving $20,000 per cycle for the national party \n     committees. The amount that a senatorial campaign committee \n     can contribute to a Senate candidate is increased from \n     $17,500 to $35,000. All of the limits increased in this \n     section are indexed for inflation beginning with a base year \n     of 2001, and the increased limits apply to contributions made \n     on or after January 1, 2003.\n       Sec. 308. Donations to Presidential Inaugural Committee. \n     Requires a Presidential Inaugural Committee to file a report \n     with FEC within 90 days of the inauguration disclosing all \n     donations of $200 or more. Foreign nationals (as defined in 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 441e(2) are prohibited from making any donation \n     to an Inaugural Committee. The FEC is required to make public \n     and post on the Internet any Report filed under this section \n     within 48 hours of its receipt.\n       Sec. 309. Prohibition no Fraudulent Solicitation of Funds. \n     Prohibits a person from fraudulently misrepresenting that he \n     or she is speaking, writing, or otherwise acting on behalf of \n     a candidate or political party for the purpose of soliciting \n     campaign contributions.\n       Sec. 310. Study and Report on Clean Money Election Laws. \n     Requires the GAO to conduct a study of the clean money, clean \n     election systems in Arizona and Maine. The study shall \n     include a number of statistical determinations with respect \n     to the recent elections in those states and describe the \n     effect of public financing on the elections in those states. \n     The GAO shall report its findings to Congress within a year \n     of enactment.\n       Sec. 311. Clarity Standards for Identification of Sponsors \n     of Election-Related Advertising. Amends and supplements the \n     FECA's current requirements that the sponsors of political \n     advertising identify themselves in their ads. Additional \n     provisions include: (1) applies the requirements to any \n     disbursement for public political advertising, including \n     electioneering communications; (2) requires the address, \n     telephone number, and Internet address of persons other than \n     candidates who purchase public political advertising to \n     appear in the ad; (3) requires candidate radio ads to include \n     a statement by the candidate that he or she has approved the \n     communication; (4) requires a television ad to include the \n     same audio statement along with a picture of the candidate or \n     a full screen view of the candidate making the statement, and \n     a written version of that statement that appears for at least \n     4 seconds; and (5) requires persons other than candidates to \n     run ads to include a statement that that person ``is \n     responsible for the content of this advertising.''\n       Sec. 312. Increase in Penalties. Increases from one year to \n     five years the maximum term of imprisonment for knowing and \n     willful violations of the FECA involving the making, \n     receiving, or reporting of any contribution, donation, or \n     expenditure aggregating $25,000 or more during a calendar \n     year. Provides that criminal fines of up to $250,000 may also \n     be assessed for prohibited contributions or expenditures of \n     that amount, or of up to $100,000 for violations totaling \n     less than $25,000 in a year.\n       Sec. 313. Statute of Limitations. Extends the statute of \n     limitations for violations of the FECA from three to five \n     years.\n       Sec. 314. Sentencing Guidelines. Directs the U.S. \n     Sentencing Commission to: (1) within 90 days of the effective \n     date promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline, \n     for penalties under FECA and related election laws; and (2) \n     submit to Congress an explanation of any such guidelines and \n     any legislative or administrative recommendations regarding \n     enforcement. Specifies considerations for such guidelines, \n     including that they reflect the serious nature of violations \n     of the FECA and the need to aggressive and appropriate law \n     enforcement action to prevent violations.\n       Sec. 315. Increase in Penalties Imposed for Violation of \n     Conduit Contribution Ban. Increases the maximum civil penalty \n     that can be assessed by the FEC for a violation of the \n     conduit contribution prohibition in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441f from \n     the greater of $10,000 or 200 percent of the contribution \n     involved to $50,000 or 1,000 percent of the amount involved. \n     Increases the maximum term of imprisonment for a criminal \n     violation of the conduit contribution ban involving amounts \n     of between $10,000 and $25,000 from one to two years, and \n     increases the maximum criminal penalty to the greater of \n     $50,000 or 1,000 percent of amount involved. The minimum \n     criminal penalty shall be 300 percent of the amount involved.\n       Sec. 316. Restriction on Increased Contribution Limits by \n     Taking into Account Candidate's Available Funds. Modifies the \n     amount of additional fundraising that a candidate who faces a \n     wealthy opponent can do under the increased contribution \n     limits set out in Section 304. If the non-wealthy candidate \n     has raised more money than the wealthy candidate, the amount \n     of fundraising under the increased contribution limits is \n     decreased by one half of the difference between the two \n     candidates fundraising (excluding the amount of personal \n     wealth that the wealthy candidate has contributed) as of June \n     30 and December 31 of the year before the election.\n       Sec. 317. Clarification of Right of Nationals of the United \n     States to Make Political Contributions. Clarifies U.S. \n     Nationals are allowed to make political contributions.\n       Sec. 318. Prohibition of Contributions by Minors. Prohibits \n     anyone 17 years of age or younger from making political \n     contributions.\n       Sec. 319. Modification of Individual Contribution Limits \n     for House Candidates in Response to Expenditures from \n     Personal Funds. Allows House candidates who face opponents \n     who spend large amounts of their personal wealth to raise \n     larger contributions from individual donors. When a wealthy \n     candidate's personal spending exceeds $350,000, the \n     individual contribution limits are tripled. In addition, \n     party coordinated spending limits are lifted. The total \n     amount of permitted additional fundraising and party \n     expenditures is limited to the ``opposition personal funds \n     amount.'' That amount is determined by taking the opponent's \n     personal wealth spending and subtracting the amount the \n     candidate spends of his or her own personal wealth and one-\n     half of the fundraising advantage, if any, that the candidate \n     may have over the opponent. Thus, the amount of additional \n     fundraising and party expenditures can never exceed the \n     amount of personal wealth devoted by the opponent.\n\n                 TITLE IV: SEVERABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       Sec. 401. Severability. Provides that if any provision of \n     the bill is held unconstitutional, the remainder of the bill \n     will not be affected.\n       Sec. 402. Effective Date. Provides that the Act will take \n     effect on November 6, 2002 (the day after the 2002 election), \n     except for the increased contributions limits contained in \n     section 307. After November 6, 2002, the parties may spend \n     any remaining soft money only for debts or obligations \n     incurred in connection with the 2002 election (including any\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n     runoff or recount) or any previous election, but only for \n     expenses for which it would otherwise be permissible to spend \n     soft money. No soft money may be spent on office buildings or \n     facilities after the effective date.\n       Sec. 403. Judicial Review. Provides that any action for \n     declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge the \n     constitutionality of any provision of the Act or any \n     amendment made by it must be filed in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia where the \n     complaint will be heard by a three judge court. Appeal of an \n     order or judgment in such an action shall be reviewable only \n     by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     Such appeal must be taken by notice of appeal filed within 10 \n     days of the judgment and a jurisdictional statement must be \n     filed within 30 days of the entry of a final decision. The \n     District Court and the Supreme Court must expedite the case. \n     Allows a Member of Congress to intervene in support of or in \n     opposition to a party to the case. The Court may make orders \n     that similar positions be filed jointly or be represented by \n     a single attorney at oral arguments.\n\n               TITLE V: ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS\n\n       Sec. 501. Internet Access to Records. Requires the FEC to \n     make all designations, reports, statements, and notifications \n     available on the Internet within 48 hours of receipt.\n       Sec. 502. Maintenance of Website of Election Reports. \n     Requires the FEC to maintain an Internet site to make all \n     publicly available election reports accessible to the public \n     and to coordinate with other agencies that receive election-\n     reports to allow such reports to be posted on the FEC's site \n     in a timely manner.\n       Sec. 503. Additional Monthly and Quarterly Disclosure \n     Reports. Requires candidates to file quarterly reports \n     instead of semi-annual reports in non-election years. \n     National parties are required to file monthly reports rather \n     than having a choice between monthly and quarterly reports.\n       Sec. 504. Public Access to Broadcasting Records. Requires \n     radio and television broadcasting stations to maintain \n     records of requests to purchase political advertising time, \n     including requests by candidates or by advertisers intending \n     to communicate a message relating to a political matter of \n     national importance. The records must be made available for \n     public inspection and must include the name and contact \n     information of person requesting to purchase the time, the \n     date and time that the advertisement was aired, and the rates \n     charged for the time.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I want to acknowledge my good friend, \ncolleague and ranking member on the Rules Committee, Senator Mitch \nMcConnell of Kentucky.\n  While he and I may be on opposite sides of this issue, we are on the \nsame side of another issue--the election reform legislation which is \nnow pending before the Senate. I would much prefer to be with him on an \nissue rather than against him.\n  I think all my colleagues agree that he is a formidable advocate for \nhis position. Even if a resolution is clear on this legislation at the \nend of the day, I suspect this will not be the end of Senator \nMcConnell's advocacy with regard to campaign finance reform issues.\n  I turn now to the matter at hand. I rise today to express my optimism \nthat Congress will enact real campaign finance reform this week.\n  We must not use this week to merely re-debate legislation already \nfully debated and adopted by both chambers of Congress.\n  Only final passage is the proper tribute to the culmination of years \nof extraordinary bicameral and bipartisan leadership provided by my \ngood friends and colleagues.\n  In the Senate, the leaders of campaign finance reform are Senator \nJohn McCain of Arizona and Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. In the \nHouse, the leaders are Congressman Christopher Shays of Connecticut and \nCongressman Martin Meehan of Massachusetts.\n  On February 14, 2002, the Shays-Meehan Bipartisan Campaign Finance \nReform Bill, H.R. 2356, was adopted by a vote of 240-189 in the House. \nOn April 2, 2001, the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance \nReform bill, S. 27, was adopted by a vote of 59-41 in the Senate.\n  Interestingly, today is only one day short of being a full year from \nwhen the Senate started debate on the McCain-Feingold measure--March \n19, 2001.\n  Last year, I was honored to serve as floor manager for the Senate \ndebate on campaign finance reform legislation. I was equally as honored \nto be counted as one of the 59 votes to adopt the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I stand in the same shoes today. It is a high honor to serve as floor \nmanager of the Senate debate on the Shays-Meehan measure. I will be \nequally as honored to be counted among the many Members who will vote \nin a bipartisan manner to adopt this reform bill.\n  I congratulate my colleagues in both chambers for the hard-fought \nsuccess that this legislation reflects.\n  I especially wish to take this time to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to my good friend, Congressman Chris Shays.\n  It is with a sense of parochial pride in this House action that the \nmajor co-sponsor of the legislation, who is a longstanding friend of \nmine and a Member of the Connecticut delegation, has been a principled \nadvocate of campaign finance reform for years.\n  I want to express the tremendous sense of pride of all the people of \nConnecticut to Chris Shays for his outstanding efforts to achieve real \ncampaign finance reform on behalf of all Americans.\n  Our Senate debate will only confirm that the House merely adopted \nvirtually the same bill as the Senate approved after a robust debate on \nApril 2, 2001.\n  In general, both bills would change the way political parties raise \nand spend money, regulate issue advertising, increase contribution \nlimits, improve disclosure requirements, and make other changes to \ncampaign finance law.\n  Specifically, both bills would ban unrestricted ``soft money'' \ncontributions to political parties by corporations, unions, and \nindividuals;\n  Both bills would restrict end-of-campaign advertising funded by \norganizations that name a Federal candidate;\n  Both bills would increase the aggregate limits on contributions by \nindividuals to candidates, PACs, and parties; and\n  Both bills would improve disclosure of campaign finance activity.\n  Thee are a few minor differences between the House and Senate passed \nbills. For example, there is a difference in the contribution limits \nfor an individual.\n  Under the House bill, an individual may contribute a total of $95,000 \nin 2 years to candidates, PACs, and parties. under the Senate bill, an \nindividual may contribute a total of $37,500 in 1 year to candidates, \nPACs, and parties. Under both bills, an individual is nevertheless \nlimited to an annual maximum contribution of $37,500 to candidates.\n  Another difference between the two bills is that the House bill \neliminates Senator Torricelli's amendment requiring the lowest unit \nrate for the purchase of broadcast advertisements.\n  Finally, the House bill extends to House candidates the \n``millionaires amendment.''\n  These are all very minor differences that serve to make the two bills \nsubstantially the same. As a result, the Senate would not benefit from \nan extended debate on re-hashing the same issues in this version of the \nShays-Meehan legislation. Last year's open and full Senate debate on \nthese same issues in McCain-Feingold remains sufficient for our \npurposes today, which is to pass comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  It is my fervent hope that we pass this legislation with a minimum \namount of debate. This is not a ``mission impossible,'' given the fact \nthat the House bill is virtually a mirror image of the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  The Senate already participated in weeks of full, open and \nunrestricted debate on campaign finance reform. And the Senate already \nvoted on both the substance of the bill and all relevant amendments to \nthe bill.\n  Now the question becomes whether yet another extended Senate debate \nwill serve to ensure certain improvements in the bill or, to the \ncontrary, only serve to ensure further delay of the bill?\n  On balance, I believe the risk of delay far outweighs the potential \nfor legislative improvements. There is no perfect legislation. \nAttempting to craft perfect legislation only serves to jeopardize the \nSenate's ability to send this measure to the President for signature.\n\n  Instead of becoming law, the Shays-Meehan bill would be on yet \nanother journey. It would be a candidate for a Senate-House conference \nor additional House debate. Either of these scenarios would kill any \nreal chance to enact campaign finance reform in the 107th Congress.\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this road well traveled for decades. \nIt is time to resist exploring new and substantive forks in the road.\n  As do many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I feel \nstrongly about the need for comprehensive campaign reform. Time and \nagain we have seen thoughtful, appropriate--and, I must emphasize, \nbipartisan--efforts to stop the spiraling money chase that afflicts our \npolitical system, only to see a minority of the Senate block further \nconsideration of the issue.\n  It is almost as if the opponents of reform are heeding the humorous \nadvice of Mark Twain, who once said, ``Do not put off until tomorrow \nwhat can be put off till day-after-tomorrow just as well.''\n  It is now long past the day-after-tomorrow. We simply cannot afford \nto wait any longer to do something about the tidal wave of special-\ninterest money that is drowning our system of government.\n  Oscar Wilde once observed that ``A cynic is a person who knows the \nprice of everything and the value of nothing.'' I fear that the \nexploding dominance of money in politics has created a similar \natmosphere of cynicism in our political system--an environment where \nthe value of ideas, of debate, of people in general, is overwhelmed by \nthe price tag of free speech and political success.\n  The worst aspect of the current financing system is its affect on \neroding public confidence in the integrity of our political process.\n  The real concern is that the escalating amounts of money pouring into \nour elections is having a corrupting influence on our political system. \nThe public perception of the problems of corruption and the appearance \nof corruption is that large political contributions to candidates and \npolitical parties provide those donors with preferred access and \ninfluence over American public policy--and the average American has \nneither the access nor influence in Washington.\n  The more money that is required to run for office, the more influence \nthat the donors--wealthy individuals, corporations, labor unions, and \nspecial interest groups--have over elected officials and public policy.\n  The real harm to avoid is having the concerns of the average voters \ncompletely usurped by the money and influence of these powerful \nindividuals, corporations, and interest groups.\n  It is this concern--the relationship of money to power--that is \ncasting a vote of ``no confidence'' in the integrity of our electoral \nprocess. It is this devastating harm of corruption and the appearance \nof corruption that campaign finance reform seeks to avoid. To date, \nCongress has an unacceptable record since we have only sought to avoid \nthe remedy for the harm.\n  Unfortunately, not only does historical data tend to support this \npessimistic view--the current data sustains this view.\n  Take a cursory look at raising and spending soft money in the \nNovember 2000 Presidential and congressional elections. It sends one \nmessage--our financing system is in urgent need of repair.\n  According to the center for responsive politics, the total amount \nspent on the 2000 Presidential and congressional campaigns was \napproximately $3 billion. This price tag is up from $2.2 billion in \n1996 and $1.8 billion in 1992.\n  According to the Federal Election Commission, the Democratic and \nRepublican parties raised $1.2 billion in 2000--a 36 percent increase \nover the $881 million raised by the parties in 1996.\n  In that same period, democrats raised over $245 million in soft \nmoney, while Republicans raised over $249 million in soft million. the \nparties use soft money funds for so-called issue ads and other so-\ncalled party building activities.\n  In that same period, Democrats raised over $275 million ion ``hard \nmoney,'' while Republicans almost doubled that amount in fundraising \nwith over $465 million in hard money. The parties use hard money funds \nfor direct contributions to candidates and other activities to advocate \nthe election or defeat of candidates for Federal office.\n  The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law \nconducted a study on television advertising in the 2000 Federal \nelections. The Brennan Center found that the Presidential election was \nthe first election in history where the major national political \nparties spent more on television ads than the candidates themselves \nspent--the Democratic and Republican national committees together spent \nover $80 million on TV ads, a lot more than the $67 million spent by \nVice-President Gore and Governor Bush.\n  The Brennan Center found that the vast amount of money spent by the \nparties on TV ads was ``soft money,'' the unregulated and unlimited \nparty donations from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy \nindividuals.\n  The Brennan Center found that spending by groups in congressional \ncampaigns on so-called issue ads increased from $10 million in 1998 to \n$32 million in 2000.\n  Finally, the Brennan Center also found that only a small percentage \nof party soft money is spent for get-out-the-vote and voter \nmobilization activities. Only 8.5 cents of every dollar goes to GOTV \nand voter registration activities while 40 cents of every dollar goes \nto purchase ads to support or defeat candidates for Federal office.\n  In contrast to all this financial participation in elections, \naccording to the Federal Election Commission report on the 2000 Federal \nelections, just under 105.4 million Americans voted in the Presidential \nelection. That is 51 percent of the Census Bureau's estimated voting \nage population of over 205.8 million Americans.\n  The voter turnout figure of 51 percent in 2000 was somewhat higher \nthan the 49 percent turnout for the 1996 Federal elections--the first \ntime in modern political history when less than half of the eligible \nelectorate turned out to vote for President.\n  This means that the voter turnout has declined sharply--from over 63 \npercent of the voting age population in 1952 to slightly over 51 \npercent of the voting age population in 2000.\n  Arguably, while there are no accurate national statistics, it is \nsufficient to project that there is only a small percentage of \nindividual donors with average income who actually contribute to \npolitical campaigns.\n  These statistics tell the story of a system in which a small \npercentage of individual donors are making ever larger contributions, \nwhile at the same time more and more voters have lost such confidence \nin our elections that they do not even feel it is worthwhile to vote.\n  Do any of us really believe this is acceptable? Do any of us believe \nthat this is not a system in need of comprehensive reform?\n  If we are to break the grip that money currently holds on our \ncampaigns, we must enact legislation that will stop the flow of \nunregulated money in the political system and limit the flow of \nregulated money into Federal campaigns.\n  We must restore common sense by eliminating the opportunities for \nlegalisms and loopholes that mock the spirit of our campaign finance \nlaws. We must give those who enforce the law the resources they need to \nensure that the campaign financing system is lawful and fair.\n  I look forward to participating in the process of winding-down the \ncampaign finance debate. I also look forward to working with my \ncolleagues--on both sides of the aisle--and to adopting this moderate \nlegislation that restores the proper balance of money to politics and \nrestores the American people's confidence in our current financing \nsystem.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to put aside any and all partisanship \nand personal ambitions to join me in de-emphasizing the importance of \nmoney in politics.\n  This is not a complicated task. We desperately need to ensure that \nthe average American is heard in Washington over the din of special \ninterest voices. We must ensure that the exercising of Americans' free \nspeech in the political process is not governed by the price tagon \ncontribution amounts that can be raised and spent on Federal elections. \nAs Supreme Court Justice Stevens wrote in the Nixon v. Shrink Missouri \nGovernment PAC case, ``Money is property, money is not speech.''\n  This is why Congress has an obligation to enact comprehensive, \nmeaningful, and real campaign finance law and pass the law now.\n  The action we take today will signal to all Americans that exercising \ntheir first amendment right to free speech\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\nand association outside the beltway has now been heard inside the \nbeltway.\n  Americans have waited long enough. Congress has the first opportunity \nin a generation to clean up a political system that most Americans \nbelieve is polluted by campaign contributions, or the appearance of \nsuch pollution. There is no room for wavering or using a philosophical, \nlegal or factual excuse for killing this legislation. This is a real \nchance to curb the role of money in politics.\n  It has been decades since Congress took similar comprehensive action \nwith the enactment of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The \none thing we cannot afford to do is wait any longer--now is the time to \nenact the Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold legislation. The American people \nhave waited long enough!\n  I fully support this legislation as the best effort that Congress can \nmake to enact real campaign finance reform. I stand ready to do what I \ncan to make reform a reality in the 107th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S1997-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1997-S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMENDING THE COURAGE OF INGRID BETANCOURT, CLARA ROJAS, MARTHA \n                   DANIELS, AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just an hour or so ago, I made a call to \nColombia, South America, and spoke with the husband of Ingrid \nBetancourt, who, as many may know, is the woman candidate for President \nof Colombia who was recently kidnaped.\n  I expressed to Ingrid Betancourt's husband the sincere hopes of all \nof us here that his wife be returned to safety soon, that she be \nallowed to continue in her efforts as a candidate in that country in \nthe upcoming presidential election, and I told Mrs. Betancourt's family \nthat the hopes and prayers of all of us in the United States are with \nthem in these very difficult hours.\n  Colombia is a nation under tremendous stress and pressure, and the \nlevel of violence there has tremendously escalated since the collapse \nof the Pastrana-FARC peace talks. President Pastrana has tried his \nentire Presidency to come up with a peaceful resolution of the 40-year-\nold conflict in that country, and he deserves great credit for the \nefforts he has made from the very first days of his Presidency up until \njust a few days ago, when those talks finally broke down completely.\n  Currently, rebel forces are doing everything in their power to \ncompromise the fragile democracy of that country. Guerrillas have \nbombed electrical towers, bridges, and waterworks while mining highways \nand increasing the number of roadblocks on Colombia's streets. As a \nresult, more than 110 towns, representing 10 percent of Colombia's \nurban centers, have been left in darkness, and 76 municipalities in 6 \nprovinces have had their phone service cut out completely.\n  Colombian citizens are living each day in fear while enduring \ntremendous domestic hardship. President Pastrana has warned his people \nmore attacks are likely, and the citizens of Colombia are frightened, \nto put it mildly.\n  Even worse, FARC rebels have undertaken a violent offensive against \npublic figures, stepping up the frequency of political attacks that \nwere already too common in the months before the collapse of the peace \ntalks on February 20. For years, the FARC--the organization I \ndescribed--and other rebel forces in Colombia, have financed their \nviolent siege of terror by kidnaping Colombian citizens and demanding \nransom. When the ransom is not paid, the hostages are killed, and new \nhostages are taken. It is a vicious cycle that repeats over and over \nagain, taking a toll on the spirit of this beleaguered nation. Indeed, \nat this point close to 4,000 people have died in Colombia since the \nbeginning of hostilities; kidnappings are about 3,000 a year. At the \nsame time, rebel groups have executed several political figures, \nincluding mayors, judges, members of the legislature, and candidates. \nAs elected officials ourselves, this is a development that we should be \nparticularly enraged by, and one that should draw the attention and \nconcern of all people in democratic countries around the globe.\n  On March 3, Martha Catalina Daniels, a Colombian Senator, was \ntortured and killed near Bogota by guerrilla fighters while attempting \nto negotiate the release of hostages kidnaped by leftist rebels. After \nher torture, she was shot at close range with two bullets to the head, \nand then dumped in a ravine off a country road. A staffer and a friend \nof Senator Daniels were also killed in this vicious attack against \ndecency and democracy, not to mention the value of human life.\n  Senator Daniels was the fourth member of the Colombian Congress to be \nkilled since the middle of last year while working in her elected \ncapacity as a representative of the Colombian people. Could you imagine \nsimilar events happening in our Capitol? There would be tremendous \npublic outcry, and the Government would respond swiftly and decisively. \nJust because this crime happened in conflict-torn Colombia does not \nmean that we should allow this execution to pass by without public \ncomment or outcry in this, the greatest Congress on the planet. We must \nstand with our democracy-loving colleagues around the world in \ncondemning these attacks. This crime was a vicious and merciless murder \nof a dedicated and courageous public servant and her staff who were \nsimply doing their jobs--jobs that we and our staffs do everyday. In \nrecognition of this commitment, Senator Daniels' sacrifice will not be \nforgotten by the Colombian people or her friends in America. Her death \nwill not be in vain.\n  Yet the assault on democracy in Colombia is not only targeted at \nthose who hold office. Rebels also have targeted national candidates \nfor public office as Colombia prepares for an upcoming presidential \nelection. On February 23, Colombia presidential candidate Ingrid \nBetancourt, and her chief of staff, Clara Rojas, were seized while \ndriving toward the southern war zone of San Vicente del Caguan. Mrs. \nBetancourt's driver and two journalists accompanying her were held and \nreleased, but Mrs. Betancourt and Ms. Rojas were kept in custody--a \nclear sign that this kidnaping was intended to send a signal to the \npolitical class in Colombia. The FARC, who are believed to have \nperpetrated this crime, currently hold five other politicians hostage \nand are attempting to cripple democracy in this Nation by force. \nHowever, the Colombian Government rightly refuses to negotiate with \nthese terrorists for fear that concessions would encourage even more \nkidnapings in the future, and the situation is presently at a standoff.\n  Mrs. Betancourt has been allowed to fax her family to assure them of \nher well-being, and she has expressed her concern for her family, \nfriends, and country. Even now, as a prisoner, she stands by her \ndemocratic principles. As she suffers, she seeks to bring international \nattention to the problem of violence in Colombia through her plight. \nMrs. Betancourt's daughter has stated that her mother has indicated her \ndesire that people be conscious of what is happening in Colombia and \nrecognize that a war is going on in that country every day. She seeks \nto use her own situation as a rallying point for the international \ncommunity against violence in Colombia.\n  I spoke to Mrs. Betancourt's husband this afternoon, and expressed my \nsympathy to him and his family, and my admiration for his courageous \nwife, and expressed as well those same sentiments on behalf of all of \nus in this Chamber. I pray for her safe and quick return.\n  Attention in America is rightly focused on Afghanistan and the war \nagainst terrorism. However, we cannot allow the brave sacrifices of \npeople like Ingrid Betancourt to go unnoticed. We have to reserve some \nof our attention to expend on the festering problems of Colombia. If we \nturn our backs on this corner of the world, I fear that we may see \nanother situation arise like that\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nwhich we saw when we ignored Afghanistan after the Soviet occupation. \nWe cannot and should not allow this to happen.\n  And so, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be deeply \naware of the sacrifices of people such as Martha Daniels, Ingrid \nBetancourt, and their staffs. They have paid the ultimate price for \ntheir commitment to democracy and have shown great courage by serving \nas politicians in such a volatile and strife-torn country. Their \nservice is a testament to the democratic commitment of the vast \nmajority of Colombian people, a commitment that was reconfirmed on \nMarch 11, when huge numbers of Colombians went to the polls even though \nthey had been threatened with violence as they sought to execute their \nconstitutionally given right to vote.\n  Colombia is a troubled country in desperate need of our assistance \nand the assistance of other democratic nations around the globe. But \nthe spirit of democracy lives on in the dedicated public servants and \ncitizens of our friend and neighbor to the South.\n  I want the Colombian Government, and more importantly the people of \nColombia, to know their courage and sacrifice has been noted by the \nAmerican people and by this individual in this body speaking, I am very \nconfident, on behalf of all of us in this Chamber in urging the FARC \nand other organizations to cease in the abduction of political figures, \nto cease in the abduction of innocent civilians, in that country and to \ngo back to the bargaining table and try to figure out a way to resolve \nthis four-decade old conflict. The deaths and the abductions shredding \nthis country deserve the attention of this Congress, the American \npeople, and freedom-loving people everywhere.\n  I ask my colleagues to take an active interest in this problem and \nact as friends of Colombia. The Colombian people, people like Ingrid \nBetancourt and Martha Daniels, deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Dodd, \nfor a very eloquent and compelling statement in regard to the tragedies \nthat are going on in Colombia today. I think he does very well in \nexpressing the sentiments of all the Members of the Senate. I thank him \nfor that eloquent comment.\n  Colombia must be looked at not just as a place we worry about in \nregard to drugs coming into this country, not just as a country that we \nhave to partner with to try to deal with our mutual drug problem, the \nproduction of drugs, and the huge consumption of drugs in the United \nStates, although we are partners in that effort, but we also must \nunderstand that what is going on in Colombia is a direct threat to the \ndemocracy of Colombia.\n  Senator Dodd has spelled out very well what has been going on. We do \nhave a longstanding democracy in this hemisphere, a democracy that has \nbeen a friend of the United States for many years that is, in fact, \nimperiled. When we make a decision about what assistance we can and \nwill give in the future, we need to keep that in mind.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine pertaining to the introduction of S. 2027 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2027 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Under the previous order, the hour of 5:38 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now go into executive session and \nproceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 705, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Randy Crane, of Texas, \nto be United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. When is the vote \nscheduled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is scheduled for 5:50 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is there time reserved to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understood the Senator from Vermont had 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is divided equally between 5:38 and \n5:50.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are voting on our 42nd judicial nominee to be \nconfirmed since last July when the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreorganized after the Senator majority changed. With the confirmation \nof Robert Randall Crane to the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas--and I predict we will accept him--the Senate will \nhave resolved 7 judicial emergencies since we returned to session a few \nshort weeks ago, 14 judicial emergencies since I became chairman.\n  As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the last 9 \nmonths than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 years under the Republican \nleadership. I have heard some inaccurate statements--I am sure \ninnocently enough but mistakenly--by my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. As of this week, we will have confirmed, in 9 months, more \njudges than were confirmed in 4 of the 6 total years under the \nRepublican leadership. In fact, the number of judicial confirmations \nover these past 9 months exceeds the number of judicial nominees \nconfirmed during all 12 months for the years 2000, 1999, 1997, and \n1996.\n  During the 6\\1/2\\ years the Republicans controlled the Senate, \njudicial nominations averaged 38 a year. We have done more than that in \n9 months. In the past 9 months, we have had more hearings for more \nnominees and had more confirmations than the Republican leadership did \nfor President Clinton's nominees during the first 9 months of 1995.\n  On the chart we took 9-month increments. In the first 9 months that \nthe Republicans led the committee, they had 9 hearings; we had 14; they \nconfirmed 36 and we confirmed 42. Looking at the first 3 months of the \nsession, we will have confirmed 14. During the first 3 months of each \nsession they were in charge the following occurred: In March 1995, they \nconfirmed 9; in March of 1996, they confirmed 0; by March of 1997, they \nconfirmed 2; by March of 1998, the high-water mark, they had 12; by \nMarch of 1999, they had 0; by March of 2000, they had 7; by March of \n2001, they had 0; we have done 14.\n  We tried to have a pace faster than the Republicans when they chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee, when they controlled the Senate, and so far we \nhave done that. Some have expressed concern how this Senate, under this \nleadership, has handled nominations of President Bush. So far he will \nhave won 41 out of 42 nominations. As great as the football team is in \nNebraska, they would be delighted to win 41 out of 42, as would any \nteam.\n  In 1999, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, in the whole \nyear, they confirmed 26 district judges and 7 circuit judges. In the \nyear 2000, for the whole year, they confirmed 31 district judges and 8 \ncircuit judges. In the first 6 months of last year, when they \ncontrolled the Senate, they had 0. In the past 9 months--remember, \nthese are comparing whole years--in the past 9 months, we have had 35 \ndistrict judges, 7 courts of appeal.\n  Take the average number of days between nomination and confirmation, \nfiguring we have to wait extra time for the ABA: they took 182 one \nyear; 212 days another year; 232, another; 178, another; 196, another. \nThe Democrats average considerably less.\n  Reviewing today's nominations illustrates the effect of the reform \nprocess that the Democratic leadership has spearheaded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see no other Member seeking recognition. \nI ask consent the vote still be at 5:50 and I be allowed to use the \ntime until 5:50.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will have a vote today on Randy Crane. \nThere are Members who have stated, because the Democrats took over the \nfull committee in July of last year, we would try to do the same thing \nto the Republicans that the Republicans did to the Democrats; that is, \nslow up and refuse to confirm judges. Of course, the figures show the \nopposite. The speedy confirmation of Randy Crane to the district court \nin Texas illustrates the effect of the reforms on the process that the \nDemocratic leadership has spearheaded.\n  Despite the poor treatment of too many Democratic nominations through \nthe practice of anonymous holds and other tactics employed during the \npast 6\\1/2\\ years, Randy Crane will be filling a judicial emergency \nvacancy seat that has been vacant since the year 2000 when the new \nposition was created.\n  I worked with the Senators from Texas and other Senators along the \nsouthwestern border to fill this vacancy. In fact, Randy Crane is the \nsecond Federal judge confirmed from Texas in just the past few months.\n  Not too long ago when the Senate was under Republican control, it \ntook 943 days to confirm Judge Tagle to the Southern District of Texas. \nShe was nominated in August of 1995 and made to wait until March of \n1998, stalled for 3 years, then passed unanimously--a lot different \nthan the nomination of Michael Schattman to a vacancy on the Northern \nDistrict of Texas. He never got a hearing. I recall 2 years ago, \nRicardo Morado, who served as mayor of San Benito, TX, was nominated \nfor a vacancy and never got a hearing or vote. They could have had \nthose votes. We could have moved forward to fill those vacancies. This \nSenate and this Judiciary Committee is trying to fill them. They could \nhave long ago been filled by nominees from President Clinton, but the \nfact is the Republicans refused to even allow a vote. We are not doing \nthe same.\n  Unlike the many judicial nominees who were given a hearing but never \nallowed to be considered by the committee, we try to make sure \nPresident Bush's nominees get both a hearing and a vote by the \ncommittee. Until Judge Edith Clement of Louisiana received a hearing on \nher nomination to the Fifth Circuit last year, after the shift in \nmajority, there had been no hearings on Fifth Circuit nominees since \n1994 and no confirmations since 1995. In fact, we confirmed the first \nnew judge of the Fifth Circuit in 6 years, even though there was a \njudicial circuit emergency.\n  Jorge Rangel was nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 1997 and never \nreceived a hearing on his nomination, or a vote, in 15 months. Enrique \nMoreno was nominated for the Fifth Circuit in 1999 and he never \nreceived a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the committee.\n  H. Alston Johnson was also first nominated to the fifth circuit in \n1999 and never received a hearing on his nomination or a vote by the \ncommittee in 1999, 2000, or the beginning of 2001.\n  Despite the support of both of his home State Senators, his \nnomination to a Louisiana seat on the fifth circuit also languished \nwithout action for 23 months.\n  In contrast, under the Democrat-led Senate, President Bush's nominees \nto the fifth circuit, Judge Edith Brown Clement and Judge Charles \nPickering, were treated fairly. Both received hearings less than 6 \nmonths after their nominations.\n  In fact, Judge Clement was the first fifth circuit nominee to receive \na hearing since Judge James Dennis had a hearing, when Senator Biden \nchaired the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1994. She is the first person \nto be confirmed to that circuit since Judge Dennis' confirmation in \n1995.\n  In contrast to recent, past practices, we are moving expeditiously to \nconsider and confirm Randy Crane, who was nominated in September, \nreceived his ABA peer review in November, participated in a hearing in \nFebruary, was reported by the committee in March and is today being \nconfirmed.\n  This nominee has the support of both Senators from his home State and \nappears to be the type of qualified, consensus nominee that the Senate \nhas been confirming to help fill the vacancies on our Federal courts. I \ncongratulate Mr. Crane and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Following the votes on the Pickering nomination last Thursday by the \nJudiciary Committee, there have been a number of unfounded and unfair \nattacks against Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee. \nReasonable people can disagree about whether Judge Pickering deserved a \npromotion, given his record as a judge. I am sorry, however, that some \nhave chosen to make that committee action into an unfortunately \nacrimonious fight.\n  It is unfortunate that some are going out of their way to intervene, \nfor example, in a matter before the Rules Committee, and objected to a \nbipartisan request for oversight funds--to be evenly divided between \nthe committee's majority and minority--in order better to fulfill our \nincreased oversight responsibility and make sure that agencies such as \nthe FBI and the INS are doing their jobs appropriately.\n  In the wake of September 11, Senator Hatch and I submitted the joint \nrequest on behalf of the committee with oversight jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Justice and its components. We wanted to assess the \nmanagement, training, and resource lapses in the FBI, INS, and in the \nother Department of Justice agencies to ensure that these agencies know \nwhat they did wrong and to avoid a recurrence of those tragic events.\n  We were reminded just last week of the need for this kind of \noversight when additional problems at the INS surfaced. It is too bad \nthat some are choosing to obstruct this important effort.\n  That retribution is now threatening the important work of the \ncommittee and the functioning of the Senate. I hope we are not entering \nan era in which any disagreement is vilified, and harsh, inappropriate \nrhetoric, is employed to make political points with the extreme \nelements.\n  This scorched earth campaign in which unrelated nominations and bills \nand oversight responsibilities are being compromised is not in the best \ninterests of the Senate.\n  I recall that even in our disappointment after the Republicans \nrejected the nomination of Judge Ronnie White in a party-line floor \nvote in 1999, I proceeded to vote for the confirmation of Ted Stewart \nof Utah.\n  The committee vote on the Pickering nomination was not a sneak attack \nor a ``lynching.''\n  It was not a nomination of which Senators had indicated that would \nvote one way and then went into a closed party caucus and were \ninstructed to vote another. It was not a party-line vote insisted upon \nby party leaders. It was not a matter in which the committee held a pro \nforma hearing and then refused over a period of weeks and months to \nbring the matter to the committee agenda for an up or down vote.\n  It was not a circumstance where the nominee was not afforded the \nopportunity to hear Senators' concerns and respond to those concerns. \nIt was not a circumstance where the nominee was not asked about \nconcerns and cases and his own actions at his hearing.\n  This was a case in which I responded to the request of a Senator to \nproceed to schedule a quick hearing on a judicial nomination.\n  As Senators reviewed this nomination, they had concerns. They asked \nthe nominee about those concerns. The committee assembled a record, \nwhich was the record of the nominee's official actions as a Federal \njudge. The committee then held a follow-up hearing to allow the nominee \nanother opportunity to make his best case and respond to Senators' \nconcerns and then provided a further opportunity through written \nquestions and answers.\n  After delaying committee action for 2 weeks at the request of the \nRepublican leader and the ranking Republican on the committee, we met \nand debated the merits of the nomination for over 4 hours before \nvoting.\n  I believe that the members of the Judiciary Committee based their \nvotes on their review of the record and their having measured the \nnominee against the standard each Senator must develop for voting on \nlifetime appointments to the Federal courts. I regret\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nthat some are questioning the motives of Senators.\n  The Senators on the Judiciary Committee, both Republican and \nDemocratic, are seeking to exercise their responsibilities with respect \nto their votes appropriately, on the merits and in accordance with \ntheir standards for such matters.\n  In spite of fair treatment, hearings and a vote, on Thursday, attacks \narose suggesting that Senate Democrats have imposed an unconstitutional \nreligious test to the nomination of Judge Pickering to the appellate \ncourt. I hesitate to dignify such a scurrilous allegation with a \nresponse, but I feel I must set the record straight. The Democratic \nmembers of the committee have never inquired into Judge Pickering's \nreligion. It had no place in the deliberations.\n  These charges, that the Democratic Senators on the committee have \nvoted against Judge Pickering based in any way based on his religion \nare outrageous, unfounded, and untrue. Whether a nominee goes to \nchurch, temple, or mosque, or not, has not been used by anyone in this \nSenate in the consideration of a judicial or any nominee.\n  Article VI of the United States Constitution requires that ``no \nreligious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office \nor public trust under the United States.'' In accordance with the \nseparation of church and state embodied in our Constitution, no \nreligious test has been applied to this nominee or any other.\n  I recall the recent reports indicated that Justice Scalia had \nrecently commented on the religion of judges and suggested that Federal \njudges who are Catholic should consider resigning if imposing the death \npenalty was a moral problem for them. But no Senator, at any time \nduring the consideration of the Pickering nomination, commented \nunfavorably on his religion.\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously and the other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee take seriously. Senator Schumer and Senator Feinstein chaired \nfair hearings on Judge Pickering's nomination. I regret that they and \nothers on the committee have been subjected to unfair criticism and \nattacks for fulfilling their duties.\n  Some of our Democratic Senators have been receiving calls and \ncriticism based on their religious affiliations. That is wrong. Other \nSenators have been insulted and called names for asking questions of \nthe nominee and for disagreeing with this choice for the court of \nappeals. That is regrettable.\n  There are strongly held views on both sides. But while Democrats and \nmost Republicans have kept to the merits of this nomination, it is \nunfortunate that some have chosen to vilify, castigate, unfairly \ncharacterize, and condemn without basis Senators working \nconscientiously to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\n  I also want to express concerns about recent statements from the \nadministration, including from the President, that the Senate's \ntreatment of judicial nominees ``hurts our democracy.''\n  This statement reveals an unsettling misunderstanding of the \nfundamental separation of powers in our Constitution and the checks and \nbalances in the Founder's design.\n  In our democracy, the President is not given unchecked powers to pack \nthe courts and to give lifetime appointments to anyone who shares \ncertain ideological views.\n  Instead, the Constitution provides a democratic check on the power of \nappointment by requiring the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Each Senator on the committee made up his or her own mind on whether \nto vote for the promotion of Judge Pickering to the Court of Appeals. \nThe Senators on the committee studied Judge Pickering's record as a \njudge. The committee's vote was part of our democratic process.\n  This democratic check on the President's appointment power \ndemonstrates our democracy in action, not action that ``hurts our \ndemocracy.'' By having fair hearings and voting on nominees, up or \ndown, the Judiciary Committee is proceeding as it should.\n  The administration should not throw gasoline onto this combustible \nsituation. It could, instead, recognize its role in sending division \nnominations to the Senate and seek to work with us to find and appoint \nconsensus nominees.\n  Unlike the many judicial nominees who did not get hearings or were \naccorded a hearing but were never allowed to be considered for a vote \nby the committee, we are trying to accord nominees whose paperwork is \ncomplete and whose blue slips are returned both a hearing and a fair up \nor down vote.\n  Those who assert that the Democrats have caused a vacancy crisis in \nthe Federal courts are ignoring recent history.\n  There were an unusually high number of retirements taken by Federal \njudges after the November 2000 election. Moreover, by the time the \nSenate was permitted to reorganize after the change in majority, the \nnumber of vacancies have reached 105 and was rising to 111, including \n32 vacancies on the courts of appeals. That is the situation I \ninherited and the Democratic majority in the Senate was faced with last \nsummer.\n  Since then this is the 42d judicial nominee to be confirmed, \nincluding seven judges to the courts of appeals. Contrary to what some \nmight say, the Democratic majority has actually been keeping up with \nattrition and we have started moving the vacancy numbers in the right \ndirection--down. By contrast, from January 1995, when the Republican \nmajority took over control of the Senate until they relinquished it in \nJune 2001, Federal judicial vacancies rose by 65 percent, from 63 to \n105.\n  Already, in less than 9 months in the majority, we have made more \nprogress than was made in 4 whole years of Republican leadership, 2000, \n1999, 1997, and, of course, 1996.\n  Within the past 9 months, after the change in majority, we have \nconfirmed 42 judges, including 7 to the courts of appeals.\n  In all of 2000, the Senate confirmed fewer, only 39 judges, and in \n1999 fewer still, only 33 judges, with 7 to the courts of appeals.\n  We are doing what the Republican majority did not do: keeping up with \nthe rate of attrition and moving the numbers in the right directions. \nTomorrow we are scheduled to hold another hearing on another court of \nappeals nominee, at the request of Senator Enzi.\n  I hope this nominee will turn out to be uncontroversial and well-\nregarded by people from both sides of the aisle.\n  Our task is made easier when the President works with members of both \nparties to nominate consensus nominees who are not outside of the \nmainstream and whose record demonstrates that they will follow \nprecedent, not try to find a way around it.\n  Tomorrow's hearing will be our 15th for judicial nominees within the \nlast 9 tumultuous months. That is more hearings on judges than the \nRepublican majority held during any full year. In only 9 months we have \nconfirmed as many court of appeals nominees, seven, as the Republican \nmajority averaged per year while they were in control.\n  Indeed, in the 76 months in which a Republican majority recently \ncontrolled the pace of judicial confirmations only 47 judges were \nconfirmed to the 78 vacancies that existed on our Federal courts of \nappeals. We have confirmed seven in less than 9 months already. The \nRepublicans went one entire congressional session, 1996, refusing to \nconfirm even a single court of appeals nominee.\n  We are holding more hearings for more nominees than in the recent \npast. We have moved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the \nprocess from 1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue \nslips public for the first time. We have drastically shortened the \naverage time for confirmation proceedings.\n  What had grown during Republican control to over 230 days on average \nis now down to 74 days from receipt of the ABA peer review to \nconfirmation for the 42 judges we have confirmed over the last 9 \nmonths.\n  However, because the Republicans refused to hold hearings on so many \nof President Clinton's nominees there were an enormous number of \nvacancies we inherited. Under Democratic leadership, we have tried to \nfill those vacancies as quickly as possible.\n  By moving first on the nonideological and well qualified of President \nBush's nominees we can fill the most vacancies in the least amount of \ntime. With controversial, less qualified\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\njudges we spend much more of time. With consensus, well-qualified \nnominees we could have confirmed a dozen judges in the same amount of \ntime the committee devoted over the last 5 months to the Pickering \nnomination.\n  It is not possible to repair the damage caused by long standing \nvacancies in several circuits overnight, but we are contributing to \nimproved conditions in the 5th, 10th, and 8th circuits, in particular. \nWe will do our best to remedy as many circumstances as possible.\n  I understand we have time before the vote. The distinguished ranking \nmember has come to the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will say a few words before the vote. I ask unanimous \nconsent I be permitted to proceed for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the vote will still be at 5:50 because \nSenators have commitments.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Robert Randall \nCrane to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Texas.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Crane's distinguished legal \ncareer, and I have come to the conclusion that he is a fine lawyer who \nwill add a great deal to the federal bench in Texas.\n  Randy Crane is a native Texan who graduated with honors from the \nUniversity of Texas School of Law when he was only 22 years old. He \nclerked for the McAllen, Texas, firm of Atlas & Hall during the summers \nof 1986 and 1987, joined the firm as a full-time associate in 1988, and \nbecame a partner in 1994. During his fourteen-year legal career, Mr. \nCrane has handled primarily civil cases, including commercial \nlitigation, personal injury matters, and toxic torts. He has also \ngained valuable experience in several criminal cases, including a large \nfederal drug conspiracy case.\n  Mr. Crane currently serves as a Director of the Texas-Mexico Bar \nAssociation, which seeks to promote cross-border dialogue of common \nlegal issues, resolution of cross-border legal issues, education about \nUnited States and Mexico legal systems, and attorney networking for \nanswering questions about the two legal systems.\n  I have every confidence that Randy Crane will serve with distinction \non the federal district court for the Southern District of Texas.\n  Mr. President, I must take a moment to respond to some of the \ncomments made by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nregarding the pace of judicial confirmations. The Senator has made much \nof comparing the pace of confirmations under Republican and Democratic \ncontrol of the Judiciary Committee. This has involved comparing 9 \nmonths to 12 months, 9 months to 9 months, 3 months to 3 months, and so \non. Of course, anyone knows that you can manipulate statistics to \nachieve the result you want. I find the bottom line numbers to tell a \nmore compelling story. And the bottom line is that we have 94 vacancies \nin the Federal judiciary today--the exact same number as we did at the \nend of last session, and only slightly fewer than we did when the \nDemocrats took control of the Senate in June of last year.\n  The bottom line numbers are even more compelling when you look at the \nnumber of circuit court vacancies.\n  When Senate Democrats took over the Judiciary Committee in June of \nlast year, there were 31 circuit court vacancies, and there remain 31 \ncircuit court vacancies today. This does not represent progress--it \nrepresents stagnation.\n  In contrast, at the end of 1995, which was the Republicans' first \nyear of control of the Judiciary Committee during the Clinton \nadministration, there were only 13 circuit vacancies.\n  In fact, during President Clinton's first term, circuit court \nvacancies never exceeded 21 at the end of any year--including 1996, a \npresidential election year, when the pace of confirmations has \ntraditionally slowed.\n  Moreover, there were only 2 circuit nominees left pending in \ncommittee at the end of President Clinton's first year in office. In \ncontrast, 23 of President Bush's circuit nominees were left hanging in \ncommittee at the end of last year.\n  Last Thursday, Senator Lott introduced a resolution calling for the \nconfirmation of each of the circuit court judges nominated by President \nBush on May 9 of last year.\n  We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of those nominations, \nand yet only 3 of the 11 nominees have had hearings and confirmation \nvotes. All of these nominees have received qualified or well-qualified \nratings from the American Bar Association.\n  This is problematic because it is no secret that there is a vacancy \ncrisis in the federal circuit courts, and that we are making no \nprogress in addressing it.\n  A total of 22 circuit nominations are pending in the Judiciary \nCommittee. But we have confirmed only one circuit judge this year, and \nonly seven since President Bush took office.\n  In light of the vacancy crisis, we cannot afford to let only 10 \nSenators defeat a circuit nominee. This is a question of process, not \nof seeking favorable treatment.\n  For all these reasons, it is imperative to support Senator Lott's \nresolution to get hearings and votes for our longest pending circuit \nnominees. Given the vacancy crisis in our circuit courts, I cannot \nimagine anyone voting against it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nRandy Crane, who is the next nominee for the Federal judiciary who will \nbe voted on by the Senate this afternoon. I am proud to support Randy \nCrane's nomination to be a Federal judge for the Southern District of \nTexas.\n  Texas' Southern District has the third highest number of filings of \ncriminal cases in the country. It is tremendously overburdened. The \nnonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States has designated the \ncourt as a ``judicial emergency.''\n  Randy Crane has an outstanding record of academic qualifications, \nlegal experience, and public service to make him an excellent Federal \njudge. He has been unanimously approved by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  A graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, Randy Crane received \nhis law degree with honors at the University of Texas School of Law at \nthe age of 22. He is currently a partner with one of the outstanding \nlaw firms of Texas, Atlas & Hall, a law firm in McAllen, TX. He has \nbeen active in the State bar of Texas and a director of the Texas-\nMexico Bar Association.\n  Randy Crane is a native of south Texas, and he is of Mexican American \nheritage. Randy Crane has strong relationships within the local \ncommunity. He is highly respected and has been very active in McAllen. \nEveryone I have talked to who lives in McAllen knows Randy Crane and \nthinks so highly of him.\n  His community involvement includes working with the McAllen \nIndependent School District helping children, trying to make sure they \nhave a quality public education system in McAllen. He is active with \nthe American Cancer Society, youth soccer, and Little League baseball.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Randy Crane to the \nFederal bench. This is a vacancy that needs to be filled quickly, and \nwe have a quality candidate to fill that need.\n  The President has made this nomination, and his nomination has \nreceived bipartisan support.

Madam President, there have been two important events \nrelating to missile defense programs that occurred last week, which I \nwould like to bring to the attention of the Senate.\n  First is the successful test last Friday night of our Nation's long-\nrange missile defense system. This was the fourth successful test \nagainst an intercontinental ballistic missile and it was much more \ncomplicated than earlier tests have been, in that the target warhead \nwas accompanied by three decoys. Despite the presence of these \ncountermeasures, the interceptor was able to destroy the ICBM warhead.\n  The target warhead was launched on a missile from California, nearly \n5,000 miles from the interceptor. The target warhead itself was a cone \nabout 4 feet high and 2 feet wide at its base. The decoys were about \nthe same size. Sensors were able to track these objects along their \nflightpath and give their location to a battle management system. The \nbattle management system computed an intercept point and launched the \ninterceptor. The interceptor missile received information about the \ntarget's position and characteristics, and while it was still several \nhundred miles from the target warhead, the kill vehicle separated from \nits booster rocket, its infrared sensors then detected the target, and \nits guidance system fired small rocket motors to guide the vehicle into \na collision with the warhead. The target was destroyed by the force of \nthis collision. All of this took place in just a few minutes in outer \nspace, at closing speeds in excess of 20,000 miles an hour.\n\n  This impressive event cannot be considered routine, but it is \nbecoming regular. The regularity with which our missile defense testing \nis succeeding is very encouraging. Although slowed down by uncertain \nfunding and ABM Treaty restrictions in the past, the missile defense \nprogram is now showing the benefits of the support provided by Congress \nover the past few years and of the new seriousness with which President \nBush has attacked this problem.\n  There is still much technical work to be done, and problems are bound \nto occur, as they do in all weapons programs. But the continued testing \nsuccess of our ground-based missile defense system--as well as in other \nmissile defense systems such as the Patriot PAC-3 and the sea-based \nmidcourse system--suggests that we are steadily making progress and \nmoving toward the time when we will no longer be defenseless against \nballistic missile attack.\n  The other event I want to mention in this context was last week's \ntestimony before our Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International \nSecurity by Mr. Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for \nStrategic and Nuclear Programs at the CIA. Mr. Walpole testified on an \nunclassified CIA report published last December entitled ``Foreign \nMissile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United \nStates Through 2015.'' Compared with\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nthe 1999 version of this report, Mr. Walpole said the missile threat to \nthe United States had increased in significant ways. He also said \nspecifically, where it was previously judged that the United States \nwould probably face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from \nIran by 2015, it is now said by our intelligence community to be most \nlikely the same level of threat assigned to North Korea. And North \nKorea's Taepo Dong-2 missile, which previously was assessed at having a \nrange of up to 6,000 kilometers, is now judged to have a range of \n10,000 kilometers if configured with two rocket stages, and 15,000 \nkilometers if it is equipped with a third stage, as was its \npredecessor.\n\n  A 15,000 kilometer range is sufficient, according to Mr. Walpole, to \nreach all of North America with a payload large enough to carry a \nnuclear weapon. The report notes that the proliferation of missile \ntechnology also has become worse. The witness said Iran was now \nassuming a more significant role as a supplier of this technology to \nother nations. Finally, Mr. Walpole noted that the United States needs \nto be vigilant against both terrorism and long-range missile threats, \nsaying:\n\n       We've got to cover both threats.\n\n  As we fight a war against terrorism, we cannot lose sight of the fact \nthat other threats are just as serious. The CIA's report on the missile \nthreat is a timely reminder of that, and last Friday's successful \nmissile defense test is an encouraging sign that we are making progress \nin preparing to answer that threat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise on this occasion to wish a happy 90th \nAnniversary to the Girl Scouts of the USA, and invite my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the organization in their 90th year of building \ncharacter, confidence, and skills necessary for success in girls \nthroughout the country. Founded on March 12, 1912, when Juliette Gordon \nLow assembled 18 girls from Savannah, GA, Girl Scouts of the USA has \ngrown to a current membership of 3.8 million, making it the largest \norganization for girls in the world. On March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts \nof the USA became the first national organization for girls to be \ngranted a Federal charter by Congress.\n  I am proud to say that Girls Scouts in the State of Mississippi are \nactive and growing stronger every day. I recently visited with Kitty \nMauffray, Dorothy Shaw, Ann Billick, Jean Lee, Dr. Mary Cates, and \nRowell Saunders, representatives from the Girl Scouts Councils of \nMississippi. I am pleased to know that at the present time, with 45,000 \ngirls enrolled, 1 out of 9 girls in Mississippi is a Girl Scout. I am \nsure that these numbers will continue to grow.\n  I would also like to recognize the Girl Scouts of Mississippi for \ntheir commitment to community service. Not only do they routinely visit \nnursing homes, help to beautify our cities and towns, and work to \nimprove the quality of life for children less fortunate than \nthemselves, but I understand that in the aftermath of September 11, \nGirl Scouts across Mississippi worked to collect donations and created \nmany cards of sympathy and support for victims of this national \ntragedy. The Girl Scout Law states that each scout will do her best to \n``make the world a better place,'' and I think that these girls have \ndone just that.\n  Girl Scouts of the USA recognizes that girls need leadership skills, \nself-assurance, and social conscience to become strong women. I offer \nmy sincere congratulations to the Girl Scouts of the USA for fulfilling \nthis need, and wish them the best of luck in the future as they \ncontinue to help girls grow strong and instill values that will last a \nlifetime.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Girl \nScouts on their 90th anniversary celebration which took place on March \n12, 2002.\n  The first Girl Scout meeting took place in Savannah, GA on March 12, \n1912 when Juliette Gordon Low gathered eighteen girls together. Ninety \nyears later, with 3.7 million members, the organization continues to \noffer girls of all ages, races and socio-economic backgrounds the \nopportunity to grow, develop friendships, challenge themselves, and \ngain valuable life experiences.\n  There are 40,000 Girl Scouts in my home state of Washington. These \ngirls are among millions nationwide who are preparing themselves to be \nfuture leaders. By examining high-tech careers, developing money \nmanagement skills, participating in the arts and sports, and learning \nabout other cultures, Girl Scouts are making themselves well rounded \nindividuals who will no doubtedly lead our country to great things in \nthe years to come. Girl Scouts serve to better our environment, our \ncommunity and our country.\n  I would like to highlight the accomplishments of one of my \nconstituents, Girl Scout Katie Grimes. Katie is one of ten women to \nreceive the National Women of Distinction Award which recognizes women \nwho have demonstrated enormous courage and strength. Katie, using many \nof the skills she developed in the Girl Scouts, founded the Federal Way \nAutism Support Group in Federal Way. Katie, who herself is autistic, is \nwell aware of the acute needs of autistic individuals and their \nfamilies and worked diligently to establish the first support group in \nher community. I am pleased that the Federal Way Autism Support Group \nnow supports over ninety families in the area and I am hopeful that \nKatie's organization will serve as a national model to provide comfort \nand assistance to the thousands of people who are afflicted with \nautism.\n  I was thrilled to have been invited by my State Girl Scouts Councils \nto join in the first Honorary Congressional Girl Scout Troop. I am \npleased to join my female colleagues, Representatives Jo Ann Emerson \nand Ellen Tauscher, and Senators Hutchison and Mikulski as a member of \nthis troop. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Troop \nCapitol Hill, and Girl Scout troops across the country to identify the \nmany challenges facing girls and young women today and ways we can \nassist them to overcome these obstacles.\n  Again, I wish to congratulate the Girl Scouts on their 90th \nanniversary milestone and thank them for the important and valuable \nwork that they continue to do.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 90th \nanniversary of the Girl Scouts of the USA.\n  Girl Scouting began on March 12, 1912, when founder Juliette Gordon \nLow assembled 18 girls from Savannah, GA. She believed all girls should \nbe given the opportunity to develop physically, mentally and \nspiritually. Girl Scouts of the USA was chartered by the U.S. Congress \non March 16, 1952.\n  That belief in personal development has evolved into today's Girl \nScout mission; to help all girls grow strong.\n  The Girl Scouts have grown leaps and bounds from that first meeting \nof 18 girls in 1912. There are more than 233,000 troops throughout the \nUnited States and Puerto Rico available to all girls ages 5-17. Today, \nthere is a membership of 3.8 million worldwide, making it the largest \norganization in the world for girls. More than 50 million women are \nGirl Scout alumnae, including my wife, Susan, and our daughter, Tyler.\n  We celebrate today the principles on which the Girl Scouts were \nfounded: Empowering girls to develop their full potential; teaching \ngirls to relate well with others; developing values that provide the \nfoundation for sound decision-making; and making positive contributions \nto society.\n  Girl Scouting continues to apply these principles to current issues \nwith programs that encourage girls to bridge the digital divide; pursue \ncareers in science, math and technology; learn how to manage money; and \nto grow into healthy, resourceful citizens.\n  Troop meetings take place without regard to socioeconomic or \ngeographic boundaries. Meetings take place in homeless shelters, \nmigrant farm\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\ncamps, and juvenile detention facilities. There are even meetings which \nassist girls who are relocating, whether across the State or around the \nworld, with support and help them adjust to new locations. The Girls \nScouts mobilized immediately following September 11 to provide \nresources for girls and their families dealing with fear and loss.\n  Let us commend this organization for the positive role it has played \nin the lives of million of girls and women in Virginia, across the \nNation, and around the world. I applaud their efforts and wish them the \nbest for another tremendous 90 years of Girl Scouting in the USA.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Girl \nScouts of America on their 90th Anniversary.\n  Since Juliette Gordon Low founded the Girl Scouts in 1912, this \norganization has provided young girls with the leadership skills to \nmake a difference in their communities and our world. Girl Scouts teach \nself-confidence, responsibility and integrity at a young age and these \ncore values stay with girls throughout their lives.\n  Today, more than 3.7 million girls in over 233,000 troops are \nlearning new skills, developing talents and building friendships across \ngeographic, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Through scouting, Girl \nScouts participate in community service projects, cultural exchanges, \nathletic events and educational activities. None of this would be \npossible without the generosity and commitment of parents and community \nmembers who donate their time to help shape the lives of young girls \nthrough the Girl Scouts.\n  In Nebraska, I represent more than 20,000 Girl Scouts, I am also a \nproud Girl Scout parent.\n  I congratulate and thank the Girl Scouts on their 90th year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2004-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               46TH ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nanniversary on March 20 of the independence of Tunisia, an Arab \nrepublic and friend of the United States for forty-six years. Americans \nof my generation recall the principles advanced by Tunisia's first \nleader, Habib Bourguiba, in setting the country on its historic course, \nliberty, modernity and religious tolerance. Today, under President Zine \nAbidine Ben Ali, the country continues its substantial progress toward \nestablishing an export-oriented market economy, raising real per capita \nincome, combating poverty, educating its girls and boys equally well, \nand improving the standard of living for all its citizens. As we \napplaud these achievements, we also wish the Tunisian people and their \nleaders perseverance and success in building a society of justice, \ncivil rights, and pluralistic, participatory democracy.\n  This body and the American people today can thank Tunisia for its \nsteadfast support during its membership on the United Nations Security \nCouncil in 2001. In the weeks and months after September 11, the \nSecurity Council adopted several resolutions that embodied U.S. \nobjectives for combating global terrorism and freeing Afghanistan from \nthe yoke of a repressive regime that granted safe haven to al-Qaida. \nTunisia, the sole Arab member state on the Council at that time, worked \nclosely and constructively with the United States in that crucial \ndiplomacy.\n  So, on this, the 46th anniversary of Tunisia's independence, we \nrecognize an international friend and express our commitment to \ncontinued cooperation and mutual progress over the years to come. We \nare fortunate to count Tunisia among our friends and partners in North \nAfrica, the Middle East, and on the global stage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2004-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2004-S2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         4-H 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President I rise today to recognize the National 4-H \norganization upon it's 100th anniversary this year. The organization, \nsymbolized by the famous four leaf clover, has become synonymous with \nrural America and agriculture. While 4-H has its roots in many States, \nI am proud to say that the youth organization got its primary start in \nmy home State of Ohio--in Springfield.\n  I would like to take a few minutes today to remind my colleagues \nabout how 4-H evolved into what it is today. In doing so, we need to \nstep back and remember what our Nation was like at the beginning of the \n20th century and how the field of agriculture was suffering from the \nindustrial revolution.\n  As a result of the industrial revolution, our nation experienced, for \nthe first time, a greater number of people living in cities than in \nsmall, rural agricultural communities. As a new generation of farmers \nwere talking about moving to ``the big city,'' many began to fear a \nlapse in the traditional teaching techniques in which parents taught \ntheir children how to farm. Additionally, the industrial revolution \nbrought about new technologies, many of which greatly affected farming \ntechniques. At first, unfortunately, few people knew about these \ntechnologies--let alone how to use them. As concerns continued to grow, \nmany communities were forced to develop programs that sought new and \ninnovative ways of teaching the next generation of farmers.\n  The most successful of these programs was created in Springfield, OH. \nIt was there, in 1902, that Albert B. Graham, superintendent of the \nClark County school system, first established agricultural classes. \nRecognizing that many people would have a difficult time with the \nconcept of learning farming outside of the family, Graham established a \nclub that offered Saturday morning classes in the basement of the \ncounty building. Families coming into town to do their weekly shopping \ncould drop off their children at the courses. In a sense, it was a form \nof daycare, but one in which the boys and girls were kept busy learning \nhow to examine soil with litmus paper and how to tie knots and splice \nropes. They even examined droplets of milk under microscopes.\n  Eventually, Graham expanded this program with help from the Ohio \nAgricultural Experiment Station and the dean of agriculture at The Ohio \nState University, itself a land-grant college. Ohio State took quickly \nto this course concept, as it offered the university an effective way \nto communicate with farmers throughout Ohio. By 1903, Graham's \nagriculture club had over 100 members, and by 1904, 13 such countywide \nclubs had been organized in Ohio. You might say that Graham had planted \nthe seed for the 4-H organization, and it sprouted quickly.\n  It didn't take long before similar clubs grew nationally. Around this \ntime, a clover became a commonly known symbol for club members, who \nwore the symbol on their lapels. Another landmark for 4-H came in 1906, \nwhen Thomas Campbell, an assistant to George Washington Carver, was \nhired to establish youth farming organizations for African-American \nfarmers in the south. At a time in our Nation when the racial divide \nran deep, 4-H was clearly ahead of its time.\n  By 1914, a mere decade after 4-H's creation, President Woodrow Wilson \nsigned the Smith-Lever Act into law, establishing the Cooperative \nExtension System. This system offered a mechanism through which 4-H \nprograms could receive Federal funds.\n  Now jump forward to today. The 4-H organization continues to be one \nthe most active youth organizations in our Nation, with chapters not \nonly in the United States, but throughout the world. 4-H clubs have \nexpanded from rural to urban areas, where they provide a new of group \nkids with essential leadership skills and community service \ninvolvement. National 4-H meetings have even become platforms for \npresidents and other national officials to voice their ideas for \nagriculture and other policies.\n  The fear of an agriculture system eroding away with the expansion of \ncities continues to this day, as we have witnessed the massive growth \nin urban sprawl. But, this merely furthers the need for 4-H. Although \ntoday's 4-H organization may be larger than the original 100 members \nand our communication has increased from town meetings to Internet chat \nrooms, the organization's principles of Head, Heart, Hands, and Health \nremain the same. Without question, the lessons and skills 4-H members \nlearn will last a lifetime.\n  I am proud to know that organizations, like 4-H, are there to help \nguide our next generation of farmers, teachers, and even elected \nofficials toward a better tomorrow. I also am proud to say that my \nwife, Fran, and I have had\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\nchildren go through the 4-H program for 24 straight years now--in fact, \nlast year was our eighth and youngest child, Anna's first year in 4-H.\n  I congratulate 4-H on their centennial anniversary, and I wish them \nthe best for their next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2005-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JOHN S.

He has \ndistinguished himself and the Army Medical Command while serving in \nseveral positions of increasing responsibility. Major General Parker \ncapped his illustrious career as Commander of the United States Army \nMedical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick, MD.\n  During his extraordinary military service, General Parker has shaped \nevery part of the Army Medical Department, from direct patient care, \ntraining, personnel management, and installation management, to \ndoctrine development, policymaking, research and medical product \ndevelopment. His mark on military medicine extends far beyond the \nDepartment of Defense and into the international community.\n  We in the Senate saw the important work of Ft.

Major General Parker's command \nresponded by swiftly and accurately identifying the anthrax here on \nCapital Hill.\n  Major General Parker's service embodies the best traditions our \nmilitary services have to offer. This soldier, statesman, scientist, \nand commander has displayed the highest level of commitment to our most \nprecious resource, America's armed forces.\n  I thank John and his wife Julie for their tireless dedication to \nserving the United States and the Army. They have served our Nation \nwith honor. I wish John and Julie well as they enter a new phase of \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2005-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO AGNES SCULLY FISTER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAgnes Scully Fister, who died January 9, 2002, at the age of 85.\n  Agnes made it easy for people to remember her, leaving behind a \nlegacy as a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. She was a \nunique individual who cherished life, enjoyed going to church, and \nloved meeting and talking to people. She married Louis A. Fister and \nwas blessed with a wonderful family that included four sons and two \ndaughters. Agnes will be remembered for many different reasons, not the \nleast of which is her dedication to her family and friends.\n  A native of Kentucky, Agnes was born in Lexington to Ed and Sarah \nScully. She graduated high school from St. Catherine's Academy and \nlater went on to work as a children's clothing buyer for retail stores \nsuch as Purcell's, Embry's, Wolfe Wiles, McAlpins, and Tots 'n Teens.\n  Agnes was a devoted Catholic and a long-time member of St. Paul \nCatholic Church. St. Paul played a significant role in Agnes' life and \nis where she was baptized, received first Holy Communion, was \nconfirmed, and married. Upon her passing away, St. Paul is also where \nher family and friends gathered to say their goodbyes and to celebrate \nher life.\n  I am certain the legacy left behind by Agnes Fister will live on.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition and \nhonor of my friend and an outstanding public servant, Mr. Duane Harris \nof St. Simons Island, GA. Duane will be retiring on April 1 of this \nyear from his position as the Director, Coastal Resources Division, of \nthe Georgia Department of Natural Resources. His retirement comes after \nsome three decades of service to the people of the State of Georgia and \nthis Nation.\n  Duane has served in the very important position of Coastal Director \nsince 1982, during a time of extraordinary challenge for the Department \nof Natural Resources. The Coastal Division encompasses all of our \nbeautiful Golden Isles where we take great pride in our magnificent \nbeaches, salt water and fresh water wetlands, and the living creatures \nthat depend on those ecosystems for life itself.\n  In Georgia, as elsewhere in our Nation, the coastal area is where we \nfind some of the greatest pressures for development and population \ngrowth, and the inevitable confrontation between those pressures and \nenvironmental protection. And in this difficult arena, Duane Harris has \nserved with remarkable distinction.\n  Duane joined the Georgia DNR on July 1 of 1970. His service to the \nState's coastal resources through the years has been diverse and \ndistinguished. In his initial job of Wildlife Biologist he worked in \ndeveloping the baseline characterization of marine fisheries resources \nin Georgia, including assessing shrimp and blue crab stocks and \nformulating management decisions regarding harvest seasons in specific \nareas. He conducted a coast-wide inventory of Georgia's oyster \nresources and was one of the founders of Georgia's very popular \nArtificial Reef Program in the 1970's. He has championed that program's \ngrowth to a system that now consists of more than 30 inshore and \noffshore reefs, providing an essential marine habitat.\n  Duane was instrumental in the establishment and expansion of the \nCoastal Division's 24-hour on-call network, which has provided round-\nthe-clock response to fish kill, sea turtle and marine mammal \nstrandings since the 1980's. He has personally responded to numerous \nsituations involving strandings and injured birds, sea turtles, and \nporpoises. Duane is the contact that local officials, the Coast Guard, \nLaw Enforcement, and coastal citizens call upon when no one can be \nreached. He has also worked tirelessly as a volunteer for DNR's annual \nWeekend for Wildlife celebration since its inception in 1989.\n  Let me also note that Duane is not simply someone who works to \nenforce a rulebook. He is an innovative and thoughtful planner who \nhelps shape new policies. For example, during the 1990's, he played a \npivotal role in the passage of far-reaching legislation to benefit \nGeorgia's unique coastal environment when he spearheaded the successful \nregulatory implementation of The Protection of Tidewaters Act, O.C.G.A. \nSections 52-1-1 through 52-1-10, and the Right of Passage Act, O.C.G.A. \n52-1-30 through 52-1-39, in 1992, culminating in the removal by 1999 of \nthe last remaining river houses that were causing environmental \ndegradation and other problems.\n\n  Duane worked very hard to provide information to local municipalities \nand county governments about the benefits of a federally-approved \nGeorgia Coastal Management Program, and has assisted in the development \nof the Georgia Coastal Management Act, O.C.G.A. Section 12-5-320, in \n1997, and its very successful implementation since that time.\n  Over the past 4 years, Duane Harris spearheaded the efforts to \nregulate driving on Georgia's remote barrier island beaches in a manner \nconsistent with the Shore Protection Act. Duane took the lead on all \nrequired administrative procedures, facilitating a lengthy citizen \nadvisory process initiated in August 1998. He formulated the resulting \nregulations to afford the needed protection to shorebirds, nesting sea \nturtles, and the fragile dune environment while accommodating the \ninterests of legally-recognized property holders. This was a sensitive \nand controversial issue, for which he forged a reasonable system of \nregulation. Following adoption of these rules in December 1998, he \nworked to implement them prior to the onset of the 1999 sea turtle \nnesting season.\n  Duane recently led the deliberations of a diverse Marsh Hammocks \nAdvisory Council in an examination of the issue of development of \ncoastal marsh hammocks and back barrier islands. His regional and \nnational conservation service includes serving as chairman of\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nboth the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the Atlantic \nStates Marine Fisheries Commission.\n  At the State and local level, he has brought a marine conservation \nperspective to the numerous boards, steering committees, task forces, \ncivic and service organizations on which he has served, including the \nLeadership Georgia Board of Trustees, the Brunswick Rotary, the \nBrunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce, and the Keep Brunswick-\nGolden Isles Clean and Beautiful Board. In recognition of his marine \nconservation expertise and contributions, he is member of the Skidaway \nFoundation Board.\n  This outline of Duane's career gives us an appreciation of his \nprofessional record, but it does not come close to illuminating the \nstrength of his career. It takes a leader of special qualities to meet \nthe challenges of administering the laws and regulations that govern \ncoast areas. It takes a person of accomplishment in scientific skills, \nbut it also takes a person of patience, honesty, and integrity. And it \ntakes a person who can deal directly and effectively with immediate and \ndifficult problems.\n  That is why Duane, in my mind, embodies the special qualities of \npublic service that are so important to this Nation. I know that many \nof my colleagues have had distinguished careers of service to local and \nState governments prior to their election to the Senate. Service in the \nSenate is an extraordinary honor and an extraordinary responsibility \nand opportunity. At the same time, we are in many ways insulated from \nthe direct consequences of policies on the lives of people.\n  As Lieutenant Governor and then Governor of Georgia, I had the \nprivilege of face-to-face contacts with citizens in need, and I \nstruggled with the difficult task of solving real and immediate \nproblems. I learned that it is men and women like Duane Harris who are \ntruly the ``hands-on'' public servants throughout this great country. \nThey must, on a daily basis, operate the enforcement programs that \ntransform laws and regulations into action. They must make quick \ndecisions that affect people's lives and livelihoods.\n  I am proud to have known Duane Harris for many, many years as both a \ndedicated public servant and a friend. I will also add that he is one \nof the best fishermen you will ever have the opportunity to meet, and I \nunderstand that after some 30 years of service to the State of Georgia, \nthat is exactly what he plans to do, go fishing. Except that he will be \ndoing that as a professional fishing guide with his own boat.\n  Duane is still a young man, and I know that as a private citizen he \nand his accomplished wife, Carol, will continue to be a source of great \nstrength and leadership to their community. He is the kind of man who \nwill always carry out his work with unselfish energy and sound values.\n  On behalf of all of my colleagues in the United States Congress, I \nwould like to thank Duane Harris for his devotion to his duty and \nexpress my heartfelt thanks for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2006-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2006-S2007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5744.

A bill to establish the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust \nArea within the Cibola National Forest in the State of New Mexico to \nresolve a land claim involving the Sandia Mountain Wilderness, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources; jointly, pursuant to the order of March \n14, 2002, with instructions that if one Committee reports, the other \nCommittee have twenty calendar days, excluding any period where the \nSenate is not in session for more that three days, to report or be \ndischarged.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat would create a unique area within the Cibola National Forest in \nNew Mexico, entitled the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area. The \nimportance of this bill cannot be overstated. It would resolve, through \na negotiated agreement, the Pueblo of Sandia's land claim to Sandia \nMoutain, an area of significant value and use to all New Mexicans. The \nbill would also maintain full public ownership and access to the \nNational Forest and Sandia Mountain Wilderness lands within the \nPueblo's claim area; clear title for affected homeowners; and grant the \nnecessary rights-of-way and easements to protect private property \ninterests and the public's ongoing use of the Area.\n  The need for this bill and the basis for Sandia Pueblo's claim arise \nfrom a 1748 grant to the Pueblo from a representative of the King of \nSpain. That grant was recognized and confirmed by Congress in 1858, 11 \nStat. 374). There remains, however, a dispute over the location of the \neastern boundary of the Pueblo that stems from an 1859 survey of the \ngrant. That survey fixed the eastern boundary roughly along the top of \na foothill on the western slope of the mountain, rather than along the \ntrue crest of the mountain. The Pueblo has contended that the \ninterpretation of the grant, and thus the survey and subsequent patent, \nare erroneous, and that the true eastern boundary is the crest of the \nmountain.\n  In the early 1980's, the Pueblo approached the Department of the \nInterior seeking a resurvey of the grant to locate the eastern boundary \nof the Pueblo along the main ridge of Sandia Mountain. In December \n1988, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued an opinion \nrejecting the Pueblo's claim. The Pueblo challenged the opinion in \nfederal district court and in 1998, the court issued on Order setting \naside the 1988 opinion and remanding the matter to Interior for forther \nproceedings. Pueblo of Sandia v. Babbitt, Civ. No. 94-2624, D.D.C., \nJuly 18, 1998. The Order was appealed but appellate proceedings were \nstayed for more than a year while a settlement was being negotiated. \nUltimately, on April 4, 2000, a settlement agreement was executed \nbetween the United States, Pueblo, and the Sandia Peak Tram Company. \nThat agreement was conditioned on congressional ratification, but \nremains effective until November 15, 2002.\n  In November, 2000, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia \nCircuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the \nDistrict Court's action was not a final appealable decision. Upon \ndismissal, the Department of the Interior proceeded with its \nreconsideration of the 1988 Solicitor's opinion in accord with the 1998 \nOrder of the District Court. On January 19, 2001, the Solicitor issued \na new opinion that concluded that the 1859 survey of the Sandia Pueblo \ngrant was erroneous and that a resurvey should be conducted. \nImplementation of the opinion would therefore remove the area from its \nNational Forest status and convey it to the Pueblo. The Department \nstayed the resurvey, however, until after November 15, 2002, so that \nthere would be time for Congress to legislate the settlement and make \nit permanent.\n  To state the obvious, this is a very complicated situation. The area \nthat is the subject of the Pueblo's claim has been used by the Pueblo \nand its members for centuries and is of great significance to the \nPueblo for traditional and cultural reasons. The Pueblo strongly \ndesires that the wilderness character of the area continue to be \npreserved and its use by the Pueblo protected. Notwithstanding that \ninterest and use, the Federal Government has administered the claim \narea as a unit of the National Forest system for most of the last \ncentury and over the years has issued patents for several hundred acres \nof land within the area to persons who had no notice of the Pueblo's \nclaim. As a result, there are now several subdivisions within the \nexternal boundaries of the area, and although the Pueblo's lawsuit \nspecifically disclaimed any title or interest in privately-owned lands, \nthe residents of the subdivisions have concerns that the claim and its \nassociated litigation have resulted in hardships by clouding titles to \nland. Finally, as a unit of the National forest system, the areas has\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\ngreat significance to the public and in particular, the people in the \nState of New Mexico, including the residents of the Counties of \nBernalillo and Sandoval and the City of Albuquerque, who use the claim \narea for recreational and other purposes and who desire that the public \nuse and natural character of the area be preserved.\n  Because of the complexity of the situation, including the significant \nand overlapping interests just mentioned, Congress has not yet acted in \nthis matter. In particular, concerns about the settlement were \nexpressed by parties who did not participate in the final stages of the \nnegotiations. I have worked with those parties to address their \nconcerns while still trying to maintain the benefits secured by the \nparties in the Settlement Agreement. I believe the legislation that I \nhave introduced today is a fair compromise. It provides the Pueblo \nspecific rights and interests in the area that help to resolve its \nclaim with finality but also, as noted earlier, maintains full public \nownership and access to the National Forest system lands. In that \nsense, using the term ``Trust'' in the title recognizes those specific \ninterests but does not confer the same status that exists when the \nSecretary of the Interior accepts title to land in trust on behalf of \nan Indian tribe.\n  Most importantly, the bill I am introducing today relies on a \nsettlement as the basis for resolving this claim. Although other \napproaches have been circulated, this bill is the only one with the \npotential to secure a consensus of the interested parties. Not only is \na negotiated settlement the appropriate manner by which to resolve the \nPueblo's claim, it also allows for a solution that fits the unique \ncircumstances of this situation. To my knowledge, Sandia Pueblo's claim \nis the only Indian land claim that exists where the tribe may \neffectively recover ownership of federal land without an Act of \nCongress. Nonetheless, the parties have negotiated a creative \narrangement to address the Pueblo's interest, protect private property, \nand still maintain public ownership of the land. That is to be \ncommended and I am proud to introduce this legislation to preserve the \nsubstance of that arrangement.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2009-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2009-S2014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENT ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--MARCH 18, 2002\n\n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 2025. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase \nthe rate of special pension for recipients of the Medal of Honor and to \nmake that special pension effective from the date of the act for which \nthe recipient is awarded the Medal of Honor and to amend title 18, \nUnited States Code, to increase the criminal penalties associated with \nmisuse of fraud relating to the Medal of Honor; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Living \nAmerican Hero Appreciation Act. This legislation honors those Americans \nthat have exhibited the highest levels of courage. It ensures that the \nrecipients of the Medal of Honor receive the recognition and support \nthat they earned through their acts of bravery. As the war on terrorism \nprogresses, I believe that it is important that we remember those that \nhave already fought for our Nation, and placed themselves in peril in \norder to defend our freedom.\n  As the senior Senator from Arkansas, I'm very proud that my State has \nproduced over 20 Medal of Honor recipients. Three of these courageous \nindividuals still live in Arkansas. Clarence Craft of Fayetteville and \nNathan Gordon of Morrilton received their medals as a result of heroism \nin World War II. Nick Bacon of Little Rock was cited for his courage in \nVietnam. Nick has continued his service to our Nation as the Director \nof the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  This legislation will ensure that our Nation's Medal of Honor \nrecipients receive the recognition that they've earned. It will raise \ntheir special pension to $1,000 a month. More significantly, though, it \nwill ensure that recipients receive pension payment for the period \nbetween the act of heroism for which the individual was given the \nmedal, and the actually issuance of the medal. These courageous \nindividuals should not be penalized for administrative delays in \nissuing the decoration. Finally, this bill includes increased criminal \npenalties for the unauthorized purchase, possession of a Medal of \nHonor, and for false impersonation of a Medal of Honor recipient.\n  I want to thank Congressman Curt Weldon for his hard work in getting \nthis bill passed by the House of Representatives. It is my privilege to \nintroduce the Senate version of this bill, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues for its swift passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the use of Cooperative Threat Reduction \nfunds for projects and activities to address proliferation threats \noutside the states of the former Soviet Union, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nunn-Lugar/\nCTR Expansion Act. My bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to \nuse up to $50 million of unobligated Nunn-Lugar/Cooperative Threat \nReduction funds for non-proliferation projects and emergencies outside \nthe states of the former Soviet Union.\n  In 1991, I introduced the Nunn-Lugar/Cooperative Threat Reduction \nlegislation with former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. The program was \ndesigned to assist the states of the former Soviet Union in dismantling \nweapons of mass destruction and establishing verifiable safeguards \nagainst the proliferation of those weapons. For more than 20 years the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program has been our country's principal \nresponse to the proliferation threat that resulted from the \ndisintegration of the custodial system guarding the Soviet nuclear, \nchemical, and biological legacy.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program has destroyed a vast array of former Soviet \nweaponry, including 443 ballistic missiles, 427 ballistic missile \nlaunchers, 92 bombers, 483 long-range nuclear air-launched cruise \nmissiles, 368 submarine ballistic missile launchers, 286 submarine \nlaunched ballistic missiles, 21 strategic missile submarines, 194 \nnuclear test tunnels, and 5,809 nuclear warheads that were mounted on \nstrategic systems aimed at us. All this has been accomplished at a cost \nof less than one-third of 1 percent of the Department of Defense's \nannual budget. In addition, Nunn-Lugar facilitated the removal of all \nnuclear weapons from Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus.\n  Nunn-Lugar also has launched aggressive efforts to safeguard and \neliminate the former Soviet chemical and biological weapons arsenals. \nThe Nunn-Lugar Program has been used to upgrade the security \nsurrounding these dangerous substances and to provide civilian \nemployment to tens of thousands of Russian weapons scientists. We are \nnow beginning efforts to construct facilities that will destroy the \nRussian arsenal of chemical warheads.\n  The continuing experience of Nunn-Lugar has created a tremendous non-\nproliferation asset for the United States. We have an impressive cadre \nof talented scientists, technicians, negotiators, and managers working \nfor the Defense Department and for associated defense contractors. \nThese individuals understand how to implement non-proliferation \nprograms and how to respond to proliferation emergencies. The bill I am \nintroducing today would permit and facilitate the use of Nunn-Lugar \nexpertise and resources when non-proliferation threats around the world \nare identified.\n  The Nunn-Lugar/CTR Expansion Act would be a vita component of our \nnational security strategy in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The \nproblem we face today is not just terrorism. It is the nexus between \nterrorists and weapons of mass destruction. There is little doubt that \nOsama bin Laden and al-Quaeda would have used weapons of mass \ndestruction if they had possessed them. It is equally clear that they \nhave made an effort to obtain them.\n\n  The al-Quaeda terrorist attacks on the United States were planned to \nkill thousands of people indiscriminately. The goal was massive \ndestruction of institutions, wealth, national morale, and innocent \npeople. We can safely assume that those objectives have not changed. As \nhorrible as the tragedy of September 11th was, the death, destruction, \nand disruption to American society was minimal compared to what could \nhave been inflicted by a weapon of mass destruction.\n  Victory in this war must be defined not only in terms of finding and \nkilling Osama bin Laden or destroying terrorist cells in this or that \ncountry. We must also undertake the ambitious goal of comprehensively \npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Let me propose a fairly simple and clear definition of victory. \nImagine two lists. The first list is of those nation-states that house \nterrorist cells, voluntarily or involuntarily. Those states can be \nhighlighted on a map illustrating who and where they are. Our stated \ngoal will be to shrink that list nation by nation. Through intelligence \nsharing, termination of illicit financial channels, support of local \npolice work, diplomacy, and public information, a coalition of nations \nled by the United States should seek to root out each cell in a \ncomprehensive manner for years to come and maintain a public record of \nsuccess that the world can observe and measure. If we are diligent and \ndetermined, we can terminate or cripple most of these cells.\n  But there should also be a second list. It would contain all of the \nstates that possess materials, programs, or weapons of mass \ndestruction. We should demand that each of these nation-states account \nfor all of the materials, programs, and weapons in a manner that is \ninternationally verifiable. We should demand that all such weapons and \nmaterials be made secure from theft or threat of proliferation, using \nthe funds of that country and supplemented by international funds if \nrequired. We should work with each nation to formulate programs of \ncontinuing accountability and destruction.\n  Victory, then, can be succinctly stated: we must keep the world's \nmost dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world's most \ndangerous people. This requires diligent work that shrinks both lists. \nBoth lists should be clear and finite. The war against terrorism will \nnot be over until all nations on the lists have complied with these \nstandards.\n  Despite the tremendous progress realized by the Nunn-Lugar program in \nthe former Soviet Union, the United States continues to lack even \nminimal international confidence about many foreign weapons programs. \nIn most cases, there is little or no information regarding the number \nof weapons or amounts of materials a country may have produced, the \nstorage procedures they employ to safeguard their weapons, or plans \nregarding further production or destruction programs. We must pay much \nmore attention to making certain that all weapons and materials of mass \ndestruction are identified, continuously guarded, and systematically \ndestroyed.\n  As the United States and our allies have sought to address the \nthreats posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction in the \naftermath of September 11, we have come to the realization that, in \nmany cases, we lack the appropriate tools to address these \nthreats. Traditional avenues of approach such as arms control treaties \nand various multilateral sanction regimes have met with some success, \nbut there is still much work to do. In some cases, it is unlikely that \nthe existing multilateral frameworks and non-proliferation tools retain \nmuch utility. In fact, several nations have announced their intention \nto continue to flout international norms such as the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty.\n\n  Beyond Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, Nunn-\nLugar-style cooperative threat reduction programs aimed at weapons \ndismantlement and counter-proliferation do not exist. The ability to \napply the Nunn-Lugar model to states outside the former Soviet Union \nwould provide the United States with another tool to confront the \nthreats associated with weapons of mass destruction.\n  The precise replication of the Nunn-Lugar program will not be \npossible everywhere. Clearly, many states will continue to avoid \naccountability for programs related to weapons of mass destruction. \nWhen nations resist such accountability, other options must be \nexplored. When governments continue to contribute to the WMD threat \nfacing the United States, we must be prepared to apply diplomatic and \neconomic power, as well as military force.\n  Yet we should not assume that we cannot forge cooperative non-\nproliferation programs with some critical nations. The experience of \nthe Nunn-Lugar program in Russia has demonstrated that the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction can lead to extraordinary outcomes based on \nmutual interest. No one would have predicted in the 1980s that American \ncontractors and DOD officials would be on the ground in Russia \ndestroying thousands of strategic systems. If we are to protect \nourselves during this incredibly dangerous period, we must create new \nnon-proliferation partners and aggressively pursue any non-\nproliferation opportunities that appear. The Nunn-\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nLugar/CTR Expansion Act would be a first step down that road. \nUltimately, a satisfactory level of accountability, transparency, and \nsafety must be established in every nation with a WMD program.\n  My legislation is designed to empower the Administration to respond \nto both emergency proliferation risks and less-urgent cooperative \nopportunities to further non-proliferation goals. When the Defense \nDepartment identifies a non-proliferation opportunity that is not time \nsensitive, when the near-term threat of diversion or theft is low, it \nshould consult with Congress. In such a scenario my bill would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to notify the appropriate congressional \nentities of his intent to utilize unobligated Nunn-Lugar funds and to \ndescribe the legal and diplomatic framework for the application of non-\nproliferation assistance. Congress would have time to review the \nproposal and consult with the Department of Defense. This process would \nclosely parallel the existing notification and obligation procedures \nthat are in place for Nunn-Lugar activities in the former Soviet Union.\n  However, proliferation threats sometimes require an instantaneous \nresponse. If the Secretary of Defense determines that we must move more \nquickly than traditional consultation procedures allow, my legislation \nprovides the Pentagon with the authority to launch emergency \noperations. We must not allow a proliferation or WMD threat to ``go \ncritical'' because we lacked the foresight to empower DOD to respond. \nIn the former Soviet Union the value of being able to respond to \nproliferation emergencies has been clearly demonstrated. Under Nunn-\nLugar the United States has undertaken time-sensitive missions like \nProject Sapphire in Kazakstan and Operation Auburn Endeavor in Georgia \nthat have kept highly vulnerable weapons and materials of mass \ndestruction from being proliferated.\n  This type of scenario does not mean Congress will abandon its \noversight responsibilities; the Secretary of Defense will be required \nto report to the appropriate congressional entities within 72 hours of \nlaunching of a mission describing the emergency and the conditions \nunder which the assistance was provided. The review process permits \nCongress to investigate the incident and decide if the authority needs \nto be restricted or amended.\n  In consulting with the administration on this legislation, we \nexplored how to create the flexibility necessary to respond to WMD \nthreats while protecting congressional prerogatives and maintaining the \nnecessary checks and balances. Accordingly, I have included several \nconditions beyond the strenuous reporting requirements.\n  First, my bill permits the Secretary of Defense to provide equipment, \ngoods, and services but does not include authority to provide cash \ndirectly to the project or activity. This preserves one of the basic \ntenets of the program: Nunn-Lugar is not foreign aid. In fact, more \nthan 80 percent of Nunn-Lugar funds have been awarded to American firms \nto carry out dismantlement and non-proliferation assistance programs in \nthe former Soviet Union.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to avoid singling out \nany particular existing Nunn-Lugar project as an exclusive or \npredominate source of funds for emergency projects outside the former \nSoviet Union. In other words, it is my intent that the Pentagon utilize \nresources from a number of different Nunn-Lugar projects so as to \nreduce any impact on the original, on-going Nunn-Lugar program in the \nformer Soviet Union. The Secretary also is required to the maximum \nextent practicable, to replace any program funds taken on emergency \noperations in the next annual budget submission or supplemental \nappropriations request.\n  Lastly, if the Pentagon employs the emergency authority to carry out \nnon-proliferation or dismantlement activities in two consecutive years \nin the same country, the Secretary of Defense must submit another \nreport to Congress. This report would analyze whether a new Nunn-Lugar-\nstyle program should be established with the country in question. If \nthe Pentagon has successfully carried out cooperative threat reduction \nactivities 2 years in a row with a country, we should explore how to \nexpand this cooperation. We should also recognize that where sustained \ncooperation has been developed it is likely to be more efficient to \nprovide assistance through an established Nunn-Lugar-style program.\n  The Nunn-Lugar/CTR Expansion Act can make valuable contributions to \nthe implementation of the war on terrorism and our non-proliferation \npolicy. It is not a silver bullet, and it cannot be used in every \ncircumstance, but it is our best option in carrying out cooperative \nnon-proliferation activities outside the former Soviet Union.\n  There are always risks when expanding a successful venture into new \nareas, but we must give the Administration every opportunity to \ninterdict and neutralize the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. This new venture, like its predecessor, will take time to \norganize and to establish operating procedures. But I am hopeful that a \ndecade from now, we will look back on this effort and rejoice in our \npersistent and successful efforts to provide great security for our \ncountry and the world at critical moments of decision.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in passing this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. DeWine and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2027. A bill to implement effective measures to stop trade in \nconflict diamonds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I have introduced a new bill along \nwith Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, and Senator Russ \nFeingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, which intends to address the U.S. \nresponse to the scourge of conflict diamonds.\n  In war-torn areas in Africa, rebels and human rights abusers, with \nthe complicity of some governments, have exploited the diamond trade, \nparticularly alluvial diamond fields, to fund their guerrilla wars, to \nmurder, rape, and mutilate innocent civilians, and kidnap children to \nbe part of their guerrilla forces.\n  Since November, the press has reported a connection between al-Qaida \noperatives and conflict diamonds. Those connections were noted in \nadvance of the September 11 attack. It stands to reason that when we \nhave a terrorist organization and a country such as the United States \nin concert with its allies trying to trace the financial transactions \nthat fund this terrorism, the terrorists will look for some other coin \nof the realm, some other way to fund their operations. Conflict \ndiamonds turned out to be one of the most easy, portable, and least \ndetected way to do it.\n  It is quite clear that Hezbollah, another terrorist organization in \nthe Middle East, has had a long history of dealing in conflict \ndiamonds.\n  While the conflict diamond trade comprises anywhere from an estimated \n3 to 15 percent of the legitimate diamond trade, it threatens to damage \nan entire industry worldwide, an industry that is important to the \neconomies of many countries and critical to a number of developing \ncountries in Africa.\n  How does it work?\n  The terrorists go into the diamond fields where the natives of West \nAfrica are trying to find these alluvial diamonds in the streams and \nthe mud as they used to pan for gold in California and Alaska. They \nterrorize the local natives. They line them up in a row and walk \nthrough and hack off their feet and their hands until the natives and \nthe miners in the circumstance are absolutely terrified. They threaten \nthem with mutilation, with rape, and torture, destroying their villages \nand their lives. They literally become slaves to these terrorists, who \nthen grab the diamonds and sell them into the terrorist networks.\n  Governments, the international diamond industry, and nongovernmental \nreligious organizations have worked hard to address this complicated \nissue. They have set an impressive example of public and private \ncooperation. For the last 18 months, many countries involved in the \nKimberly Process have been working to design a new regimen to govern \nthe trade in rough diamonds. About 70 percent, by some estimates, of \nall the diamonds that are mined and found in the world are sold in the \nUnited States. The United States needs to show a leadership role in \ndealing with conflict diamonds so the terrorists know it is not going \nto be easy. We\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nare going to make it more difficult. We are going to try to establish \ncontrols so we know if diamonds were brought into the trade by illegal \nor legal means.\n  Last year, I introduced a bill called the Clean Diamonds Act, S. \n1084, along with Senators DeWine and Feingold, to reflect the consensus \nthat had developed between the religious and human rights communities \nand the diamond industry on the U.S. response to this issue. Senator \nJudd Gregg, who had introduced his own amendments and legislation \ndealing with this issue in the past, joined in cosponsoring our bill, \nas did a bipartisan group of 11 additional Senators.\n\n  In the House of Representatives, Congressmen Tony Hall and Frank Wolf \nhave been leaders on this issue. They introduced several bills to \naddress it. They worked with the Ways and Means Committee and the \nadministration to pass the bill last November, H.R. 2722, the Clean \nDiamonds Trade Act, which, while a step forward, I am afraid, did not \ndo enough to meet the original intent of our congressional effort. I \nhad hoped Senator DeWine, Senator Feingold, and I might be able to work \nout an agreement with the administration to make some changes to \nstrengthen the House-passed bill, but unfortunately that has not \nhappened.\n  In the meantime, the international effort is continuing. Talks that \nwe hope will one day lead to a final session of the Kimberly Process \nare underway today, tomorrow, and Wednesday in Ottawa. I am concerned \nkey issues remain unresolved or have been addressed in ways that could \nundermine the whole initiative, leading to the failure to produce an \neffective Kimberly agreement.\n  Specifically, the negotiators need to address the issues of \nindependent monitoring, the collection of reliable statistics, and the \nneed for a coordinating body to implement the agreed-upon system of \ncontrols on rough diamond exports. In addition, the U.S. General \nAccounting Office, in its February 13 testimony entitled ``Significant \nChallenges Remain in Deterring Trade in Conflict Diamonds,'' outlined \nother potential witnesses in transparency, accountability, and risk \nassessment, particularly relating to controls from the mine to export.\n  We have decided we need to introduce a new, stronger Senate version \nof the Clean Diamonds Trade Act to move this issue forward and to \naddress developments such as the revelations about terrorist \nexploitation of diamonds and the potential weaknesses in the \ninternational agreement.\n  Think about these diamonds moving across the world. You can put a \nfortune in your hand, put it into your pocket, and walk through any \nmetal detector undetected. You can carry them on an airplane around the \nworld, use them as people would use gold ingots or checking accounts. \nThey are fungible wherever you go.\n  Our bill includes a broad definition of conflict diamonds, so it \ncovers the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not \nsimply areas that have been singled out by the United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Our definition also covers the terrorists named by \nPresident George Bush in his Executive Order 13224.\n  The House bill does not give the authority to the President that he \nhas already under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and \nhas already in fact exercised to implement existing U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions, nor does the House bill require the President to \ndo anything to respond to this problem.\n  Our bill requires the President to prohibit the importation of rough \ndiamonds from countries not taking effective measures to stop the trade \nin conflict diamonds if that prohibition is in the foreign policy \ninterest of the United States.\n  It is clear to me those responsible for the conflict diamond trade \nwill stop at nothing in their efforts to circumvent the international \nefforts being negotiated. To transform a rough diamond into a polished \ndiamond for purposes of import classification, all someone needs to do \nis make one cut. That distinction in the House-passed bill is a \nterrible loophole. The importation of polished diamonds or jewelry \ncontaining diamonds is a potentially huge loophole as well through \nwhich conflict diamonds could have been imported into the United \nStates. The House-passed bill did not protect against that loophole.\n\n  The House bill also does not require but only permits the President \nto prohibit the importation of specific shipments of polished diamonds \nor jewelry containing diamonds into our country, if he has credible \nevidence they were produced from conflict diamonds. Our bill requires \nit.\n  Our bill also permits the President to prohibit the importation of \npolished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds from countries that \ndo not take effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds.\n  With these two provisions, we hope to send a strong message that the \nUnited States will close the polished diamond and diamond jewelry \nloopholes so that American consumers can have confidence that the \ndiamond they buy for an engagement, an anniversary, or another \nmilestone in their lives is from a legitimate and responsible source.\n  Finally, our bill eliminates the safe harbor provision contained in \nthe House bill which would allow circumvention of the Kimberly Process \nbefore an agreement were even finalized. While these negotiations are \nproceeding and while we are trying to secure the cooperation of all \nparties concerned, this is not the time to undercut it.\n  The world was shocked and horrified by the murder, mutilation, and \nterror imposed on the people of Sierra Leone by rebels funded with \nconflict diamonds. The moral outcry by religious and human rights \ngroups galvanized governments and the diamond industry to address the \nproblem. Now is the time to close the deal and to secure an effective \nagreement, not an exercise in public relations. Now is also the time to \nhave strong U.S. legislation to say to the world the United States will \ndo as much as it can to stop this scourge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Diamond Trade Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being \n     used by rebels, state actors, and terrorists to finance \n     military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, \n     subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, \n     and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. \n     During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from \n     Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in \n     large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of \n     these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in \n     neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the \n     United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died \n     during these wars.\n       (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to \n     nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart \n     not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights \n     violations.\n       (3) Human rights advocates, the diamond trade as \n     represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United \n     States Government recently began working to block the trade \n     in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a \n     consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in \n     conflict diamonds.\n       (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at \n     various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United \n     Nations to address threats to international peace and \n     security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these \n     actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons \n     to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has \n     further required all states to prohibit the direct and \n     indirect import of rough diamonds from Angola and Sierra \n     Leone unless the diamonds are controlled under specified \n     certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely for \n     a period of 12 months the direct and indirect import of rough \n     diamonds from Liberia.\n       (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions \n     restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola and \n     Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified \n     certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation \n     of rough diamonds from Liberia. In order to put an end to the \n     emergency situation in international relations, to maintain \n     international peace and security, and to protect its \n     essential security interests, and pursuant to its obligations \n     under the United Nations Charter, the United States is now \n     taking further action against trade in conflict diamonds.\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\n       (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict \n     diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat \n     of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of \n     countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and \n     penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they \n     employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other \n     countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley \n     Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the \n     consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the \n     United States has an obligation to help sever the link \n     between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of \n     an effective solution.\n       (7) Articles XX and XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade 1994 allow members of the World Trade Organization \n     to take measures to deal with situations such as that \n     presented by the current trade in conflict diamonds without \n     violating their World Trade Organization obligations.\n       (8) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to \n     differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the \n     trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative \n     impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as \n     Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n       (9) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the \n     regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the \n     trade in conflict diamonds.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Conflict diamonds.--The term ``conflict diamonds'' \n     means--\n       (A) rough diamonds the importation of which is prohibited \n     by United Nations Security Council Resolutions because that \n     trade is fueling conflict;\n       (B) in the case of rough diamonds not covered by \n     subparagraph (A), rough diamonds used by any armed movement \n     or an ally of an armed movement to finance or sustain \n     operations to carry out systematic human rights abuses or \n     attacks against unarmed civilians; or\n       (C) diamonds that evidence shows fund the al-Qaeda \n     international terrorist network and related groups designated \n     under Executive Order No. 13224 of September 23, 2001 (66 \n     Federal Register 49079).\n       (2) Diamonds.--The term ``diamonds'' means diamonds \n     classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 or subheading \n     7102.39.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States.\n       (3) Polished diamonds.--The term ``polished diamonds'' \n     means diamonds classifiable under subheading 7102.39.00 of \n     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n       (4) Rough diamonds.--The term ``rough diamonds'' means \n     diamonds that are unworked, or simply sawn, cleaved, or \n     bruted, classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 of the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n       (5) United states.--The term ``United States'', when used \n     in the geographic sense, means the several States, the \n     District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or \n     possession of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. MEASURES TO PREVENT IMPORTS OF CONFLICT DIAMONDS.\n\n       (a) Authority of the President.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the President shall prohibit, in whole or \n     in part, the importation into the United States of rough \n     diamonds, and may prohibit the importation into the United \n     States of polished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds, \n     from any country that does not take effective measures to \n     stop trade in conflict diamonds as long as the prohibition is \n     consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United \n     States, including the international obligations of the United \n     States, or is pursuant to United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions on conflict diamonds.\n       (b) Effective Measures.--For purposes of this Act, \n     effective measures are measures that--\n       (1) meet the requirements of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds;\n       (2) meet the requirements of an international arrangement \n     on conflict diamonds, including the recommendations of the \n     Kimberley Process, as long as the measures also meet the \n     requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     on trade in conflict diamonds; or\n       (3) contain the following elements, or their functional \n     equivalent, if such elements are sufficient to meet the \n     requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     on trade in conflict diamonds:\n       (A) With respect to exports from countries where rough \n     diamonds are extracted, secure packaging, accompanied by \n     officially validated documentation certifying the country of \n     origin, total carat weight, and value.\n       (B) With respect to exports from countries where rough \n     diamonds are extracted, a system of verifiable controls on \n     rough diamonds from mine to export.\n       (C) With respect to countries that reexport rough diamonds, \n     a system of controls designed to ensure that no conflict \n     diamonds have entered the legitimate trade in rough diamonds.\n       (D) Verifiable recordkeeping by all companies and \n     individuals engaged in mining, import, and export of rough \n     diamonds within the territory of the exporting country, \n     subject to inspection and verification by authorized \n     government authorities in accordance with national \n     regulations.\n       (E) Government publication on a periodic basis of official \n     rough diamond export and import statistics.\n       (F) Implementation of proportionate and dissuasive \n     penalties against any persons who violate laws and \n     regulations designed to combat trade in conflict diamonds.\n       (G) Full cooperation with the United Nations or other \n     official international bodies examining the trade in conflict \n     diamonds, especially with respect to any inspection and \n     monitoring of the trade in rough diamonds.\n       (c) Exclusions.--The provisions of this section do not \n     apply to--\n       (1) rough diamonds imported by or on behalf of a person for \n     personal use and accompanying a person upon entry into the \n     United States; or\n       (2) rough diamonds previously exported from the United \n     States and reimported by the same importer, without having \n     been advanced in value or improved in condition by any \n     process or other means while abroad, if the importer declares \n     that the reimportation of the rough diamonds satisfies the \n     requirements of this paragraph.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION OF POLISHED DIAMONDS AND JEWELRY.\n\n       The President shall prohibit specific entries into the \n     customs territory of the United States of polished diamonds \n     and jewelry containing diamonds if the President has credible \n     evidence that such polished diamonds and jewelry were \n     produced with conflict diamonds.\n\n     SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds \n     imported into the United States in violation of any \n     prohibition imposed under section 4 or 5 are subject to the \n     seizure and forfeiture laws, and all criminal and civil laws \n     of the United States shall apply, to the same extent as any \n     other violation of the customs and navigation laws of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Proceeds From Fines and Forfeited Goods.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the proceeds \n     derived from fines imposed for violations of section 4(a), \n     and from the seizure and forfeiture of goods imported in \n     violation of section 4(a), shall, in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available for such purposes, be available only \n     for--\n       (1) the Leahy War Victims Fund administered by the United \n     States Agency for International Development or any successor \n     program to assist victims of foreign wars; and\n       (2) grants under section 131 of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2152a).\n\n     SEC. 7.

The \n     requirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a \n     country under this subsection shall remain in effect until \n     such time as the country implements effective measures.\n\n     SEC. 8. GAO REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     transmit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the \n     provisions of this Act in preventing the importation of \n     conflict diamonds under section 4. The Comptroller General \n     shall include in the report any recommendations on any \n     modifications to this Act that may be necessary.\n\n     SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) International Arrangement.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that the President should take the necessary steps to \n     negotiate an international arrangement, working in concert \n     with the Kimberley Process referred to in section 2(6), to \n     eliminate the trade in conflict diamonds. Such an \n     international arrangement should create an effective global \n     system of controls covering countries that export and import \n     rough diamonds, should\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n     contain the elements described in section 4(b)(3), and should \n     address independent monitoring, the collection of reliable \n     statistics on the diamond trade, and the need for a \n     coordinating body or secretariat to implement the \n     arrangement.\n       (b) Additional Security Council Resolutions.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that the President should take the \n     necessary steps to seek United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions with respect to trade in diamonds from additional \n     countries identified under section 7(a)(5).\n       (c) Trade in Legitimate Diamonds.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that the provisions of this Act should not impede \n     the trade in legitimate diamonds with countries which are \n     working constructively to eliminate trade in conflict \n     diamonds, including through the negotiation of an effective \n     international arrangement to eliminate trade in conflict \n     diamonds.\n       (d) Implementation of Effective Measures.--It is the sense \n     of Congress that companies involved in diamond extraction and \n     trade should make financial contributions to countries \n     seeking to implement any effective measures to stop trade in \n     conflict diamonds described in section 4(b), if those \n     countries would have financial difficulty implementing those \n     measures.\n\n     SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the President \n     $5,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to \n     provide assistance to countries seeking to implement any \n     effective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds \n     described in section 4(b), if those countries would have \n     financial difficulty implementing those measures.\n\n     SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about legislation \nthat Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, and I introduce today to address \nthe continued profitable sale of what we refer to as conflict diamonds. \nWe have been working together on this matter for some time, along with \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman Tony Hall \nfrom my home State of Ohio and Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia.\n  We have been working to help those in Africa who are suffering at the \nhands of this illicit diamond trade. Last spring, we introduced a \nsimilar bill to put pressure on the international community to \nimplement a global agreement to stem the conflict diamond trade.\n  While the House passed a weaker version of that bill last November, \nmy Senate colleagues and I have been working with the administration to \npass a stronger, more meaningful bill. Unfortunately, these \nnegotiations thus far have not been successful. That is why we join \ntogether today in the introduction of a new and even stronger measure: \nlegislation that reflects both trade and humanitarian concerns.\n  The introduction now is particularly significant, as the \ninternational community begins the final session of the Kimberly \nProcess today in Ottawa.\n  During these negotiations, it is critical that the United States send \na strong message to the international community, a message that says we \nare committed to these efforts and are fighting for a strong, effective \nKimberly agreement.\n  Mr. President, I believe the United States must take this leadership \nrole so we can get ultimately the strongest possible agreement. That is \nthe message I believe our bill sends today. I will spend a few minutes \ntalking about why this bill is so important and why it is vital we get \na strong measure passed and eventually signed into law.\n  The diamond trade is one of the world's most lucrative industries. \nWith its extreme profitability, it is not surprising a black market \ntrade has emerged alongside the legitimate industry. The sale of \nillicit diamonds has yielded disturbing reports in the media linking \neven Osama bin Laden to this trade. On February 22, 2001, the U.S. \nDistrict Court trial, United States v. Osama bin Laden, attests to \nthis.\n  Additionally, there is an established link between Sierra Leone's \ndiamond trade and well-known Lebanese terrorists.\n  It is also not surprising that diamond trading has become an \nattractive and sustainable income source for violent rebel groups \naround the world, particularly in Africa. The information I am talking \nabout today in regard to terrorists has been reported in the public \nnews media. Currently in Africa, where the majority of the world's \ndiamonds are found, there is ongoing strife and struggle resulting from \nthe fight for control of the precious gems. While violence has erupted \nin several countries, including Sierra Leone, Angola, the Congo, and \nLiberia, Sierra Leone in particular has one of the worst records of \nviolence.\n  In that nation, rebel groups, most notably the Revolutionary United \nFront, the RUL, have seized control of many of that country's diamond \nfields. Once in control of a diamond field, the rebels confiscate the \ndiamonds. Then they launder them on to the legitimate market through \nother nearby nations, such as Liberia, and ultimately finance their \nterrorist regimes and their continued efforts to overthrow the \ngovernment.\n\n  Over the past decade, the rebels reaped the benefits of at least $10 \nbillion in smuggled diamonds, and the fact is it could be a lot more \nthan that. Since the start of the rebel quest for control of Sierra \nLeone's diamond supply, the children of this small nation have borne \nthe brunt of the insurgency. For over 8 years, the RUF has conscripted \nchildren, often as young as 7 or 8 years old. These soldiers and their \nmakeshift army have ripped an estimated 12,000 children from their \nfamilies. After the RUF invaded the capital of Freetown in January \n1999, at least 3,000 children were reported missing.\n  As a result of deliberate and systematic brutalization, children \nsoldiers have become some of the most vicious and effective fighters \nwithin the rebel factions. The rebel army, child soldiers included, has \nterrorized Sierra Leone's population, killing, abducting, raping, and \nhacking off the limbs of victims with machetes. This chopping off of \nlimbs is the RUF's trademark strategy.\n  I believe we can do something about this. We can, in fact, make a \ndifference. We have the power to help put an end to the indiscriminate \nsuffering and violence in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa. As the \nworld's biggest diamond customer, purchasing the majority of the \nworld's diamonds, the United States has tremendous clout. With that \nclout, we have the power to remove the lucrative financial incentives \nthat drive the rebel groups to trade in diamonds in the first place.\n  Simply put, if there is no market for their diamonds, there is little \nreason for the rebels to engage in their brutal campaigns to secure and \nthen protect their diamonds. That is why our legislation is aimed at \nremoving the rebels' market incentive. We need to work together with \nthe international community to facilitate the implementation of a \nsystem of controls on the export and import of diamonds so that buyers \ncan be certain their purchases are not fueling the rebel campaign.\n  Specifically, our new bill attempts to move this issue forward and to \nstrengthen U.S. policy. For example, our bill would require the \nPresident to prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from countries \nnot taking effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds.\n  It also addresses potential loopholes associated with polished \ndiamonds and diamond jewelry and includes a broader definition of \nconflict diamonds so that it includes conflicts in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and other areas as well.\n  These are a few of the important provisions that were omitted in the \nHouse version, provisions that are essential in this legislation to \nmake the difference we want to make. I urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto support this new bill and send an important message to the \ninternational community. As I see it, we do have an obligation, I think \na moral obligation, to help eliminate the financial incentives for the \nillicit traders. We owe it to those who unwittingly buy these conflict \ndiamonds but, more importantly, we owe it to the children who have \nsuffered far too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/18/senate-section/article/S2014-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2014-S2015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3031.
