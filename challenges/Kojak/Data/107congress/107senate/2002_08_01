Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 3009, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 3009) to \n     extend the Andean Trade Preference Act, to grant additional \n     trade benefits under that Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, or the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nyes on the motion to invoke cloture on the trade bill. Three months \nago, the Senate passed its version of the Trade Act of 2002. It was a \nstrong bill, it was a progressive bill, and it passed overwhelmingly \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  We now have completed our conference with Representatives of the \nHouse. I am pleased to present the Senate with a conference report that \nretains and builds upon key elements of the Senate bill.\n  Let me begin by discussing the reestablishment of the President's \nfast-track trade negotiating authority. This authority will make it \neasier for the President to negotiate strong trade agreements, but we \ndo not give the President a blank check. Far from it. The bill makes \nCongress a full partner in trade by laying out negotiating objectives \non a number of topics and creating a structure for consultations--I \nmight add, much stronger than previous fast-track bills.\n  Most of the debate on fast track has focused on three trouble spots \nin trade negotiations: Labor rights and environmental standards; so-\ncalled chapter 11 provisions; and U.S. trade laws.\n  Let me turn to them. First, labor and environmental standards. Most \nimportantly, this bill adopts the standards set forth in the United \nStates-Jordan Free Trade Agreement; that is, as a floor. No standards \nin future trade agreements can go below the floor set in the United \nStates-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which is a pretty high floor, but \ncertainly agreements can be higher.\n  In that agreement, in the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, \nboth parties agreed to strive for labor standards articulated by the \nILO and for similar improvement in environmental protection. Both \ncountries also agreed to faithfully enforce their environmental and \nlabor laws and not to waive them to gain a trade advantage.\n  The conference bill's fast-track provisions fully adopt the Jordan \nprovisions, and the bill makes it clear that Jordan is the model for \nevery free-trade agreement we negotiate; that is, the bottom floor is \nJordan. Again, agreements can go higher. That is a big step forward.\n  In addition, the conference report obtains negotiating objectives \nseeking to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Senator Harkin has \nbeen a tireless advocate on this issue, and I am proud the conference \nreport includes this important objective.\n  Another contentious issue pertains to investor-state dispute \nsettlement, also known as chapter 11, in reference to provisions on \nthis topic in NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  The conference report attempts to balance the legitimate needs of \nU.S. investors with the legitimate needs of Federal, State, and local \nregulators, and the concerns of environmental and public interest \ngroups.\n  The bill directs trade negotiators to seek provisions that keep \nChapter XI-type standards in line with the standards articulated by \nU.S. courts on similar matters.\n  It urges the creation of a mechanism to rapidly dispose of frivolous \ncomplaints and to deter their filing in the first place.\n  And it urges the creation of an appellate body to correct legal \nerrors and ensure consistent interpretation of key provisions by \nChapter XI arbitration panels. That is a level playing field.\n  So neither country has an advantage, and neither investors on the one \nhand, nor municipalities nor environmental groups on the other hand, \nhave an advantage. It is a totally level playing field.\n  I am pleased that, on the whole, we were able to retain the Senate \nobjectives on investment.\n  The second difficult issue within fast track is how we ensure fair \ntrade.\n  To battle unfair trade practices, the United States and most other \ndeveloped countries maintain antidumping and countervailing duty laws. \nAnother critical U.S. trade law--Section 201--aims to give industries \nthat are seriously injured by import surges some time to adapt.\n  Rather than being protectionist these laws are the remedy to \nprotectionism. And importantly, these laws are completely consistent \nwith U.S. obligations under the WTO.\n  On a political level, these laws also serve as a guarantee to U.S. \nindustries and U.S. workers.\n  Without those critical reassurances, I suspect that the already \nsagging public support for free trade would evaporate, and new trade \nagreements would simply become impossible.\n  Now, the Senate overwhelmingly supported an amendment by Senators \nDayton and Craig. That amendment provided a process for raising a point \nof order against a bill that changes trade remedy laws.\n  The House bill did not include this provision--although I expect the \nHouse might support such a provision if put to a vote.\n  That said, in the conference process we needed to come up with an \nalternative if we were going to move forward. I believe the provisions \nthat have come out of that process are very strong--and give Congress \nan important role before an agreement is finalized. Let me explain.\n  First, this legislation raises concerns regarding recent dispute \nsettlement panels under the WTO that have ruled against U.S. trade laws \nand limited their operation in unreasonable ways. These decisions \nclearly go beyond the obligations agreed to in the WTO and undermine \nthe credibility of the world trading system. We must correct these \nerroneous decisions.\n  That is why our concern regarding WTO dispute settlement is \nidentified at the very outset of the bill--as findings--and why the \nAdministration is directed to develop a strategy to counter or reverse \nthis problem, or lose fast track.\n  This bill also contains a principal negotiating objective directing \nnegotiators not to undermine U.S. trade laws. This fully expresses \nCongress's view that maintaining trade laws is among the highest \npriorities in our trade negotiations.\n  Finally--and most importantly, I believe--this bill directs the \nPresident to send a report to Congress, 6 months before he signs an \nagreement, that lays out what he plans to do with respect to our trade \nlaws.\n  This is important. This provision provides that the President--before \nhe reports on any other issue--must lay out any changes that would have \nto be made to U.S. trade laws. This will give Congress a chance to \naffect the outcome of the negotiations well before they occur.\n  In fact, to buttress that point, the bill provides for a resolution \nprocess where Congress can specifically find that the proposed changes \nare ``inconsistent'' with the negotiating objectives. I suspect that if \neither House of Congress were to pass such a resolution--by the way, it \nis privileged. I mean it is nondebatable. It cannot be filibustered. So \nthe relevant committees--House Ways and Means and Senate Finance--\nreport this out, and it starts with a resolution offered by any Member \nof Congress in the respective bodies. I suspect that resolution--again, \nprivileged, not filibustered, not amendable--would be very much \nlistened to by the President.\n\n  If they don't get that message, there are ways that either House of \nCongress can derail a trade agreement. But I don't think it would come \nto that. I think the agreement would be renegotiated in that \ncircumstance--and that is the point.\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n  This is a solid fast track bill. If passed, this will be the most \nprogressive fast track bill we have ever had.\n  Let me turn to the portion of the bill that I believe is the most \nhistoric. We now have a unique opportunity to expand and improve a \nprogram that is a critical part of moving toward a consensus on trade--\nthat program is Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  TAA is a program with a simple, but critical, objective: To assist \nworkers injured by imports to adjust and find new jobs.\n  TAA was created back in 1962 as part of an effort to implement the \nresults of the so-called Kennedy Round agreement to expand world trade.\n  President Kennedy and the Congress agreed that there were significant \nbenefits to the country as a whole from expanded trade. They also \nrecognized, however, that some workers and firms would inevitably lose \nout to increased import competition.\n  TAA was created as part of a new social compact that obliged the \nNation to attend to the legitimate needs of those that lose from trade \nas part of the price for enjoying the benefits of increased trade.\n  Unfortunately, we have not always upheld that bargain in pursuing new \ntrade agreements.\n  This legislation aims to fulfill the bargain struck in 1962.\n  It makes several important changes in the TAA program to make it more \neffective:\n  First, the conference bill expands the number of workers eligible for \nbenefits.\n  Like the Senate bill, the conference bill covers secondary workers.\n  The conference bill also expands coverage to workers affected by \nshifts in production. Workers are automatically covered if their plant \nmoves to a country with which the United States has a free trade \nagreement, or to a country that is part of a preferential trade \narrangement.\n  For workers whose plant moves to any other country, benefits are \navailable if the Secretary of Labor determines that imports have \nincreased or are likely to increase.\n  ``Or are likely to increase'' is very important because obviously if \na plant moves to another country, imports are likely to increase. Since \ncompanies that move offshore typically ship back to the United States, \nI can think of no circumstances in which relocating production abroad \nwould not be accompanied by or lead to an increase in imports of the \nproduct.\n  Moreover, I would note here that the workers do not have to prove \nthat the increase in imports will come from the country to which \nproduction relocated. This is a standard that is easily satisfied.\n  In addition, the conference agreement also includes a new program for \nfarmers, ranchers, fishermen, and other agricultural producers.\n  Taken together, these expansions in eligibility are likely to result \nin a program that would cover under 200,000 workers per year.\n  Moreover, TAA benefits are substantially improved.\n  For the first time in the history, we provide health care coverage \nfor displaced TAA workers.\n  Who would have thought--when we started this process 2 years ago--\nthat we would be able to achieve such an important and laudable goal?\n  But that is exactly what we accomplished. Workers eligible for TAA \nwill now receive a 65 percent advanceable, refundable tax credit that \ncan be used to pay for COBRA coverage, that is, coverage related to \nlost health insurance on account of lost jobs or a number of other \ngroup coverage options through the States. This assistance is available \nto workers for as long as they are participating in the TAA program.\n  I am pleased with the health care provisions in the conference \nreport, and I hope that we can bring the same willingness to work \ntogether and compromise to other important health care issues before \nus.\n  The conference report also extends income support from 52 to 78 weeks \nto allow workers to complete training. And thanks to the efforts of \nSenator Edwards, it adds a further 26 weeks of training and income \nsupport for workers who must begin with remedial education such as \nEnglish as a second language. To pay for this additional training, the \nannual training budget is doubled from $110 million to $220 million.\n  For older workers, the conference report offers wage insurance as an \nalternative to traditional TAA. Workers who qualify and who take lower-\npaying jobs can receive a wage subsidy of up to 50 percent of the \ndifference between the old and new salary--up to $10,000 over 2 years. \nThe goal is to encourage on-the-job raining and faster re-employment of \nolder workers who generally find it difficult to change careers.\n  The bill included a 2-year wage insurance pilot program. The \nconference report improves on the Senate bill in two ways--by making \nthe program permanent, and by providing TAA health benefits to workers \nunder the program if the new employer does not provide health \ninsurance.\n  Finally, in addition to expanding benefits and eligibility, the \nconference agreement makes a number of improvements that streamline the \nprogram. It eliminates bureaucracy. It makes the program fairer, more \nefficient, and more user friendly. And I believe it will meet the \nultimate goal of TAA--getting workers back to work more quickly.\n  All told, this bill amounts to a major expansion and a historic re-\ntooling of TAA--a step that is long overdue.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy asked Congress for trade \nliberalizing legislation. It was a much simpler bill at that time, when \ntrade issues were more narrowly defined, but it was still \ncontroversial. For many of the same reasons, that remains controversial \ntoday.\n  President Kennedy emphasized the importance of trade for our economy, \nfor our workers, for American leadership, and the world. He also \nrecognized, even then, that trade also creates dislocation and that a \nnew program, trade adjust assistance, was needed to help workers left \nbehind by trade. Congress seized that opportunity and passed the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962.\n  Today, we, too, can show the world and America what we stand for. \nBuilding not only on the vision of President Kennedy but also on the \nefforts of the Presidents who followed him, we can show the world that \nAmerica will lead the way in building a new consensus on international \ntrade. We, too, must seize that opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture and to pass the \nconference report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, this debate, if it is like \nmost debates on fast track, will not be a very thoughtful debate. There \nis a relentless chanting about free trade and the global economy, but \nno discussion about what is really happening in trade.\n  I believe in expanded trade. I believe expanded trade helps our \neconomy and helps economies around the world. I am not someone who \nbelieves we should put walls around our country and try to keep other \ngoods out of our country. I do believe, however, our country has a \nright to be a leader in demanding and insisting on fair trade. That has \nnot been the case for several decades. I will talk a bit about that.\n  In October 2001, our trade Ambassador, Mr. Zoellick--a man I like--\nspeaking to a business group in Chicago, described opponents of trade \npromotion authority as ``xenophobes and isolationists.''\n  That is fairly typical of the prevailing view on trade. There is a \nperception that this debate has two camps: The camp that is able to see \nover the horizon, they get it, they understand it, they understand the \nglobal economy, and they understand all of the issues; and then there \nare the others, xenophobic, isolationist stooges who cannot and will \nnot understand.\n  The Senate is preparing to give the administration the power to \nnegotiate trade agreements in secret, and bring them back to Congress \nfor very limited debate. Congress will have in place a procedure that \nwill prevent the Senate from ever changing even one word of the \nagreement. In other words, Congress signs itself up to say: Handcuff \nus. Handcuff us so we cannot change a word in the next trade agreement \nyou bring back. We understand we will not be part of the negotiation, \nwe understand we will not be in the room, we will not even know where \nthey take place, but we agree beforehand that whatever you bring back \nto us, we will not change a word.\n\n  Had I been able to change a word of the United States-Canada Free \nTrade\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\nAgreement, we would not have the problem with grain trade with Canada \nwe have had for a decade. When that trade agreement came back to the \nSenate, I could not change one word because Congress passed fast track.\n  Trade promotion authority is a euphemism for what used to be known as \nfast track. It is Congress handcuffing itself, saying: Whatever you \nnegotiate, wherever you negotiate it, we promise not to offer one \namendment to change one word of the trade agreement.\n  There are people who will sign up for almost anything. I saw in the \npaper a while back that the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile was advertising \nfor a driver. The Oscar Meyer Weinermobile, which we have seen in \nclips, needed a driver, and 900 college graduates applied. I thought to \nmyself, people will sign up for almost anything, won't they? Nine \nhundred college graduates aspire to drive the Weinermobile.\n  Then I see people signing up for the proposition that the Congress \nought to handcuff itself, in advance, before a trade agreement is \nnegotiated in secret in some location we do not yet know, and I see \npeople say: Sign me up, I think that is a good deal.\n  Let me describe the circumstances in which we find ourselves after a \nbarrelful of this trade strategy. This chart represents red ink, trade \ndeficits. Today is Thursday. Today, the American people and our \nGovernment, our country, will incur a $1.4 billion deficit--just in \nthis one day. Today, every day, 7 days a week, our trade deficit is \nrelentless, and it increases at a relentless pace. The deficit for this \nyear will go off the chart, by the way. That is a trade deficit we owe \nnot to ourselves, as we do with the budget deficit, it is a trade \ndeficit we owe to other countries.\n  We have people who think this strategy works. Would this be \nmalpractice in medicine if a doctor prescribed medicine and it did not \nwork, and he prescribed it again and it did not work, and he said, \nlet's keep prescribing the same medicine that does not work? How about \na football team that calls the same plays despite the fact it does not \nwork?\n  That is exactly what we are doing in international trade. The same \npeople made the same promises then that they are making now: If we can \njust do more of the same, our country will be better off. Total \nnonsense.\n  The last big debate we had was NAFTA--United States, Canada and \nMexico. Prior to that debate, we had a very small trade surplus with \nMexico. We had a surplus with Mexico and a reasonably modest trade \ndeficit with Canada. We had people promising the Moon: If we just do \nthis, if we sign up for the NAFTA agreement, if you let us negotiate it \nin secret--if you allow us to do that, we will add 300,000 new jobs in \nthe United States of America. Total nonsense.\n  Here is what happened after NAFTA: A trade surplus with Mexico turned \ninto a very large deficit; a modest trade deficit with Canada turned \ninto a huge trade deficit with Canada. People said: Well, if you just \nsign up to this, we will import the skills of low-skill labor from \nMexico; that is what we intend to have happen. Do you know what the \nthree largest imports from Mexico are? Electronics, automobiles, and \nautomobile parts--all the product of high-skill labor. So the deficit \nexplodes. Now we have a very large combined deficit with our two \ntrading partners on the south and north of us, and we have people in \nthe Senate who said: Boy, this is really working. What a great deal for \nour country.\n  I graduated from a small school, a high school class of nine in my \nsenior class. I know we did not have all the advanced mathematics some \nother people had, but this surely must be the only venue in America \nwhere grown men and women add 2 and 2 and get 5 and compliment each \nother on their math skills.\n  In this morning's newspaper, there are reports about anemic economic \ngrowth, and worries about a double dip recession. According to \neconomists, the trade deficit has done a lot to reduce our economic \ngrowth to just 1.8 percent.\n  The fact is, this trade deficit matters, and we are getting clobbered \nby it. It ties an anvil to the neck of this country's economy. And we \nhave people coming to the floor of the Senate saying: let's do more of \nthe same; let's do much more of what is not working. I, for the life of \nme, cannot understand that.\n  Postcloture, I am going to give a speech that describes the details \nof all of this and ask the question: Why are we all so interested in \nhaving the next treaty negotiated, or the next trade agreement \nnegotiated, before even one problem is fixed? Let me give you some \nexamples of problems, even if I do not describe them all now.\n  How about eggs to Europe, high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico, \nautomobiles to China, automobiles to Korea, potato flakes to Korea, \nunfairly subsidized grain from Canada, beef to Japan, flour to Europe? \nI can go on, and I will go, on at some length about each of those. How \nabout stuffed molasses from Canada? That is an interesting one, stuffed \nmolasses. Brazilian sugar is sent to Canada and then mixed with liquid \nmolasses, put in a container, and shipped into this country in \ncontravention of our trade laws. They take the sugar out of the \nmolasses, send the molasses back to Canada, and everything is as it was \nbefore, except we now have Brazilian sugar in our market in \ncontravention of our trade laws and you cannot do a blessed thing about \nit. When the trade bill left the Senate, it contained a provision that \nfixed this problem. The bill that came back out of conference \nessentially dropped this provision. But that is typical of virtually \neverything in this bill that left the Senate with some decent \nprovisions and came back here washed clean of those provisions.\n  There is a company in Canada. It is called Methanex. It is a company \nthat makes MTBE, a fuel additive. California has decided it is going to \ndiscontinue the use of MTBE in fuel because it ends up in the ground \nwater. The fact is, it poisons people. You have to get it out of the \nground water, so you have to stop using it in fuel. So when California \ndecides on behalf of the safety of its citizens to stop using MTBE, a \nfuel additive that is now showing up in their water supply, guess what. \nThe Canadian manufacturer of that product takes action in the WTO \nagainst the United States for violating trade laws. So a State that \ntries to protect its citizens from a poison going into the water supply \nis now being sued, under our trade agreement, by a Canadian company.\n  Guess what. The NAFTA dispute tribunal is secret. They are going to \nshut the door, lock the door, and in a closed room somewhere--where we \nwill not be told--they make a decision about whether we have the right \nto protect our citizens.\n  I offered an amendment on this bill here in the Senate. A wide \nbipartisan majority of Senators voted for it. It said: Those dispute \nresolutions must be opened to the public. America needs to see them. \nLet's have the disinfectant of sunlight on those trade disputes.\n  That makes sense, doesn't it? Except the trade bill came back from \nconference with that stripped out.\n  The bill also came back from conference without the Dayton-Craig \namendment, which I cosponsored. The Dayton-Craig amendment said if you \nare going to negotiate a trade treaty and weaken the laws that protect \nus against unfair trade, then we deserve to have a separate vote on it. \nDo you know what they did? They stripped that out and they said: What \nyou can do is you can have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  We can have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution right now. That doesn't \nmean anything. To offer this kind of placebo is an insult. You are \neither going to stand up for this country's interests or you are not. \nIf you decide you are not going to stand up for this country's \ninterests, just say so. Don't play a game with it.\n\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment ought to be in this piece of legislation. \nThe amendment I offered on transparency ought to be in this piece of \nlegislation. Amendments dealing with child protection and child labor \nissues ought to be in this legislation--and it is not, despite the fact \nthat at its roots it is bad legislation.\n  We ought not handcuff ourselves. We should not preclude ourselves \nfrom offering one amendment to a treaty that has not yet been \nnegotiated at a time and place not yet described; a treaty in which the \nnegotiations are not open to the public. We in the Senate agree we will \nnot offer one amendment; in fact, we will prohibit it. Has anybody read \nthe Constitution lately? That is not what the Constitution says.\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\n  People refuse to stand up on the floor of the Senate and say: On \nbehalf of our producers we demand fair trade. On behalf of farmers, \nsteelworkers, textile workers, we are willing to compete. Yes, we want \ncompetition, absolutely. Bring them on. We are willing to compete. But \nwe demand fair competition. If it is not fair, we say to those who want \nto ship their trousers and shirts and shoes and trinkets to us, ship \nthem to Nigeria or Zambia and see how fast they sell. Say to Korea, \nthat sent 630,000 cars into our marketplace and we are allowed only \n2,800 cars into Korea: Korea, ship your cars to Zambia. See how many \nyou sell. If you want to keep shipping Hyundais and Daewoos to the \nAmerican marketplace, then open your market to American automobiles. It \nis very simple.\n  I am going to talk more about this during the postcloture period. But \nmy question is very simple: When will the House and Senate stand up for \nAmerican producers? No, not for an advantage for them, just to demand \nbasic fairness for workers and producers in this country. Just to \ndemand basic fairness. When will we take action?\n  I said before, maybe if there is a fast track urge around here, maybe \nif deep in the breasts of people around here they have some urge to do \nsomething on fast track, we should pass a piece of legislation that \nsays the only fast track you have, Mr. Ambassador, is to put on fast \ntrack the solution to our trade problems. Fix a few problems before you \nnegotiate a new trade agreement, just fix a few problems, then come \nback here and tell us you have fixed a few, and then we will work with \nyou.\n  Understand what is going to happen today. We will have a debate that \nis never at the center of the issue. We will have a vote. We will vote \ncloture. Then tomorrow, after the bill is passed, the President will \ntalk about how wonderful it is that he has this trade promotion \nauthority, which is fast track. People in Congress will talk about how \nwonderful it is because they understand the global economy and how \nimportant this is. It is all sheer nonsense, and they know it.\n  I hope tomorrow morning someone will address this question: Why is it \nwhen things are not working, you want to do more of it? Why is it you \nwant to do more of that which does not work? Just describe for one \nmoment why you think something that hurts this country is something \nthat we ought to continue.\n  Let me finish as I started. My speech, especially the speech I will \ngive later where I will go into a lot of specifics, will be \nmisinterpreted, because it always is, as someone who is a xenophobe \nisolationist who doesn't believe in free trade. I believe in expanded \ntrade. I believe trade promotes opportunity for our country and for \nothers. But I, by God, insist on fair trade for American workers and \nproducers, and I do not believe that after fighting for 100 years in \nthis country for the right to organize, for people dying in the streets \nfor the right to organize in a labor force, for the right to have a \nsafe workplace, for the right not to employ children, 10- and 12-year-\nold children in coal mines and in factories, for the right to a decent \nwage--after fighting for those things for a century, I do not believe \nwe ought to construct an economic system where companies can pole-vault \nover all of that in just a nanosecond and say, ``I renounce my American \ncitizenship, let me become a citizen of Bermuda and put my jobs in Sri \nLanka and Bangladesh,'' and not have to worry about all the things we \nfought about for a century.\n  Fair is fair. There is a price for admission to the American \nmarketplace. You cannot have a 12-year-old kid, pay him 12 cents an \nhour, work 12 him hours a day, and ship the product to Pittsburgh or \nFargo or Los Angeles and call that fair trade. It not fair to America's \nworkers and or producers. This fast-track trade authority for a trade \nagreement that has not yet been negotiated is, in my judgment, an \naberration.\n  It ignores the precepts of the consultation about international \ntrade. In my judgment, because of what has happened in recent years, \nthe evidence is clear that it also hurts our country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume, but I would like to be informed if I have reached the 7-minute \nmark.\n  Mr. President, I hope people on the other side of the aisle will take \ninto consideration the statements of the previous President of the \nUnited States, President Clinton, on the importance of trade. President \nClinton rightly bragged about one-third of the new jobs during his \nadministration being directly related to trade emphasizing the \nimportance of trade. John Deere, Waterloo, IA--one-fifth of the jobs \nthere are related to trade: 3M in Oakville, IA--40 percent of \nproduction is related to trade.\n  We want to remember that trade creates jobs. It creates jobs that pay \n15 percent above the national average. According to President Clinton, \nand according to the economic facts of life, trade is good for American \nworkers--creation of jobs, and creation of good jobs.\n  I would also like to say that those who have been criticizing \nPresident Bush saying he does not have a strong economic team must, in \nfact, have their heads in the sand.\n  Compare that criticism to what I just said about the importance of \ntrade as emphasized by President Clinton. Then you will see the strong \neconomic leadership of Ambassador Zoellick and Secretary Evans as they \nhave worked on trade issues generally, and particularly their \nleadership on trade promotion authority.\n  Two things about the economic policy of this administration: They \nhave strong leaders in place to talk about the importance of the \neconomy and to carry out policy important to the economy. And \nparticularly they are considering continuing the trend that President \nClinton emphasized--the importance of trade to creating jobs, and good \njobs.\n\n  I think it is bunk that this administration has no strong economic \nvoice, particularly if you look at the strong leadership of Ambassador \nZoellick and Secretary Evans on promoting good trade policy, and their \nvery successful work on bringing this legislation to where it is now.\n  Make no doubt in anybody's mind that I rise in strong support of the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 3009, the Trade Act of 2002, and \nurge my colleagues to support cloture and final passage.\n  This bill is the product of over a year and a half of intense \nnegotiations, discussion, and debate from both Republicans and \nDemocrats in both Houses of Congress--and particularly strong \nbipartisan support here in the Senate.\n  Because of these efforts, the Trade Act strikes a solid and balanced \ncompromise among a number of key issues and competing priorities in the \ntradition of bipartisanship in the Senate. It is a product that should \nreceive broad support here in the Senate today.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 renews trade promotion authority for the \nPresident for the first time in almost a decade.\n  Through a spirit of compromise, Democrats and Republicans were able \nto break the deadlock on trade promotion authority that was the \nenvironment during the last term of President Clinton, and we were able \nto reach a balanced compromise on a number of key issues.\n  At the same time, we were able to provide the President with the \nflexibility that he needs to negotiate strong international trade \nagreements while maintaining Congress's constitutional role over U.S. \ntrade policy.\n  It represents a thoughtful approach to addressing the complex \nrelationships between international trade, workers' rights, and the \nenvironment. And it does so without undermining the fundamental purpose \nand proven effectiveness of this process now called trade promotion \nauthority.\n  It is an extremely solid bill. The Trade Act also reauthorizes and \nimproves trade adjustment assistance for America's workers whose jobs \nmay be displaced by trade. I think the trade adjustment provisions in \nthe act are a vast improvement over the legislation that passed the \nSenate.\n  Our provisions--which I voted for but wasn't entirely in tune with--\nwould have completely rewritten existing law of trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  In doing so, the Senate bill added a number of new, costly \ndefinitions, time lines, and ambiguous administrative obligations.\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\n  This conference report removes these burdensome and ill-advised \nchanges. Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report simply amends \nand builds upon existing trade adjustment assistance law.\n  It adds new provisions which help to actually improve trade \nadjustment assistance while maintaining a linkage to trade.\n  In short, the Trade Act improves the Senate-passed trade adjustment \nbill and represents a balanced approach to ensuring that workers \ndisplaced by trade will get the necessary assistance in trading to \nreenter the workplace.\n  I also mention the good provisions of the Andean pact because this \nwill help create new employment opportunities in the countries of \nBolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. It will help us, too, in our \nefforts there to fight drug trafficking.\n  I will be the first to admit that this bill is not a perfect piece of \nlegislation. But, all in all, it is fair and balanced. It deserves \nstrong support.\n\n  International trade has long been one of our most important foreign \npolicy and economic tools. It was a key component for the last 50 years \nfor enhancing international economic strategy. This bill will make a \ndifference.\n  Nations around the world are waiting for our call and the usual U.S. \nleadership of the last 50 years. Trade ministers and cabinets all over \nthe world are looking to the Senate now for the United States to \nreestablish its leadership that we haven't had for 9 years. I hope we \nwill not let them down.\n  I urge support for the conference report, vote for cloture and \npassage of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Idaho speaks, I \nwant to thank him for all his hard work on trade remedies. And I thank \nhim, too, for the support and for being a very strong advocate of \nchecking American trade laws. I thank him for all that he has done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and also the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the trade promotion authority \nlegislation. I will speak briefly about the strong provisions contained \nwithin the conference bill that will help the United States preserve \nthe effectiveness of our trade laws.\n  As many of you know, these laws are going to be critical to the \nability of U.S. companies, farmers, and workers to combat trading \npractices that harm our economic interests. As barriers to trade come \ndown around the world, it becomes critically important to uphold the \nrules that combat government subsidies and predatory pricing practices.\n  As many of you know, and many of you participated with Senator Dayton \nand I in crafting an amendment aimed at preserving the ability of \nCongress to have a significant role in shaping our laws, it was not \ndone in an isolationist or xenophobic attitude--not at all. That \namendment had overwhelming, bipartisan support, and spoke directly to \nTPA and the role of the Senate.\n\n  I tell you, I was disappointed the conference did not deal with the \nCraig-Dayton provision, but I do believe the conference bill does \ncontain several strong provisions that require the administration to \nconsult with us every step of the way during trade negotiations.\n  First, the bill makes trade law preservation a principal negotiating \nobjective.\n  Secondly, it requires the administration to report to Congress a full \n6 months before a trade agreement is initialed regarding any trade law \nchanges that trade agreement would require. In other words, the U.S. \nTrade Representative must come to the Senate and explain to each of us \nwhat will be changed in our laws, and how those changes meet the \nobjectives of trade and also the rights of this Congress. We have \ngained transparency in the process of negotiation. I think that is \ncritical.\n  And third, if those changes do not satisfy our requirements of \npreserving U.S. trade law, well, we can vote on a resolution of \ndisagreement. And I will help write it.\n  Make no mistake, our trade laws are under attack at the WTO.\n  First, several countries have put forth proposals that would fire a \nnumber of rounds into our trade laws with every intent of sinking them.\n  Our trade laws are also unraveling, on a monthly basis, before the \nWTO dispute settlement process where bureaucrats in Geneva sit back and \ntell our trade law agencies how to make their decisions, completely \nignoring the standard of review that was agreed to in the last trade \nround.\n  These are some of the issues. So Ambassador Zoellick, Secretary \nEvans, hear us loud: Do it right or bring it back here and we defeat \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Sixty-two Senators said: Do not negotiate away our trade \nlaws, or suffer the consequence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the remainder of the time to Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe conference report that is before us today and the cloture motion.\n  Let me just make a couple very quick comments. I do not agree with \neverything that is in this bill. And I do not agree with the way it was \nput together. We had three bills together. The Andean trade bill should \nhave been passed a year ago. It expired in December.\n  You have Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru that have been needing \nus to pass this bill. Those are all allies of ours, but they were held \nhostage by it being put in a package. But the only way we can help them \nis by passing this bill today. It is better late than never. We need to \ndo it. I apologize to those four countries for us taking so long.\n  We have been collecting duties against our allies when, for years--\nfor over 10 years--we have not done it. So we are long overdue. Senator \nMcCain has brought this to our attention on the floor. They were held \nhostage because these three bills were put together.\n  Also, trade adjustment assistance--which the Congress has always \npassed and the Senate has always passed, but not as part of trade \npromotion authority, or not as part of fast track--we need to do it, \nbut it should not be in the same package.\n  I disagree strongly, very strongly, with a couple of elements that \nare in the trade adjustment assistance package, particularly the \nexpansion of health benefits or the health tax credits. It is 65 \npercent for people who now are between the ages of 55 and 65. Those now \nreceiving Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation benefits are now going \nto get health benefits. It is almost like an incentive to dump your \npension liabilities into the PBGC, which is going to have enormous \nfinancial problems in the future. Now that is an obligation for \ntaxpayers.\n  That being said, I think it would be a disastrous thing if this \nSenate did not pass trade promotion authority. And now all three bills \nare tied together. So while I do not like the trade adjustment \nassistance--and if it was separate, I would be voting against it--when \ntaken together, the good of the trade promotion authority far outweighs \nthe entire package. We have to pass it.\n  I would shutter to think what would happen if we did not pass it. I \nwill even guess what would happen. I remember Chairman Greenspan was \nasked: What can we do to help the economy? And he said: You need to \nshow fiscal discipline. We have not in many cases. And you need to \npromote trade. Well, if we did not pass this, there would be a big \neconomic shock wave that would not only resonate in Wall Street but all \nacross the world: The United States defeats trade promotion authority. \nThe United States, the world leader in trade, really defeated trade, \ndefeated trade promotion--taking us out of our active leadership role \nwhich we have had since at least the 1970s, which we have had for \ndecades, really since the conclusion of World War II. We would be\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\nsaying: No, we don't want to be a leader in trade. I think that would \nbe a disastrous result.\n  So I think the stock market would have a precipitous decline. Our \nleadership role in free trade would suffer an enormous defeat.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion on TPA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 3 minutes \nto my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate that both sides \nshould have equal time. I enjoyed listening to my colleague from \nOklahoma. I might say, however, I do not believe that Chairman \nGreenspan would suggest we should promote trade deficits. I think he \nsuggests we promote international trade. I am all for that. Sign me up. \nCount me as one who believes we ought to expand international trade. I \nthink that is healthy. Good for our economy and good for the economies \nof those with whom we trade, provided the trade is fair and reasonably \nbalanced.\n  We have a trade deficit with China that is $60 billion to $70 \nbillion, and headed south. We have a trade deficit with Japan that is \nbetween $50 billion and $60 billion--slightly more than that, as a \nmatter of fact. We have a trade deficit with Mexico and Canada that is \nbecoming significant. And we have a trade deficit with Europe.\n  It is interesting how all of the discussion this morning has \ncarefully avoided the fact that the current trade policy they espouse \nisn't working. The current trade policy, last month, produced a $41.5 \nbillion trade deficit--just last month. That is a deficit that will be \na yoke on the shoulders of every American. It is relentless, it is \nincreasing, and everyone who speaks in favor of this trade policy \ncarefully and studiously ignores it. They just do not want to talk \nabout the fact that it isn't working.\n  Let me, once again, put up a chart that shows what is happening in \ninternational trade. Our country is drowning in trade deficits. The \nnext line would be up here off the chart. The merchandise trade deficit \nis exploding. Everyone in the Senate knows that. It emanates from a \ntrade strategy that is, in my judgment, weak kneed, a trade strategy in \nwhich we lack backbone and will.\n  Our country refuses--refuses--to say to China or Japan or Europe or \nCanada or Mexico that we demand some reciprocity and fair trade. We \njust refuse to do it.\n  We have this huge trade deficit with China. So China wants to buy \nairplanes, and goes over and buys airplanes from Airbus, which is \nheavily subsidized by the European governments. Is that fair? It is \nfair to an American producer of airplanes? It is fair to Boeing? You \nknow it is not fair.\n  We ought to say to China: Look, you want to sell us all of your \ntrousers and shirts and shoes and trinkets, and all the things you \nmanufacture in our marketplace; good for you. Our marketplace is open \nto you, by all means. But understand this: When you need something we \nproduce, you ought to be buying from us. That is the way trade ought to \nwork.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course. I have very limited time. You have used all \nyour time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator be \ngranted an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. And that 5 minutes be granted also on this side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. We have a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have a vote scheduled. I will yield on \nmy time for a very brief question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the vote is scheduled to start at 10:30. It would be \njust an additional 5 minutes and 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. What was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I asked unanimous consent the Senator be granted an \nadditional 5 minutes, and also 5 minutes for this side.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was willing to yield ever so slightly because I have \nsuch limited time.\n  Let me say this: I am going to speak postcloture, and I would be \nhappy to engage in the debate. No one in the Senate really wants to \ndebate trade very much. They want to simply say there are those of us \nwho support fast track, and those of us who get it, who understand it, \nwho see over the horizon, and who have a broader view of the world. And \nthen there are, as Ambassador Zoellick suggests, the xenophobes and \nisolationists, the stooges who just don't see it. That is the \nthoughtless debate that occurs every time we talk about trade.\n  But I will, in the postcloture period, ask a series of questions. I \nhope perhaps some colleagues will be here.\n  I will ask, for example, about the issue of washed versus unwashed \neggs with Europe, corn syrup with Mexico, and automobiles with China. \nWe will see if there are people on the floor of the Senate who agree \nwith the circumstances of our trade relationships. The problems are \nrelentless, they are pervasive, and they continue.\n  What we want to do is rush off and negotiate the next trade treaty \nbefore we solve any problems in the previous treaties. How can we tell \nthe farmers of North Dakota that it is all right? That it doesn't \nmatter that they have had a problem for 10 years of a monopoly in \nCanada shipping unfairly subsidized grain south? We want to do another \ntreaty. The folks who produce America's beef, who 12 years after the \nbeef agreement with Japan now have a 38.5-percent tariff on every pound \nof beef sent to Japan--how can we tell these people that it just \ndoesn't matter?\n  Yes, we are a leader in trade. Regrettably, we have been a leader \nwithout a backbone. We have refused to say to our trading partners, \nthere is an admission price to the American marketplace, and that \nadmission price is fair trade with respect to labor standards and a \nrange of other issues.\n  Most especially, from my standpoint, I am concerned about the issue \nof fundamental fairness. I mentioned that I did not support fast-track \ntrade authority for President Clinton, didn't think he should have it. \nI don't think President Bush should have it.\n  I also mentioned earlier, the last two experiences we have had with \nfast track, both NAFTA and GATT, have not turned out well for America. \nThe agreement that went into conference came out of conference in much \nworse shape than it left the Senate. They essentially got rid of the \nDayton-Craig amendment and put a placebo in place. They got rid of the \ntransparency issue I raised.\n  I want to talk about what they boast about with respect to this \nconference agreement. It provides assistance with health insurance. \nWhat that means is for those Americans who lose their jobs because of \nthe next incompetently negotiated trade agreements, we will help pay \ntheir health insurance. That is going to be great news to people who \nwill lose their jobs. It is safe to say not one man or woman in the \nSenate will lose their job because of this vote. Fast track will not \ncost any jobs here in the Senate. No Senator's job is threatened by \nthis. It is also safe to say that those Americans who are working for \ncompanies that will be subject to unfair trade, because our trade \nnegotiators want to negotiate the next agreement rather than fix the \nproblems they have created in the past, are going to have little \nconsolation with these provisions. If you lose your job, we give you \nhealth insurance. Well, maybe it would be better if they didn't lose \ntheir job.\n  We expand coverage for secondary workers. If you are a secondary \nworker and you lose your job, we help you a bit. There is wage \ninsurance for the older workers who lose their jobs: We will help you a \nbit. New benefits for farmers and ranchers: If you lose the farm and \nthe ranch because of trade negotiations, we are willing to help you. It \nmight be better just to negotiate trade agreements that are fair to our \nproducers and say to our producers: This represents fair competition. \nYou have to go compete. If you don't win, that is tough luck. But we \nhave made the rules fair for you. You have to compete and win.\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n\n  That is not what we do here. Our trade negotiators don't do that. In \nnegotiation after negotiation, we discover we don't have much of a \nbackbone.\n  Will Rogers once said that the United States of America has never \nlost a war and never won a conference. He surely was talking about our \ntrade negotiators. They usually manage to lose in a week or two; \nsometimes it takes longer. I can't think of a trade negotiation in \nrecent years that has enhanced this country's economic interests.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will have a cloture vote this morning, and my \nexpectation is that sufficient votes exist to have cloture. We will \nthen have a postcloture period in which I will speak at greater length \nabout the specifics of unfair trade.\n  Let me say this: The only bright spot for me for some long while in \ninternational trade was Mickey Kantor, trade ambassador some while ago, \nwho in 1 year took action against Canada for engaging in horribly \nunfair trade against American farmers. I happen to like current trade \nambassador Zoellick. I think he is a charming fellow. This is not about \npersonalities, it is about strategy.\n  The fact is, this Senate is going to make a serious mistake by \ndeciding it will tie its hands and it will agree to tie its hands prior \nto negotiation of a new trade agreement so that if and when a trade \nagreement comes here for approval by the Senate, we agree not to change \na word.\n  Think of the difference that would have existed had we been able to \nchange a few words in the United States-Canada trade agreement; think \nof what it would have meant for tens of thousands of American farmers \nif we had been able to say: We demand fairness in this agreement. But \nwe couldn't. That trade agreement was negotiated, as all of them are, \nin secret. The next trade agreement will be negotiated the same way. We \nwill come back 5 years from now, and I will be back on the floor of the \nSenate, if I am here, showing with another chart that we are drowning \nin red ink and jobs are leaving and opportunity is lost. We will have \npeople saying: We ought to do the same thing. We ought to repeat the \nsame failures.\n  It is hard for me to understand how repeating something that doesn't \nwork advances America's interests. This must be the only body in the \nworld that has grown men and women adding 2 and 2 and getting 5 and \ncomplimenting each other on their math skills. It defies logic, in my \njudgment, to believe that this strategy enhances America's economic \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 64, the nays \nare 32. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could the Chair inform me as to the \nparliamentary situation as it exists?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture has been invoked on the conference \nreport. The Senator has a maximum of 1 hour of debate. The amendments \nmust be germane or the debate must be germane to the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand.\n  Madam President, I do not intend to take very long. I do want to \nspeak for a relatively brief period of time on the importance of the \nAndean Trade Preference Act.\n  I think it is very important we recognize that in our hemisphere \ntoday we have a number of very serious situations--the possibility of a \nbreakdown of democracy. Institutions which were regarded as relatively \nstrong and stable a short time ago, in many of the countries throughout \nour hemisphere, are in danger or in some cases near a crisis situation. \nThat is why I think the Andean Trade Preference Act, although maybe not \nof major impact, is certainly one that is important and an important \nsignal to send to these countries in the region. That, coupled with our \noverall approval of trade authority for the President of the United \nStates, I hope will be an encouragement to nations in our hemisphere \nthat are now in varying degrees of duress.\n  Argentina is in a serious financial crisis. A country that was once \nthe fifth most wealthy nation in the world is now in such a period of \nfinancial difficulty that their economy could be close to collapse. \nVenezuela is a country whose democracy is under severe strain. Hundreds \nof thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets recently to demonstrate \nagainst their elected President, and, as we all know, there was an \nattempted, briefly successful, coup which was antidemocratic in nature.\n  In Bolivia, one of the countries that is directly affected by the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, there is now a candidate for President of \nthat country who is running on one of his commitments to the people of \nBolivia, which is that they will resume the growth of coca--a \nremarkable turnaround, particularly given that Bolivia had an \nincredibly successful cocaine eradication program.\n  Peru is in such difficulties that the President, President Toledo, \nhas gotten rid of the reform economists in his Cabinet and his \npopularity and approval have plummeted to almost historic lows.\n  As we prepare to vote on this trade package, our country is \nprecariously positioned in the international trade arena. Many of our \nfriends and allies no longer see the United States as a nation that \nchampions global free trade but, rather, as a nation that increasingly \nfears foreign competition\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\nand seeks to erect barriers to trade in order to protect domestic \nindustries and advance narrow political agendas.\n  A series of shortsighted protectionist actions in recent years has \njeopardized our relationships with our most important trading partners. \nGiven our recent double standards on trade, it is not surprising that \nthe United States is quickly losing its credibility and leadership in \nchampioning free trade principles around the world.\n  Our staunchest allies and most important trading partners are now \ndoubting our dedication to the free trade principles we have long \nchampioned.\n  Many of the nations that engage in the free exchange of commerce are \nalso our staunchest allies in the war on terrorism. Over the past eight \nmonths, those countries have joined in our worthy cause, some making \nsubstantial sacrifices to advance our shared values. During that time, \neven as our allies have deployed their forces to stand alongside our \nown in Central Asia, we have pursued protectionist policies on steel \nand lumber, and passed into law a regressive, trade-distorting farm \nbill. We are already fighting one war on a global scale. We cannot \nsimultaneously fight a trade war.\n  The United States simply cannot afford to follow the dangerous path \nof protectionism. I hope that the passage of trade promotion authority \nand the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act, both of which are \nincluded in this package, will represent a turning point. Now is our \nchance to put a stop to our short-sighted protectionism and recognize \nthat such behavior has consequences.\n  Mr. President, this package of trade bills, including the Andean \nTrade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, trade promotion authority, \nand trade adjustment assistance (TAA), demonstrates what I hope is the \nbeginning of a renewed commitment to negotiating and expediting strong \ntrade agreements. Enactment of this legislation will go a long way \ntoward re-establishing faith and trust in the United States as a \ntrading partner.\n  The Andean Trade Preferences Act, a measure that would be expanded by \nthis bill, is a trade-related success story that has not only \nstrengthened our economy, but our national security as well. ATPA was \ndesigned to reduce the Andean region's drug trade and spur economic \ndevelopment. That Act has proven effective, and benefitted not only \nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, but also the United States. Its \nextension is long past due.\n  Originally enacted in 1991, entire export industries have been \ncreated through ATPA. The cut flowers industry alone has created more \nthan 80,000 new jobs in Ecuador, and over 150,000 new jobs in Colombia. \nIn Peru, the benefits of the Andean trade act encouraged farmers to \ncultivate asparagus, making it that country's largest export crop to \nthe United States, creating 50,000 new jobs in the process. No longer \nare people in these countries confined to producing the raw materials \nthat go into the production of cocaine; They have the ever increasing \noptions afforded them under ATPA.\n  Unlike other forms of assistance, ATPA costs the U.S. nothing. In \nfact, American workers and consumers benefit through reduced prices on \ngoods and services.\n  Despite such success, it has taken Congress well over a year to \nextend this non-controversial measure. Legislation was introduced in \nthe Senate in March 2001 to extend and expand ATPA, which was set to \nexpire December 2001. Along with this history, a long delay in the \nappointment of conferees and partisan disagreements, all unrelated to \nATPA, prevented final Congressional action on this critical legislation \nuntil now. Fast-track authority for the President expired 8 years ago. \nBy empowering the President to negotiate bilateral and multilateral \ntrade agreements, TPA will enable the President to eliminate trade \nbarriers, reduce tariffs, and open foreign markets to American goods \nand services. American workers, farmers, businessmen, and consumers \nwill benefit from the regional free trade areas such as the Free Trade \nArea of the Americas, and bilateral trade agreements such as those \ncurrently being negotiated with Singapore and Chile.\n  I repeat, a man is running for President of this country of Bolivia. \nOne of his most popular themes is to reinitiate the cultivation and \ngrowth of coca. If that man wins--and I do not question the will of the \npeople of Bolivia, but it is clear that it would be a dramatic setback \nto our efforts to eradicate the growth of coca in that country.\n  In Peru, there are civil disturbances and the President of Peru, who \nis a good and decent man from all I can tell, is suffering enormously \nin popularity in polls.\n  Colombia is a nation with its very existence at risk due to civil \nwar, a lot of that fueled by the cocaine trafficking, the growth of \nwhich begins in the country of Colombia.\n  Ecuador, next to Colombia, has felt many very devastating side \neffects of the war in Colombia and the effects on its own economy.\n  I mentioned Argentina, Venezuela, Guatemala are having difficulties; \nHonduras, Nicaragua; and even Mexico is having some difficulties \nbecause of the failure, in the view of many of the Mexican people, of \nPresident Fox in delivering on many promises he made when he ran for \nPresident of Mexico.\n  I cannot believe all of the troubles in our hemisphere, which in my \nview are more serious than they have been since the 1980s, on the \nabsence of trade and the absence of renewal of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act. But in the words of the Presidents of these countries \nwho visited my office, they said one thing: We do not want aid; we want \ntrade. We want trade.\n  Now, I have heard many of the arguments about how the lumber industry \nor the steel industry or the textile industry, or any other, is being \nharmed because some of the imports are lower priced goods. Well, I am \nnot a trained economist, but I know these cut flowers are less \nexpensive. I know it costs less to build a house for the average \ncitizens when the lumber is cheaper. It is easier to clothe people when \nthe apparel is cheaper.\n  This protectionism which has characterized many of the actions of \nthis body and the other body, and of the President of the United \nStates, is harmful to average American citizens, many of whom do not \nmake large campaign contributions, many of whom do not make huge \ncontributions to the fundraisers. But they will pay more for the price \nof a house if we continue to protect lumber. They will pay more for an \nautomobile if we continue to protect steel. They will pay more for \nclothes if we continue to protect the textile industry.\n  Are there people who are hurt by this free and open trade? \nAbsolutely. That is why I have steadfastly supported insurance, job \ntraining, and outright assistance to any dislocated worker if the case \ncan be made that that worker was dislocated or removed from their job \nbecause of a direct impact of trade.\n  I am worried about our hemisphere. There was a front page story in \nthe New York Times a couple weeks ago about the failure of free market \neconomies in our hemisphere and how average citizens of these poor \ncountries have enjoyed the benefits of the increased economic benefits \nof free trade and a great discontent and unrest that exists in these \nnations. We should pay attention to the difficulties in our own \nhemisphere. There is no stronger supporter of the war on terror than \nthis Senator and all of the American people.\n  We are going to have great difficulties because of one thing we have \nlearned from the 1980s: That if governments are unable to satisfy the \npeople, the people turn to other means to satisfy their legitimate \nyearnings and desires. We saw that manifested in guerilla movements and \narmed insurrections in Central America and in Latin America in the \n1980s, movements such as the Shining Path, the Sandinistas, and others. \nAnd the United States then expended a great deal of American treasure \nto try to prevent these movements from overthrowing legitimately \nelected governments.\n  I rise in strong support today of the Andean Trade Preference Act. I \nwant to make it very clear that along with my support for free trade, I \nalso am strongly supportive of and will continue to commit to any \nworker and his or her family who are dislocated by free trade. But to \nargue that we should not have free trade as a result of this is \nignoring the larger picture, and that is goods and services ranging \nfrom flowers to apparel to many other products\n\n[[Page S7776]]\n\nare less expensive for average American citizens, thereby allowing \nAmerican citizens to enjoy many of the things wealthier Americans are \nable to enjoy.\n\n  I want to warn my colleagues. We have a serious situation in our \nhemisphere. Enactment of trade authority for the President in the \nAndean Trade Preference Act will not turn that around immediately. But \nthere is no doubt in my mind that we are on a path in our hemisphere \nthat could lead to enormous challenges and difficulties in the months \nand years ahead. By passing the Andean Trade Preference Act and giving \nthe President trade authority, I think we can at least start on a path \nto reversing some of the terrible misfortunes that have beset so many \ninnocent people in our own hemisphere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 5005\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 5005 be vitiated, there be a time limitation of 7 hours \non the motion to proceed on H.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill, \nequally divided between Senators Lieberman and Thompson for the \nproponents, and Senator Byrd for the opponents, or their designees; \nthat the time begin on Tuesday, September 3, at 9:30 a.m., and the \nmotion to proceed be the pending business at that time. I further ask \nunanimous consent that at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nSenate, without any intervening action or debate, vote on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 5005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened intently to my colleague and \nfriend from Arizona. There is no disagreement on the proposition that I \nwant the benefits of international trade to accrue to American \ncitizens, consumers who go to the store and want to buy the best \npossible product at the best possible price. There is no question about \nthe doctrine of comparative advantage, in which each country, doing \nthat which it does best and trading with other countries, promotes \nefficiency. There is no question about that, and that should not be the \nsubject of this debate.\n  It is not that those of us who oppose fast track do not support free \ntrade. But I want to tell you about the kind of trade I do not support. \nThe most recent agreement that we negotiated in this country was with \nChina. It was a bilateral agreement, prior to their membership in the \nWTO. Let me just take one small piece of that bilateral agreement with \nChina and ask a question.\n  Our negotiators negotiated with the Chinese in this bilateral \nagreement, and they agreed to the following: After a phase-in period, \nthe United States would impose a 2.5-percent tariff on any automobiles \nmanufactured in China shipped to the United States, and China would \nimpose a 25-percent tariff on any United States automobiles shipped to \nChina.\n  I am wondering, who in this Chamber would think that is a reasonable \ndeal? We say to China: China, you have a $70 billion trade surplus with \nus. We have a $70 billion trade deficit with you. And by the way, here \nare some new terms on automobile trade. If you decide to build \nautomobiles and ship them to our country, and we want to ship cars to \nyour country--you have 1.3 billion people--we agree you can charge 10 \ntimes the tariff on United States cars going into China. Who thinks \nthat makes sense? Where do these negotiators come from? Do they go to a \nschool somewhere, a school that fails to teach them the basics of how \nyou negotiate and what a fair trade agreement is about?\n  No one wants to discuss this. One of my colleagues said: I have half \na notion to stay here and debate you.\n  I said: Gosh, I wish you would.\n  No one is interested in debating the issue of trade. There is the \nsimplistic and thoughtless debate saying we are for free trade, we \nunderstand it, we see over the horizon, we understand the economy, and \nthe rest of you are xenophobic stooges, and you don't know what you are \ntalking about. That is the way the debate rages on the floor and in the \nWashington Post, with the same thoughtless drivel.\n  I come from a State that has a lot of family farmers. We have to find \na foreign home for over half of what we produce. I am the last person \nin the world who wants to retard the movement of goods around the \nworld. I believe in trade. I believe in expanded trade. But on behalf \nof our farmers, I demand the trade relationships with other countries \nbe fair. It doesn't matter to me whether it is wheat or corn or \nsoybeans, if we are going to have a trade relationship with someone, \nand we are going to connect with somebody, I want it to be fair. So let \nme describe a bit what I mean about fairness.\n  I mentioned Japanese beef. We ship a lot of Japanese cars into this \ncountry and good for us. If consumers want to buy them, that is good. \nThey want access to that product. So I represent a lot of ranchers in \nNorth Dakota. They have a lot of beef to sell. Japan needs beef. So we \nnegotiated a beef agreement with the country of Japan.\n\n  Madam President, 12 years after the agreement was completed, every \npound of hamburger, every pound of T-bone steak that goes into Japan \nnow has a 38.5-percent tariff on it; 12 years after our agreement, we \nhave a 38.5-percent tariff. Should we be shipping more T-bones to \nTokyo? You bet your life we should. Why can't we? The tariff is too \nhigh. That is after our negotiators reached an agreement with them. Do \nour ranchers have a complaint? I think so; I believe so because the \ntrade circumstances with respect to beef to Japan are not fair, and \neverybody knows it.\n  Let me show a chart that shows the EU's import barrier to U.S. eggs. \nIf you are an egg producer in this country, in the United States, it is \nstandard to wash eggs before shipment. So if you go to the store and \nbuy a carton of eggs and open the carton, that is what it is going to \nlook like. It is something you might want to crack and eat.\n  The European Union requires that imported eggs be unwashed, \nsupposedly because their farmers are not in the habit of washing eggs. \nTherefore United States eggs cannot be sold in Europe at the retail \nlevel, because we wash our eggs. Is that a fair trade deal? If you were \ninvolved in selling eggs, do you think you would like what Europe is \ndoing to us? I don't think so.\n  I mentioned yesterday the issue of $100 million in United States beef \nthat is banned in the European Union. We have a fairly significant \ntrade deficit with Europe. You read the European press, they make it \nsound as if all of our cows have two heads--this grotesque creature we \nare trying to sell that is going to injure their consumers.\n  So we took the Europeans to the WTO court, the tribunal, and we said \nit is unfair, the $100 million of United States beef we cannot get into \nEurope, and the WTO said: Yes, you are right.\n  So they said: Europe, you are going to have to allow that United \nStates beef in.\n  Europe said: Go fly a kite. We don't intend to let United States beef \ninto Europe.\n  So our trade negotiators got real gutsy for once. Our trade \nnegotiators screwed up all of their courage and they said: Look Europe, \nif you don't play fair with us, we are taking tough action against you.\n  What did we do? We took action against them, by imposing tariffs on \nselected products. Do you know what EU products our negotiators chose \nto retaliate against? Our retaliation is on truffles, goose liver, and \nRoquefort cheese. That will scare the devil out of a trade adversary, \nwon't it? If you have a trade relationship in which someone is unfair, \nyou better watch out or we might take action against your goose liver \nor Roquefort cheese. Maybe I come from a small town and don't \nunderstand that, but I don't think that is going to strike fear in the \nheart of a trading partner who is being unfair to America.\n  Let's talk about the issue of potato flakes to Korea. What if you are \na potato grower in the Red River Valley and you want to get potato \nflakes to Korea from which they make snack food? There is a 70 percent \ntariff trying to get potato flakes into Korea.\n\n  While we are on the subject of Korea, how about automobiles going \ninto Korea? Last year, this country brought 618,000 Korean automobiles \ninto our\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\nmarketplace to be sold to the American consumer. That is good for \nKorea. Korea produces a pretty good car, and they ship them into the \nUnited States, and United States consumers buy them.\n  Guess how many United States-manufactured cars got into Korea last \nyear? It wasn't 618,000. It was 2,008. Why? Try to sell a Ford Mustang \nin Korea. They use all kinds of non-tariff trade barriers. This is \ntrade in which the Koreans sell us 217 cars for every car we can sell \nin Korea--618,000 sold here, and 2,008 in Korea.\n  Is that because we don't make good cars? No. Is it because Koreans \ndon't want American cars sold in Korea? Yes. It is that simple.\n  I mentioned stuffed molasses, which are used to evade U.S. tariffs on \nsugar. Brazilian sugar is sent to Canada. Then a Canadian company \ncombines the sugar with the molasses. Then it comes into this country, \nand the sugar is unloaded. They get another load of sugar and bring it \ndown with stuffed molasses in contravention of our trade law. It has \nbeen going on for a long period of time. We can't do a thing about it.\n  Trade problem? Sure, it is. If you are a sugar beet grower, is that a \nproblem? You bet. Is anybody about to fix it? No. Nobody cares. \nActually, the Senate version of the trade bill had a provision that \naimed to fix this problem. But, like most other things of value in the \ntrade bill, it was dropped out in conference. There is instead a \nplacebo provision that means virtually nothing.\n  I mentioned a bit ago that China has this huge trade surplus with us, \nor we have a huge trade deficit with them. I noticed in the newspaper \nthe other day that China is buying Airbuses from Europe. China has a \nlot of people. They need a lot of airplanes. The Airbus is deeply \nsubsidized by the European governments. It is unfair competition for \nthe Boeing Company, for example.\n  What is the remedy for a United States airplane manufacturer when the \nEuropean company that is deeply subsidized by the European governments \ngoes to China and sells them Airbuses, at the same time that China has \nthis huge trade surplus with us?\n  We had a situation recently because of NAFTA. The administration says \nwe must allow long-haul Mexican trucks into our country. Of course, the \nfact is that long-haul Mexican trucks are not inspected the way we \ninspect our trucks. Their drivers are not required to carry logbooks \nthe way our drivers do. There is a lot of concern about safety when \nthey come in and move around our country. They have been limited to a \n20-mile distance from the border. Mexico said, apparently, that if we \ndidn't allow long-haul Mexican trucks into our country, they were going \nto take action against us with respect to high-fructose corn syrup. I \nhave news for the Mexicans. They have already taken action. We can't \nget high-fructose corn syrup into Mexico with any reasonable tariff \nbecause they are acting in contravention of our trade laws and \nagreements.\n  The list is endless. I could go on for a long period.\n  We have a trade agreement with Canada. Clayton Yeutter went to Canada \nand negotiated a trade agreement with Canada. This agreement \nessentially sold out the interests of our American farmers. I am sure \nhe received something from Canada--perhaps greater access by the \nfinancial service community, or something. In any event, immediately \nafter the trade agreement was negotiated with Canada, our farmers saw \nan avalanche of Canadian grain being sold in our country at unfairly \nsubsidized prices by a monopoly controlled by what they call the \nCanadian Wheat Board. We can't do a thing about it. We sent \ninvestigators to Canada to get information about the prices at which \nthey were selling the grain. They thumbed their noses at us and said: \nWe don't intend to give you any information about the prices at which \nwe are selling it in the United States.\n\n  I rode up to the Canadian border with a farmer named Earl Jensen in a \n12-year-old orange truck with a couple hundred bushels of durum wheat \non the back, and we were stopped at the border despite the fact that \nall the way to the border we saw 18-wheel Canadian trucks coming into \nthe country hauling Canadian wheat.\n  That is the kind of thing that angers the American people about \ntrade.\n  We have a circumstance where we have this huge trade deficit. It is \ninteresting. We talked about this in the debate. No one really wants to \ntalk about this deficit at all. People just act as if it doesn't exist. \nPeople come out here and dance around for a while, talk about the \nwonders of global trade and how terrific it is, but they want to \npretend it doesn't exist. There is this relentless griping about the \ntrade deficit that is increasing year after year and that is hurting \nour country. We don't owe this money to ourselves as we do the budget \ndeficit, we owe this money to other countries. This is a claim on our \nassets by other countries.\n  In May, the trade deficit was $41.5 billion--just last month. And the \ntrade ambassador has said that he is going to put our antidumping laws \non the negotiating table. We have antidumping rules. They are not very \nwell enforced. But we have them nonetheless. They are one of the few \ntools we have to fight unfair trade. And they are now on the \nnegotiating table. There are discussions about their elimination. We \nare willing to get rid of them in future trade negotiations--in secret, \nbecause all these trade negotiations are in secret--willing to consider \ngetting rid of our antidumping rules. We will be defenseless. We have a \nweakened 301, no section 22, and now we have antidumping rules on the \ntable.\n  So where is the remedy for unfair trade? Under this trade bill, the \nonly remedy for those who lose their jobs because of these trade \nagreements is that we are willing to give you some health insurance--\nnot all of a it, but we are willing to pay 65 percent for some health \ninsurance for you. Lose your jobs, and you'll get some trade adjustment \nassistance. You can go home and say to your spouse: Honey, I have lost \nmy job. They are moving into Indonesia. They can find someone who works \nfor 40 cents an hour. They don't have to have a manufacturing plant \nthat is safe because they are not subject to all those darned OSHA \nrules. And they can dump the chemicals right in the streets, and they \ncan pollute the air. They don't have to worry with that because there \nis no enforcement. And they can work 12-year-old kids for 12 hours a \nday, and nobody is going to say anything. Honey, I have lost my job, \nand it is going overseas. But, honey, there is good news here because \nthe bill the Senate has been considering is going to get us a little \nhealth insurance.\n  They have even extended it now to farmers and ranchers who lost their \nfarms and ranches. They get a little trade adjustment assistance as \nwell, when they lose their farms.\n  Incidentally, they are also going to expand the training budget \nbecause they know we are going to lose some of these jobs. We are going \nto give some training to all the people forced out of their jobs. Just \ndon't expect their new jobs to amount to much. Because good jobs are \nbeing driven out of this country by all these trade agreements.\n  It is interesting to me that there is no one in the debate who wants \nto defend the practices I have just described. All they want to do is \nchant. You can go to the street corners and hear chanting as well. \nNormally they have drum rolls and symbols, and they chant. We have the \nsame exercise when we talk about trade--this relentless chant: ``Free \ntrade, global economy, free trade, global economy.''\n  Is there anyone in the Senate who wants to say: Yes, let us have \nexpanded trade, but let us demand on behalf of this country that we \nhave tried rules that are fair?\n  This country got into a bad habit after the Second World War. We did \nit necessarily, and it was something which I would have supported if I \nhad been here at that point. Just after the Second World War, we had a \nlot of countries flat on their backs. Trade policy for us was foreign \npolicy. We said with all of these countries: Let us make concessions. \nLet us help them. We can do almost anything. We are the biggest, the \nbest, the strongest, and we have the most. We can beat anybody in \ninternational trade competition with one hand tied behind our backs. So \ntrade policy was then foreign policy. And that is fine.\n\n  For a quarter of a century, our trade policy was foreign policy. But \nthen, those who were flat on their back became shrewd, tough \ninternational competitors: Japan, Europe, and others. Yet our trade \npolicy did not become\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\ntrade policy or economic policy, it remained foreign policy.\n  For the second 25 years after the Second World War, we began to see \nthis problem, a problem of gripping, relentless trade deficits. With \nJapan, it has been a trade deficit that has continued virtually \nforever--year after year after year after year--because they want to \nprotect their economy and keep United States goods out, to the extent \nthey can, and they want access to our marketplace with their \nmanufactured goods.\n  And this country has said: Fine; that's a relationship that's fine \nwith us.\n  It is not fine with me, and should not be fine with others, whose \nprincipal interest ought to be the economic future of this country, \nwhose principal interest ought to be to have trade agreements that are \nmutually beneficial to both trading partners.\n  When I started talking, I talked about this Byzantine, twisted, \nperverted provision with China on automobiles. I did it for a reason.\n  I recognize that we do not have a lot of automobile trade with China. \nChina has 1.3 billion-plus people. One would expect, as the Chinese \neconomy advances, that the opportunities to sell automobiles in China \ncould be significant. But our negotiators, for reasons I could never \nunderstand, said: Oh, by the way, let's make a little deal. Just as one \npart, one paragraph, in a big, long trade agreement, here is what we \nwill decide on automobiles: China, you have a big trade surplus with \nus, and we have a big deficit with you, but if we ever have any \nautomobile trade between us, you can go ahead and impose a tariff that \nis 10 times higher on United States cars than we would impose on \nChinese cars.\n  We ought to find the person who agreed to that, and somehow put him \nout here on the Senate steps, and get a chair and sit beside him, and \nask him to explain to us what school you go to, to learn that kind of \nnonsense, that kind of perverted sense of fairness.\n  I could describe paragraphs in every trade agreement in the last 25 \nyears that have the same absurdities, the same unwillingness to stand \nup for American producers and American jobs, not at the expense of \nothers, but just for the benefit of ours.\n  Somehow there is an embarrassment in this Chamber about standing up \nfor this country's economic interests. Yes, it is in our economic \ninterest to have a system in which U.S. consumers have access to lower \npriced goods from around the world. But it is not, and never will be, \nin our economic interest, if those consumers are out of work, if the \njobs that provided the income that used to allow the consumers to take \nthe goods off the shelf through their purchases have now gone to other \ncountries because corporations, that at this point are no longer \nAmerican citizens but international citizens, have decided they ought \nto produce where it is very inexpensive to produce and ship their goods \nto the established marketplace.\n  That, inevitably, and, in my judgment, more significantly as the \nyears go on, will erode our job base of good jobs. I am talking about \nmanufacturing-sector jobs. No country will long remain a strong \neconomic power, a world economic power, if it decimates its \nmanufacturing base. Manufacturing is critical to our country's economy \nand to our long-term economic health.\n\n  There is a fellow in North Dakota who goes to county fairs and \nperforms for money, and his name is John Smith. He has an act that he \ntakes to county fairs, and they pay him for it. He takes old cars--gets \nsome old wreck--and then he gins up the engine somehow, and then he \ngoes and he jumps four or five other cars in front of the bandstand, \nwherever the county fair is. He calls himself the Flying Farmer from \nMakoti. He lives in Makoti, ND, and he farms.\n  So he has this act where he travels with these old cars and he calls \nhimself the Flying Farmer. He is an interesting guy. He wanted to set \nthe Guinness record in the ``Guinness Book of World Records.'' And he \nis now in the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' for driving in reverse \nfor 500 miles, averaging 38 miles an hour.\n  Now, you might wonder why I thought about the Flying Farmer from \nMakoti. I was thinking about going in reverse this morning, and I \nthought what better example of going in reverse than the Flying Farmer \nfrom Makoti and the Senate on international trade.\n  Year after year after year, we go deeper and deeper and deeper in \ndebt. The current account deficit is somewhere around $2 trillion at \nthis point this year. When the year ends, we will be somewhere around \n$450 to $480 billion in merchandise trade deficit. And we have to pay \nsomebody that, somebody living outside of our country. It injures our \neconomy, it injures future economic activity, and yet no one really \nwants to talk much about it.\n  We are going in reverse. We are not making progress. Despite all of \nthe protests by those who think this is a wonderful thing, the evidence \nis in.\n  With NAFTA, the last trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, we \nturned a small surplus with Mexico into a big deficit; we turned a \nmoderate deficit with Canada into a big deficit. NAFTA was a disaster. \nWe were promised that there would be 300,000 new American jobs coming \nfrom this trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. The fact is, we have \nlost somewhere around 700,000 jobs.\n  We were told by the economists, who thought they knew what would \nhappen with Mexico, that we would simply get the products of low-\nskilled jobs coming into this country as a result of NAFTA. The three \nlargest imports from Mexico are automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics--all products of high-skilled jobs that used to exist in \nmajor centers of manufacturing in our country but now exist in Mexico.\n  We are not making progress. We are losing ground. That is the reason \nI oppose giving fast-track trade authority to this President. To \nsuggest that we ought to ignore the Constitution--and, yes, we ignore \nthe Constitution when we do this. The Constitution says that the \nregulation of trade with other countries is the province of the \nCongress--the Congress. And a majority of the Senate says: we have not \nseen your next trade agreement yet. We know you will negotiate it \nwithout us. We know it will be negotiated in secret somewhere. But we \nagree in advance, so whatever you do, whenever you do it, wherever you \ndo it, we will handcuff ourselves so we are unable to offer even one \namendment to change one word when it comes back to the Senate.\n  I think that is one of the goofiest propositions I have ever heard. \nIt just makes no sense at all. Yet a pretty broad majority of the \nSenate agrees to it.\n  Well, let me make a final point.\n  The business community in this country and in this world have become \ninternational citizens. Multinational corporations do business all \naround the world. They do not get up in the morning and say: Look, my \nprincipal interest is the economy of the United States of America. That \nis not their principal interest. Their principal interest is to their \nshareholders. And their interest to their shareholders is to do, in \ninternational economic circumstances, the best they can to improve \nprofits. If that means moving jobs from Pittsburgh to Indonesia, in \norder to take advantage of lower labor rates, and to avoid OSHA, and to \navoid all the other things you have to comply with in this country, \nthen that is what they do.\n  The problem is, this country, as a leader in international trade, has \nnot described what fair competition is. We have never described, in the \nnew global economy, what is fair competition. The global economy has \ngalloped forward, but the rules have not kept pace.\n  It begs the question, for all of us, as a leader in world trade: What \nare the rules? What are the conditions? What is the admission price for \nthe American economy?\n  I said earlier, if a company decides that it wishes to access the \nlowest possible labor rate anywhere in the world, and takes its \ncorporate jet, and circles the globe, and looks down to see where they \ncan possibly do that, and discovers a place where they can hire 12-\nyear-olds, and they can work them 12 hours a day, and they can pay them \n14 cents an hour, is that fair?\n  Then they ship the product of that labor to Fargo or to Denver or \nFresno and put on it the store shelf, and someone says: Isn't that a \nwonderful thing? What a wonderful thing; you actually have a lower \nprice for that product. In fact, some studies suggest that is not the \ncase. The difference is made up in\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nprofit for the corporation, not lower prices for the consumer. But \nsetting that aside, people say: Isn't that a wonderful thing? That is \nlower priced than I expected.\n  Yes, that is good for the consumer, but it is also the case that the \nwould-be consumer may well have lost his job because the production of \nthat item no longer exists here.\n  I am not suggesting we should have the manufacturing advantage or \ncapability for all products. I believe the doctrine of comparative \nadvantage makes sense. If there is a country that can do it better, \nmore effectively, has the natural resources more available than we do, \none would expect they would do that which they do best. We do that \nwhich represents a natural advantage for us, and we trade back and \nforth.\n  But that is not the circumstance today. The natural economic \nadvantage these days is instead a natural political advantage. A \ncountry says, our political advantage is we will allow you to hire \nkids. We will allow you to pay 20 cents an hour. We will allow you to \ndump your chemicals into the streams and into the air, and we will \nallow you to do this in a workplace that is not required to be safe. \nThose aren't economic advantages that somehow relate to natural \nadvantages. Those are political advantages created by a government that \nsays: We will not allow people to form unions or labor to collectively \nbargain or rules against children put in factories. Those are political \njudgments and political circumstances. There is no natural economic \nadvantage there. My point is, we have to come to grips with this \ngalloping globalism. We must do that in fairness to the American worker \nand to the American businesses. To do less than that means that we \nconsign our economy to unfair competition in a dozen different areas.\n  Americans depend on us to represent our best economic interests, not \nsome notion of what the economic interest is for a corporation that \ndoes business in every country and has no special interest or \nrecognition in our economy or our economic growth or our workers.\n  I know we have a 30-hour postcloture period. Several of my colleagues \nwill want to speak on this issue. I expect they will have significant \nvotes for it today and those who vote for it will be back on the floor. \nI will be back on the floor of the Senate again with another chart, and \nwe will talk about whether it is wise for the Senate, when it discovers \nthat doing something isn't working, to continue doing it over and over \nand over again.\n  Most people learn by repetition. When you repeat something that has \nfailed, most people understand that they want to do it differently. \nThat is not the case with fast track and with our current trade policy.\n  I believe in expanded trade. I believe economies are strengthened by \nexpanded trade. I believe our economy and other economies of the world \nare strengthened by expanded trade. I don't want to put up a wall \naround our country. I am not an isolationist. But I believe very \nstrongly there needs to be voices raised demanding fair trade rules. \nWhether it is China, Japan, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Korea, or others \nwith whom we have very large trade deficits, we have a right as \nAmericans, as producers and as workers, to expect our Government \nwill represent our economic interests in demanding fair trade rules.\n\n  That has not been the case to date. I hope soon after this vote \ntoday, we will begin to see some effort on behalf of our country in \ndemanding the rules of trade keep pace with the galloping pace of \nglobal trade. That is the only thing that will be fair to American \nworkers and American companies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nsecond, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from North \nDakota. If the Senate had been in session listening and heard the \npersuasive argument made by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nand we had a vote, we would vote his way immediately because he has \npresented the case.\n  The only thing is, he has not presented the case in the stark reality \nthat it really is. We are talking to a fixed jury. As an old trial \nlawyer for some 20 years, where I made enough to afford the luxury of \nserving here, I know how to talk to a fixed jury. Specifically, the \ncontention in the trial of this case is that we have to give the \nPresident negotiating authority that cannot be amended; it is on a \ntake-it-or-leave-it basis; and that the trading nations, some, let's \nsay, 160, 170 trading countries, just will not enter into an agreement \nunless the President has fast track.\n  He doesn't want to go through the negotiation period and then find \nthat his particular trade agreement has been amended on the floor of \nthe Congress.\n  If you refer to the 2001 Trade Policy Agenda and 2000 Annual Report, \nwhich is the most recent, issued by the U.S. Trade Representative, turn \nto page 1 of the list of trade agreements. You will find, in essence, \nfive trade agreements as a result of fast track, and thereafter some \n200 agreements without fast track. The contention that you can't get an \nagreement unless you have fast track is totally absurd.\n  We have had the Tokyo round, and the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement. Incidentally, this Senator voted for that because we have \nrelatively the same standard of living. We have the labor protections. \nWe have the environmental protections. When you have a level playing \nfield, I am delighted to vote for trade, and so-called free trade. But \nnow, we have fixed trade.\n  That is what we are debating. This jury is fixed. We also had the \nUnited States-Israel trade agreement, which I also supported; NAFTA, \nwhich I opposed; and the Uruguay Round with WTO. Those are the five so-\ncalled trade agreements under fast track. But then turn the pages and \ncontinue turning, and there are some 200 trade agreements without fast \ntrack.\n  When I first got here, we had SALT I, and it was very complex. We had \nreservations and amendments on the floor of the Congress. We had a vote \non that. We didn't have fast track for SALT I and fast track for SALT \nII and fast track for the chemical weapons treaty. The contention of \nthe White House is you can't get trade agreements, but the President \nneeds to look at his own book.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is he telling me that trade agreements can be negotiated \nwithout this fast-track mechanism?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that what he is saying?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I tell the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nthey literally have almost a dozen and a half pages of all of these \nagreements, right here in the President's report, that were obtained \nwithout fast track.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought the President was saying to the country that he \nhas to have this fast-track thing that we will vote on today in order \nto negotiate trade agreements. Is the Senator from South Carolina \ntelling me he doesn't have to have that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, sir, he doesn't. I can tell you now he wants the \nfast track for the fix.\n  That is the point I want to make. I can tell you right now. Let's \nlook at the result of the so-called trade agreements. Look at 1992, and \nyou find that the Foreign Trade Barriers of the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative is 267 pages long. Oh, we had WTO, we had GATT, we \nhad NAFTA, and we did away with all the barriers. Why then is this \nyear's Foreign Trade Barriers--458 pages long?\n  Like the monkey making love to the skunk, I cannot stand any more of \nthis. I can tell you that right now. For Heaven's sake, don't give me \nany more free trade agreements or fast tracks. This would be the end of \nthe argument, if you didn't have a fixed jury. What is better proof? I \nam using the President's proof. No. 1, he doesn't need fast track and, \nwith fast track, we are actually going out of business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. What I have been hearing the administration say is that \nthis is trade promotion authority. Does the\n\n[[Page S7780]]\n\nSenator mean to tell me here in front of the eyes of the Nation, the \nears of the people, that the President doesn't need fast-track in order \nto negotiate trade agreements for the United States? Is that what the \nSenator is saying?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There is no question, Senator----\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not what the President has been saying, is it?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. You bring out the point that this is bipartisan. \nPresident Clinton said he had to have fast track for NAFTA.\n  Mr. BYRD. We didn't give it, did we?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. They said if we pass NAFTA we would get \n200,000 jobs, but we lost 700,000 textile jobs. In the State of South \nCarolina, since NAFTA, we have lost more than 54,000 jobs.\n  Now, this farm crowd, they get their $70 billion bill, and they come \nhere blinking their eyes and talking about free trade, free trade. They \nget all the subsidies and protection--the Export-Import Bank, support \npayments, and everything else of that kind--and they run away with some \n$80 billion. The poor, hard-working people, such as your mine workers \nand my textile workers--\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As the distinguished Senator from Texas always says, \nthey are pulling the wagon, paying the taxes, keeping the country \nstrong. We have removed 700,000 textile jobs alone. Akio Morita and I \nwent to a seminar in Chicago almost 20 years ago, and they were \nlecturing about the Third World countries, the emerging nations trying \nto become nation states.\n  Morita, then head of Sony, said: Wait a minute, in order to become a \nnation state, you have to develop a strong manufacturing capacity.\n  Then later, he turned and said to this Senator: Senator, the world \npower that loses its manufacturing strength will cease to be a world \npower.\n  I am worried about this country. I tell you, we have over a $412 \nbillion deficit in fiscal year 2002.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that page 1 and page 60 of \nthe Mid-Session review on the budget just issued be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Summary\n\n       When this report was published last year, the nation was in \n     the midst of a recession that, predictably, was already \n     having detrimental effects on the government's finances. What \n     no one could predict was that just 20 days later, a lethal \n     attack on America would exacerbate the recession and trigger \n     extraordinary military, homeland defense, and repair \n     expenditures that would at least temporarily make an enormous \n     difference in the fiscal outlook.\n       By the February 2002 submission of the Budget for fiscal \n     year 2003, the budgetary effects of the recession and the war \n     on terror were well understood. It was also becoming apparent \n     that the flood of revenue that produced record surpluses in \n     the late 1990s was driven both by underlying economic growth, \n     the traditionally decisive factor, and, in ways no yet fully \n     grasped, by the extraordinary boom in the stock market. The \n     markedly greater dependence of revenues on stock market \n     developments was not yet understood by experts either inside \n     or outside the government.\n       The economic recovery appears to be underway, the one-time \n     costs of recovery are being paid, and the expense of war-\n     fighting abroad and new protective resources at home have \n     been incorporated in budget plans. Taking all these changes \n     into account, the federal government is now projected to \n     spend $165 billion more than it receives in revenues in 2002, \n     up from the $106 billion projected nearly six months ago. \n     Table 1 below comparing February and July estimates shows a \n     return to the pre-recession pattern of surpluses in 2005, and \n     growing surpluses thereafter. Future improvements, however, \n     depend to a significant extent on two key factors: (1) \n     restraint of the recent rapid growth in federal spending; and \n     (2) a resumption of growth in tax payments produced by a \n     stronger economy and a stronger stock market.\n\n\n                moving forward amid the backdrop of war\n\n       President Bush placed two purposes above all others in his \n     2003 Budget: Winning the war on terror and restoring the \n     economy to health. On both fronts, initial progress has been \n     encouraging. Military action in Afghanistan has depleted the \n     ranks and greatly weakened the operational capabilities of \n     the terrorists. On the economic front, the nation's gross \n     domestic product (GDP) grew at an impressive 6.1 percent \n     annual rate in the first quarter of 2002, making the \n     recession both shorter and shallower than most and the early \n     recovery far stronger than assumed in February's budget.\n       For the future, we can be certain only of the intentions of \n     our adversaries and our own resolve to defeat them.

You and I saw the \ncorruption of the process when they brought TV cameras in here. I first \ngot here 35 years ago. If you wanted to know what was going on down on \nthe floor, you had to go down on the floor. So you always had 20, 25 \nSenators in this cloakroom, 20 Senators over in that cloakroom; and a \npoint was made that you could immediately go out and contest that \npoint. Now I stay back in my office looking at my TV. I know that is \nwrong, and I should run over to the floor. But when I get here, two \nother Senators have been waiting for an hour as the next speakers. So \nthere is no debate. The process has been corrupted, as the budget \nprocess has been corrupted.\n  Let me tell you exactly how it happened because I was chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I went over with Alan Greenspan in January of 1981 to \nbrief President Reagan on the budget. He had pledged to balance the \nbudget. He pledged, of course, tax cuts. He also pledged to balance the \nbudget in 1 year. After the briefing, he said: Oops, this is way worse \nthan I thought. It is going to take 3 years.\n  That is how we got into the 3-year budgets. And with Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, we got the 5-year budget, and now we have 10-year budgets. \nWhoopee, let's have a 20-year budget and make all kinds of happy \nprojections and re-elect ourselves. That is the corruption that has \ngone on.\n  After President Reagan came in, the Greenspan Commission issued their \nreport on Social Security, making it fiscally sound. Section 21 of the \nGreenspan Commission report said: Put Social Security off budget.\n  As a former chairman of the Budget Committee and an old-timer, I \nworked with John Heinz from Pennsylvania, and we finally got it passed. \nOn November 5, 1990, George Herbert Walker Bush--President senior \nBush--signed into law, section 13.301 that says you shall not use \nSocial Security in your budget. But we do. The President violates it, \nthe Congress violates it, and, more particularly, the media does.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is so terrific on \nhistorical reference, and I must think at this moment of President \nThomas Jefferson. When he was asked: Between a free government and a \nfree press, which would you choose? He said: I choose the latter. So \nlong as the free press tells the truth to the American people, the \nGovernment will remain free.\n  Why do they say on page 1, which we have just put into the Record, \nthe deficit is $165 billion? But on page 60, the deficit, the real debt \nwe will spend in this fiscal year, Madam President, is $412 billion \nmore than we take in. Why? Because Mitch Daniels, our Enron \naccountant--wants to fool Americans. He is more interested in rolling \nout hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for Kenny-Boy Lay.\n  Now, President Reagan, in trying to get both tax cuts and his pledge \nto balance the budget, got what he called ``unified.'' That was the \nbiggest bunch of nonsense and charade I ever saw because it was all but \nunified. He just separated out the trust funds, including Social \nSecurity, and the civil service retirement and military retirees funds. \nHe factored them out, and the next thing you know, we had unified.\n  Then, under President Clinton, we went to on-budget, off-budget, on-\nbudget, off-budget. Then to continue the charade, under President Bush, \nwe refer to it as public debt and Government debt, Government debt and \npublic debt. They confuse the public in order to get reelected. They \ntell everybody Social Security is not spent. That is exactly what the \nSecretary of the Treasury said this last Sunday. He said that under no \ncircumstance would we spend Social Security.\n  I almost went through the TV set when I heard him say:\n\n       Social Security moneys are never spent for anything except \n     Social Security. It's a red herring.\n\n  CBO has already said we will owe not $1.170 trillion, but $1.333 \ntrillion to Social Security. In fact, on page 44 of the Mid-Session \nReview you will see Mitch Daniels hides that fact. I ask unanimous \nconsent that page 44 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      TABLE 7.--BUDGET SUMMARY BY CATEGORY\n                                            [In billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007    2003-2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOutlays:\n    Discretionary\n        Defense..............................      332      371      388      408      423      437        2,028\n        Nondefense...........................      379      399      413      418      424      432        2.086\n    Subtotal, discretionary..................      711      771      801      826      847      870        4,114\n    Emergency response fund..................       36       17        8        3        2        1           30\n    Mandatory:\n        Social Security......................      453      473      494      515      538      566        2,587\n        Medicare.............................      223      232      242      260      282      307        1,324\n        Medicaid.............................      147      161      173      188      205      223          950\n        Other mandatory......................      291      305      302      307      319      323        1,556\n    Subtotal, mandatory......................    1,114    1,171    1,212    1,270    1,345    1,419        6,417\n    Net interest.............................      171      180      196      198      197      194          965\nTotal Outlays................................    2,032    2,138    2,217    2,298    2,390    2,483       11,526\nReceipts.....................................    1,867    2,029    2,169    2,351    2,451    2,567       11,567\nSurplus......................................     -165     -109      -48       53       60       84           41\n    On-budget surplus........................     -322     -282     -236     -165     -176     -171       -1,031\n    Off-budget surplus.......................      157      173      189      219      237      255        1,072\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, you will see on page 44 that the \nSocial Security moneys, to the tune of $157 billion, is spent. It shows \nit in his own document. We need to catch these fellows. That is why I \nsay the budget is corrupt.\n  Robert Kennedy, who used to sit at this desk, wrote a famous book, \n``The Enemy Within.'' I could write a book called ``Your Best Friends \nand My Best Friends.'' The best friends are the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Business Roundtable, the National Manufacturers Association, and \nthe National Federation of Independent Business. They are the enemy \nwithin for fixed trade. Yes, they want to export--export our jobs. That \nis what this is all about. Senator Byrd, over half of what we consume \nin this country is imported. Does the Senator realize that?\n  We import 56 percent of our optical goods; 80 percent of our watches; \nand 42 percent of our semiconductors. I thought we were in the age of \nhigh tech, high tech, high tech--that motor of growth, high tech, high \ntech. But we import 42 percent of our semiconductors.\n  By the way, out in Silicon Valley, they do not have health care, and \nI say to Senator Byrd, they do not have medical care. They are part-\ntime workers. My friends at Microsoft had to sue to get health care. I \nwould rather have a GE plant where they are making turbines and \nemployee make $24 an hour, than to have high tech, high tech plants, \nwhere people make $12 or $14 an hour. Don't give me this high-tech \nstuff.\n  This is all catching up with corporate America on the front pages. \nCorrupt executives are going to be indicted. The Justice Department has \ncharged some executives already, but not Kenny Boy Lay, of Enron. You \ndo not even hear about him.\n  The Commerce Committee brought the Enron and WorldCom crowds in for \nhearings. We also heard from David Freeman, of the California Power \nAuthority. I wanted to know how Kenny Boy Lay could not have heard \nabout the fraudulent pricing structure Enron had out there. I saw his \nwife on TV, who said Mr. Lay did not know anything. Mr. Freeman said he \nknew everything going on out in California, I can tell you that.\n  We have enough to bring charges. But that said, I am wondering and \nworrying about this because the fellow in charge of this, Deputy \nAttorney General Larry Thompson, used to worked at a law firm that \nrepresented Enron. And if you think we cleaned up corporate America the \nother day with the new accounting bill, we did not, because it did not \ninclude expensing stock options. We also need companies to change \nauditors every 5 years. If they do, then every 5 years you will have \nthe auditors auditing the auditors. When you know that another audit \ngroup is going to come in behind you, you do not start any tricky \nstuff. You are on trial. That is the quickest way to clean up the \nbooks.\n  I wanted to offer an amendment for that, but the leadership on both \nsides had it tabled. We have not solved that problem, but I will be \nback.\n  Back to the task at hand, we import 46 percent of our camera \nequipment; 93 percent of electrical capacitors; 55 percent of printing \nand related machinery; and already 36 percent of motor vehicles. That \nis a third of the vehicles Americans drive. Imported cars keep taking \nover the market here, they keep taking over the market. Also we import \n62 percent of our motorcycles; over 50 percent of our office machines; \n70 percent of our television sets; and 50 percent of our crude \npetroleum.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this list in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                 Import\n        Commodity                                            percentage\nOptical Goods......................................................56.5\nBall and Roller Bearing............................................28.4\nWatches............................................................80.8\nHousehold Appliances...............................................31.5\nAir Conditioning Equip.............................................23.0\nSemiconductors.....................................................51.2\nComputers, Peripherals, Parts......................................56.5\nCameras and Equipment..............................................46.8\nElectrical Capacitors..............................................93.5\nMetal Forming Machine Tools........................................46.9\nMechanical Power Transmission Equip................................36.2\nPrinting and Related Machinery.....................................55.2\nTextile Machinery..................................................58.3\nElectrical Transformers............................................51.8\nMotor Vehicles.....................................................35.6\nMotorcycles........................................................62.1\nOffice Machines....................................................50.7\nTelevisions........................................................69.2\nCrude Petroleum....................................................49.8\nSteel Mill Products................................................21.3\nElectric Motors....................................................29.8\nConsumer Electronics...............................................95.5\nTV and Radio Broadcasting..........................................86.7\nPrinted Circuits...................................................24.6\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. But don't we need this trade promotion authority? Don't we \nneed this trade promotion authority to wipe out those deficits so we \ncan start moving our goods, other than farm products and along with \nthem, too, don't we need this trade promotion authority, I say to the \nSenator? ``Trade promotion authority,'' that tells me it promotes \ntrade.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I just read a list of products, showing how the fix is \non with respect to trade. What they do is fix us. In other words, House \nmembers are elected every two years, so they have to explain their \nvotes every 2 years. In the Senate, we just have to explain our votes \nevery 6 years. So we do not have to explain too much.\n  On our side, the Finance Committee is either a bunch of oil people or \nfarmers--and that is a fix. When you get that crowd in there, they will \naccept anything with regards to trade, which they did with this \nparticular conference report.\n  Here is how they have fixed it in the past. In November of 1993, \nunder fast track, Rep. Peter King helped President Clinton organize the \nGOP supporters of NAFTA. When Rep. King went home and found the Army \nCorps of Engineers was reneging on a deal to dredge, President Clinton \nfixed the problem for him.\n\n       Lynn Martin, President Bush's Labor secretary, said that \n     ``If the president didn't make deals, they'd be saying he \n     doesn't understand Washington.''\n\n  Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which the Senator from \nWest Virginia carries in his breast pocket, says the Congress--not the \nPresident, not the Supreme Court--but the Congress shall regulate \nforeign trade.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. But here is how it is regulated. The President comes \nover and he gets this so-called fast track, which is fixed trade. So he \ngets a peanut butter deal, Durham wheat deal, orange juice deal, sugar \ndeal, cucumber deal, beef deal, winter vegetable deal, frozen food \ndeal, wine deal, and Honda auto parts deal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From USA Today, November 18, 1993]\n\n                 Wheeling, Dealing, To Assure a Victory\n\n                           (By Steve Komarow)\n\n       President Clinton couldn't get Rep. Clay Shaw's vote with a \n     highway overpass, water project or federal courthouse. Shaw's \n     demand was more personal: extradition from Mexico of the man \n     accused of raping a 4-year old girl.\n       ``I am now confident that the Mexican authorities will do \n     everything in their power to see him brought to justice,'' \n     said Shaw, R-Fla., as he announced his vote for the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement.\n       The California child, now 5, is the niece of Shaw's \n     secretary and ``just a beautiful little girl,'' he said. \n     Until NAFTA, it appeared unlikely her suspected attacker \n     would be tried.\n       Mexico doesn't send its citizens to the United States for \n     trial, despite the existence of an extradition treaty between \n     the two countries.\n       But not Mexican Attorney General Jorge Carpizo has \n     personally assured Shaw that they'll pursue Serapio Zuniga \n     Rios and, if he's captured, extradite him.\n       Shaw's deal stood out among the flurry of bargains the \n     White House struck to secure passage of NAFTA. But at least \n     ``it had something to do with Mexico,'' unlike many, said \n     colleague Jim Bacchus, D-Fla.\n       More often, they fell in the traditional category of favors \n     a president can bestow within limits of the budget.\n       The White House offered everything from presidential \n     jogging dates to road projects during its final push.\n       Opponents screamed foul.\n       ``It's obscene, this horse-trading of votes,'' said Rep. \n     John Lewis, D-Ga., a ``no'' vote.\n       ``We knew we couldn't compete. . . . We didn't have any \n     bridges to give away,'' said former representative Jim Jontz, \n     head of the anti-NAFTA Citizens Trade Campaign.\n       But the administration said it was just using whatever \n     legitimate influence it had, at a time when it might do some \n     good.\n       ``I think when we end up, there's no cost to the \n     Treasury,'' said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.\n       A sheaf of last-minute side agreements was added, and \n     promises were made to help the\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\n     wine, citrus, glass, sugar, peanut and textile industries.\n       Not only fence-sitters won concessions. The White House \n     also took care of allies.\n       Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who helped Clinton organize GOP \n     supporters of NAFTA, had gone home last weekend to find the \n     Army Corps of Engineers was reneging on a deal to dredge an \n     inlet in his Long Island district.\n       ``I was endorsing him . . . and getting screwed by the \n     administration,'' he said. ``It was a bureaucratic foul-up, \n     but it was putting me in a very awkward spot.''\n       Not for long. King called the White House, explaining his \n     predicament. ``And yesterday they faxed us a signed copy of \n     the agreement,'' he said.\n       Clinton's signature was all over Capitol Hill.\n       ``I know that peanut growers are concerned about imports of \n     peanut butter and peanut paste as well as quality,'' the \n     president intoned in a typical letter to lawmakers with \n     goober-growers in their districts.\n       Better to risk looking like a wheeler-dealer than to risk \n     losing the critical NAFTA vote. And what's so bad about a \n     little give-and-take?\n       Said Lynn Martin, President Bush's Labor secretary, on \n     Larry King Live: ``If the president didn't make deals, they'd \n     be saying he doesn't understand Washington.''\n       Quid pro quo: Who got what to win votes for the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement, President Clinton has made \n     side deals with members of Congress, promising benefits for \n     their districts--mainly protecting the prices farmers and \n     manufacturers get for their products. Some examples:\n       Peanut Butter the Deal: U.S. peanut growers claim Canada, \n     with 25% of the U.S. market, evades trade barriers by \n     processing peanuts from China and Africa. Clinton will seek \n     limits on peanut butter and paste shipments to the USA if \n     Canada doesn't cut back within 60 days.\n       Durum Wheat the Deal: U.S. producers of durum wheat, used \n     in spaghetti and macaroni, complain Canadian growers get \n     transportation subsidies. President Clinton promised talks \n     with Canada and, if talks fail, said he'd seek limits on \n     imports from Canada. Either way, the price would go up.\n       Orange Juice the Deal: Clinton would impose pre-NAFTA \n     tariffs on frozen orange juice concentrate if Mexican \n     shipments rise, pushing prices below a five-year average for \n     five straight days. Also, he'll limit tariff reductions the \n     administration would accept in free-trade talks with other \n     countries.\n       Sugar the Deal: Mexico agreed to tighten controls on sugar \n     and high fructose corn syrup exports to the USA. If the \n     ceiling is exceeded, Clinton could impose tariffs. Also, \n     Mexico pledged to prevent Mexican candymakers from using corn \n     syrup, which would have freed Mexican sugar production for \n     export.\n       Cucumbers the Deal: Clinton would impose pre-NAFTA tariffs \n     if Mexican shipments rise, pushing prices down. Also, he'll \n     limit tariff reductions the administration would accept in \n     talks with other countries.\n       Beef the Deal: New rules will keep Australian and New \n     Zealand beef from coming though Mexico by requiring shippers \n     to show where the animals were raised.\n       Winter Vegetable the Deal: Clinton pledged to diligently \n     enforce NAFTA provisions that would allow reimposition of \n     tariffs to protect against sudden import surges from Mexico \n     of tomatoes, sweet corn and peppers.\n       Frozen Food the Deal: Clinton agreed to push for ``country \n     of origin'' labeling on products like frozen broccoli. Unions \n     complains many plants in that category have moved to Mexico \n     in recent years to take advantage of Mexican vegetable \n     production and cheaper labor.\n       Wine the Deal: Clinton would open negotiations to eliminate \n     Mexico's tariffs more quickly than the 10-year phaseout NAFTA \n     specifies. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor promised a new \n     arrangement by May 1994.\n       Textiles, Clothing the Deal: Clinton promised to work \n     toward a 15-year, rather than 10-year, phaseout of American \n     textile quotas in global free-trade talks. Also, the Customs \n     Service will step up enforcement of trade quotas.\n       Honda Auto Parts the Deal: The administration added a \n     provision that will relieve Honda of paying $17 million in \n     duties on auto parts shipped from Canada to its assembly \n     plant in Ohio since 1989.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The point is the fix is in. Members get all kinds of \nfavors for their votes. I remember my good friend Jake Pickle got help \nwith a cultural center down in Texas. I remember in northern California \nthere were two golf games with President Clinton. Then there were two \nC-17s given down in Texas where they were making them, and on and on. \nMembers who vote for trade get all the favors. They have already fixed \nthis vote, and that is why you see the empty Chamber. They have made up \ntheir minds.\n  But the country is in trouble with a $412 billion fiscal deficit, and \nwe heard the figure by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. \nLast month there was a $41.5 billion trade deficit, so we are right at \na $500 billion current account deficit, with the outcome being a \nweakening of the dollar.\n  We now have high unemployment. We have a Secretary of the Treasury \nthat says everything is fine. That is nonsense. They want more tax \ncuts. They cut $1.7 trillion of the revenues and then wonder why at \nthis time last year we were talking about a 10-year $5.6 trillion \nsurplus and now we have a $412 billion deficit.\n  They try to blame that on the war. I think we ought to look at this \nparticular article about the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mitchell Daniels, on September 4, 2001--7 days before \nSeptember 11--projected for fiscal year 2001 that our government would \nhave the second largest surplus in history.\n  I have looked at the figures. Overall, 9/11 cost the government, and \nI say this to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee $31 billion. \nOf that $4 billion was during fiscal year 2001, and $27 billion in this \nfiscal year. The war did not cause the supposed surplus to disappear.\n  We have always paid for our wars, but this President comes along and \nsays we have a war on so we are going to have to run deficits, and \nincidentally the war is never going to end.\n  When we go home, Governors are struggling. Mayors are cutting back \nspending. They are having to layoff firemen and policemen. But in \nWashington, there is no tomorrow. We have a war on, so let's have some \nmore tax cuts even with a $412 billion deficit.\n  Wall Street talks about consumer confidence, but there is not \nconfidence in the Government. On Wall Street, they know those long-term \ninterest rates are bound to go up. The Government is going to crowd in \nwith its sharp elbows, borrowing the money to keep it going, crowding \nout business finance, running up the long-term interest rates. That is \nwhat is happening to the stock market. It is not another tax cut, for \nheaven's sake, that we need. The President ought to come back and go to \nwork and cut out his fund-raising, for goodness' sake.\n  We have problems in this country. The biggest problem that is \nunmentioned, except by the Senator from Minnesota, the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia and others, \nis we are spending Social Security moneys.\n  The Enron accounting did not start with Kenny Boy Lay. It started \nwith us 20 years ago. Infectious greed? No, Madam President. Infectious \nfraud, fraud on the American people.\n  I am not proud to say that, but the process has been corrupted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article in the Financial Times from \n2 days ago be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, July 30, 2002]\n\n                            Infectious Fraud\n\n       How can Americans be confident in the stock market and the \n     country when everything seems to be one grand fraud? It seems \n     as if every day another blue-chip corporation is under \n     investigation. And somebody in Washington is cooking the \n     books, when last year the US had a 10-year $5,600bn surplus \n     and this year it has an estimated $412bn deficit.\n       Enron bookkeeping started in Washington. In 1983, the \n     Greenspan commission restored the soundness of Social \n     Security with a graduated payroll tax, meant to take care of \n     the baby-boomers in this century. The commission's report \n     required surpluses from Social Security to be put in an off-\n     budget trust fund to be used for future generations. Back \n     then Reaganomics, the policy of economic growth by cutting \n     taxes, led to spending Social Security and other trust funds \n     in order to say the deficit was decreasing, while it was in \n     fact increasing.\n       President George H. W. Bush called Reaganomics ``Voodoo''. \n     Now President George W. Bush is giving us Voodoo II. This \n     Enron system of accounting hides the truth by juggling two \n     sets of books. It is like paying off one credit card with \n     another.\n       The Bush administration continues this charade by dividing \n     the budget into public debt and government debt. Both debts \n     combined constitute the total national debt. But Mr. Bush \n     talks only about the public debt (the bonds and notes America \n     issues) while hiding the government debt (the Social Security \n     and other trust funds being raided). What Mr. Bush needs to \n     talk about is the total national debt.\n       The budget committee tried to stop this charade in 1990 by \n     passing section 13301 of the Budget Act, forbidding the \n     president and the Congress from citing a budget that spends \n     Social Security. But, no matter, the president, the Congress \n     and the media--acting like Enron--violate section 13301 by \n     spending Social Security and other trust funds and \n     fraudulently reporting that they have not been spent.\n       The financial markets see this fraud. They know the \n     government will need to borrow\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\n     money, coming into the market with its sharp elbows, crowding \n     out business finance, stultifying the economy and causing \n     long-term interest rates to go up. When Ronald Reagan came \n     into office the interest cost on the national debt was $95bn. \n     By 2001 it was $359bn--so every day the government borrows \n     nearly $1bn to service the national debt. This is outrageous \n     waste. But the bigger outrage is the president, Congress and \n     the media crying foul at Enron while engaging in the same \n     type of fraud.\n       To expose this fraud, in 1989 a debt clock was erected near \n     Times Square in New York. It spins like a speedometer \n     reporting the combined public and government debt going up, \n     up and away. In 2000, when the debt started coming down, the \n     clock was turned off. But this month the government's office \n     of management and budget released numbers showing an alarming \n     amount of new red ink.\n       On page one of the mid-session review, the deficit was for \n     this fiscal year ending September 30 will hit $165bn. Of \n     course, this is the ``Enron figure'' the government hopes \n     everyone will use, not the real number. On the last page of \n     the report readers can find that this year's true deficit is \n     $412bn, of which only $27bn is due to September 11. The debt \n     clock has been turned on again.\n       The true story of today's economic downfall began with \n     candidate Bush in 2000. He stated that his first order of \n     business as president would be to cut taxes. In office, Mr. \n     Bush told the nation that not only was there enough money for \n     a tax cut; there would also be money left over to pay down \n     the debt, to protect Social Security and Medicare, and \n     $1,000bn for any special needs. The dam really broke in \n     January 2001 when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal \n     Reserve, in a fit of irrational exuberance, cautioned that \n     surpluses were growing too fast and we were paying down too \n     much debt. With this blessing of tax cuts, Wall Street \n     started selling. And in less than four months, we went from a \n     $2bn surplus in June 2001, when the tax cut was passed, to a \n     $143bn deficit on September 30 last year. Less than $4bn of \n     this was because of September 11.\n       In the 1990s, when we were paying down the debt with \n     spending cuts and tax increases, America had eight years of \n     the best economic growth in history. Mr. Bush's $1,700bn tax \n     cut has put the country into the ditch.\n       The president says we should not worry about deficits while \n     there is a war on. There is no end to the war and he calls \n     for more tax cuts. This requires further government invasion \n     into the market, so the market stays on edge.\n       The US should freeze next year's budget at this year's \n     levels, with the exception of defense and homeland security; \n     cancel the tax cuts; and start, once again, paying down the \n     debt. If Americans want to regain confidence in the stock \n     market and in the country they should know the problem is \n     infectious fraud, not infectious greed.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Here's another headline from July 31, ``Automakers Get \nEven More Mileage From The Third World. Low Cost Plants Abroad Start To \nSupply Home Markets As Quality Picks Up Steam.'' And this one from the \nLos Angeles Times, ``High-paid Jobs Latest U.S. Export.'' That is what \nwe are exporting. That is what the people ought to be reading.\n  Understand that we are going out of business. Productivity is high, \nyes, of what we produce, but we are not producing anything. We are \ngiving fast food to each other and going the way of England. At the end \nof World War II, they said, do not worry, instead of a nation of brawn, \nwe will be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products, we will \nprovide services. We have heard that ``service economy wag'' in this \nChamber. Instead of creating finances, we will handle it and be the \nfinancial center. They have the haves and the have-nots, and a bunch of \nscandal sheets and debating Parliamentarians. We are going the way of \nEngland. We are going out of business and nobody wants to talk about it \nbecause we have the campaign; we have lunch coming along.\n  I remind everybody what made this country great. It was in the \nearliest days--and this has to be included in the Record--under our \nFounding Fathers. The British said to our little fledgling colony, now \nthat you have won your freedom, what you ought to do is trade back to \nthe mother country what you produce best and the mother country will \ntrade back what it produces best.\n  We were saved by Alexander Hamilton, who helped write the papers, his \nreport on manufacturers. It is too much, I believe, to put in the \nRecord, but in a line, he told the British, ``bug off.'' He said, we \nare not going to remain your colony, importing the finished goods and \njust exporting our timber, our coal, our iron, our ore, our farm \nproducts. We are going to become a strong economy, a nation state.\n  The first bill was the seal of the United States of America, and the \nsecond bill on July 4, 1789, was a tariff bill, protectionism. These \nchildren run around on the floor hollering, ``protectionism, \nprotectionism.'' They do not know how the country was built. They have \nno idea of history, no sense of accomplishment. We did not pass the \nincome tax until 1913. We built this strong United States of America \nwith protectionism, tariffs.\n  Fast forward 100 years to Teddy Roosevelt, and Edmund Morris' book \n``Theodore Rex.'' We ought look at the turn of the century when old \nTeddy came in. The United States was already so rich in goods and \nservices that she was more self-sustaining than any industrial power in \nhistory.\n  We are not today by any manner or means. We do not have a strong \neconomy by any manner or means. Tell the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n       Back then, we consumed only a fraction of what we produced. \n     The rest went overseas at prices other exporters found hard \n     to match. As Andrew Carnegie said, the ``Nation that makes \n     the cheapest steel has other nations as its feet.'' More than \n     half of the world's cotton, corn, copper, and oil, flowed \n     from the American cornucopia, and at least one-third of all \n     steel, iron, silver, and gold did, too. The excellence of her \n     manufactured products, guaranteed her dominance of world \n     markets. That was in the early 1900s.\n       I went to New York recently on Amtrak's Acela. It is a \n     train made in Canada. When I arrived at the station, the dogs \n     that sniffed me were from Czechoslovakia. We are even \n     importing the dogs. We don't have anything Made In America \n     around here, other than a few politicians. I wish newspapers \n     and politicians could be produced overseas. If they were, we \n     could straighten this country out overnight, I can tell you \n     that right now.\n\n  Senator Wellstone, before you would be able to open up Wellstone \nManufacturing, you would have to have for your employees a minimum \nwage, clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, plant closing \nnotice, parental leave, safe working place, safe machinery--on and on \nand on. Then the plant next door says: Wait a minute. I can go down to \nMexico and pay workers 58 cents an hour and have to do none of that. \nAnd they go. Unless you follow, you will go broke.\n  The job policy in the Senate today is to export and get rid of jobs. \nI remember when Sam Ervin stood at that desk and we added $5 billion \nfor highway construction in the 1970s to create jobs that were needed.\n  Now, instead of creating jobs, we come in and have a welfare reform \nbill. They stand in the well and pride themselves, look, we have \nextended payments for unemployment; we are offering a little bit more \nfor health care. They do not talk about creating jobs anymore. They \npresent this as a welfare reform bill. I don't want welfare reform. I \nneed to hold on to my job.\n  What happens to the some 54,000 textile workers in South Carolina? \nWashington said: Go global. Be like Mao Tse-tung and reeducate them if \nthey lose their jobs. In my state, the mills that made the T-shirts, \nthey get closed down. They had 487 employees. The average age was 47 \nyears.\n\n  The Senate said: Let's retrain them for high tech. And tomorrow \nmorning we have 487 expert computer operators. Are you going to hire a \n47-year-old expert computer operator and take on their retirement costs \nand their health costs? Or are you going to hire a 21-year-old?\n  We brought in BMW to South Carolina, but we still have empty towns \nback home. A couple years ago, we had 3.2 percent unemployment. Now \nit's over 6 percent. In some counties, it is over 10 percent \nunemployment, and we have lost 54,000 textile jobs alone. There you go.\n  I regret the corruption and the fix. You talk about accounting \ncorruptions, option corruptions; you talk about job corruptions. They \ncould care less about the jobs. I can go right down, article after \narticle, where the recovery will not reach.\n  We have corrupted the financial and fiscal affairs of the Nation. We \nhave corrupted the economic base all on the premise that we need fast \ntrack because trade issues are very complex; whereas, one more time, \nSenator, I don't believe you were here, but in my hand is the trade \npolicy agenda of the President of the United States, issued by the U.S. \nTrade Representative. To negotiate five trade agreements the President \nhad fast track authority: Tokyo, NAFTA, U.S.-Canada, U.S.-Israel, the \nUruguay, or WTO. But the next dozen pages contain some 200\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\ntrade treaties and agreements that have been entered into without fast \ntrack. They can do it, but we are in the hands of the Philistines, \nunless we can get corporate America to pull in its hold.\n  I do see a minor sign of hope. General Electric said they would start \nexpensing their stock options. This is very different than the way GE's \nJack Welch ran the place. I have the record here and his particular \narticle I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Dec. 6, 1999]\n\n                       Welch's March to the South\n\n                          (By Aaron Bernstein)\n\n       One of General Electric Co. CEO John F. Welch's favorite \n     phrases is ``squeeze the lemon,'' or wring out costs to \n     maintain the company's stellar profits. In the past year, the \n     lemon-squeezing at GE has been as never before. In a new, \n     superaggressive round of cost-cutting, the company is now \n     demanding deep price cuts from its suppliers. To help them \n     meet the stiff goals, several of GE's business units--\n     including aircraft engines, power systems, and industrial \n     systems--have been prodding suppliers to move to low-cost \n     Mexico, where the industrial giant already employs 30,000 \n     people. GE even puts on ``supplier migration'' conferences to \n     help them make the leap.\n       GE's hard-nosed new push could spark other companies to \n     emulate its tactics. The supplier crackdown is reminiscent of \n     a similar attempt by former General Motors Corp. parts czar \n     Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. His efforts largely failed \n     in the face of stiff supplier resistance. But if GE succeeds, \n     other companies could be inclined to try again. GE officials \n     at headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., say the business units \n     are simply carrying out Welch's larger campaign to globalize \n     all aspects of the company. Says Rick Kennedy, a spokesman at \n     GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE): ``We're aggressively asking for \n     double-digit price reductions from our suppliers. We have to \n     do this if we're going to be part of GE. ``GE's efforts to \n     get suppliers to move abroad come just as World Trade \n     Organization ministers start gathering in Seattle on Nov. 30. \n     That timing could help make the GE moves an issue at the \n     talks, where critics will be pointing to just such \n     strategies--and the resulting loss of U.S. jobs to low-wage \n     countries--as the inevitable fruit of unregulated trade. GE's \n     14 unions hope to make an example in Seattle of the company's \n     supplier policy, arguing that its paving the way for a new \n     wave of job shifts. They plan to send dozens of members to \n     march with a float attacking Welch. PALTRY WAR CHEST. The \n     campaign by GE's unions, which bargain jointly through the \n     Coordinated Bargaining Committee (CBC), is also the opening \n     salvo of bargaining talks over new labor contracts to replace \n     those expiring next June. Because GE's unions are weak--fully \n     half of their 47,000 members at the company belong to the \n     nearly bankrupt International Union of Electronic workers \n     (IUE)--they'll have a hard time mounting a credible strike \n     threat. Instead, the CBC is planning a public campaign to tar \n     Welch's image. They plan to focus on likely job losses at GE \n     suppliers. The unions also suspect that GE may move even more \n     unionized GE jobs to Mexico and other countries once it has \n     viable supplier bases in place. ``GE hasn't moved our jobs to \n     Mexico yet because our skilled jobs are higher up the food \n     chain,'' says Jeff Crosby, president of IUE Local 201 at GE's \n     Lynn (Mass.) jet-engine plant. ``But once they have \n     suppliers there, GE can set up shop, too.'' His members \n     from parts supplier Ametek Inc. picketed the plant on Nov. \n     19 to protest GE's pressure on Ametek to move to \n     Monterrey, Mexico.\n       Although it has never openly criticized Welch before, the \n     AFL-CIO is jumping into the fray this time. Federation \n     officials have decided that Welch's widely admired status in \n     Corporate America has lent legitimacy to a model of business \n     success that they insist is built on job and wage cuts. \n     ``Welch is keeping his profit margins high by redistributing \n     value from workers to shareholders, which isn't what U.S. \n     companies should be doing,'' charges Ron Blackwell, the AFL-\n     CIO's director of corporate affairs. Last year, the AFL-CIO \n     proposed a bold plan to spend some $25 million on a massive \n     new-member recruitment drive at GE, but the IUE wasn't \n     willing to take the risk. So the federation is backing the \n     new, less ambitious campaign that focuses on traditional \n     tactics like rallies and protests. STRONG TIDE. GE's U.S. \n     workforce has been shrinking for more than a decade as Welch \n     has cut costs by shifting production and investment to lower-\n     wage countries. Since 1986, the domestic workforce has \n     plunged by nearly 50%, to 163,000, while foreign employment \n     has nearly doubled, to 130,000 (chart, page 74). Some of this \n     came from businesses GE sold, but also from rapid expansion \n     in Mexico, India, and other Asian countries. Meanwhile, GE's \n     union workforce has shriveled by almost two-thirds since the \n     early 1980s, as work was relocated to cheaper, nonunion \n     plants in the U.S. and abroad.\n       Welch's supplier squeeze may accelerate the trend. In his \n     annual pep talk to GE's top managers in Boca Raton, Fla., \n     last January, he again stressed the need to globalize \n     production to remain cost-competitive, as he had done in \n     prior years. But this time, he also insisted that GE prod \n     suppliers to follow suit. Several business units moved \n     quickly to do so, with GEAE among the most aggressive. This \n     year, GEAE has held what it calls ``supplier migration'' \n     conferences in Cincinnati, near the unit's Evendale (Ohio) \n     headquarters, and in Monterey, where an aerospace industrial \n     park is going up.\n       At the meetings, GEAE officials told dozens of suppliers \n     that it wants to cut costs up to 14%, according to documents \n     about the Monterrey meeting at Paoli (Pa.)-based Ametek, \n     whose aerospace unit makes aircraft instruments. The internet \n     report, a copy of which Business Week obtained, says: ``GE \n     set the tone early and succinctly: `Migrate or be out of \n     business; not a matter of if, just when. This is not a \n     seminar just to provide information. We expect you to move \n     and move quickly.' '' Says William Burke, Ametek's vice-\n     president for investor relations: ``GE has made clear its \n     desire that its suppliers move to Mexico, and we are \n     evaluating that option. We have a long relationship with GE, \n     and we want to preserve it.''\n       GEAE officials argue that heightened competition leaves \n     them no choice. Jet engines sell for less than they did four \n     years ago, says Kennedy, the unit's spokesman. Almost all \n     GEAE's profits have come from contracts to maintain engines \n     already sold. And that business is getting tougher, with \n     rivals such as United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney \n     laying off thousands of workers to slash costs. ``This \n     company is going to make its net income targets, and to do \n     it, we will have to take difficult measures,'' says Kennedy.\n       Still, even some suppliers don't see the Mexico push as \n     justified. They point out that GEAE's operating profit has \n     soared by 80% since 1994, to $1.7 billion on sales of $10.3 \n     billion. GE, they argue, is leading the cost cuts. ``It's \n     hard to give away 5% or 10% to a company making so much money \n     when most of the suppliers are marginally profitable,'' says \n     Barry Bucher, the CEO and founder of Aerospace International \n     Materials, a $30 million distributor of specialty metals in \n     Cincinnati. Nonetheless, Bucher says he's looking into a \n     joint venture in Mexico in response to the demands from GE, \n     his top customer.\n       The unions, for their part, worry that GEAE will follow in \n     the footsteps of GE's appliance unit. To remain competitive \n     in that low-skilled, low-margin industry, GE Appliances has \n     slashed its workforce nearly in half at its Appliance Part \n     facility in Louisville, to some 7,500 today. Much of the work \n     has been relocated to a joint venture in Mexico. Union \n     leaders have tried to stave off further job shifts by \n     offering concessions. In early November, the company agreed \n     to a $200 million investment in Louisville in exchange for \n     productivity improvements and lump-sum payments instead of \n     wage hikes for its members. ``We hope GE will see this as a \n     solution they can adopt in jet engines and elsewhere,'' says \n     IUE President Edward L. Fire.\n       Labor's new campaign may embarrass Welch and even prompt GE \n     to tone down its demands on suppliers. But it won't rebuild \n     the union's clout at the bargaining table the way a serious \n     organizing drive might have done. Until that happens, Welch \n     probably has little to fear from his restive unions.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just two years ago Mr. Welch met with his suppliers and \nsaid to them: you will have to go overseas in order to make it. Unless \nyou move to Mexico and cut your costs, you will not be a supplier of \nGE. Then he held seminars around the country for all the suppliers \nsaying: Get out of the country, get out of the country, get out of the \ncountry.\n  Now, unless these industrial leaders gain a conscience and quit \ntelling all the suppliers they have to go to Mexico or China; and quit \ntelling their board of directors they have to go to Bermuda to avoid \ntaxes, we are going to be in serious trouble. They need to help us \nrebuild the industrial strength of the United States of America.\n  But we are in a fix. The debate in the Senate is controlled. We \nalready have cloture. People are ready to go home and pass over the \nresponsibility.\n  Senator Helms could not be here. But he and I wanted to get that \nprinting, dyeing, and finishing provision in the Caribbean trade bill. \nThey didn't want to do it. They had plenty of time to do it, but the \nBush administration said: We can fix this and get the vote of the \nCongressman from Greenville--which they did. And he voted again for \nfast track. But now that we have the fast track he voted for, what we \nwanted for printing, dyeing, and finishing is out. It has gone to \nAndean countries.\n  When I was Governor of South Carolina, we had a contest for the \nslogan of an insurance company, Capital Life. We said:\n\n       Capital Life will surely pay, if the small print on the \n     back don't take it away. That was the winning slogan, and \n     that is what we have in Washington.\n\n  They have won out. We have lost the blooming stuff. They fixed the \njury here, and they are all getting fattened up in order to win the \nnext election.\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nBut on how to win the economy and save this country--there is no \ninterest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, before the Senator from South \nCarolina leaves, I want him to know that normally I ask unanimous \nconsent to follow and normally I might have gone back to the office and \ndone some other things. But there are a few Senators I like to come out \non the floor and listen to. The Senator from South Carolina is one of \nthem.\n  He is the opposite of sterile and plastic and scripted and rehearsed. \nHe is colorful, but, frankly, and more importantly, he is prophetic and \nhe is right. In my years in the Senate, which is going on 12, there is \nnot another Senator for whom I have greater respect. I mean that as \nsincerely as I can say it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator. He is overgenerous \nto me. But I am trying to follow you and our hero, Senator Humphrey.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, building on the comments of the \nSenator from South Carolina, I really feel sorry for working people \nright now in our country. I just think they are getting pounded. I \nbelieve ordinary citizens are just getting pounded. For example, take \nQwest workers in Minnesota. When Arthur Levitt was the Chair of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission several years ago, he tried to put \ninto effect a rule that would have dealt with this conflict of interest \nsituation. The Senator from South Carolina talked about this a few \nminutes ago. It would have prohibited the Arthur Andersens of the world \nfrom raking it in on these consulting contracts when they do an \nindependent audit. He was stopped by too many Members of the House and \nSenate. But he did get a rule put into effect that they at least had to \ndisclose their contracts.\n  With Qwest, as it turns out, in the year 2001 and 2002, by first a 6-\nto-1 ratio and then in 2002 a 8-to-1 ratio, Arthur Andersen was getting \nall kinds of money from these consulting contracts. I am not even sure \nwhat they did for all this money--6-to-1 to the actual money they got \nfor the independent audit. So you know you don't bite the hand that \nfeeds you. They didn't do an independent audit. And all of a sudden we \nfind out Qwest was short quite a bit of money.\n  Above and beyond that--I am just going to give this context--above \nand beyond that, the management of Qwest tells the workers and the \ninvestors--a lot of little people are investors--we have had this \ncompany audited. Our auditing company wants to be clear with you that \nwe have had this independent audit that we can vouch for, so on and so \nforth. But it turns out at the same time the actual audit committee did \nnot say that. They actually do not say that they can, with 100-percent \nassurance, say this is a completely independent audit.\n  At the same time that this is being said, the CEOs are dumping some \nof their stock. And at the same time, too much of the workers' pension \nplan is invested in stock in the company, trying to be loyal workers, \nand they are locked in, and no one is helping them out. Now you have a \nlot of people out of work and, in addition, they have seen a lot of \ntheir pension plan eroded in value.\n  That is the story of a lot of people in the country who are not part \nof lobbying coalitions in Washington, not big investors, not heavy \nhitters, not well connected. I really feel sorry for working people. \nFrankly, I think this piece of legislation is yet another example of \npounding a lot of regular people--regular people, ordinary citizens. I \ndon't mean it in a pejorative sense, I mean it in a positive way.\n  One good thing that came out of conference is that there are some \nadditional health care benefits for some of our older steelworkers--\nsome of our retirees, some of our older steelworkers. That is good. But \nas I look at what happened in this conference committee, this bill is \ninfinitely worse. This trade promotion authority bill is infinitely \nworse than when it left the Senate.\n  There was the Dayton-Craig amendment. I am very proud of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mark Dayton, for his work, so that any Senator would \nhave been allowed to raise a point of order to any part of the trade \nagreement that would weaken U.S. trade remedy laws such as section 201, \nsaying: Look, we are not going to give up our right to protect working \npeople. If you have a trade agreement that basically undercuts our \ntrade remedy laws, we are not just going to forfeit our responsibility \nto come out here on the floor and challenge that. We have to represent \npeople back in our States.\n  That passed in the Senate but was taken out of the conference report. \nI wonder why.\n  Then my colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, who has such passion \nabout the exploitation of children, working God knows how many hours a \nday for so little wages--he had language that would have prohibited the \nuse of exploitative child labor among our trading partners. That was \ntaken out of the conference report.\n  I had an amendment that said our trading partners ought to respect \nhuman rights--would respect human rights. That was taken out of the \nconference report.\n  I had another amendment that said: Let's do a real jobs impact \nanalysis. Let's really find out what is going on. Sometimes ignorance \nis not random and people don't want to know what they don't want to \nknow.\n  Recently the Economic Policy Institute noted:\n\n       NAFTA has contributed to rising income inequality, \n     suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened \n     collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions \n     and reduced fringe benefits.\n\n  We are talking about a net total of 3 million actual and potential \njobs lost in the U.S. economy from 1994 to now. But the provision I had \nin the legislation was also taken out in conference.\n  This administration is gung ho on commercial property rights. They \nwant to make sure they are fully protected in our trade agreements. \nThis administration is gung ho on all the big financial institutions \nand all the big multinational corporations. That is where they raise \ntheir money. A lot of the key positions in the administration come from \nthis background. A lot of their task forces are disproportionately made \nup of such people--you name it. They are gung ho when it comes to the \ncommercial property rights of multinationals and big financial \ninstitutions. But when it comes to labor, when it comes to \nenvironmental, when it comes to human rights, they are nowhere to be \nfound. I think that is wrong. I think it is profoundly wrong. And I \nthink it is tragic that so many Democrats are not out here on the floor \nfighting for these rights.\n  I think the vast majority of people in Minnesota and the vast \nmajority of people in the country would say we do not want to put walls \nup at our border. I get so angry at the charge: You are an \nisolationist. My father was born in Odessa, fled persecution in Russia, \nspoke 10 languages fluently. I grew up in a home that made me, by \ndefinition, an internationalist. My mother's family was from Ukraine. \nShe was a cafeteria worker. I grew up in a family that emphasized that \nwe live in a world and we ignore that world at our peril, and also \nemphasized being there for working people.\n  That is not the question. The question is whether or not we have \ntrade agreements that respect basic human rights, that lead with our \nvalues as Americans, and that focus on promoting democracy. If we, as a \ncountry, can't promote democracy and human rights, who are we? That \nreally protects little children, and says it is wrong to have a 9-year-\nold working 19 hours a day for 30 cents hour; that also says there \nshould be environmental standards; there should be fair trade; do not \nput our workers in the position of when they try to organize or do \norganization and bargain collectively for better wages for their \nfamilies, companies say, no, we are leaving, we are going to Mexico. \nWhen those workers try to organize, companies say no, we are going to \nleave and go to South Korea, or Indonesia. Then those companies say to \nthose countries, if you should pass any legislation that would give \nworkers the right to organize, or have environmental standards, or have \nchild labor standards, we will not invest in your country.\n  Where are the values that promote the good standard of living for \nfamilies in our country and families in the developing countries as \nwell?\n  There was a Washington Post piece entitled ``Worked Till They Drop: \nFew\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\nProtections for China's New Laborers.'' The article is heartbreaking. \nIt tells of the death of Li Chunmei. I quote:\n\n       Coworkers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 \n     hours, running back and forth inside the Bainan Toy Factory, \n     carrying toy parts from machine to machine. When the quitting \n     bell finally rang shortly after midnight, her young face was \n     covered with sweat.\n       This was the busy season, before Christmas, when orders \n     peaked from Japan and the United States for the factory's \n     stuffed animals. Long hours were mandatory, and at least two \n     months had passed since Li and the other workers had enjoyed \n     even a Sunday off.\n       ``Lying on her bed that night, starting at the bunk above \n     her, the slight 19-year old complained she felt worn out, her \n     roommates recalled. Finally the lights went out. Her \n     roommates had already fallen asleep when Li started coughing \n     up blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours later, \n     curled up on the floor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding \n     from her nose and mouth. Someone called an ambulance, but she \n     died before she arrived.''\n       The article goes on to say that what happened to Li ``is \n     described by family and friends and co-workers as an example \n     of what China's more daring newspapers call guolaosi. (GO-\n     LAO-SI). The phrase means ``overwork death,'' and usually \n     applies to young workers who suddenly collapse and die after \n     working exceedingly long hours, day after day.\n\n  Can't we with our trade policy lead with our values? Can't we promote \nhuman rights? Can't we protect children? Can't we promote protection of \nthe environment? Can't we protect the rights of working people to \norganize and bargain collectively?\n  I could read from the State Department report in country after \ncountry after country--in Colombia, there are so many examples of \nworkers who have been murdered for trying to join a union; same sort of \ncoercive practices that workers in Mexico have experienced for years. \nCertainly that is the case in China. And the list goes on and on.\n  I believe that most Americans believe trade policy should be about \npromotion of human rights. Trade policy should be about respect for \nhuman rights. Trade policy should be about promoting a decent \nfundamentally good standard of living for Americans as well as our \nbrothers and our sisters in other countries as well.\n  What this piece of legislation says to me, as a Senator from the \nState of Minnesota, is that I have to forgo my constitutional rights to \nrepresent people in my State. When I see a trade agreement that \noverturns or overrides consumer protection in Minnesota, environmental \nprotection in Minnesota, and workers' rights in Minnesota, I don't have \nthe right to come out here and challenge that? I don't have the right \nto come out here with an amendment?\n  I didn't vote to give fast-track authority to President Clinton, and \nI am certainly not going to vote to give fast-track authority to \nPresident Bush. I will say it on the line. I have seen what this \nadministration has done with repetitive stress injury. I have seen the \nway in which they overturned an important rule to protect people. I \nhave seen what they have done when it comes to practically nothing by \nway of making safer workplaces for people. I have seen what they have \ndone which amounts to practically nothing when it comes to mine safety \nissues. I have seen what they have done in trying to go after \nprevailing wages. I have seen what they have done in terms of one \nantilabor initiative after another. I have seen what they have done \nwhen it comes to a lack of commitment to people being able to organize \nand bargain collectively and labor law reform.\n  Frankly, I wouldn't for anything in the world give away my right to \nrepresent Minnesota and to represent workers and to represent unions. I \nam a proud labor Senator. I am a proud Senator who represents working \npeople. You want to know something else. The best thing is there are a \nlot of people in the business sector who feel the same way.\n  I think exports are so critically important to our economy and very \nimportant to Minnesota. We do really well. I think imports are good \nbecause imports mean our companies have to compete. We should have that \ncompetition.\n  The only thing I want to see is some rules that go with this new \nglobal economy. I want to see fair trade. I want to see a global \neconomy that does more than just promote the interests of multinational \ncorporations. I want to see a global economy that promotes the \nenvironment. I want to see a global economy that promotes human rights. \nI want to see a global economy that promotes democracy. I want to see a \nglobal economy that protects the interests of working families in \nMinnesota and all across the country.\n  That is what I speak for. That is what I fight for. That is what I \nbelieve in. That is why I believe that this piece of legislation, which \nwill pass overwhelmingly, is so profoundly wrong and so profoundly \nmistaken.\n  I feel sorry for working families today. They are getting pounded. I \nthink we should do a better job of representing them.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today a number of the minority held \na press conference. I have not spoken to Senator Daschle, but I know \nwhat took place at that press conference. It was all directed toward \nTom Daschle. I think it was so unfair what they did.\n  They went to some printer and got a little thing printed up, and they \npassed this out to the press as a progress report on what has happened \nin the Senate.\n  Of course, they selectively picked some things that are not totally \ncompleted at this time. But it is interesting how they did this. For \nexample, they talked about judicial nominations. I talked to Senator \nLeahy yesterday. I think we have done 73, or something like that, \njudicial nominations--way ahead of what has ever been done before. We \nhave a batch of them we are going to do today.\n  They complained about the Defense appropriations conference, that it \nis incomplete. We just finished the bill yesterday, Mr. President, in \nrecord time. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye did this in record \ntime. The largest Defense bill in the history of the world, and we \ncompleted it yesterday in record time.\n  Homeland security, we have worked out an arrangement that we are \ngoing to go to that immediately when we return. The minute we get back \nhere there will be a debate on that and we will be on the bill on \nWednesday, the second day we are back.\n  Prescription drugs, they criticize Senator Daschle for not doing \nsomething on prescription drugs. I will tell you, that takes a lot of \nnerve, a lot of nerve, because we all know that there was, first, the \nGraham-Miller, and then we tried to do something less than that to try \nto develop a consensus here. I mean, we spent almost 3 weeks on that \nbill.\n  So I guess the best offense, in their mind, is what you do when you \nare on the defensive--energy, complaining about that.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that in addition to this ``progress \nreport'' that they made, a ``report card'' to the majority leader, one \nof the things we picked up, as they were hurrying out of there--because \nsome, of course, are going to go away to the beach this summer, or at \nleast part of the time--and we found--it just happened to fall out--a \nlist of what they are going to be reading this summer.\n  I don't know, I guess, in a rush to get out of here, someone from the \nminority side must have dropped their required reading assignment for \nthis summer. But in the interest of making sure all are aware of these \nreading assignments, I would like to read a list of books the GOP \nleadership has assigned to its caucus.\n  The first isn't a bestseller yet, but it possibly could be. It is \ncalled: ``Paying U.S. Taxes is for Suckers: A Guide to Offshore Banking \nin the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.''\n  Another book is: ``Grapes of Wrath 2002: How to Let Medicare Wither \non the Vine.''\n  Another book that I am fascinated with--I think I will take a look at \nit--is: ``See No Evil, Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil: Economic Leadership \nfor the Enron Era.''\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\n  A book: ``Master of the Senate Republicans: How Drug Company Cash \nKilled the Prescription Drug Benefit,'' or one that should be pretty \nexciting is: ``Drilling Our Way to a Cleaner Environment,'' or ``Sea \nDick Run . . . From Haliburton Accounting,'' or ``The Art of Timely \nSelf-Promotion by Harvey Pitt (includes a foreward on securing non \nmilitary burial rights at Arlington Cemetery).''\n\n  Another, Mr. President, is: ``How to Succeed in Business Without \nReally Earning: The Inside Story of [the] Harkin Energy [Company].''\n  And then the final book they put on the list--I am not sure the order \nis appropriate--is called: ``Someone to Watch Over You: The John \nAshcroft Story.''\n  In all seriousness, Mr. President, everyone can play these games \nabout what has not been accomplished, what has been accomplished. But \nwe have really worked hard to try to come up with legislation, and we \nhave done a lot. People have to understand how much we have been able \nto accomplish. The country, the people of Missouri, Georgia, Nevada, \nall over this country, should be proud of the work we have done.\n  The rules in the Senate were not developed yesterday. They have been \nhere for more than 200 years. I have to tell you, it is hard. I served \nin the House of Representatives. The Presiding Officer served in the \nState legislature in Georgia, was Governor of the State of Georgia. The \nrules are not the same.\n  For example, Mr. President, the State of Nevada met on Monday, a \nspecial session of the Nevada State Legislature, called by the \nGovernor. Why? Because we have, in the State of Nevada, a medical \nmalpractice problem. And, you know, they handle it in the State of \nNevada where it should be handled. And they did. They finished at 4:15 \nthis morning. They now have, for the Governor to sign as soon as he \nwakes up this morning, the bill. We have a new medical malpractice law \nin the State of Nevada. But they did it in 3\\1/2\\ days. Here that would \ntake 3\\1/2\\ weeks. But that is the way it is.\n  The U.S. Senate has these rules, but we have been able to do a lot. I \nrepeat, our country can take pride in what we have done.\n  Let me talk about a few things: Antiterrorism use of force \nresolution; immediate $40 billion response to terrorist attacks; \ndefense/homeland security appropriations, significant ones; \nsupplemental Defense appropriations; the United States Patriot Act; \nairport, border, and port security; terrorism insurance, which we \npassed out of here--it was tough; we finally got a conference report on \nthat--support for the airline industry; economic stimulus, which \nincluded unemployment insurance.\n  We passed a Patients' Bill of Rights; corporate and auditing \naccountability, the Sarbanes bill; greater access to affordable \nprescription drugs. We worked so hard on that, Mr. President. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, we did not get everything we wanted, but we \npassed something dealing with generic drugs, dealing with giving the \nStates help that they need so badly with their medical problems. That \nis all in this bill we passed yesterday. In that bill was prescription \ndrug reimportation to reduce costs. Fiscal relief to States is in \nthere. I have just talked about that. The trade bill, some like that a \nlot. It is going to pass sometime today.\n  We have had campaign finance reform; election reform, as I have \nmentioned, judicial confirmations; clean water and brownfields \nrevitalization.\n  This brownfields bill is so important. We learned that we could not \ncompletely revamp and renovate and change Superfund legislation, but we \nlearned there are things we could do. There are brownfields sites, \nindustrialized sites in our States that are not really in bad shape. \nMaybe they had a dry cleaning establishment there.\n  Under the brownfields legislation, we can come in and take care of \nthat. It is happening all over the country. In Nevada alone it is going \nto create thousands of new jobs, some of them at shopping centers where \nwe had dry cleaning establishments and lenders stayed away. They didn't \nwant the Superfund liability. We took care of that with this \nlegislation.\n  There was education reform; that certainly was done. We passed the \nenergy bill; that is now in conference. I am a member of the \nconference, chaired by Mr. Tauzin of Louisiana. We finished all the \nsecondary items this week. As soon as we get back, the first week, we \nwill see if we can work our way through that. I believe we can.\n  We passed a huge farm bill that was so difficult but so important, \nespecially for various sectors of our country. Then we passed the \nDefense authorization. And we will pass, in just a little while, the \nlargest appropriations bill in the history of the world.\n  We have done a lot. I don't think we need to talk about Tom Daschle's \nreport card. He has done a good job. He has been a magnificent leader.\n  I wish we wouldn't do this. It is not good for the whole body \npolitic. It does not help. Tom Daschle is somebody who is respected. \nWhy? Because he is a quick learner. He is totally ethical. He works \ntireless hours. He tries to be fair to everybody. We don't need this \nkind of stuff. We don't need these readings lists.\n  Anybody who comes out here and slaps around Tom Daschle, I will slap \nback. They can have the report cards. They can have all their progress \nreports they want. I will come back. I am not going to let these \nscurrilous attacks on a fine man go unanswered. If they don't want to \nhear about their reading list, then leave Tom Daschle alone. If there \nis something they don't like that is going on, do it right here. This \nis the place to do it, where we can have a good debate and go on to \nsomething else. I hope we can do that.\n  These were not Democratic accomplishments alone, although I will take \ncredit for what we have done. But we have been able to do them because \nyou don't do anything here alone. We have passed these. We should be \nproud of this. It is good for the country. We don't need any more of \nthis.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes for the purpose of introducing a \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I ask unanimous consent that the time used be counted \nagainst my hour postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Carnahan pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2842 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I see a Senator on the other side who is \nprepared to speak. Does he wish to speak immediately? What is his \nsituation?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to speak on TPA at \nsometime during the debate for around 7 to 10 minutes. But the senior \nSenator from West Virginia was in the Chamber preceding me, so I will \nrecognize his attendance here and his seniority.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. He would need 7 minutes?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is approximately the amount of time I would \nspeak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, ordinarily I would suggest that the Senator \ntake his 7 minutes now. My speech is probably going to be 45 minutes or \nlonger, and I understand there is a vote scheduled for 2 o'clock; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 2 o'clock, we will consider the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is not a vote at that point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Mr. President, I have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have an hour under the cloture motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will try to do it in around 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield for no more than 7 minutes on his time, but I \nretain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I \nwant to talk about trade promotion authority, and I appreciate very \nmuch the Senator's graciousness.\n  I met yesterday with members of the administration at the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's office in the Department of Commerce and the President \nof the United States. I stated to the President that I don't think \nthere is another thing we could do in the near term for us to be able \nto grow this economy that would be more important than to pass trade \npromotion authority. I think it is that critical a piece of legislation \nfor us to stimulate the economy. At this point in time, this is \ncritical for us to do.\n  We received economic figures today that showed anemic growth in the \nlast quarter--1.1-percent economic growth. We need to do everything \npossible to stimulate this economy. Trade promotion authority is the \nlead piece of legislation that we can do to expand the trade \nopportunities for this Nation. I strongly believe that.\n  I have worked in the trade field. In 1990 and 1991, I worked in the \nU.S. Trade Representative's office when we were beginning the \nnegotiations for the NAFTA treaty--certainly a treaty that is not \nperfect, but one that has expanded trade opportunity and has grown the \neconomy of the United States. The United States has an international \neconomy. From that, I mean to say we have an economy that is based \nsubstantially upon trade. My State has an economy that is based \nsubstantially upon trade. My family is dependent substantially upon \ntrade. We are in agriculture. We produce grains, cattle, and these are \nthings in which we have a significant trade market.\n\n  Trade promotion authority will allow the President to negotiate trade \nagreements and trade tariff agreements that will reduce tariffs. I \nthink people need to recognize that a tariff is a tax. So this will be \na tax reduction treaty. It will also open up trading opportunities for \nthe United States and for our trading partners. One of the lead ways we \ncan grow it is by doing this. What trade does when you lower tariffs, \nlower the barriers to trade, is it allows people to compete based upon \nthe theory of comparative advantage and who can do the best and more.\n  Fortunately for the United States, we have comparative advantages in \nmain economic fields. So we are going to be able to compete more \naggressively with more countries because there will be fewer barriers. \nThe United States also has one of the lowest trade barriers. We have \nfewer barriers to trade in the United States than most nations.\n  With this trade promotion authority, we are going to be able to \nnegotiate trade-opening agreements with a number of countries around \nthe world. It is going to reduce barriers in other nations more than in \nthe United States for their incoming products. We are going to have \nmore ability to go there, and that will expand because of the \ncomparative advantages of the U.S. economy in producing goods and \nservices--though not all goods and services. There are going to be \nproblem areas that we will need to protect in our economy because of \ndifficulties we have, or subsidies in other countries, or because of \nthings they do trying to block our products. We may have to respond in \nkind at times.\n  The administration is aware of that. They are seeking this authority. \nIt is an authority that we need to grant to the administration. I think \nwith it we are going to see substantial trading blocs expand for the \nbenefit of the United States. We have a NAFTA trading bloc of Canada, \nthe United States, and Mexico. I see that expanding. The administration \nis pushing to expand to Central America and South America, so we have \nan entire Western Hemisphere; North and South America will be in one \nopen trading type of bloc.\n  We are also being pursued by other countries to expand trade \nopportunities with them. These hold substantial opportunities for us to \ngrow. But without trade promotion authority, the agreements will not \nhappen.\n  For those reasons, I am a strong proponent of trade promotion \nauthority. I believe it is important for us to have. I think this is \nthe right time and place for us to do it. This country needs to let \nthis President have trade promotion authority so we can expand \nagreements. So I will be voting for TPA. I urge my colleagues to do so \nas well.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for allowing me \nthis time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, and he has indicated his remarks \nwill probably take 50 minutes or thereabouts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the defense matter \nwhich is now scheduled to begin at 2 o'clock, that time which is \nencompassed in the unanimous consent agreement, be delayed to begin at \n2:20 p.m. today rather than 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So the President pro tempore can use his time postcloture \nand can come back later.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority whip. As \nalways, he is most gracious, most considerate, and most courteous. He \nalso wants to be helpful.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator for a unanimous \nconsent request provided that my speech does not show an interruption \nand that I retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak for 7 minutes \nconcluding the remarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the dead of night, under cover of \ndarkness, near the bewitching hour of midnight on July 25, 2002, House \nand Senate conferees reached agreement on a new trade bill. The White \nHouse embraces this new trade bill, not because it contains trade \nadjustment assistance--no, no, no--but because it provides the \nPresident with fast-track negotiating authority. The administration \nlikes to refer to it as trade promotion authority--that is an old \nVaudeville trick--trade promotion authority.\n  This is fast-track negotiating authority that the President wants, \nbut he does not call it fast track. He wants to call it ``trade \npromotion authority.'' That sounds good. That has a sweet ring to my \nears--trade promotion. Who would not be for trade promotion? The \nPresident knows how to frame these terms in ways one may be lulled to \nsleep--trade promotion authority--but it provides the President with \nfast-track negotiating authority, fast track.\n  As we all know, the real effect of fast track is not to promote \ntrade--no, no, no--not to promote trade but to prevent amendments to \ntrade agreements. That is why we have fast track.\n  This Constitution, which I hold in my hand, gives to the Congress the \npower to regulate trade and commerce with foreign nations. This \nConstitution is my authority, not fast track. This is my authority.\n  This bill we are talking about here and about to vote on and upon \nwhich cloture was invoked earlier today is a fast-track bill. It is not \nreally about creating jobs or helping workers. It is about weakening \nour trade laws, making it easier for multinational corporations to move \noffshore where they can pay slave wages and where they do not have to \npay health insurance and where they do not have to pay retirement \nbenefits. That is what this bill does. That is why the Chambers of \nCommerce around the country favor it.\n  Just in my home State of West Virginia, we have lost thousands--\nthousands--of jobs, good jobs that supported families and breadwinners \nwho worked hard for their money, very hard, indeed.\n  When I was first elected to Congress 50 years ago--elected 51 years \nago--we had glass factories in West Virginia; we had pottery plants in \nWest Virginia; we\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\nhad leather goods; we made shoes; we produced steel. We employed many \nWest Virginians in the steel industry. That was 56 years ago when I \nfirst got into politics, and then 50 years ago when I first came to \nCongress. We had those thousands of good jobs in West Virginia.\n  Those jobs supported families and breadwinners who worked hard for \ntheir money, I say. They labored in the coal mines. They labored in the \nsteel mills. They labored in the glass plants. They labored in the \nchemical manufacturing works. They worked in the leather goods \nindustries in West Virginia. They were employed in the textile and \napparel industries in West Virginia. These hard-working families \ndeserve a fair slice of the pie.\n  These and other American workers elected the various Members of this \nbody to look after their interests in national trade matters. Senator \nRandolph and I, when we came to this Chamber, did just that; but other \nStates elected their Senators, too, to give them, the American workers, \na fair shake when the trade deals were being made. I have to say that \nSenators cannot fulfill this obligation by handing Presidents fast-\ntrack authority.\n  The President proclaimed victory in obtaining his trade bill, but it \nis a hollow victory. It is a Pyrrhic victory. Remember Pyrrhus, who \nfought the Romans, who was the first to bring elephants to Rome and to \nthe Italian peninsula to fight the war? That was in 280 B.C. He won a \nvictory but a very costly one, and that has been called a Pyrrhic \nvictory.\n  So the President won a Pyrrhic victory for America.\n  The President threatened to veto the bill unless the conferees \ndropped the Dayton-Craig amendment. So what did they do? They folded. \nThey dropped it because the President waved his veto pen.\n  Why should that make one falter or faint or fall? The Constitution \ngives the President that right. The Constitution says he can veto a \nbill. But why shake and tremble in one's boots because the President \nthreatens to use his veto pen? Let him veto it. Go to it. Explain to \nthe American people, Mr. President, your veto of this protection that \nwas written into this bill. Explain to them. Yes, go ahead and veto it.\n  He has a constitutional right to do that. Of course, the House and \nthe Senate under the Constitution have the right to override his veto, \nbut they will not on this bill.\n  In these 50 years that I have been in the Congress, the House and the \nSenate, every administration, Democratic and Republican, has sung the \nsame old song. It is the State Department song. Administration after \nadministration, Democratic and Republican, have sung the same old song: \nGive us free trade agreements.\n  Well, I voted against about every one that I can think of that came \nbefore this Senate, NICPAC--no, not NICPAC, but you name it, I voted \nagainst these so-called free trade agreements.\n  I am for free trade. We are for free trade. Who would not be for free \ntrade? But as some say, there is a great deal of difference between \nfree trade and fair trade. They are two different terms.\n  So the conferees dropped it. They dropped the Dayton-Craig amendment. \nThey trembled when they heard the President say he would veto it. What \nhappened? They dropped that language. The President struck fear, I \nsuppose, into their weak hearts by saying, ``I will veto that bill. If \nit comes with that language in it, I will veto it.''\n  I say, go to it, Mr. President. You just go ahead and veto it. I dare \nyou to veto it and then go and tell the American people. Let's both go. \nLet's have a debate on this. Let the American people know.\n  So they scrapped the only meaningful part of the bill that allowed \nthe Congress to stop the President from weakening our trade law. They \nscrapped the Dayton-Craig amendment, the only meaningful part of the \nbill that allowed the Congress to stop the President from weakening our \ntrade laws in the next round of trade negotiations. Dayton-Craig would \nhave allowed the Congress to exercise its constitutional right to amend \nand strengthen whatever agreement the President brings back to us. \nWithout Dayton-Craig, we are at the mercy of our negotiators in Geneva, \nthe same old place where nearly every week some WTO panel tells the \nUnited States that it has no right to enforce its own laws.\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment was a bipartisan amendment that I \ncosponsored along with a third of the Senate. Although the amendment \nwas supported by an overwhelming majority of the Senate--62 Members of \nthe Senate from both sides of the aisle now--in conference it was \nblithely cast aside as a bag of dirty laundry in the face of the veto \nthreat by the President. Like a bag of dirty laundry, whiff, out went \nthe Dayton-Craig amendment.\n  The President said he was afraid it might offend certain members of \nthe WTO.\n  Well, Mr. President, I must ask this question--ungrammatically I will \nput the question: Who is the President working for, the WTO or the \nUnited States?\n  As I have often said, I was sent to the Congress not by the President \nof the United States. I have worked with 11 Presidents since I have \nbeen in Congress. Not one of them sent me to the House or to the \nSenate. I was not sent by any electoral college either. As I have often \nsaid, I was sent by the people, we the people of West Virginia. I \nlisten to them. I was not sent by the President, and I was not sent by \nthe WTO--nor was that Senator, nor that Senator, nor that Senator, nor \nthat Senator. The last time I checked, neither the President nor I was \nelected by the WTO but by the American people.\n  Not surprisingly, the very day after the trade conferees' deal was \nannounced, the Director General of the WTO commended President Bush. \nImagine that. The very day after the trade conferees' deal was \nannounced, the Director General of the WTO commended President Bush. \nThe WTO Director General congratulated the President of the United \nStates for having obtained a trade bill that wrests from the Congress \nits right to strengthen and protect American trade laws under article \nI, section 8, of this U.S. Constitution which I hold in my hand.\n  Again I ask: For whom is the President working? I will say it \nungrammatically: Who is the President working for, the WTO or the \npeople of the United States? Who is he working for, the President, the \nWTO, or the people of the United States?\n  Of course, the Director General of the WTO is pleased with the \nPresident's trade bill. If I were pleased with it, I would congratulate \nhim, too. The WTO is pleased with it. The President is now free to \nnegotiate trade deals more favorable to other WTO members than to the \ncitizens of West Virginia and the citizens of the United States. That \nis this trade bill I am talking about.\n  I have seen how the employment figures in West Virginia have gone \ndown over these years that I have been in Congress, and we have voted \none time after another to take the Congress out of the equation, give \nPresidents free trade agreements. They can negotiate trade agreements \nwithout this bill we are going to vote on. They can. They don't need \nthis to negotiate trade agreements. They call it promotion trade \nauthority. What is that--PTA? Forget it. That is not promotion trade \nauthority. That sounds good, count me in, if we promote trade.\n\n  But this is fast track, nothing short of it. This is the old hat \ntrick. Don't watch what is going on in this hand; watch what is going \non over here. Everything really is happening over here. This is the old \nhat trick.\n  So the WTO Director General ``congratulated'' the President for \nhaving obtained a trade bill that wrests from the Congress what \nCongress is entitled to under that Constitution--the right to debate \nand particularly the right to amend.\n  These are the very same countries whose representatives, sitting on \nWTO dispute settlement panels, have ruled against the United States in \nnearly each and every U.S. antidumping, countervailing duty, and \nsafeguards case taken to the WTO since the last round of international \ntrade negotiations.\n  So now, inexplicably, our President wants to enter into a new round \nof international trade negotiations. Why? To further undermine the \nability of the United States to enforce its own laws against unfair \ntrade. Despite congressional advice to the contrary, this \nadministration honored the requests of\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\nforeign governments to renegotiate our trade laws, knowing full well \nthat these are the same governments that are gutting these laws in \nGeneva.\n  So again I ask, Who does the President work for, the WTO or the \npeople of the United States? Why would our President want to do this? \nLet's step back a minute and look at this objectively. What exactly is \nthe point of giving the President this authority to negotiate new trade \nagreements? Whom are we kidding? The goal of foreign governments in \nthese negotiations is not to strengthen U.S. trade laws but to weaken \nthem. And they have said as much. They begged us to put our laws on the \nnegotiating table so they could water them down or kill them.\n  Does anyone really believe that negotiating new trade agreements at \nthe explicit request of the very nations that are committed to \ndestroying our trade laws would somehow result in a better deal for the \nUnited States than if we had simply walked away?\n  The foreign governments whose representatives sit on these WTO panels \nare launching a two-pronged attack on the United States. First, they \nseek to undermine our trade laws by having the President renegotiate \nthem, meaning weaken them, in the new trade round. At the same time, \nwhenever the United States applies an antidumping or countervailing \nduty order or a remedy under section 201 as we did recently in the \nsteel case, our foreign competitors simply take us to the WTO where \nthey continue to chip, chip, chip away at the laws passed by Congress \nprecisely to stop their illegal actions.\n  We already know, based on bitter experience, that regardless of what \nis negotiated in Geneva, future WTO panels will continue to find U.S. \nlaw inconsistent with the new international agreement. These WTO panels \nare not ruling against the United States based on their understanding \nof international law. They are not seeking to uphold a greater good. \nThese panels are ruling against the United States to eviscerate--\neviscerate, disembowel--our trade laws so they can gain unfettered \naccess to our markets--aha, the largest and most lucrative markets on \nEarth. And inconceivably this administration wants to help them do it.\n  Even the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, \nagrees that the WTO panel's interim ruling against the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Offset Act, known to some as the Byrd amendment, \nwas yet another example of how WTO panels are trying to undermine our \ntrade remedies by telling us that we cannot enforce our own laws. These \nWTO panels are not seeking simply to prevent us from enforcing our own \nlaws. No, they are going far beyond that. They are basically making new \nlaws. That is what they are doing. They are basically making new laws \nby exceeding the scope of legal review that is permitted under the WTO \nagreements. Standard of review of the relevant WTO agreements is based \non language that was painstakingly negotiated by all WTO members during \nthe Uruguay round.\n  In those negotiations, WTO members agreed that in a dumping case, a \npanel is not permitted to substitute its own judgment for a member's \ngovernment so long as, one, there is more than one permissible \ninterpretation of a WTO agreement; and, two, the interpretation by the \nmember government is a permissible one.\n  The problem is, according to the WTO, there is only one permissible \ninterpretation to these agreements. That permissible interpretation, it \nturns out, is never the interpretation of the United States. Instead, \nit is always the interpretation of the WTO panel. Rigged? We are beaten \nbefore we go in. We are out of the game before we enter. Instead, it is \nalways the interpretation of the WTO panel.\n  During the Uruguay round, all WTO members agreed that there could be \nmore than one permissible interpretation of a WTO agreement, but \ncurrent WTO panelists dismiss that.\n  So if WTO panels do not respect their own agreements today, why does \nPresident Bush think they will abide by the agreements he negotiates \ntomorrow? Why should they? They know if down the line they refuse to \nplay by the rules, this President will simply suggest another round of \ntrade negotiations and those negotiations in the end will benefit whom. \nThem. Not us.\n  The President is again getting started on these lengthy negotiations \nright away. Why? Who does he work for, the WTO or the American people \nout there who are watching through those lenses? He thinks he can \nappease our trading partners. In effect, this administration is trying \nto ``buy off'' our foreign competitors. It is more worried about them \nthan it is about America. The administration is like Willy Loman in \n``Death of a Salesman.'' He wants everybody to like us--everybody.\n  I have a new little dog. It is a Tibetan terrier. Its ancestors were \nborn and bred in Tibet. They were to be used in the palace because they \nwere so loving. They loved everybody. My new little dog is called \nTrouble. My wife named our little dog Trouble.\n  No dog will ever take the place of Billy, but Billy is gone. Billy \nhas gone on to Billy's heaven, and so has Bonnie, his sister.\n  Now we have a new dog--a new dog, a little dog. It is a lap dog, a \nreal lap dog. That is why these dogs were bred. And they are loving. \nThey are small. They were born and bred for the palace in Tibet--China. \nSo the little dog loves everybody. I can pick up that little dog, and \nit will lick me, and it will lick me, and it will wash my face, and it \nwill kiss me. It loves everybody.\n  Well, that is the way it is here. That is the way it is here. The \nadministration is like Willy Loman in ``Death of a Salesman.'' It wants \neverybody to love us.\n  Maybe the President has a special nickname for each of our foreign \ncompetitors, as he does for our adversaries in the press corps. How \nabout that? The President has a nickname for adversaries in the press \ncorps--the fourth estate that sits up there in those galleries and \nwatches, watches, and listens every hour and every minute that we are \nhere.\n  So he has a special nickname for each of our foreign competitors--\nmaybe--as he does for his adversaries in the press corps. But his \ndesire to have the United States be loved by everyone could result in \nour trading partners' loving us to death. His ongoing attempts to buy \nfriendship abroad are sowing the seeds of destruction here at home.\n\n  For example, the Bush administration continues to compulsively exempt \nforeign imports from the 201 remedy on steel because it is concerned \nthat the remedy is ``upsetting'' our foreign competitors. Rather than \nadhering to the letter of the 201 law, in the face of foreign critics, \nthe administration every few weeks bows and scrapes, hems and haws, \nand, lo and behold, issues a new list of products suddenly exempted \nfrom the 201. These exclusions amount to thousands of tons of imported \nforeign steel. Is it any wonder that, despite the 201 tariffs, there \nwas a 37 percent increase in steel imports in June compared to May of \nthis year?\n  And here is another question. Is the President's strategy of \nappeasing our offended trading partners paying off? Apparently not. As \nof July 12, the President had excluded 247 products from the 201 \nremedy, which amounted to 740,000 tons of foreign, unfairly-traded \nsteel. However, after reviewing the exclusions that were announced by \nthe administration on July 11, a spokesman for the European Commission \nsaid those exclusions were ``not enough.'' The EC said the United \nStates would have to provide more exclusions or the EC would retaliate. \nSo, glory be, what a surprise, on July 19, 2002, the President issued a \nnew list of additional exclusions, including, of course, more \nexclusions of European steel. If that wasn't enough, the administration \nwent on to announce that it would continue to grant exclusions on a \n``rolling'' basis--which apparently means whenever we are threatened \nwith retaliation--through the end of August. Not surprisingly, the EC \nsuddenly announced it had decided to postpone its decision on whether \nto retaliate until the end of September. Coincidence? I think not. \nListen to what the EC told us. The Danish Foreign Minister, speaking \nfor the EC, candidly stated, ``We decided that if we sanctioned the \nUnited States now, it might prove more difficult for the U.S. to add \nadditional exclusions.'' But notice he did not say that the EC would \nnot retaliate at the end of September, even if the President gives the \nEC all of the exclusions it asks for. Will we be able to buy off the EC \nby continuing to grant these exclusions? Not based on recent history. \nListen to this.\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\n  On Monday, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body announced it was adding \nBrazil to the list of seven other WTO members that have requested a WTO \npanel in Geneva to contest our steel 201 remedy. If someone were to \nask, ``Well, why didn't the President just exclude Brazilian products \nfrom the 201, as he has so many others?'' they might be surprised to \nlearn that, in fact, Brazil was one of the first nations to be granted \na 201 exclusion, and it was a whopper. You know about those fish we \ncatch--``And it was a whopper.'' Obviously, it is not only futile but \nridiculous for the United States to keep caving in to the demands of \nforeign critics. Why are we allowing ourselves to be cuckolded by \nforeign suitors we know are insincere? We cannot appease them by giving \nthem further exclusions. They will have their cake and eat it, too--\nwon't they?\n  Professor John Jackson of the University of Michigan is considered to \nbe one of the most knowledgeable experts on GATT and the WTO in the \nwhole wide world. Listen to what Professor Jackson wrote about the \norigins of the GATT in 1969. He wrote that it was an invention created \nby men, that was perhaps the least handsome of all the major \ninternational institutions of our time. He said the GATT began as only \none wheel of a larger machine, the ill-fated International Trade \nOrganization. And, he said, when the ILO fell apart, this wheel--the \nGATT--became a unicycle on which the burdens of the larger machine were \nheaped. He said of the GATT:\n\n       This unicycle, for reasons not fully understood, has \n     continued to roll through two decades since it was put \n     together. To be sure, it takes careful balance to keep it \n     rolling and ad hoc repairs and tinkering have brought it to a \n     point where the bailing wire and scrap metal which hold it \n     together form an almost incomprehensible maze.\n\n  Professor Jackson made this observation in 1969. Add to this maze \nanother thirty-three years of bailing wire, scrap metal, and ad hoc \nrepairs and what do you get? The World Trade Organization. The WTO. An \nincomprehensible maze that is still rolling along, but rolling so hard \nand fast now, it's careening out of control.\n  And the greatest irony of all of this, Mr. President, is that it all \nbegan at the behest of the United States. In the early 30's, at the \nrequest of Senator Roosevelt's Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, the \nUnited States enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. \nBetween 1934 and 1945, the President negotiated and entered into 32 \ntrade agreements. Most, if not all of the clauses in the GATT, can be \ntraced to one or another of the clauses that were contained in those \nearly trade agreements. So the United States was there at the inception \nof the GATT, and it continues to nurture what is now the WTO. And, I am \nsorry to report that we in the United States are still the greatest \nfinancial contributor to the WTO, paying approximately 16 percent of \nits total budget for the luxury of being told our laws are meaningless, \nand we don't know how to interpret WTO agreements that are rooted in \nAmerican law.\n\n  I submit we are being hoisted on our own petard, and that, rather \nthan protecting us, the Bush administration is simply helping to \nsharpen the blade.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time, if I have \nanything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today we stand on the precipice of passing \na monumental expansion of trade adjustment assistance and overdue fast \ntrack trade negotiating authority for our country.\n  Before the debate closes, I wanted to explain how important this \nlegislation is to my home State of Montana. Montana exports nearly a \nhalf billion dollars in products a year. We only have 900,000 people in \nour State. This includes $260 million in agricultural commodities, $100 \nmillion in industrial machinery, $24 million in chemical products, and \n$37 million in wood and paper products.\n  We export more than $300 million to Canada, $34 million to Mexico and \nhave significant trade with China, Japan, Germany and the United \nKingdom. In fact, just last week, Ambassador Moreno from Colombia \nvisited Great Falls, Montana and announced a major wheat and barley \npurchase, with more trade opportunities to follow.\n  And that is just the beginning--if we are willing to engage the \nworld. This bill helps us do that by allowing the President to \nnegotiate new agreements to open foreign markets which is so necessary \nto the United States, and brings down trade barriers which is so \nimportant to this country.\n  I would like to read a letter I received from the Montana Grain \nGrowers, Montana Stockgrowers, Montana Farm Bureau and Montana Chamber \nof Commerce that addresses this very point. To quote:\n\n       We are aware that trade is not always free or fair, but we \n     believe this legislation is vital in putting the United \n     States on a similar playing field with agreements that are \n     negotiated around the world. While we understand that trade \n     promotion authority will not fully address inequities with \n     existing trade agreements, we feel strongly that this is an \n     important way of establishing long-term agreements that will \n     help return profitability back to the producer level.\n\n  I could not agree more. We need to take a seat at the negotiating \ntable and level the playing field for our producers. It is not level \ntoday.\n  This means taking aim at the Canadian wheat board and finally \ndismantling its market distorting monopoly.\n  This means reducing foreign agricultural tariffs to levels that are \nthe same as or lower than those in the United States. These are the \nsame tariffs that block Montana beef exports to Korea and Japan.\n  This means eliminating all export subsidies on agricultural \ncommodities while maintaining bona fide food aid and export credit \nprograms that allow the U.S. to compete with other foreign export \npromotion efforts.\n  As you well know, Mr. President, the European Union maintains the \nlion's share of these agricultural export subsidies. You know this \nfigure. It is 60 times more than the U.S. agricultural export \nsubsidies--not 6, 60 times more than the United States. How can we as \nAmericans ever expect to compete in the world if we are undersold time \nand time again by foreign-backed competitors? We can't. We need a trade \nagreement so we can begin to level that playing field and begin to \neliminate those trade-distorting subsidies that are 60 times greater in \none area than those of the United States.\n  This means preventing unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary \nrestrictions not based on sound science. For three decades we fought to \npry open the Chinese market to Pacific Northwest wheat. Now we are \nstruggling with markets in Chile and Russia that place arbitrary \nsanitary barriers on U.S. exports of beef, pork and poultry. This must \nend, to say nothing about the EU restriction on American beef.\n  They will not take American beef. I remember meeting with Mrs. \nMargaret Thatcher. She admitted to me that it was a phony excuse. She \nsaid that to me personally.\n  And, most importantly, this means promoting trade while \nsimultaneously maintaining a strong agricultural policy that preserves \nour family farms and rural communities.\n  Agriculture is not the only industry dependent on trade, however. We \nmust continue to work to guarantee that small businesses have access to \nforeign markets.\n  It is open foreign markets that create new opportunities for a \nBozeman, MT company that ships trailers for mining equipment to Latin \nAmerica; that allow a Missoula company to expand its nutraceutical \ntrade; it is open foreign markets that allow our nurseries to send \nseeds and seedling trees to developing nations rather than fighting \nphony sanitary barriers.\n  The potential for preserving good jobs--and even creating new jobs--\ndoesn't stop there.\n  But there is a potential downside to trade that is also addressed by \nthis bill. In this package we target assistance for workers who are \nstruggling because of trade assistance for workers who are struggling \nbecause of trade by expanding the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\n  Many Montana workers are now back at work and many firms are still in \nbusiness thanks to TAA. Take for example, Montola Growers which is \nresearching new markets for its safflower oil, Thirteen Mile Lamb and \nWool Company which is designing new garments for manufacture by \ncontract knitters, and Pyramid Lumber, which is improving its milling \nefficiency.\n\n  Expanded trade adjustment assistance will help Montana workers by \nstreamlining the process and expanding the net of eligibility. More \nwill be eligible. In addition, a new program will provide up to $10,000 \nin cash assistance to Montana farmers and ranchers injured by imports. \nThis should be a good incentive to keep Montana farmers and ranchers, \ntheir families, and future generations on the land.\n  Good jobs will be created in Montana if we are willing to give our \nnegotiators the strong hand needed to secure sound trade agreements, \nopen those markets, and knock down those barriers. I hope my colleagues \nwill feel the same about their own constituencies and lend their \nsupport to this very important matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter I quoted be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    July 31, 2002.\n     Hon.

The Montana Stockgrowers Association, the Montana \n     Grain Growers Association and the Montana Chamber of Commerce \n     we would like to reconfirm our support of Trade Promotion \n     Authority (TPA). We ask for your support as well when the \n     bill comes to the floor of the Senate later this week.\n       As you know, this bill has already overcome many hurdles, \n     including passage in both the House and Senate. Just last \n     week, the House approved the conference report. Passage in \n     the Senate is the last hurdle before it goes to the President \n     for signature.\n       We are aware that trade is not always free or fair. But we \n     believe this legislation is vital in putting the United \n     States on a similar playing field with agreements that are \n     negotiated around the world.

We must find a \n     way to put more money in the pockets of our farmers and \n     ranchers or they will not be able to stay in business. The \n     vast majority of ag producers recognize that increasing \n     exports increases their bottom line.\n       Thank you for your continued strong support of Montana \n     agricultural producers.\n           Sincerely.\n     Jake Cummins,\n       Executive Vice President, Montana Farm Bureau Federation.\n     Steve Pilcher,\n       Executive Vice President, Montana Stockgrowers Association.\n     Webb Brown,\n       President, Montana Chamber of Commerce.\n     Richard Owen,\n       Executive Vice President, Montana Grain Growers \n     Association.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, could the Senator from Texas be allowed to \nbe recognized first on this, and I then be recognized for my 8 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from Arizona. I \nthank him for his vigilance on this issue.\n  We have two issues before us, but they really boil down to the same \nprinciple, and I want to talk more about the principle than I do the \ninterest.\n  The first issue has to do with the leasing of four 737s. I would have \nto say, this is a transaction I have not looked at very closely. This \nis something new to this bill. What I want to focus my attention on is \nthe leasing of 100 Boeing 767s, which was contained in last year's \nappropriations bill, which was not competitively bid.\n  In looking at the economics of leasing these planes, to the best of \nmy ability--to get data, and to understand it--it looks to me that if \nwe need these planes as tanker replacements, we ought to buy the \nplanes.\n  My concern is, we are going into leasing because we do not have the \nfront-end costs in the appropriations process with leasing that we do \nwith purchasing. If in fact my concern is legitimate, what it means is, \nwe are having procurement dictated by how we score leasing versus \nprocurement. I think if that in fact is the case, we are making a very \nbig mistake.\n  I think something needs to be done about looking at these leasing \ncontracts into which we are entering. They represent tens of billions \nof dollars of commitments of resources into the future. It seems to me \nthat OMB and CBO need to work together to come up with a methodology to \nlook at leasing versus buying. And this is something that ought to be \nlooked at by the Defense authorization bill since the leasing of the \n737s and the leasing of the 100 767s--neither of them was authorized by \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I think it is imperative, before we go through this process again, \nthat we have OMB and CBO develop for us a methodology of looking at \nleasing versus purchases, that we have hearings in the authorizing \ncommittee, and that we have authorizing legislation in this area.\n  I was very concerned, last year, with 100 Boeing 767s because the \nclear intent at that time, no matter what the economics were, was to \nbasically help Boeing, given that they did not get the major defense \ncontract of our era.\n  I do not think, given that we have a $168 billion deficit, we ought \nto be in the business of simply gratuitously giving billions of dollars \nto companies that do not win contracts. The whole purpose for competing \ncontracts is to choose the contractor that will do it best at the \nlowest possible price. The idea that losers have to be compensated is \nabout as far away from the market principle as it can be.\n  So I would certainly urge that something be done to develop a \nmethodology so that the Senate can make rational decisions about \nleasing versus buying.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his leadership in this area. This is \nsomething we ought to be concerned about. We are talking about tens of \nbillions of dollars. We are making commitments on economics that people \nhave not looked at or understood. I think this is something we need to \nunderstand. And I hope to pursue, with Senator McCain, a study by CBO \nand OMB to set the stage for the setting of a policy in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas, who \nunderstands the issues of economics and leasing and the machinations of \nvarious budget activities far better than I. I appreciate his support.\n  I remind my colleagues that the amendment I have withdrawn would have \njust simply required the authorization of appropriations of $30.6 \nmillion--I repeat, $30.6 million--for the four Boeing 737 \ncongressional/executive VIP aircraft. That is all it did.\n  The language in the amendment is identical to language requiring \nauthorization of appropriations for 100 Boeing 767 tanker aircraft that \nis included in the fiscal year 2003 Defense authorization bill. Whether \nthat lasts through conference will be very questionable, given the \nenormous impact of the lobbying by Boeing Aircraft.\n  Last year, during conference negotiations on the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee inserted into the bill unprecedented language \nto allow the U.S. Air Force to lease 100 Boeing 767 commercial aircraft \nand convert them to tankers, and to lease four Boeing 737 commercial \naircraft for VIP airlift to be used by congressional and executive \nbranch officials.\n  My colleagues will recall that Congress did not authorize these \nleasing provisions in the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, and in fact the Senate Armed Services Committee was \nnot advised of this effort by the U.S. Air Force during consideration \nof that authorization measure.\n  Again, this year, without benefit of authorization, committee debate, \nor input, the Senate Appropriations Committee has added funding in the \nfiscal year 2003 Department of Defense appropriations bill for $30.6 \nmillion to cover initial leasing costs for the four Boeing 737 \ncongressional/executive VIP transport aircraft.\n  I am concerned that the impact of this 737 leasing provision has not \nbeen adequately scrutinized and the full cost to taxpayers has not been \nsufficiently considered. In fact, after review of the Air Force's \nproposed lease for the four 737s, and its comparison of leasing and \npurchase options for these aircraft, it appears that certain leasing \ncosts are being hidden to make the leasing option appear more cost \neffective.\n  In addition, recent CBO and GAO analysis of the Air Force's 737 \nleasing proposal suggests that the lease could cost the Government, and \nultimately the U.S. taxpayers, from $13.5 million to $20 million more \nthan to purchase these aircraft. These CBO and GAO reports, it seems to \nme, lend credence to the view that additional scrutiny of the leasing \nproposal would be beneficial--and such scrutiny generally occurs during \nthe congressional authorization process.\n  I repeat, my amendment only said that this insertion in the \nappropriations bill would have required authorization. It would not \nhave stopped it.\n  This is the same kind of egregious behavior we often rail against \nhere on the Senate floor when it comes to corporate scandals.\n  What is at risk in this series of unfolding circumstances is the \ntrust Americans have in our Congress and in Government.\n  I am aware that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has just \na short time ago received a letter from OMB Director Mitch Daniels \nstating the administration's support for the lease of these four \naircraft.\n  I know also that our committee has received a reprogramming request \nfor the funds necessary to begin this lease. This reprogramming \nrequest, evidently, has addressed any concerns, my friends, the \nchairman and ranking member, might have had about the Appropriations \nCommittee. Accordingly, Senators Levine and Warner would have opposed \nmy amendment insisting that our committee need not authorize these \nleases. I understood the reality and withdrew the amendment.\n  However, I want to make a couple of observations. I guess I don't \nknow for certain why OMB has decided to support this lease--which will \ncost American taxpayers just about as much to rent four aircraft as it \nwould to own them. I assume it is because the real need for these \naircraft is negligible compared to our many other defense priorities, \nand to find the money to support a luxury in a time of enormous budget \ndeficits it becomes necessary to engage in budgetary shell games and \nappropriations parlor tricks. But the American people should know and \ntheir elected officials should understand that the accounting tricks \nthat we decry in the corporate world and that have so distressed our \nfinancial markets should not be any more acceptable in government \nspending decisions.\n  Lastly, I say to my friends, the chairman and ranking member of my \ncommittee, for whom I have great affection and respect--and I mean \nthat: I remember a time when the members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee considered their authorizing responsibilities to be \nconsiderably more onerous than simply receiving and acquiescing in the \noccasional reprogramming request for an unneeded, unaffordable, luxury \nacquired by resorting to spending gimmickry rather than insisting that \nthe scarce resources available for our armed services--in an age of \nserious and multiple threats to our freedom--ought to be spent on our \nsecurity and our security alone and not on the convenience of \ntravelling members of Congress and the executive branch.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are making good progress in our effort \nto bring the debate on this bill to a close. I compliment the \ndistinguished Senators, the managers of the bill, the chairman, and the \nranking member. At a point when we are able to conclude the debate, I \nknow Senator Levin would like to be recognized for a few minutes before \nthat happens, we will go to final passage. There will then be an \nopportunity to vote on issues relating to the Executive Calendar--at \nthis point I am not sure how many votes relating to the judicial \nnominations on the calendar, but it is my intention to go to many of \nthe judges who are currently listed on the Executive Calendar.\n  I would like to propound a unanimous consent request. It has been \ncleared by the distinguished Republican leader in regard to that \nmatter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the disposition of \nthe Defense appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession to consider Executive Calendar No. 862, Henry Autrey, to be \nU.S. District Judge; that there be 4 minutes for debate equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of Judiciary Committee; that \nupon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote immediately \non confirmation of the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table; the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; any statements thereon be printed in the Record; and \nthe Senate then return to legislative session, with the preceding all \noccurring without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to repeat, there will be a vote on final \npassage, at least one, perhaps more votes on the judicial nominations \nthat we have been able to clear. Then I would also note that we have \none other vote at least after all of that, which is the vote on the \nfinal passage of the trade promotion authority conference report. There \nare Senators who had asked to be recognized for remarks prior to the \ntime we have that vote. We will be consulting with them relating to the \namount of time they will require.\n  I urge Senators to be aware that after this block of votes, there \nwill be at least one, maybe other important votes this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if one of the managers will yield \n4 minutes to me.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last year's Defense Appropriations Act \ncontained a provision which authorized the Secretary of the Air Force \nto pursue\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\nmultiyear leases for two types of aircraft, up to four Boeing 737 \naircraft and up to 100 Boeing 767 aircraft. That provision exempted \nthese leases from the requirement for congressional authorization in \nsections 2401 of title X which I thought was an unfortunate action on \nthe part of the Appropriations Committee. That was last year.\n  After the enactment of that provision by our good friends, the \nappropriators, the Secretary of the Air Force appeared before the Armed \nServices Committee and he made a personal commitment to us that he \nwould not proceed with a lease without first coming to both the \nauthorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee for approval of \nfunding required for the lease.\n  In the case of the proposed Boeing 737 lease, the four planes, the \nSecretary lived up to that commitment. The Department of Defense \nsubmitted a request for reprogramming to both the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee. The Armed Services \nCommittee met earlier today, about an hour and a half ago, to consider \nthe reprogramming request from the Department of Defense. I emphasize, \nthis reprogramming request is from the Department of Defense. My \nimmediate response, when we received it, was to ask the Department of \nDefense some questions and to ask the OMB some questions.\n  The main question I was asking the Department of Defense was whether \nthey considered this a precedent for any other reprogramming requests. \nThe answer was no.\n  The question I asked the OMB was whether or not the OMB supports this \nrequest and if so why. The OMB has sent a letter now to us indicating \nthat they support the Department of Defense reprogramming request, and \nthey set forth their reasons.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters from the Department of Defense \nand the OMB supporting the reprogramming request be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Secretary of the Air Force,\n\n                                         Washington July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter is in response to your \n     questions regarding the Air Force's intent to award a \n     contract to lease four Boeing 737 aircraft under the Multi-\n     Year Aircraft Lease Pilot Program authorized by Section 8159 \n     of the Fiscal Year 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act.\n       Our analysis shows that the least cost alternative is a \n     lease program. Under the terms and conditions of the proposed \n     lease contract negotiated with Boeing, the net present value \n     of the lease is approximately $3.9M less than a purchase over \n     the same period.\n       With respect to your comment that you do not consider the \n     proposed Boeing 737 lease to be a precedent for any other \n     lease, I agree. Although the Air Force will use a similar \n     methodology to determine the value of a 767 lease (if one can \n     be successfully negotiated), in the end, the Air Force will \n     only bring forward a lease proposal which shows a net present \n     value that is advantageous to the American taxpayer.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     James G. Roche.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of July 30th \n     concerning the proposed lease of Boeing 737 transport \n     aircraft. You asked if the lease proposal is consistent with \n     the criteria for an operating lease under OMB circular A-11 \n     and with the requirements of Section 8159 of the FY 2002 DoD \n     Appropriations Act.\n       We believe that the lease is consistent with A-11 and \n     Section 8159, despite the fact that it includes an option to \n     purchase the aircraft. In particular, the lease proposal \n     meets two key requirements in A-11: (1) the lease payments \n     constitute no more than 90% of the value of the asset (the \n     aircraft); and (2) the asset is commercial in nature and not \n     designed to meet unique government purposes. Under A-11, \n     purchase options are allowable in operating leases as long as \n     they do not commit the government to purchase and as long as \n     the purchase is at the fair market value of the asset at the \n     time the option is exercised. In this case the prices quoted \n     in the contract are fair market value for this type of \n     aircraft after five years of use. Therefore, as long as the \n     Air Force provides the required funding to purchase the \n     aircraft up-front if and when it decides to exercise the \n     option, it can do so without violating the A-11 requirements \n     for an operating lease. The lease is also consistent with \n     Section 8159 in this regard since the purchase option \n     requires separate authority in order to be exercised.\n       Finally, all costs for FY 2002, including termination \n     liability costs, are fully covered by the reprogramming \n     request of $37.2 million that was sent to the Congress. In \n     future years, the program will continue to be scored \n     according to guidelines for operating leases under A-11 thus \n     requiring an annual appropriation.\n       In summary, we support the proposal worked out with the Air \n     Force on the lease of 737s. Any future leases would be \n     expected to comply with these standards. Thank you again for \n     your interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, that relates only to the 737 lease which is \nthe matter in the appropriations bill. There is no reference to the 767 \nlease, which is for the 100 tankers, in the appropriations bill before \nus. We need to address how that issue should be addressed.\n  In the authorization bill, which this Senate has passed and which is \nnow in conference, we added a provision which states that before there \nis any lease, the Department of Defense must obtain authorization for \nthat lease. This legislation will not only require the Department of \nDefense and the Office of Management and Budget to lay out the ground \nrules for any such lease but also to obtain the approval of the \nauthorizing committees as well as the appropriators for any lease of \nBoeing 767 aircraft. That is the way in which I believe we have done \nthe people's work in requiring the justification from the OMB and the \nDepartment of Defense for the reprogramming request relative to the \nfour 737s and the way in which we will protect the public interest \nrelative to any request for funding for a lease for the 767s and for \nthe tankers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of documents I \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS01AU02.000\n\n\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS01AU02.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2002.\n     Hon. James G. Roche,\n     Secretary of the Air Force, The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Roche: On June 24, 2002, the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee received a letter indicating your intent \n     to award a contract to lease four Boeing 737 aircraft under \n     the Multi-Year Aircraft Lease Pilot Program authorized by \n     Section 8159 of the Fiscal Year 2002 Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act. The Committee subsequently received a \n     request for reprogramming to enter into such a lease.\n       As the Committee considers this reprogramming request, I \n     would appreciate your response to the following questions.\n       First, based on net present value calculations performed by \n     the Air Force, do you believe that it will cost the Air Force \n     more or less to lease the four aircraft than it would cost to \n     purchase the same aircraft?\n       Second, as you know, Section 8159 authorizes the Secretary \n     of the Air Force to investigate operating leases for both \n     Boeing 737 aircraft and Boeing 767 aircraft. In my view, any \n     proposed lease should be considered on its merits, and for \n     that reason I do not consider the proposed Boeing 737 lease \n     to be a precedent for any other lease, including a potential \n     Boeing 767 lease. Do you agree or disagree?\n       Because your reprogramming request is currently pending \n     before our Committee, I would appreciate a prompt response to \n     these questions.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Daniels: On June 24, 2002, the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee received a letter from the Secretary of \n     the Air Force informing us of the Secretary's intent to award \n     a contract to lease four Boeing 737 aircraft under the Multi-\n     Year Aircraft Lease Pilot Program authorized by Section 8159 \n     of the Fiscal Year 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act. The Committee subsequently received a request for \n     reprogramming ``to enter into a long-term operating lease of \n     up to four Boeing 737 (C-40 aircraft)'' as authorized by \n     section 8159.\n       Section 8159 states that ``The Secretary shall lease \n     aircraft under terms and conditions consistent with this \n     section and consistent with the criteria for an operating \n     lease as defined in OMB Circular A-11, as in effect at the \n     time of the lease.'' It further states that ``No lease \n     entered into under this authority shall provide for . . . the \n     purchase of the aircraft by, or the transfer of ownership to, \n     the Air Force.'' An Air Force report to the Congress \n     regarding the proposed contract terms and conditions states \n     that ``A price option to purchase the aircraft at residual \n     value is included. Exercise of the options is subject to a \n     separate authorization and appropriation.''\n       I would appreciate if you would review the proposed \n     contract terms and conditions and determine: (1) whether the \n     terms and conditions are consistent with the criteria for an \n     operating lease as defined in OMB Circular A-11; (2) whether \n     the terms and conditions are consistent with the requirements \n     of Section 8159; and (3) how the lease should be scored for \n     budget purposes. I would also appreciate your statement as to \n     whether, in view of these terms and conditions, the Office of \n     Management and Budget supports the proposed lease.\n       Because the Air Force reprogramming request is currently \n     pending before our Committee, I would appreciate a prompt \n     response to these questions.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may have an additional minute, I think \na number of important points were raised by the Senator from Texas \nrelative to the leasing issue. I hope that path will be followed, where \nthe Department of Defense and the OMB will set forth some criteria, \nsome guidelines, relative to leasing because there are some real risks \nwhen the leasing road is walked in terms of committing future \nresources.\n  We hope we have protected the taxpayers in this matter by looking at \nthe reprogramming request very carefully. A majority in the committee \nhas voted and approved formally the way we do reprogramming; \nnonetheless, it has approved the reprogramming request.\n  Senator Warner has worked with me and fully concurs in the decision \nthat we made to get the decision from the committee. Usually, \nreprogramming is done more informally, but we decided that because \nthere were some differences, we would actually convene the committee \nand get a more formal response and polling of the committee relative to \nthe Department of Defense's reprogramming request on the four 737s. \nThat is completed now, and the reauthorization issue will now be \naddressed relative to the 100 tankers.\n  I thank my friends for the time. I thank Senator McCain for \nwithdrawing his amendment, and I hope we are on the right track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas started his \ncomments about this subject with the phrase ``if'' we need these \nplanes. That is the point of departure, as far as I am concerned, from \nthose who oppose what we have done to start leasing planes.\n  The tankers that we are replacing in the lease program, the 767s, \nhave reached over 42 years of age. Senator Inouye and I have talked to \npilots throughout the world who are flying our planes, and we found \nthat, to a great extent, these planes are spending more time in the \ndepot for maintenance than they are spending flying. The cost of \nmaintaining a plane that old is irrelevant to the subject of what we \nare spending on these new planes. That doesn't figure in on the CBO. If \nyou save money from maintaining a 42-year-old airplane, that doesn't \ncount toward what it costs you to lease a plane to take its place.\n  Now, we have an unquestioned need for these planes. As I said last \nnight, I cannot imagine that, in the time when I was an Army and Air \nCorps pilot, anyone would have dared offer me a 1902 plane to fly in \nWorld War II. But that is equal to what we are doing now. We are not \nonly offering it, we are forcing our people to fly planes that are, for \nthe most part, older than the pilots who are flying them. It is costing \nus more to maintain them than the planes are worth. It is because of \nthe failure of the Congress to face up to the problems of replacing our \naging systems that we face this tremendous bow-wave of costs in front \nof us.\n  We are not able to lease combat equipment. We don't seek to lease \ncombat equipment, but we do seek to lease those types of systems that \nare available in the competitive market and for which there will be a \nmarket at the end of the lease. I envision that we will go away from \nthe point of having to spend dollars and dollars and dollars to \nmaintain old planes to the point where we will turn these planes back \nafter not more than 10 years, and then we will buy the next generation. \nThis generation will go out into the general aviation sector of the \nworld, and we will have a value. That value is not calculated in these \nsystems either because they just assume we will keep leasing them, I \nguess, and envision us continuing to lease these planes until they, \ntoo, are 40 years old.\n\n  As a practical matter, we have faced this problem before, not just in \nthis Congress. I remember the fights over the C-17. Even those were \npurchased, but the Congress, in three out of the four committees of the \nCongress, refused to proceed with the purchase of the C-17s. We saw the \nC-140s ready to be retired, and we had to have a replacement. It was \nour subcommittee that insisted on going ahead with the C-17s.\n  We see the problem of the cost of maintaining the tankers, of \nmaintaining the C-9s. We call them the DC-9s. Those are being retired \nnow. They average 30 years of age. The 727s, which we call the C-22, \naverage 38 years of age.\n  Think of that, Mr. President. We have gone through three decades \nwithout thinking about how we keep planes so they are functional and \ncosts do not get ever-increasing for maintenance. We look at money in a \ndifferent way than the Armed Services Committee does; I admit that. We \nlook at money as to how we can possibly get what we need without \nbreaking the budget. We have proceeded to lease with that in mind.\n  It is not my judgment that we will increase the cost of flying these \nmissions by leasing the planes, as compared to keeping planes that are \nin the 30-, 38- and 44-year-old age bracket.\n  Mr. President, I think one comment was made concerning the fact that \none company--Boeing--was not awarded one of the contracts for the \ncombat aircraft. That had nothing to do with our decision to try to \nlease these planes. It is totally immaterial, as far as I am\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nconcerned. We weren't even sure whether they would decide to lease the \nplanes. The fact was that we had to find planes, and the planes that \nwere available at that time on the line were the 767s, which could be \nreadily converted to tankers to replace these aging tankers that must \nbe replaced if we are to continue our war against global terrorism.\n  Mr. President, it doesn't please this Senator to have this continued \nbattle with the Armed Services Committee over the question of what is \nthe best way to spend our money to keep our people in the military \noutfitted with the best possible equipment. But, in my judgment, we are \nproceeding along the right line.\n  I sort of wonder about the request that GAO do a study on whether or \nnot the Congress was right in passing the law and the President was \nright in signing the law last year. We are discussing an issue we \ndebated on the Senate floor. We prevailed on the floor, we prevailed in \nconference, and the President signed the bill. The system is moving \nforward that was intended to move forward. I seriously question what \nright anybody has to ask the GAO to study whether Congress made the \nright decision last year. Congress should be looking at the execution \nof the laws, not whether the laws represented the best possible \nsolution.\n  I don't have a problem with them looking at the economics of it; I \nwelcome that, provided they look at the cost of maintaining those old \nplanes. They are not going to tell me that the taxpayers are saving \nmoney by keeping planes that are as old as the C-9s, C-22s, and tankers \nthat are flying today.\n  Lastly, I remind the Senate that those tankers are still flying, \nalmost nightly, in Afghanistan. Every plane that flies in that theater \nhas to be refueled at least twice a night. We recently talked to the \ncommander of our forces in Europe. We were told that when the AWACS \nNATO loaned us after 9/11 came to the United States, they flew 19,000 \nhours in less than 6 months. Now, those, too, are the old 707 bodies \nand they are aging. The engines are aging, and they are going to have \nto be replaced because of the heavy duty they got during that period \nthey were on loan here.\n  There are all kinds of problems that have to be solved. We solve them \nby using money from the operation and maintenance account. We are not \nauthorizing people to buy planes. That is the jurisdiction of the Armed \nServices Committee. But what happens to the O account, as far as I am \nconcerned, is a matter for the Appropriations Committee to determine--\nthey are consulted--but we have to find some way to make the money fit \nthe need. I think we have done it in this bill.\n  I thank my friend from Hawaii for his courtesy in allowing me to \nspeak ahead of him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of my distinguished colleague from Alaska.\n\n\n                          DEPOT MODERNIZATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to \nMr. Inouye, the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense, and to Mr. Stevens, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, \nfor the fine work they have accomplished in crafting this important \nFiscal Year 2003 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. It has been \nmy pleasure, as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, \nto work with them on this bill, as well as on the defense portions of \nthe recently passed Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency Supplemental Bill, H.R. \n4775. They certainly do a masterful job of setting priorities and \nbalancing competing needs.\n  I am also pleased that the Appropriations Committee chose to \nspecifically provide $90 million in the Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency \nSupplemental bill to accelerate the depot modernization period of the \nUSS Scranton at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from Fiscal Year 2003 to \nFiscal Year 2002, as it will result in dramatically improved fleet \nreadiness. In addition, it will free up $90 million in Fiscal Year \n2003, which had been programmed for the USS Scranton, to be used for \nother U.S. Navy critical submarine requirements. This could include \nreturning back to Fiscal Year 2003 the important USS Annapolis depot \nmodernization period at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which the Navy \nwas recently forced to slip from Fiscal Year 2003 to Fiscal Year 2004, \nbecause of a Navy funding shortfall.\n  I direct a question to my two friends, the Chair and the Ranking \nMember of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Is it the \nSubcommittee's understanding that the appropriation of the additional \n$90 million to accomplish the USS Scranton depot modernization period \nin Fiscal Year 2002, now gives the U.S. Navy flexibility to allocate \nthe Fiscal Year 2003 USS Scranton funds to meet other critical \nsubmarine requirements?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is correct. \nIt is the understanding of the Defense Subcommittee that the Fiscal \nYear 2003 $90 million that the navy had requested for the USS Scranton, \nmay now be available to the Navy to meet other critical submarine depot \nmodernization requirements.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I tell the Senator from New Hampshire that it is also my \nunderstanding that the Navy now has the flexibility to reprioritize \nthose Fiscal Year 2003 funds.\n\n\n                              M13 carrier\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, one of the most \nversatile and successful programs in the history of the Army is the \ndevelopment and fielding of the M113 Family of Vehicles. The Army has \nbeen in the process of up-grading these vehicles so that they can keep \npace on the modern battlefield, improve survivability and drastically \nincrease reliability. Not withstanding the need to transform the Army, \nthe fact remains that in 2016, at the time the Army intends to field \nthe Objectives Force, there will be nearly 10,000 M113s remaining \noperational including 1,900 in the Counter Attack Corps.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, I am familiar with the success of the M113 Family of \nVehicles and the role they play in today's Army.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as the chairman knows the FY 2003 budget \nrequest contained $60.3 million for carrier modifications but only \n$14.9 million of that total was allocated for M113 ``A3'' upgrades. I \nam supportive of transformation and understand the need to reallocate \nresources for that purpose. In this instance, however, I believe the \nArmy's decision not to upgrade the remaining forward deployed 112 \nM113A2s of the 2nd Infantry Division in the Republic of Korea and the \n352 M113A2s in Europe belonging to the 1st Infantry Divisions, will at \na minimum, leave the soldiers in these front line units vulnerable in a \npotentially unstable and high threat environment.\n  Because of these concerns, I believe serious consideration should be \ngiven to using all the funds provided in this bill for M113 Carrier A3 \nupgrades and ask that you work with me on this issue during conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Shelby and I have discussed this \nmatter and I also believe we should take a close look at using the \nfunds recommended by the Committee solely for the conversion of M113A3 \ncarriers and that we address this matter in conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my distinguished colleagues for sharing concerns \nabout this program. I too support Army transformation and, most \nimportantly, the protection of our soldiers. I would be happy to \ndiscuss the M113 issue further as we move toward conference.\n\n\n               brilliant anti-armor submunition colloquy\n\n  Mr. SHELBY: Mr. President I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nMikulski, to discuss the Brilliant Anti--Armor Submunition BAT P\\3\\I. I \nwant to express my disappointment with the $152 million cut taken by \nthe committee from the President's budget request for the BAT program. \nDespite increased emphasis being placed on precision guided munitions, \nthis cut will cripple a promising program that has shown progress in \ntesting and is nearing the end of its development phase.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI: I join my friend from Alabama in expressing my concern \nwith this cut to the BAT program. The Department of Defense is \ncurrently creating a vision of precision munitions capabilities and \ntransformation investments for our Armed forces and I believe BAT could \nplay a significant role. The Army has already spent close\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nto $1.9 billion developing this program and the President's fiscal year \n2003 request is needed to complete development, testing and make this \nsystem production ready by 2005. That is well within the Army's \nschedule to support both the Army's Interim and Objective \nTransformational Forces. With adequate funding, BAT P\\3\\I is on track \nto be fielded 3 years sooner than any competing system.\n  Mr. SHELBY: I note that BAT P\\3\\I is the Army's only precision strike \nmunition that can operate in inclement weather and effectively hit \nmoving and stationary targets, including SCUD launchers capable of \ncarry weapons of mass destruction. It is equally worth noting that \nrecent tests of BAT and its P\\3\\I variant have proven to be effective \nagainst targets that were employing countermeasures. I applaud the \nArmy's efforts to expand the delivery platform for BAT P\\3\\I beyond the \nATACMS missile to include examining the applicability of putting the \nBAT on rockets and unmanned air vehicles, such as Predator and Hunter \nUAVs. I encourage the Army and its colleague services to continue this \nkind of innovative thinking to take full advantage of the flexibility \nthat this all weather, precision guided weapons can provide.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI: I am informed of a positive trend, in that, the cost of \nthe BAT submunition has decreased by approximately 10 percent each time \na new order has been procured. I also understand the Army is working on \nan achievable cost reduction program for BAT P\\3\\I. Considering the \npoints Senator Shelby and I have raised, it seems we should give more \nthought to this matter in conference. I ask both Chairman Inouye and \nSenator Stevens if they might be willing to discuss this matter further \nas we move to conference on this bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY: I join the distinguished Senator from Maryland in \nrequesting the assistance of Chairman Inouye and Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. INOUYE: I thank the Senators from Maryland and Alabama for their \nsteadfast support for this program. I would be happy to review the \ncommittee's action and discuss the BAT program with them.\n  Mr. STEVENS: I join the chairman in thanking the distinguished \nSenators from Alabama and Maryland for their remarks. I would certainly \nbe willing to discuss BAT program funding with my colleagues.\n\n\n              chemical and biological defense initiatives\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very \nimportant issue of chemical and biological research. The threat of a \nchemical and biological attack is no longer an emerging threat: it is \nvery real, and it affects not only our nation, but our allies as well. \nThe risks associated with chemical and biological weapons are growing, \nand our capacity to assess, counter, and deter these threats needs to \nbe addressed. That is why it is critical to see continued investments \nmade in diagnostic tools for biowarfare-inflicted agents, chemical and \nbiological detection devices, and sensors to ensure the safety of food \nand water supply.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Maine that \nthis research area needs a robust investment to ensure that promising \ntechnologies are not only explored, but that the technologies are \ntransitioned to the field and operationally deployed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished Ranking Member for his \nleadership on Defense issues. And I am very pleased to see that the \nDefense Appropriations bill places a high priority on addressing the \nchemical and biological weapons threat that we face and provides \nadditional funding beyond the President's request for a number of high \npriority research programs.\n  As the Senator knows, I have been actively supporting vigorous \nresearch efforts in this area since my first days in the Senate because \nthe threat from these weapons is serious and it is growing day by day. \nI am pleased to see that the Committee is recommending to the Senate \nthat a chem-bio defense initiatives fund be established with an initial \nfunding increment of $25 million. The Committee has listed a number of \ntechnology initiatives for consideration, but is providing the \nSecretary of Defense with the discretion to allocate the funds.\n  It seems logical to ensure that the most promising, maturing \ntechnologies are seen through to their completion, particularly if the \ntechnology shows a high potential to yield benefits in defending our \ntroops, Nation, and our global interests. Is it the Committee's intent \nto ensure that such on-going programs that are nearing completion \nreceive a priority for consideration of these funds?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Maine is correct that this fund has \nbeen established for the distinct purpose of improving our military's \nability to respond to chemical and biological warfare threats. It is \nthe intent of this committee to see that the funds provided are wisely \nspent. I would say to the Senator from Maine that a program that has \nbeen supported by this committee in the past and is nearing completion \nshould be appropriately considered for funding to ensure that the \ntechnologies are funded to completion, provided the technologies will \nenhance our ability to protect or deter a chemical and biological \nattack. To withhold funding for a promising, multi-year program just as \nit is achieving documented results would, in my view, be wasteful.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for his illuminating words. If the \ndistinguished ranking member would indulge me further, I would like to \ncall to his attention a research initiative regarding food safety and \nsecurity that is on the Committee's list of projects eligible for \nfunding. This initiative is one that holds great potential to protect \nour military from a chemical or biological threat. Does the Senator \nfrom Alaska share my view that this kind of a program ought to be a \npriority for the chemical and biological defense initiative fund?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe that threats to the food supply are very \nserious and they need to be addressed both in terms of protecting our \ndeployed troops and also in terms of homeland security. We need to find \na way to ensure that the food supply for our deployed troops is safe, \njust as we need to protect America's food supply. I definitely support \na research initiative in this area.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Again, I thank the ranking member for his \nforthrightness, his knowledge and his determination to keep America \nstrong. I also thank him for his continued leadership on defense and \ndefense related issues. I believe that the Appropriations Committee \ndeserves the thanks of the American people for the leadership the \ncommittee has shown in defending our nation from the threat of chemical \nand biological weapons. The chairman and ranking member are dedicated \nto America's defense and the committee staff have done outstanding work \non this bill.\n\n\n                        Enterprize Architecture\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal \nYear 2003 Defense Appropriations Bill, I wanted to discuss briefly the \ncurrent efforts at the Defense Department to design, install and \nimplement an enterprise architecture to perform financial activities at \nthe Department. This has been a major undertaking, and the ultimate \ngoal is to have at the Department a modern, state-of-the-art, \nintegrated system that will perform business processes and financial \nactivities in numerous fields, including logistics, health care, \naccounting, finance, and personnel.\n  The financial management challenges at the Department are no secret \nto the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Last year, Congress \nprovided the Department $100 million to start the financial management \nreform initiative, and this year, the Department requested more than \n$96 million to continue the reform program. According to the \nDepartment, financial management reform would reduce the approximately \n967 stand-alone systems currently generating financial data.\n  In the current fiscal year, we have seen signs of progress. On April \n9, the Department selected International Business Machines to develop \nthe financial management enterprise architecture. IBM, along with \nseveral leading information technology firms, and under the direction \nof the Department's Financial Management Modernization Program Office, \nwill now design a blueprint for future Department investments in \nbusiness management information technology. This blueprint is expected \nto be completed as early as March 2003.\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\n  While this is good news, the Committee report noted that this \ninitiative has gotten off to a slow start. For example, a significant \nportion of the $100 million provided last year was to go for systems \nimprovements, and to undertake various pilot projects under these \nimproved systems at the service branch level. However, despite the \nexistence of these funds for these projects and with project teams \nalready selected, they have not moved forward and the funds have not \nbeen spent.\n  With the IBM team engaged in architecture design, the current and \nnext fiscal year would seem an appropriate opportunity to make the \nsystems improvements, and undertake the various pilot projects that \nhave already been funded. These pilots could enable the Department to \ntest and analyze the nuts and bolts of integrated financial management \nprocesses. With problems already identified, solution sets, and ``best \npractices'' can be tested via the pilots and under the improved \nsystems. This is consistent with one of the observations of the General \nAccounting Office, which noted, ``it is critical to establish interim \nmeasures to both track performance against the department's overall \ntransformation goals and facilitate near-term successes...'' Also, at a \nrecent conference here on Capitol Hill on Defense financial management \nmodernization, a representative of IBM agreed that it was important to \ngo forward on the pilot programs, stating that they were ``vital'' to \nthe improvement of the business.\n  I see the distinguished chair and ranking member of the Defense \nSubcommittee on the floor, and would like to ask them if they agree \nwith me that the Defense Department should utilize the funds previously \nprovided by Congress to undertake needed systems improvements and pilot \nprojects for financial modernization.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from California for her comments, and \nagree with her assessment. As she pointed out, with the Defense \nDepartment now in the process of designing its financial management \narchitecture, it can use this time to move forward on various pilot \nprojects, already funded, in order to modernize and test systems, \nidentify potential challenges and problems, and incorporate solutions \nin the planning process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Chairman of the Subcommittee, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, also a distinguished member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, are correct. In fact, as they both know, the committee \nreport that accompanies this legislation directs the Secretary of \nDefense to submit semi-annual status reports to the relevant \ncongressional committees.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee for their comments and for their leadership on this very \ncritical reform effort at the Department of Defense.\n\n\n       rapid response sensor networking for multiple applications\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I rise with my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, to engage in a colloquy with Senator Inouye, the \nChairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Senator Nelson and I rise to note the critical importance of the \nRapid Response Sensor Networking for Multiple Applications. The project \nwill bring together the new concept of Impromptu Wireless Network \nTechnology and emerging new sensors for use in detection and \nquantification of high priority biological and chemical materials in \nseveral nationally important settings--most significantly, for real \ntime detection and response to biological and chemical materials which \nthreaten public health and safety, environmental integrity or \nindustrial processes. I yield to Senator Nelson for a few words about \nthis important program.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator for yielding. New sensors are being \ndeveloped at the University of North Florida which use polymer membrane \nand dye combinations to create analytical sensors based on photo \ninduced charge movements. These sensors can be combined into relatively \ninexpensive easily produced families of sensors which will be able to \nrespond to a range of targeted analytes appropriate to a particular \narea of risk or interest. This makes possible and readily usable real \ntime field-based sample preparation and analysis--it will process data \nand deliver it via wireless communication to create real time models of \nsensor responses and measurements which are combined in GIS \napplications and other decision making tools to enable real time highly \neffective responses. The applications of this approach are highly \nvaried, and include: a wide range of environmental monitoring \nstrategies; early warning applications to protect food, water, and \nother systems from bioterrorism attacks; and monitoring of industrial \nprocesses.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, Senator Nelson that is correct. The University of \nNorth Florida has requested $750,000 for this important, new project \nand I request conference report language to identify this program to be \neligible for funding from the Chem-Bio Defense Initiatives Fund.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate hearing about both Senators support of this \nprogram. I will review your request and will work to include language \nin the conference report.\n\n\n        center for southeastern tropical advanced remote sensing\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise with colleague from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, to engage in a colloquy with Senator Inouye, the \nChairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Senator Nelson and I note the critical importance of the Center for \nSoutheastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing, CSTARS, at the \nUniversity of Miami, and are thankful for the support of this critical \nprogram. The university has initiated the acquisition and construction \nof this regional satellite collection, processing and analysis facility \nin partnership with the U.S. Southern Command and other academic \ninstitutions. The Center will offer unprecedented capability in the \nsoutheastern United States to link with a broad range of low-Earth \nsatellite orbiting systems. When made available to regional as well as \nto key partners like the Southern Command, these resources will provide \na unique and much-needed capacity for environmental observation, \nclimatic prediction and resource analysis, watershed and ecosystem \nassessment, and natural hazards monitoring critical to effective \nemergency response. I yield to Senator Nelson for a few words about \nthis important program.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator for yielding. CSTARS is of critical \nimportance to the state of Florida and will make a strong contribution \nto the Southern Command mission, including drug interdiction, civil \ndefense, and natural disaster mitigation.\n  The core fiscal year 2003 objectives are to complete Phase II of the \nstation infrastructure and operational capabilities and initiate \nprototype use by the U.S. Southern Command and the National Imagery and \nMapping Agency NIMA. Funds would be used to ensure direct down linking \nwith satellite orbiting systems, such as SPOT2, 4 and 5, ENVISAT, \nADEOS-II, LANDSAT and TERRA/AQUA.\n  The program is authorized is authorized in the Senate fiscal year \n2003 Defense Authorization bill and report and is funded at a level of \n$2.5 million in the House fiscal year 2003 Defense Appropriations bill \nand report. I request support for a funding level at a minimum of $2.5 \nmillion for this critical program in the conference negotiations. \nFunding reductions below that level will cause delays in the program \nand delay the benefits to SOUTHCOM and NIMA.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate being made aware of both Senators' support \nof this program and will will do what we can to find funding of a \nminimum of at least $2.5 million in the conference negotiations.\n\n\n                                  cmis\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to ask my friend, the Chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Daniel Inouye, to engage \nin a discussion of several defense programs that are of vital \nimportance to my home state of Louisiana and our national security.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I welcome a conversation with the junior Senator from \nLouisiana and the Chairwoman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have been impressed by recent efforts undertaken by \nthe Navy to create an Internet capable\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\ndatabase that would catalogue and inventory all spare parts necessary \nfor repairs to Navy aircraft. It is a fact of life that the high \nstresses Navy pilots place on their aircrafts will cause significant \nwear and tear and require repairs. The Navy, at times, has been plagued \nby difficulties in locating the whereabouts of necessary parts. To \nremedy this problem, the Navy began to work on the Configuration \nManagement Information System, or CMIS, to catalogue and inventory Navy \naircraft parts and their whereabouts. With CMIS, Navy mechanics around \nthe world, will be able to search through an Internet database to \nascertain if the needed parts can be found on site. If not, they will \nbe able to quickly learn where the nearest replacement part is located. \nWith this knowledge, mechanics know where to turn for parts rather than \nconducting scatter-shot searches throughout the Navy to look for the \npart.\n  The CMIS program was funded last year in the Senate Defense \nAppropriations bill at a level of $4,000,000. This year, the Senate \nauthorized $13,500,000 for CMIS, and the House appropriated $4,000,000 \nfor CMIS. I would hope, Senator Inouye, that you would agree on the \nneed to create a centralized database to quickly identify the location \nof necessary parts to make repairs to Navy aircraft, and I would hope \nthat you would agree that this program should be supported in \nConference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the Senator from Louisiana that we must find \nefforts to expedite the return of our aircraft to service. We should \nnot face delays in repairs because of logistical problems that could be \nsolved rather easily using modern information technology. I will take \nan interest in this matter when the House and Senate conference on this \nbill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate your support, Mr. Chairman, for CMIS. I \nwant to discuss another program that will greatly improve the \nefficiency in which our military can deploy across the globe, and in \ndoing so, save millions of dollars. The Field Pack-Up unit, or FPU, is \na containerized storage system that is 100% strategically and \ntactically mobile that far exceeds the current storage bins we use to \ntransport materiel across the country and around the world. Senator \nInouye, as you are well aware, one of the greatest factors in \ndetermining how quickly the U.S. military can deploy to a theater in \norder to respond to a threat is the simple fact that it can take \nseveral months to transport the materiel our troops need to succeed. \nThe FPU will reduce that transportation time frame, decrease the \nlogistics footprint, and allow the military to move swiftly and \nefficiently. In turn, these logistical efficiencies will save millions \nof dollars each year.\n\n  The 3rd Infantry Aviation Brigade at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia \nconducted a field test between the FPU and currently used storage bins. \nThe 3rd Infantry Brigade determined that if the entire Brigade deployed \nto Kuwait, 2 C-5s would be needed using the FPU. Using traditional \nstorage bins, 8 C-5s would be necessary to mobilize to Kuwait. The FPUs \nwould save at least $3,000,000 per deployment, according to the 3rd \nInfantry Brigade.\n  I am concerned, however, that the Army has not dedicated funds toward \nthis transformational program that will greatly reduce the logistics \nfootprint and save millions of dollars each year. Last year, the Senate \nappropriated $5,000,000 for the FPU, but neither the House nor Senate \nfunded the program this year. Senator Inouye, I know you are a champion \nof transformation, and I hope you would be willing to consider the \nutility the FPU could provide to our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The FPU is a great improvement to our logistics \ncapabilities and the money saving potential is quite promising. You are \ncorrect to note that the time in which we respond to threats is largely \ndetermined by the rate in which we can mobilize our troops and \ntransport the materiel necessary for them to do their jobs. I do look \nforward to working with you in the future on this promising program.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. Chairman, I am also concerned about a health and \nwelfare issue for our troops on the battlefield. We must ensure that we \nare providing them with the most nutritional meals possible to optimize \ntheir war fighting capabilities. The fatigue and stresses on the bodies \nof our war-fighters are unlike anything the average person could \nimagine. We must provide our troops with nutritious foods that provide \nnecessary energy and are tailored to meet the rigors of combat. We \ncannot place our troops in unnecessary danger because of equipment \nfailures, nor because the food they are consuming in combat does not \nprovide them with the proper nutrition.\n  For several years the United States Army has been working on a Food \nNutrition Program in conjunction with the Pennington Biomedical \nResearch Center. The focus of this research is to develop meals that \ncan be eaten on the battlefield which provide our troops with the \nnutrients necessary to fuel their bodies to meet the grueling demands \nof war-fighting. Senator Inouye, would you agree that this research \nshould continue so we can optimize the performance of our troops?\n  Mr. INOUYE. While rations have improved significantly since my \nservice in World War II, there is always room for improvement. Well \nnourished soldiers fight better. It is that simple. I believe that this \nresearch is valuable to ensuring the combat capability of our troops.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, shares my concern about the future threats to our military \nand nation. As chairwoman of the Armed Services Committee's \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats, it has become very clear to me that \nwhile the current threats seem to come form madmen with explosives, \ntomorrow's terrorists may very well use cyberwarfare. For this reason, \nLouisiana and Georgia have been participating in a program known as the \nPicket Fence Initiative. It has brought together the Department of \nDefense, the Louisiana State Government, the federal presence within \nthe state, as well as industries with responsibility for critical \ninfrastructure. Together, we have established a collaborative network \nthat monitors the types and methodologies of on-going cyber attacks \nagainst these systems. Through these efforts, the Department of Defense \nis learning about the nature and variety of attacks on Louisiana's \ncritical information networks, while companies and the Louisiana State \ngovernment benefit from improved security technology. It is the kind of \ncooperative enterprise that should be a model for future homeland \ndefense efforts. This program was authorized this year for $4.5 \nmillion, and has been appropriated $2 million in the House mark. \nAlthough we were unable to find additional funds within our bill to \nfully fund this program, I hope the Chairman will help me to protect \nthe $2 million in the House mark, and look for any additional funds \nthat may be made available during conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I share Senator Landrieu's concern about \ncyber-security, and agree that cooperative efforts like Picket Fence \nare an effective way for us to address the problem. I hope that we may \nfind additional resources for this program at a later date.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii for taking time to participate in this colloquy. His \nleadership and management of this bill have been excellent. The people \nof Louisiana, Hawaii, and the United States are grateful for his \nlifetime of service to our Nation.\n\n\n                              armed pilots\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, if I could have the \nattention of the Republican Leader for just a moment. I say to the \nleader, I had considered offering my armed pilots amendment on this \nbill, but after our discussions, and with the assurances that to the \nextent possible this would be one of the first items of business when \nwe consider the homeland defense bill, I have agreed to withhold.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the senior Senator from New Hampshire. He has led \nthe charge on the issue of arming pilots. I agree that this should be \none of the first items that we consider on the homeland defense bill. \nIt is my intention that this would be one of the first amendments \noffered from our side on the homeland defense bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the leader. I know he is as \nconcerned about safety in our skies as I am, and I appreciate his \nsupport. I look\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nforward to passing this important bipartisan initiative when we return \nfrom the August recess.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President: It is widely recognized that the Coast \nGuard is the nation's principal defense against illicit drug shipping \nand must become a barrier to terrorist attacks in which explosives or \nweapons of mass destruction may be headed for an American city on a \nship or fast boat. I join with the distinguished Chair of the Defense \nSubcommittee, in commending the Senator from Alaska for his leadership \nrole in establishing the HITRON mission in the United States Coast \nGuard.\n  The current fleet of eight MH-68A helicopters is stationed in \nJacksonville, Florida and is active in the Caribbean. The fleet was \ntemporarily deployed at the U.S. Coast Guard Station in San Diego for a \ndemonstration. It was a complete success and as a result, Congressman \nBob Filner recently wrote the Commandant urging that he extend the \ncurrent lease of eight or more MH-68A helicopters until a permanent \nDeepWater replacement is selected.\n  Both Congressman Filner and I agree there is a critical requirement \nfor off shore drug interdiction along the Mexican-Southern California \ncoastline. Further, these helicopters can add anti-terrorist protection \nfor the Port of San Diego. Therefore, based on the assumption the Coast \nGuard has the legal authority to enter this lease, I urge my colleagues \nto support extension of 5-year lease for eight MH-68 helicopters.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer the Budget Committee's \nofficial scoring of H.R. 5010, the Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  H.R. 5010 provides $355.139 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, all classified as defense spending, which will result in new \noutlays in 2003 of $239.472 billion. When outlays from prior-year \nbudget authority are taken into account, nonemergency discretionary \noutlays for the Senate bill total $349.777 billion in 2003.\n  The Appropriations Committee voted 29-0 on June 27 to adopt a set of \nnon-binding sub-allocations for its 13 subcommittees totaling $768.1 \nbillion in budget authority and $793.1 billion in outlays, which the \ncommittee subsequently increased to $803.891 billion in outlays \nfollowing the passage of the 2002 emergency supplementary bill. While \nthe committee's subcommittee allocations are consistent with both the \namendment supported by 59 Senators last month and with the President's \nrequest for total discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2003, \nthey are not enforceable under either Senate budget rules or the \nBalanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. While I applaud the \ncommittee for adopting its own set of sub-allocations, I urge the \nSenate to take up and pass the bipartisan resolution, which would make \nthe committee's sub-allocations enforceable under Senate rules and \nprovide for other important budgetary disciplines.\n  For the Defense Subcommittee, the full committee allocated $355.139 \nbillion in budget authority and $350,549 billion in total outlays for \n2003. The bill reported by the full committee on July 18 is fully \nconsistent with that allocation. In addition, H.R. 5010 does not \ninclude any emergency designations or advance appropriations.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of H.R. 5010 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        H.R. 5010, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Defense   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.....................    355,139        278    355,417\n  Outlays..............................    349,777        278    350,055\nSenate committee allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.....................    355,139        278    355,417\n  Outlays..............................    350,549        278    350,827\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority.....................    354,446        278    354,724\n  Outlays..............................    349,315        278    349,593\nPresident's request: \\2\\\n  Budget Authority.....................    366,592        278    366,870\n  Outlays..............................    354,754        278    355,032\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate committee allocation:\n  Budget Authority.....................          0          0          0\n  Outlays..............................       -772          0       -772\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority.....................        693          0        693\n  Outlays..............................        462          0        462\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.....................    -11,453          0    -11,453\n  Outlays..............................     -4,977          0     -4,977\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Senate has not adopted a 302(a) allocation for the\n  Appropriations Committee.

Mr. President, there is no problem which more directly \naffects the security of our forces in the Middle East and particularly \nin Afghanistan than our ability to communicate with the local \npopulation. To solve this problem we must enhance DoD support on two \ntechnologies that are being sorely neglected--digital satellite radios \nand the solar panels which can permanently power them anywhere.\n  As a result of two satellites launched in the past three years there \nis now complete 64 channel digital radio satellite coverage of the \nentire middle east, Asia, and Africa. In parts of the Middle East such \nas Afghanistan there is double satellite coverage and therefore 128 \nclear highest fidelity radio broadcast channels are available. \nUnfortunately until now our government has made little use of this \ntechnology which the private sector has already bought and paid for. \nThis means that a superior method of communicating in the Middle East \nis not being used to support our troops who are or will be serving \nthere.\n  What is virtually needed is a DoD program to jump start the \ndissemination of these satellite radio receivers to the local \npopulation surrounding our troops so that our messages of democracy and \nfreedom can be brought to them in a variety of formats. Our troops \nvitally need the added security that the resulting increased local \nsupport for their mission will bring. Our troops also need periodically \nthe ability to communicate directly with these people.\n  A jump start DoD program of adequate size to buy and disseminate or \nsubsidize the price of receivers would lower their price to the point \nwhere the market would complete the job. Failure to start this process \nnow would be tragically shortsighted.\n  A second private sector technology now being inadequately supported \nor neglected by our government is the solar panel technology which can \npermanently power these receivers wherever they are located. Both solar \npanels and widely available kerosene can be used to power these \nreceivers in a region where both batteries and electricity are both \ncritically scare.\n  Afghanistan is a communications wasteland. Barely 30 percent of the \npopulation can read. Only 3 people in every 1,000 have a TV set; only 6 \nin every thousand have a radio. Given these statistics it is little \nwonder that a central government has so little power and regional \nwarlords are so great a threat. The warlords have the megaphone and the \nsecurity of our troops is severely imperiled as a result.\n  By contrast in both Iran and Iraq are over 70 TV's and 200 radios for \neach thousand people--still very low by western standards, but a huge \nmultiple of the mass media now available in Afghanistan. In those \ncountries we face different problems--a hostile state-controlled media \nand hostile governments which can jam our terrestrial transmissions. \nThese are problems which increased DoD and U.S. government support for \nsatellite radio could also solve.\n  I do not claim that our current efforts are non-existence. They are \njust hopelessly inadequate to the task at hand. When we first went into \nAfghanistan we dropped leaflets and relief packages containing single \nchannel short wave radios many of which broke when they hit the ground. \nIn a country where illiteracy rate is so high, the impact of any \nwritten material seems questionable. We sent C-130's to fly over areas \nwhere our troops were to broadcast to the single channel radios that \nsurvived the air drop. Now we are also spending considerable amounts of \nDoD and other money to build terrestrial transmitters to broadcast to \nthe few radios that do exist in the country. These are laudable efforts \nbut demonstrably inadequate to confront the task\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nbefore us. The comparative superiority of satellite radio in remote \nAfghanistan was demonstrated early this year by the enthusiastic \nresponse of our troops there who listened to the Superbowl thanks to \n1,000 privately donated satellite receivers.\n\n  I earnestly request my chairman and ranking member to address this \nurgent matter of support for satellite radio both in the conference and \nin the conference report. I had planned to offer an amendment to begin \nto achieve the needed results. However, I realize we are not earmarking \nmoney as the House did in its bill. I do know that there is substantial \nsupport the House and the administration for satellite radio as an \nessential weapon in the war to combat terrorism and increase the \nsecurity of our troops abroad. The investment required is small \ncompared to the additional expense required on arms where we do not \nhave adequate local support.\n  I also know existing programs and special interests will swallow up \nas much money as they can get. Thus a vital technology and existing \ncapability like satellite radio will very likely suffer from \ninattention and neglect to the vast impairment of our overall war \neffort without some specific direction from us. I urge my colleagues in \nthe conference not to let this happen. Please give satellite radio \ntechnology the specific and concrete support it needs and deserves.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to express my strong support for Senator \nBurns' remarks on the importance of DoD support for satellite radio \ntechnology and to get satellite receivers disseminated to the local \npopulations where our troops are located. Their security and support is \nobviously of paramount concern to each and every one of us. This is one \narea upon both of our parties are in complete agreement.\n  I urgently hope that the conferees will work in the DoD bill to \nenhance and strengthen this superior method of mass communication via \nsatellite radio which offers such promise in so many ways and in so \nmany areas of the third world. Our existing approaches clearly fall \ncritically short of meeting the urgent need to get our message heard. \nThe time for action is now. We will pay a high price for any further \ndelay.\n  I come to the floor today to join in discussion of a very important \nissue with the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  The Defense Appropriations bill before us will provide $20,470,000 \nfor historically black colleges and universities. This is a relatively \nsmall part of the overall defense bill, but an important part, \nbeneficial to both the Defense Department and the universities.\n  Senators from many states, particularly those from states which are \nhome to a historically black college or university, have always come \ntogether to support any initiative which would greatly benefit our \nyoung African Americans and thus, our country. Just such an opportunity \nwas presented to us recently by the Air Force Research Laboratories at \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.\n  The program assigns defense research projects to historically black \nuniversities, including Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, \nand other universities in Texas, Alabama, and Georgia to undertake work \nidentified by the Defense Department. These universities and their \nstudents also team with small businesses to accomplish a major portion \nof the work.\n  The benefits of this program are many, beginning with greater \nopportunities for these schools, and extending the range of options \nstudents have for their career choices. There may even be the added \nbenefit that these students may choose to join their military peers \nfull time. We know that by 2006, two out of every five federal \nemployees will be eligible for retirement. We will have to find a new \npool of talent who wants to work in federal service.\n  We also know that only 15 percent of African Americans are earning \ncollege degrees. For comparison, this percentage is two-thirds higher \nfor white Americans. We also know that African Americans who earn an \nadvanced degree can nearly double their annual average salary. Clearly, \nsteering more African American students into the science and \nengineering field is one way to accomplish this goal. The U.S. \ngovernment will also benefit by bringing these students into the field \nof defense research.\n  I ask the Chairman, wouldn't you agree that this is the kind of \nprogram that should be funded through appropriations for HBCU?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator from Louisiana is correct. This program \ncertainly seems to be in line with the types of projects funded under \nHBCU. I would encourage the Department of Defense to support the \nprogram the Senator from Louisiana has identified.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chairman. I also thank Southern University \nfor the wonderful work they do. This college started in 1880 with just \n12 students and 5 faculty. It has grown to become a university with \nthree campuses, offering 152 degree programs and a law school.\n  This is typical of the huge success stories we find among many of the \nhistorically black colleges and universities all over the United \nStates. This program which I encourage today, will allow them to take \nan even greater step into uncharted territory and be a competitive \nforce in the defense research field.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, the \nesteemed chair and ranking member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee in supporting the withdrawal of the McCain amendment, \nwhich would unwisely scuttle an important program that was approved \nlast year on this same bill by the Senate in an overwhelming 94-4 vote.\n  I further applaud the Senator for the amendment that he successfully \nincluded into this bill that would require that the transport lease \nprogram will be fair, open and competitive and conform to the \nCompetition and Contracting Act.\n  However, I think that the Senator from Arizona is off the mark in his \nattempts to undermine this particular program. The transport plane \nlease program approved last year is a much-needed priority, and it has \nbeen specifically requested by the Department of Defense and the Air \nForce.\n  These transport planes are a crucial element of an efficient \ndeployment of our national security strategy and they are in dire need \nof modernization.\n  At any given time, world events may require the Nation's leaders to \nbe dispatched simultaneously on diplomatic missions. These missions are \nessential in peace and war when diplomacy and negotiation become \ncritical to the settlement of conflict, whether in the Middle East, the \nsub-continent, Bosnia, or the myriad other hot spots in which U.S. \nleadership is necessary to calming conflict and saving lives.\n  To get these leaders to the places, we need transport aircraft that \nare efficient, modern and up to the task.\n  Both physical and communications security are integral to the mission \nbecause principals and their staffs must conduct business en route. In \naddition, mission protocol dictates the frequent use of civilian \nairports, which require commercial planes.\n  The Air Force and the Administration needs these planes, and the Air \nForce and our esteemed colleagues in the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee have developed a creative and effective solution that will \nmeet this need: an operating lease.\n  The leasing option would allow the Air Force to amortize the majority \nof upfront acquisition costs over the life of lease, and at no \nadditional cost, since the leasing money comes from existing operation \nand maintenance funds. This allows flexibility by allowing the Air \nForce to purchase the aircraft at any point in the lease, and also \naccelerates the acquisition while maintaining existing procurement \npriorities.\n  We need planes, and particularly given the current geopolitical \ncontext, including crises in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and the \nMiddle East, we need them now. The leasing program that was \noverwhelmingly by this Chamber last year was the right thing to do then \nand it continues to be the right thing to do.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to support the withdrawal of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I am opposed to the McCain amendment which would attempt to redefine \nan issue the entire Congress has already endorsed and the President has \nsigned into law.\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\n  I spoke about this amendment last evening and will only make brief \nremarks today.\n  I want to begin by associating myself with the remarks of Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye. Both of these Senators have committed an \nenormous amount of time to work on this important issue. I know, all \nSenators know, that when Senator Dan Inouye and Senator Ted Stevens \nspeak about tankers, their ultimate interest is the safety of the men \nand women in uniform who are protecting our country. I am proud to have \nworked closely with Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens to win approval \nfor the leasing provisions in last year's Defense Appropriations \nmeasure.\n  Senator McCain ask the Senate to again require authorization for the \nlease of aircraft. Senator McCain's language is specific to the \nproposed 737 lease but his rhetoric and his ultimate objective is to \nscuttle any potential lease deal regardless of whether it is for a 737 \naircraft or 767 aircraft.\n  As I stated last evening, I am puzzled that this issue continues to \ncome up.\n  Not long ago, the Senate considered the Defense Authorization \nlegislation. The Senator from Arizona sits on the committee. That was \nthe bill to have this debate. This Senator complains that the \nAppropriations bill is the wrong place to authorize. Yet, here we are \nconsidering an authorizing amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona on an appropriations bill. It makes little sense to me. This is \nthe wrong place to have this debate.\n  The Senator wants to scuttle the 737 lease recently announced by the \nAir Force. Importantly, that lease deal has been sent to the Armed \nServices Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in both \nthe House and Senate for review and comment. And, it is my \nunderstanding, that all four panels have reviewed and approved of the \nlease and the Air Force justification for the lease.\n  Last year, both the Senate and the House supported the language in \nthe Defense Appropriations bill giving the Air Force the authority to \nmove forward with lease discussions. The President signed the bill into \nlaw after the provisions were carefully scrutinized by the Office of \nManagement and Budget. And now, with an actual lease deal proposed, the \nfour relevant panels have signed off on an actual deal.\n  Yet, the Senator from Arizona persists in his attempts to scuttle an \nAir Force lease. Senator McCain has succeeded in making sure that this \nissue is thoroughly reviewed. It has been reviewed. The Senator clearly \ndoes not like the outcome of the review and he now wants the Senate to \nstart the process over again and give him additional time to delay a \nlegitimate need of our military.\n  The Senator also talks about competition. Here's what is really at \nstake. The Senator from Arizona wants to open the doors to the Air \nForce and the Department of Defense to Airbus. One U.S. company \nmanufactures commercial aircraft of this type. One and only one U.S. \ncompany can meet the Air Force needs.\n  The Senator is not talking about asking the Air Force to choose \nbetween Ford and Chevrolet. The Senator from Arizona is asking the \nSenate to decide whether U.S. workers or European workers will \nmanufacture U.S. military aircraft. That's a simple choice for me. U.S. \ntaxpayers should not be asked to undermine the lone U.S. manufacturer \nof aircraft. U.S. taxpayers should not be asked to subsidize Airbus.\n  I want to remind my colleagues again what the Secretary of the Air \nForce, James Roche, wrote to me in a letter on the tanker issue, quote: \n``The KC-135 fleet is the backbone of our Nation's Global Reach. But \nwith an average age of over 41 years, coupled with the increasing \nexpense required to maintain them, it is readily apparent that we must \nstart replacing these critical assets. I strong endorse beginning to \nupgrade this critical warfighting capability with new Boeing 767 tanker \naircraft.''\n  Those are the words of the Secretary of the Air Force. The Air Force \nwants to move forward with the lease option. Congress voted for the \nlease last year. The President signed the lease option into law. And \nthe relevant committees have just approved the lease terms proposed by \nthe Air Force for 737 aircraft.\n  I encourage my colleagues to again support this important option to \nlease aircraft, to get assets into the field that are of great \nimportance to our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address the subject of our \nNation's security needs in the context of the Defense appropriations \nbill presently before the Senate.\n  I believe we must provide the best possible training, equipment, and \npreparation for our military forces, so they can effectively carry out \nwhatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, war-fighting, or other missions \nthey are given. They deserve the targeted pay raises of 4.1-6.5 \npercent, the incentive pay for difficult-to-fill assignments, and the \nreduced out-of-pocket housing costs from the current 11.3 percent to \n7.5 percent contained in this bill. The bill would also fully fund \nactive and reserve end strengths, including an additional 724 positions \nfor the Army National Guard, which will hopefully ease the current \nburden on our over-stretched men and women in uniform. For many years \nrunning, those in our armed forces have been suffering from a declining \nquality of life, despite rising military Pentagon budgets. The pressing \nneeds of our dedicated men and women in uniform, and those of their \nfamilies, must be addressed as they continue to be mobilized in the war \nagainst terrorism. This bill goes far in addressing those needs, and I \nwill vote for it today.\n  I am also supporting the bill because it contains two important \namendments that I offered. The first would bar any funds in this bill \nfrom being used to enter defense contracts with U.S. companies who \nincorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Former U.S. companies who have renounced their citizenship currently \nhold at least $2 billion worth of contracts with the Federal \nGovernment. I do not believe that companies who aren't willing to pay \ntheir fair share of taxes should be able to hold these contracts. U.S. \ncompanies, who play by the rules, who pay their fair share of taxes, \nshould not be forced to compete with bad actors who can undercut their \nbids because of a tax loophole.\n  In the last couple of years a number of prominent U.S. corporations, \nusing creative paperwork, have transformed themselves into Bermuda \ncorporations purely to avoid paying their share of U.S. taxes. These \nnew Bermuda companies are basically shell corporations: they have no \nstaff, no offices, and no business activity in Bermuda. They exist for \nthe sole purpose of shielding income from the IRS.\n  U.S. tax law contains many provisions designed to expose such \ncreative accounting and to require U.S. companies that are foreign in \nname only to pay the same taxes as other domestic corporations. But \nthese bad corporate former-citizens exploit a specific loophole in \ncurrent law so that the company is treated as foreign for tax purposes, \nand therefore pays no U.S. taxes on its foreign income.\n  The loophole gives tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks to major \nmultinational companies with significant non-U.S. business. It also \nputs other U.S. companies unwilling or unable to use this loophole at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. No American company should be penalized \nstaying put while others renounce U.S. ``citizenship'' for a tax break.\n  Well, the problem with all this is that when these companies don't \npay their fair share, the rest of American tax payers and businesses \nare stuck with the bill. I think I can safely say that very few of the \nsmall businesses that I visit in Detroit Lakes, MN, or Mankato, in \nMinneapolis, or Duluth can avail themselves of the Bermuda Triangle.\n  They can't afford the big name tax lawyers and accountants to show \nthem how to do their books Enron-style but they probably wouldn't want \nto anyway if it meant renouncing their citizenship. So the price they \npay for their good citizenship is a higher tax bill.\n  My amendment closes this loophole. We all make sacrifices in a time \nof war, the only sacrifice this amendment asks of Federal contractors \nis that they pay their fair share of taxes like everybody else.\n  The bill also contains a second amendment which would significantly \nimprove the Department's response to domestic violence. I was deeply \nconcerned to hear about the four domestic\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nviolence homicides that occurred over the past six weeks at Fort Bragg \nin North Carolina. But these incidents, while unusual in that they are \nclustered within such a short time, are not unique. The military \nreports 207 domestic violence homicides since 1995.\n  My amendment, which is based on the recommendations of the \nDepartment's Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence, would ensure that \nfunds are available to establish an impartial, multi-disciplinary \nDomestic Violence Fatality Review Team at the Military Community and \nFamily Policy Office. It would also help the Department ensure that \nthere are victim's advocates at every military installation to provide \nconfidential support and guidance exclusively to victims, by providing \n$10 million for this purpose. Finally, the amendment would require that \nthe Secretary report to Congress on progress in implementing the \nrecommendations of the Task Force.\n  In the introduction to its first report, the Task Force wrote, \n``Domestic Violence is an offense against the institutional values of \nthe Military Services of the United States of America. It is an affront \nto human dignity, degrades the overall readiness of our armed forces, \nand will not be tolerated in the Department of Defense.'' I do not \nthink anyone who has followed the recent events in North Carolina would \ndisagree.\n  I also believe the bill addresses some of the serious flaws in the \nprocess by which the Defense Department summarily terminated the \nCrusader Artillery system. I strongly believe in fair, transparent, and \ninformed government-decision making processes, which did not occur in \nthe case of the Crusader. Three Defense secretaries, three Army \nsecretaries, and three Army chiefs of staff, as well as numerous \nadministration officials, testified in support of the Crusader. Yet \nwithin a few weeks of this testimony, the Secretary of Defense abruptly \nterminated the Crusader. The decision was made without consultation \nwith the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without consultation with the Army, and \nwithout consultation with members of Congress. The Defense \nAuthorization bill then required the Army Chief of Staff and Secretary \nof Defense to conduct a serious study of the best way to provide for \nthe Army's need for indirect fire support. At the same time, it \nprovided the Secretary of Defense, following the study, a full range of \noptions. These include termination to continued funding of Crusader, to \nfunding alternative systems to meet battlefield requirements. That \nreport having been completed, the bill before us expresses concern \nabout the way the termination was proposed, and instructs the Army to \nmove forward with a follow-on contract immediately to leverage the \nCrusader technology to field a lighter, more mobile cannon in 2008. \nThis is good news for the workers and officials at the United Defense \nIndustries plant in Minnesota, whose advanced skills and expertise will \nbe necessary for the success of this new cannon.\n  I also have concerns about the bill, especially about its missile \ndefense provisions. The Defense Authorization bill reported out by the \nArmed Services Committee would have cut total funding for missile \ndefense from $7.6 billion to $6.8 billion. Unfortunately, the Senate \nadopted an amendment to restore the entire $814 million, with the \nPresident given the option of spending funds on either missile defense \nprograms or on counter-terrorism. This bill retains this change. I \nwould have preferred that the cut be restored, and if not, that the \nPresident at least be required to use the funds solely for counter-\nterrorism.\n  I've long been a critic of Ballistic Missile Defense, BMD, and I \nstill have strong reservations about the feasibility, cost and \nrationale for such a system. When I addressed missile defense on the \nSenate floor on September 25, just 2 weeks after terrorists destroyed \nthe World Trade Center, I argued that pressing ahead on BMD would make \nthe U.S. less rather than more secure. Instead, I suggested the Senate \ngive homeland defense the high priority it deserves by transferring \nfunds to it from missile defense programs. But the administration \nobviously didn't agree and approved only $26 million.\n  In conclusion, I believe in maintaining a strong national defense. We \nface a number of credible threats in the world today, including \nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We must \nmake sure we carefully identify the threats we face and tailor our \ndefense spending to meet them. We could do a better job of that than \nthis bill does, and I hope that as we move to conference, the committee \nwill make every effort to transfer funds from relatively low-priority \nprograms to those designed to meet the urgent and immediate anti-\nterrorism and defense of our forces.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nis of great importance to me, the retention of key military personnel \nin our Armed Forces. It has been brought to my attention that in order \nfor us to retain top notch military personnel, we need to, among other \nthings, improve the quality of family life on our military bases. I \nbelieve that we need to do everything in our power to improve the \nmorale and welfare of our military personnel and their families. I also \ncommend the President and the managers of this bill, as I believe this \nyear's Department of Defense appropriations bill goes a long way to \nthis end.\n  In working toward this, we should do what we can to provide our Armed \nForces with access to training in cutting-edge technologies. We can \nimprove the quality of military family life, while at the same time \nprovide military personnel and their families with valuable lifelong \nemployable technological skill sets. This may even have the ancillary \nbenefit of providing families and service personnel technology training \napplicable in both military and civilian settings and could help \nprovide service personnel and their family members with the \ntechnological currency critical to excelling in today's society as Web \ndesigners, 3-D animators, programmers, media artists.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces, whether they be active duty, \nGuard or Reserve, stand ready to aid both State and Nation when called \nupon. They come from all walks of life and all corners of this great \ncountry. They sacrifice time with their families, so that when they are \ncalled upon, both here and abroad, they honor the call and give their \nvery best to those they serve. I believe that it is our duty to honor \ntheir commitment to us by providing them with the tools they need to be \ntheir best and the resources they need to compete in today's \ncompetitive environment.\n  Unfortunately due to funding constraints and the numerous worthy \nprograms included in this year's bill, funding was not available for a \ncouple of projects which may have value in this regard. I hope Congress \ngives consideration to these programs next year.\n  I want to make sure that during this time, when we are spending so \nmuch funding on equipment, ammunition, etc., and rightly so, that we do \nnot lose sight of the importance of quality of life issues. We can have \nall of the cutting-edge technology and fancy machinery that money can \nbuy, but it means nothing and is useless without our brave men and \nwomen behind it.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in a few moments, Senators will be called \nupon to cast their votes on the Defense appropriations bill. At this \nmoment, I wish to express my gratitude to the Senator from Alaska for \nhis cooperation in moving this bill through the Senate.\n  This is a massive spending bill totaling more than $355 billion. With \nthe cooperation of Senator Stevens and his Republican colleagues, we \nwere able to work through the issues of this bill with comity and a \nminimum of controversy. The defense of our Nation is too important to \nbe a matter of partisan politics. My friend, Senator Stevens, knows \nthat and follows that in all of his actions, and so I thank him and his \nstaff for all their hard work: His chief assistant, Mr. Steve Cortese, \nand Ms. Sid Ashworth, Mr. Kraig Siracuse, Ms. Alycia Farrell, and Ms. \nNicole Royal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the hard work of my \nstaff. They put in very long hours year round but especially as we seek \nto act on the annual appropriations bill. I express my deep gratitude \nto them as well: Mr. Charles Houy, Mr. David Morrison, Ms. Susan Hogan, \nMs. Mazie Mattson, Mr. Tom Hawkins, Ms. Lesley Kalen, Ms. Menda Fife, \nand Ms. Betsy Schmid.\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n  Mr. President, finally I say to all my colleagues, this is a very \ngood bill, and I urge all Senators to vote for it.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me a minute?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, Scriptures say:\n\n       Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand \n     before kings. . . .\n\n  These two Senators are diligent in their business. They are \nexperienced legislative craftsmen, and they have studied this subject \nfor many years. In defense of our country, they have traveled all over \nthe globe searching for answers to questions, searching for solutions \nto problems, and coming back to the Senate and applying their \nexperience, their knowledge to the problems at hand. The Senate is in \ntheir debt.\n  I personally thank them for the good work they have done on this \nbill, the good work they always do. The Nation is in their debt. I \nthank them both.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the committee-reported substitute is agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, H.R. 5010, as \namended, pass? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee moved \nexpeditiously to consider Judge Henry Autrey despite the poor treatment \nof President Clinton's nominees in the same circumstances. I mention \nthis because this vacancy is special. It is a vacancy to which Justice \nRonnie White should have been confirmed. But in October of 1999, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, marched from a \nclosed-door meeting to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White, the \nfirst African American Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, after his \nnomination to the District Court had been kept waiting for 2 years--2 \nyears here in the Senate; actually kept on the Executive Calendar \npending for 9 months.\n  I mention this because, with all the unfair criticism of Majority \nLeader Daschle, who has been moving judges through at a much faster \npace than was done prior to him becoming majority leader, I just want \nto contrast the difference between that action and the one on this \nnomination, where we are going to confirm Judge Autrey to the Federal \nbench in Missouri.\n  It shows, also, Senator Carnahan showed far more grace in helping us \nmove this nominee forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, first my appreciation to the President for \nnominating Judge Autrey. My thanks to Chairman Leahy and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for voting unanimously to confirm him.\n  We will have discussions about other procedures and other activities \nin a different forum. In this forum, I express my strongest support and \nhighest confidence that this candidate respects the role of judges in \nour system of government--the job being to interpret the job rather \nthan to legislate it.\n  Permit me to tell you that Judge Henry Autrey currently serves as a \ncircuit court judge for the 22nd Judicial Circuit for the State of \nMissouri, City of St. Louis. Judge Autrey served with distinction as an \nassociate circuit judge beginning in 1986, a position to which he was \nappointed by then-Governor, John Ashcroft. He was later promoted to the \nfull circuit bench by then-Governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan.\n  As a sitting judge for over 15 years, Judge Autrey has displayed an \nunwavering commitment to honesty and approachability, earning a \nreputation as a thoughtful and hard-working judge with a judicious \ntemperament.\n  Prior to his service on the bench, he served as a prosecutor in the \nCity of\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nSt. Louis for 9 years, won convictions in several high-profile cases, \nand led the office in its work in the area of child abuse prosecution.\n  His entire career has been spent in the courtroom and therefore he \nexemplifies someone who has both the personal qualities and the \nexperience to fill this spot and perform this duty in an exemplary \nmanner. He is highly regarded by the law enforcement community in St. \nLouis. Countless attorneys have expressed their support for him. He has \nthe support of the Mound City Bar Association of St. Louis, the \nMissouri Prosecuting Attorneys, and the Women Lawyers Association of \nGreater St. Louis.\n  He is an ideal candidate for the position.\n  I appreciate the Senate proceeding to this nomination, and I urge my \ncolleagues to give Judge Autrey their favorable consideration. I \nreserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I inform my colleagues when we conclude this series of \nvotes, whatever the number may be--and we will clarify that after this \nvote--that will conclude the rollcalls for this week. So I urge my \ncolleagues to stay on the floor.\n  This is a 10-minute vote, and whatever additional votes will be 10-\nminute votes. If we have to wait 15 or 20 minutes, it just prolongs the \ntime until we will have completed our work on this block of votes and \nthen, therefore, the final, official vote of the week.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stay on the floor and respond to the votes \nas their names are called.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Henry E. Autrey to the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District \nof Missouri.\n  I have enjoyed reviewing Judge Autrey's distinguished legal record, \nand I am confident that he will make a fine Federal judge.\n  Judge Autrey is no stranger to the citizens of eastern Missouri. He \nhas strong roots in the city of St. Louis, having graduated from the \nUniversity of St. Louis School of Law and having served in the city's \nOffice of the Circuit Attorney, where he prosecuted a variety of \ncriminal cases and later acted as the First Assistant Circuit Attorney. \nHe also served on the Rape Trial Task Force and created the first child \nabuse unit in the Office of the Circuit Attorney. From 1991 to 1997 he \nserved as Adjunct Professor of Law at St. Louis University School of \nLaw.\n  Judge Autrey's prosecutorial excellence attracted the attention of \nboth Republican Governor John Ashcoft, who appointed him as an \nAssociate Circuit Judge on the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis \nin 1986, and Democratic Governor Mel Carnahan, who elevated him to \nCircuit Court Judge in 1997. Judge Autrey's judicial experience on the \nState bench will serve him well in the district court.\n  Judge Autrey is described by associates as a judge who ``work[s] very \nhard to ensure that justice is provided to all'' and as a ``smart and \nhard-working jurist.'' He merited an ABA rating of ``Unanimous \nQualified,'' and I fully expect him to serve with distinction on the \nFederal bench in Missouri.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee moved \nexpeditiously to consider Judge Henry Autrey as it has with so many of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. We have done so despite the poor \ntreatment of President Clinton's nominees by the Republicans when they \nwere in the majority from 1995 through the first half of 2001.\n  The vacancy being filled by this nomination is special. This is the \nvacancy that Justice Ronnie White should have been confirmed to fill. \nBut on October 5, 1999, Republicans marched from their closed-door \nmeeting to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White. This, even \nthough he had been favorably reported twice by the Judiciary Committee \nwith the apparent backing of from four and seven of the Republicans who \nserved on the committee.\n  I remember the treatment of Ronnie White very well, as do people in \nMissouri, I am sure. I recall the efforts made by Gov. Mel Carnahan on \nJustice White's behalf and how hard I had to work as the ranking \nDemocrat to get his nomination reported to the floor, not once but \ntwice, and to secure a floor vote after the nomination had been pending \n2 years and had been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for 9 \nmonths.\n  It has now been been almost 5 years since anyone nominated to the \nFederal district court in Missouri has been confirmed. The vacancy to \nwhich Judge Autrey has been nominated has been vacant even longer--\nsince December 1996, when the late Judge Gunn took senior status. \nPresident Clinton nominated Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White \nto this vacancy in June 1997. He had to wait nearly a year for a \nhearing, until May 1998. The committee reported the nomination \nfavorably to the Senate with only three negative votes of the 18 \nmembers of the committee. But his nomination sat waiting for a full \nSenate vote, and, having never received one, was sent back to President \nClinton at the end of the 105th Congress after languishing for 6 months \non the Senate floor without action.\n  The President renominated Justice White in January of 1999. He was \nvoted out of the committee a second time in July with at least four of \nthe Republicans on the committee in apparent support of the nomination. \nAfter a great deal of effort on the part of Democratic Senators, I \nthought we had secured for him a fair floor vote. Instead, on October \n5, 1999, the Republican-controlled Senate ambushed Justice White's \nnomination for partisan gain. As is by now a well-known story, Ronnie \nWhite was the victim of a sneak attack on that day. He was defeated on \nan unprecedented party-line Senate vote and was branded ``pro-\ncriminal.'' These issues were aired during the confirmation hearing of \nJohn Ashcroft last year. Senator Specter, to his credit, offered an \napology to Justice White for the way he was treated.\n  When there is so much unfair criticism of the way Majority Leader \nDaschle and I have been handling nominations since the change in Senate \ncontrol last July, I mention this to help contrast the treatment of \njudicial nominees by Democrats and Republicans. As I have said from the \noutset, the Democratic majority is treating President Bush's nominees \nmore fairly and moving more of them more quickly than the Republican \nmajority acted with respect to President Clinton's nominees. That is \nundeniable and today, in yet another example of the stark contrast in \nour approaches and our actions, we will join to confirm Judge Autrey to \nthe Federal bench in Missouri.\n  I commend, in particular, Senator Carnahan for her support of the \nfair treatment of Judge Autrey, despite the unfair way Justice White \nhad been treated. Her actions underscore for us what we all know about \nher that she is a person of character and grace, willing to work on a \nbipartisan basis in the best interests of the State of Missouri.\n  With today's vote on the nomination of Judge Henry Autrey to the \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri, the Democratic-led \nSenate will have confirmed a total of 65 judicial nominees since the \nchange in Senate majority 1 year ago. The Senate has now confirmed more \nnominees in a little more than 1 year than were confirmed in any year \nduring the past 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, from \n1995 through 2001. For that matter, we have confirmed more judges than \nwere confirmed in 1996 and 1997 combined. Contrast the 65 judges \nconfirmed by the Democratic Senate with the Republican average, during \ntheir past 6\\1/2\\ years of control, of confirming only 38 judges a \nyear.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today \nand commend Senator Carnahan and Majority Leader Daschle for all they \nhave done to bring us to this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. BOND. I yield my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield any time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Henry E. Autrey, of Missouri, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid on the table, and the President will be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is now my intention to go to seven \nadditional district court nominees. Senator Leahy and the Judiciary \nCommittee have done an extraordinary job of reporting these out. They \nhave been on the calendar. And it is certainly Senator Leahy's \nprerogative to ask for a rollcall vote on each nominee.\n  He and I have discussed this matter, and I would ask the Senator from \nVermont, the distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, about the \nneed to have additional rollcalls for each of these district judges.\n  I yield the floor for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell the distinguished majority leader, \nthe only concern I have had about having rollcall votes is, a couple \ntimes we have taken a group of these and had voice votes, with seven, \neight going through, and the next day my good friends on the other side \nof the aisle and the White House have had a press release saying we \nhave not had a single judge voted on in weeks in the Senate. I think \nthey only notice it if there is a rollcall vote.\n  I ask my friend, the majority leader, if we do these 7, am I correct \nthat would mean we will have confirmed 72 judges in less than 13 \nmonths?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is the current count, 72 district \nand circuit court judges over that period of time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe that sets sort of a record for the last 5 or 6 \nyears, in any event.\n  Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues have the sprint-for-the-\nairport look in their eye, trying to get home.\n  I am willing to sacrifice my time and spend the next month, the month \nof August, in Vermont, close to my constituents, onerous as that may \nseem.\n  I would be perfectly willing to accept voice votes on each of these \nseven judges, but I would just ask my friends: Please, don't issue a \npress release tomorrow saying that we only voted on one judge today.\n  We have already voted on one. I will take voice votes on the others.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair of the \nJudiciary Committee. I appreciate very much his cooperation in this \nregard.\n  Let me tell my colleagues who need to remember, even though we are \ngoing through these voice votes, there is one more rollcall vote on the \nconference report on the trade promotion authority legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consider the \nfollowing nominations and that they be considered individually: \nExecutive Calendar Nos. 863, 864, 865, 866, 867, 887, and 888.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   nomination of richard everett dorr\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRichard Everett Dorr to the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Missouri. He is a man who has dedicated large portions of \nhis career to public service, one of the qualities I most admire in a \nnominee to the bench.\n  Mr. Dorr attended the University of Illinois at Champaign on a \nfootball scholarship. He graduated with a B.S. in Marketing in 1965. In \n1968, he graduated with a J.D. from the University of Missouri at \nColumbia. During the next five years as a Judge Advocate, the nominee \nregularly appeared as either a prosecutor or defense counsel in \ncriminal cases before Courts-Martial and Administrative Boards. During \nthis period, Mr. Dorr also served as a legal advisor to Administrative \nBoards and as a Military Judge. He was also appointed to the Human \nRelations Council, an Air Force program designed to educate service \nmembers on appropriate behavior regarding racial diversity.\n  Upon returning to private life, Mr. Dorr was an associate at the firm \nof Mann, Walter, Burkart, Weathers & Walter for 5 years. In this \nposition he practiced general civil law, including real estate, \nbusiness, domestic relations and general litigation cases. In 1978, he \nstarted his own firm, Harrison, Tucker and Dorr and continued his \ngeneral civil practice. In 1996, Mr. Dorr became the Managing Partner \nof the Springfield office of Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, a major \nlaw firm based out of Kansas City, Missouri. In this new position, he \nhas concentrated on business and commercial litigation.\n  Mr. Dorr was very active in the establishment of the Southwest \nMissouri Legal Aid Corporation. He served on its first Board of \nDirectors from 1976 to 1982 and was the Corporation's President from \n1978 to 1982. This organization provides legal aid to the poor who \nnormally could not afford for their cases to be heard in a court of \nlaw.\n  Unfortunately, this is Mr. Dorr's second nomination to the federal \ncourt. He was nominated by the first President Bush, but he did not \nreceive a hearing.\n  Throughout his life Mr. Dorr has given back to his community, first \nin the Air Force, where he championed the cause of human rights, and \nthen by forming an organization that helped those who could not afford \naccess to the courts. Clearly, Mr. Dorr has the character and \ntemperament to be a fair and balanced federal court judge. I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm this most deserving attorney.\n\n\n                       nomination of david godbey\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of David \nGodbey to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Texas.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Godbey's distinguished legal \ncareer, and I have concluded, as did President Bush, that he is a fine \njurist who will add a great deal to the Federal bench in Texas.\n  Mr. Godbey has a terrific record as a civil litigator and as a highly \neffective state court judge.\n  Following graduation from Harvard Law School, where he graduated \nmagna cum laude, Judge Godbey clerked for Judge Goldberg of the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals for a year, then accepted a job with Hughes & \nLuce, a Dallas firm, in 1983.\n  For the next 11 years, he handled civil and commercial litigation in \nFederal trial and appellate courts in Texas and elsewhere. He accepted \ncriminal appointments and represented clients in commercial arbitration \ncases. He specialized in technology litigation, appeals, public-law \nlitigation, and oil and gas matters.\n  In 1994 Mr. Godbey was elected to a judgeship on the 160th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Texas. Judge Godbey has handled over 6,500 cases on \nthe bench, including approximately 230 jury trials, and his reversal \nrate is well below 1 percent.\n  It is clear that Judge Godbey is well prepared for the Federal \ndistrict court bench. I know he will make a great judge in the Northern \nDistrict of Texas.\n\n\n                       nomination of henry hudson\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Henry E. \nHudson's nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Virginia.\n  Judge Hudson's many accomplishments as a prosecutor, State court \njudge, and Federal law enforcement officer convince me that he will \nexcel on the federal bench in Virginia.\n  Upon graduation from American University in 1974, Mr. Hudson worked \nas Assistant Commonwealth Attorney in Arlington, VA, prosecuting felony \nand misdemeanor cases. From 1978-1979 he served as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where he handed federal \ncriminal case; and from 1980 to 1986 he served as Commonwealth's \nAttorney for Arlington County.\n  Mr. Hudson then served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of \nVirginia, gaining substantial supervisory and prosecutorial experience. \nHe headed an office of 70 Assistant U.S. Attorneys and 25 Special \nAssistants and prosecuted major civil and criminal cases, including \n``Operation Ill Wind,'' a federal investigation resulting in the \nconviction of 54 individuals and 10 corporations for illegally \nexchanging confidential defense contract bidding information.\n  Mr. Hudson served as Director of the U.S. Marshals Service from 1992 \nto 1993, and since 1998 Mr. Hudson has served as Circuit Court Judge \nfor the Fairfax County Circuit Court.\n  Judge Hudson received an ABA rating of Substantial Majority Well \nQualified and Minority Qualified. My support for Judge Hudson's \nnomination to the Federal bench is unqualified. He will make an \nexcellent federal judge.\n\n\n                       nomination of henry hudson\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Henry Hudson, who has been nominated to serve as a judge on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  Senator Allen and I had the honor of recommending Judge Hudson to \nPresident Bush for this position, and we have worked closely with \nChairman Leahy, Senator Hatch, and with our leadership to get Judge \nHudson's nomination to a confirmation vote.\n  It is important to note that the Virginia Bar Association ``highly \nrecommends'' Judge Hudson for this Federal judgeship.\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\n  In addition, Judge Hudson's nomination enjoys bipartisan support in \nVirginia. Congressman Jim Moran and State Senate Minority Leader Dick \nSaslaw, both Democrats, have penned letters of support for Judge \nHudson.\n  Judge Hudson enjoys such widespread support based on his extensive \nexperience with the law, and his reputation for having an appropriate \njudicial temperament. For these reasons, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported out his nomination.\n  Judge Hudson's legal career began with his service as a Deputy \nSheriff in Arlington County, Virginia, in 1969 and 1970. He then went \nto law school, graduating from American University in 1974.\n  Subsequent to his graduation from law school, Mr. Hudson entered \nlegal practice as a prosecutor. First, he served as an Assistant \nCommonwealth's attorney for 5 years and then as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  In 1986, Mr. Hudson was confirmed by the Senate and began his service \nas the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, \nwhere he served until 1991.\n  After leaving the U.S. Attorney's office, Judge Hudson once again \nreceived Senate confirmation and served as the Director of the United \nStates Marshals Service from 1992 to 1993.\n  After completing his work at the Marshals Service, Mr. Hudson entered \nprivate practice until he was sworn in as a Judge on the Fairfax \nCounty, Virginia, Circuit Court. Judge Hudson has served as a Judge on \nthis important court since 1998.\n  During his time on the Fairfax County Circuit Court bench, Judge \nHudson has been known as a fair, objective judge who conducts \nproceedings with dignity and with the appropriate judicial temperament. \nI am confident that he will continue his service on the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia bench consistent with this reputation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Judge Hudson's nomination.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, the Senate confirmed Judge Henry \nHudson to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia. I am very pleased to see this fine man take his place on the \nFederal bench, and I know that he will serve our Nation with \ndistinction.\n  Judge Hudson is very deserving of this high honor, and I commend \nPresident Bush for nominating such a well-qualified and honorable man. \nThroughout Judge Hudson's distinguished career, he has held several \npositions of public trust, and he has always performed his duties with \nthe utmost integrity. Judge Hudson has also demonstrated a profound \nrespect for the rule of law, and he will no doubt be an asset to the \nEastern District of Virginia.\n  Judge Hudson has an illustrious legal background. Upon graduation \nfrom the American University School of Law, he worked as an Assistant \nCommonwealth Attorney in Arlington County, Virginia. There, he learned \nthe basics of trial work, and after 5 years, he became an Assistant \nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. As a Federal \nprosecutor, Judge Hudson handled many important and oftentimes complex \ncriminal cases, including drug conspiracies, racketeering, and \npolitical corruption cases. After his service as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney, Judge Hudson served as the Commonwealth Attorney in Arlington \nCounty, Virginia. As Commonwealth Attorney, he was responsible for \nprosecuting crimes such as homicides and violent sexual assaults.\n  Judge Hudson's vast knowledge of the law and his skills as a trial \nattorney did not go unnoticed. In 1986, he was nominated and confirmed \nas the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. As the U.S. \nAttorney, Judge Hudson not only gained additional experience as a \nFederal prosecutor, but also demonstrated an ability to supervise \nothers. He was responsible for an office staffed by 70 Assistant U.S. \nAttorneys and 25 Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys. During his tenure, \nhe supervised ``Operation Ill Wind,'' a Federal investigation of \nunlawful defense contract bidding that resulted in the conviction of 54 \npeople.\n  Judge Hudson was again honored in 1992 when he was selected as \nDirector of the U.S. Marshals Service, our Nation's oldest law \nenforcement organization. This appointment serves as a testament to the \nwidespread admiration and respect enjoyed by Judge Hudson.\n  In 1998, Henry Hudson became Circuit Court Judge for the Fairfax \nCounty Circuit Court in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In this role, he \nhas performed admirably, demonstrating an outstanding legal mind and a \ngood judicial temperament. He has served the people of Fairfax County \nwell and will no doubt serve the Eastern District of Virginia with \nequal competence and integrity.\n  Judge Henry Hudson will make an outstanding Federal judge. A \nsubstantial majority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Hudson as Well Qualified. Not only \ndoes he have considerable legal expertise, but he is a fine man. I am \nproud to see my friend, Henry Hudson, confirmed as a Federal District \nCourt Judge.\n\n\n                      nomination of timothy savage\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Timothy J. Savage to the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania.\n  My review of Mr. Savage's career as a litigator and public servant \nhas convinced me that he will make a fine Federal judge.\n  Following graduation from Temple University School of Law, Mr. Savage \njoined the Philadelphia firm of MacCoy, Evans & Lewis as a civil \nlitigator. In 1974 he and a partner started the firm of Savage and \nCiccone, where he turned to criminal defense work. Since 1976 Mr. \nSavage has worked as a sole practitioner in Philadelphia, moving in the \nlast two decades to civil litigation and white collar crime \nspecialties.\n  Mr. Savage knows his way around the Eastern District, serving as a \nmediator in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and as judge pro tem \nin the Court of Commons Pleas in Philadelphia County.\n  Since 1977 he has served in a quasi-judicial role on the Pennsylvania \nLiquor Control Board, making evidentiary rulings, overseeing \ninterrogation of witnesses, and authoring findings of fact and \nrecommendations for Board decisions.\n  Outside his law practice, Mr. Savage has served as counsel for a \nlocal civil association and for the local Boys and Girls Clubs for the \nlast 20 years. He has also provided pro bono services to community \ngroups, his church, senior citizens and served on the Philadelphia Bar \nAssociation's Volunteers for Indigent Persons panel.\n  I am confident Mr. Savage will serve well on the Federal bench in the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                       nomination of amy st. eve\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nAmy J. St. Eve to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nIllinois.\n  Ms. St. Eve's academic record is truly outstanding. She received her \nundergraduate degree in History, with Honors and Academic Distinction \nin All Subjects, from Cornell University.\n  She then graduated from Cornell's College of Law, where she was an \nArticles Editor on the Law Review, a member of the Order of the Coif, \nand recipient of numerous prizes for finishing her first and second \nyears at the top of her class.\n  After graduation, she joined the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. \nFor four years, she worked as a litigator representing corporations in \ncivil and criminal matters. In 1994, Ms. St. Eve joined the Office of \nthe Independent Counsel, investigating the events surrounding the \nWhitewater Development Corporation. She drafted the indictment and \nsecond-chaired the trial that led to the conviction of Jim McDougal, \nSusan McDougal and then-Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker.\n  In 1996, she joined the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois. In this position, her responsibilities included \nhealth care fraud, bank fraud, narcotics, trafficking, public \ncorruption and gang violence cases. Additionally, she served as the \nCriminal Health Care Fraud Coordinator. For her work in this position, \nshe twice received the Award for Integrity from the U.S. Health and \nHuman Services Office of the Inspector General. She was also one of the \nsenior prosecutors in ``Operation Safe Road.'' This operation was \ncharged with ridding the Melrose Park Illinois Secretary of State \nfacility of corruption.\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\n  Currently, Ms. St. Eve is a Senior Counsel in the Litigation \nDepartment of Abbott Laboratories.\n  Ms. St. Eve is one of the best and brightest of her generation. Her \nand others like her are prime examples of a new generation of women who \nare becoming the top legal minds in the legal community. Her nomination \nis a fine example of the diverse judiciary that President Bush is \ncreating. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for her confirmation.\n\n\n                      nomination of david cercone\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise in support of \nDavid S. Cercone, who has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Cercone graduated from Duquesne University School of Law. Judge \nCercone then clerked for Hon. Paul R. Zavarella on the Allegheny County \nCourt of Common from 1978 to 1979. Judge Cercone has also been a sole \nlegal practitioner in Pennsylvania. From 1979 to 1981, Judge Cercone \nserved as the Assistant District Attorney for Allegheny County Court of \nCommon Pleas and specialized in the prosecution of narcotics and \nviolent crime cases.\n  From 1982 to 1985, Judge Cercone served as the Pennsylvania district \njustice magistrate. In 1986 to the present, Judge Cercone was the \nyoungest person ever elected, at 32, to the Court of Common Pleas for \nAllegheny County Pennsylvania. In 1993, Judge Cercone was appointed \nadministrative judge for the criminal division by the Supreme Court of \nPennsylvania. Judge Cercone implemented an accelerated plea docket to \nprevent jail overcrowding and to reduce case backlogs. He also \nestablished the first ``drug court'' in western Pennsylvania for the \nrehabilitation of drug offenders.\n  In his capacity as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Allegheny \nCounty, Judge Cercone has ruled on many issues including medical \nmalpractice, auto accidents, criminal homicide, murder, arson, \ninsurance fraud, drugs, vehicular homicide, defamation, intoxication of \nminors and criminal conspiracy of an escape of six inmates from the \nWestern State Correctional Institute. Judge Cercone has also prepared \nannual reports for the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal \nDivision from 1994 to 1998.\n  Judge Cercone has been rated ``unanimous qualified'' by the American \nBar Association. I am confident Judge Cercone will serve on the bench \nwith integrity, intelligence, and fairness.\n\n\n                     nomination of morrison england\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nMorrison C. England to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District \nof California.\n  I have enjoyed reviewing Judge England's distinguished legal career, \nand I have concluded that he will make an excellent Federal judge in \nCalifornia.\n  Judge Morrison C. England is a native of St. Louis and a graduate of \nMcGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific. He has had \nmore than a decade of private practice experience as a litigator and \ntransactional attorney and has served for the past six years as a \nCalifornia state judge in Sacramento presiding over criminal and civil \ncases. In 1996 Governor Pete Wilson appointed him as Sacramento \nMunicipal Court Judge and elevated him to Superior Court Judge on the \nSacramento Superior Court a year later. He currently serves in a \nGeneral Trial Court, presiding over both civil and criminal cases. \nPrevious to his judicial service, Judge England acted as Referee and \nJudge Pro Tem in the Sacramento County Juvenile Court from 1991-96. \nClearly he has the experience a Federal judge needs.\n  Judge England also serves this country as a member of the U.S. Army \nReserve, JAG Corps, holding the rank of Major. Judge England's \nnomination has been praised by his colleagues and Sacramento attorneys \nalike. He has home state support and my support as well. He will make \nan excellent Federal judge in California.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have the distinct honor of being on the \nfloor again to support the nomination of another fine candidate to the \nFederal bench in Missouri. The President has nominated Dick Dorr of \nSpringfield, MO, to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Missouri. Mr. Dorr embodies well the principles laid out by \nthe President for nominees to the Federal bench. Above all, Mr. Dorr \nrespects the roll of a judge in our Federal system--to interpret the \nlaw. In addition, Mr. Dorr is a respected trial attorney who will bring \nyears of experience in the court room to this position. He is an \nexcellent candidate and I urge the Members of this body to give him \nyour favorable consideration.\n  Mr. Dorr will bring to this position a reputation as an outstanding \ntrial attorney with the respected Missouri law firm. His experience \nextends to both criminal and civil law. Attorneys in Springfield who \nworked with Mr. Dorr and who have litigated against him share my belief \nthat he has the experience to preside over trials in a fair and \nefficient manner. Mr. Dorr has also served his country in the U.S. Air \nForce as a reservist and as a judge advocate general.\n  Mr. Dorr has given a tremendous amount of this time to ensure that \nthe citizens of Springfield have legal representation available to them \ndespite their financial means. He has worked for the Missouri Bar's \nVolunteer Lawyer Pogram. He was instrumental in starting the Legal Aid \nSociety of Southwest Missouri and served on its board. He has received \nthe Equal Access to Justice Award from the Springfield Bar for his \nwork, and he was recognized for outstanding service to the community by \nthe Greene County Community Justice Association.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for scheduled a \nhearing for this nominee, and I thank the Members for the unanimous \nvote in support of this nominee.\n  I believe the Senate will find this candidate is well qualified for \nthe position, possessing the experience, the intellect and the personal \nqualities necessary to preside over trials and rule in an informed and \nimpartial manner. He will be a tremendous asset to the bench, and I \nurge the Members of the body to support the nomination.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to express to my Senate colleagues \nmy support for the confirmation of Henry E. Hudson to serve as a judge \nin the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia. I have known Henry Hudson for about 20 years. He has had a \nlong and distinguished career in public service, beginning as a \nfirefighter and a deputy sheriff. He was elected in 1979 by the \ncitizens of Arlington County, VA to serve as their Commonwealth's \nAttorney, and was reelected by a large margin four years later.\n  In 1986, President Reagan selected Henry Hudson to serve as the \nUnited States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He is \ncredited with elevating the stature and visibility of that office with \nsuch prosecutions as Operation Illwind, which restored integrity to the \nfield of defense procurement.\n  In 1992, Judge Hudson was appointed by President Bush to serve as \nDirector of the United States Marshals Service. The Department of \nJustice recognized his exceptional leadership of that agency and \nawarded him the John Marshall Award for outstanding legal achievement.\n  During my term as Governor of Virginia, I appointed Henry Hudson to \nserve as Chairman of the Criminal Justice Services Board and and a \nmember of the Governor's Commission to Abolish Parole and Reform \nSentencing. Later, I selected him to be a member of the Virginia \nCriminal Sentencing Commission. From his superb performance in all \nthose roles, which helped us reduce crime in Virginia as well as better \nprotect victims, I can personally attest to his calm, knowledgeable, \nand fair leadership as well as his dedication, work ethic and \nintegrity.\n  Henry Hudson is currently serving as a Circuit Court Judge in Fairfax \nCounty, VA, where he has enjoyed a reputation for being a fair, but \nfirm, jurist. His nomination to the Federal court is widely supported \nby both Democrats and Republicans, as well as bar associations and \ncivic groups.\n  It is vital at this point in our Nation's history that we have the \nhighest caliber men and women on the Federal bench.\n  Indeed, our Federal personnel are charged with the responsibility in \nthese difficult times with enforcing our laws while still respecting \ncivil liberties.\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\n  Perhaps in no district court is that more important than in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which \nhas been short-handed for some time--handles some of the nation's most \nimportant and high-profile cases, including the John Walker Lyndh case \nand the Moussaoui trial.\n  I am very pleased that the United States Senate will today confirm \nJudge Henry Hudson for this very important judicial position. He \npossesses a strong legal acumen, the requisite judicial temperament, \nand proper judicial philosophy of interpreting the law and Constitution \nand not rewritng it from the bench. This will enable him to serve with \ndistinction on the federal bench, and this is why the President wisely \nnominated him.\n  Thus, I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote for the Confirmation \nof Henry Hudson as judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week marks a little more than one year \nafter the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following \nthe change in majority last year. The Democratic-led Judiciary \nCommittee has had an impressive year of fairly and promptly considering \nPresident Bush's nominees. In addition to the dozens of high-ranking \nJustice Department officials for whom we held hearings and our work in \nconnection with almost 200 Executive Branch nominees the Committee \nreported, we have had a noteworthy record year with respect to judicial \nnominees.\n  With the lifting of a Republican hold on nominations we have been \nable to move forward this week to confirm 15 more judicial nominees--4 \ncircuit court nominees and 11 district court nominees. The Democratic-\nled Senate has now confirmed 72 of President Bush's judicial nominees. \nThis interim total of 72 judges far outdistances any Republican total \nfor any of the preceding six years. Moreover, this is more judges than \nwere confirmed under Republican control during all of 1999, 2000 and \nthe first six months of 2001 combined. Thus, in less than 13 months we \nhave done more than the Republicans did in 30 months! And we did so \nwhile reforming the process to ensure bipartisan cooperation and \ngreater fairness.\n  The Senate has now confirmed 13 of President Bush's circuit court \nnominees--which is almost twice as the average during the prior six and \none-half years of Republican control when they averaged seven circuit \ncourt confirmations per year. This is more circuit court nominees than \nwere confirmed in two years combined, during all of 1996 and 1997, of \nthe prior years of Republican control.\n  In this, our first year, we held 23 hearings for 84 of the \nPresident's nominees to the Federal Courts of Appeals and District \nCourts. That is more hearings for more of this President' s district \nand circuit court nominees than were ever held in any of the six and \none-half years that preceded the change in majority last summer. It is \nmore hearings for more circuit and district court nominees than in 20 \nof the last 22 years.\n  In particular, we held more hearings for more of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees, 18, than in any of the six and one-half years \nin which the Republicans controlled the Committee before the change in \nmajority last summer. For that matter, we held twice as many hearings \nfor courts of appeals nominees than were held in the first year of the \nReagan Administration when the Senate was controlled by Republicans and \nfive times more than in the first year of the Clinton Administration \nwhen the Senate was controlled by Democrats. That total of 18 hearings \nfor circuit court nominees is also twice what the Republican majority \naveraged when it was in control of the process. Those are the facts.\n  Under Democratic leadership, the Judiciary Committee voted on more \njudicial nominees, 79, than in any of the six and one-half years of \nRepublican control that preceded the change in majority. We voted on \ntwice as many circuit court nominees, 15, than the Republican majority \naveraged in the years they were in control. In fact, this last year we \nvoted on more nominees than were voted on in 1999 and 2000 combined and \non more circuit court nominees than the Republicans allowed votes on \nduring 1996 and 1997 combined.\n  We have achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's \nnominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's \nnominees had been treated. By many measures the Committee has achieved \ntwice as much this last year as Republicans averaged during their years \nin control, and, by some measures, has done so in less than half the \ntime.\n  I commend and thank the Majority Leader and Assistant Majority Leader \nfor their patience and determination in achieving movement on judicial \nnominees on the Senate floor. The Administration's obstructionism \nstalled Senate floor actions on nominations for more than two months, \nwhile the Administration failed to fulfill its responsibility to work \nwith the Senate in the naming of members of bipartisan boards and \ncommissions. But just last Friday we resumed voting on judicial \nnominations and confirmed 15 judicial nominees in the last week once \nSenator McCain's hold was lifted.\n  Four of these nominees were confirmed to the Federal Courts of \nAppeals, including the first nominee to the Sixth Circuit in almost \nfive years, the first nominee to the Ninth Circuit in two years, and \nthe first nominee to the Third Circuit in almost two and a half years \nand the third nominee that we have confirmed to the Eighth Circuit.\n  With these confirmations, we have addressed long-standing vacancies \non circuit courts caused by Republican obstruction on President \nClinton's nominees. We held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit \nnominee in seven years, the first hearings for Sixth Circuit nominees \nin almost five years, the first hearing for a Tenth Circuit nominee in \nsix years, and the first hearings for Fourth Circuit nominees in three \nyears.\n  We have also now confirmed 59 of the President's district court \nnominees, twice as many as the Republican average for the past six and \none-half years. Contrast the 59 Federal trial court judges confirmed by \nthe Democratic Senate in just a little more than a year with the \nRepublican average, during their past six and one-half years of \ncontrol, of confirming only 31 Federal trial court judges a year. The \nSenate has confirmed more Federal trial court judges than were \nconfirmed in 19 of the past 21 years and almost twice as many as the \nRepublican average from their six and one-half years of control.\n  With this week's confirmations, the Democratic-led Senate has \nconfirmed the 10th Federal judge for Pennsylvania. In addition, we \nconfirmed our fifth judge to the District Courts in Texas, and our \nfifth judge to the Federal courts in the Eleventh Circuit. Our \ntreatment of these nominees as well as a number of others, including \nthe nominees confirmed today for the District Courts in Missouri, \nstands in sharp contrast to the treatment of nominees by the Republican \nmajority.\n  We have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees. For \nexample, we have ended the practice of anonymous holds that plagued the \nperiod of Republican control, when any Republican Senator could hold \nany nominee from his home state, his own circuit or any part of the \ncountry for any reason, or no reason, without any accountability. We \nhave returned to the Democratic tradition of holding regular hearings, \nevery few weeks, rather than going for period of as long as six months \nwithout a single hearing.\n  It would certainly have been easier and less work to retaliate for \nthe unfair treatment of the last President's judicial nominees. We did \nnot. We have been, and will continue to be, more fair than the \nRepublican majority was to President Clinton's judicial nominees. More \nthan 50 of Clinton's nominees never got a vote, many languished for \nmonths and years before their nominations were returned without a \nhearing or other action by the Senate. Others waited years--not just a \nyear, but up to more than four years. Some never were accorded a \nhearing, some were finally confirmed after years of delay.\n  Those who now seek to pretend that the Democratic majority in the \nSenate caused a vacancy crisis in the Federal courts are ignoring the \nfacts. Under Republicans, court vacancies rose from 63 in January 1995 \nto 110 in July 2001, when the Committee reorganized. During Republican \ncontrol before the reorganization of the Committee, vacancies\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\non the Courts of Appeals more than doubled, increasing from 16 to 33. \nThat is what we inherited. But in one year of Democratic control, and \ndespite 45 additional vacancies caused largely by the retirements of \nmany past Republican appointees, we have reduced the number of district \nand circuit court vacancies.\n  Vacancies continue to exist on the Court of Appeals, in particular, \nbecause a Republican Senate majority was not willing to hold hearings \nor vote on more than half--56 percent--of President Clinton's circuit \nnominees in 1999 and 2000, and was not willing to confirm a single \ncircuit judge during the entire 1996 session. Republicans caused the \ncircuit vacancy crisis, and it has taken a tremendous effort to \nevaluate and have hearings for 18 circuit court nominees in our first \nyear.\n  In the meantime, Republicans have been unfairly critical that not \nevery nominee has yet had a hearing or been confirmed. Rather than \ncommend our efforts to do twice as much as they, their criticism is \nthat we have yet to conclude consideration of everyone simultaneously. \nIn less than 13 months we have already confirmed 13 of President Bush's \nnominees to the Courts of Appeals, and one more is awaiting a vote by \nthe full Senate. They confirmed 46 circuit court nominees in 76 months. \nWithout the benefit of presidential consultation of the Senate before \nnomination--as Republicans did in recent past years, without having had \nthe luxury of taking two, three and sometimes four years before voting \non a nominee, we have already achieved a confirmation rate of over 40 \npercent in our first year. With some cooperation in the fall from the \nAdministration and from the Republican minority, we can improve on that \nconfirmation rate before the end of the year. It already tops the \nRepublican's record in 1997 and far exceeds the Republicans' record in \n1999 when their own confirmation rate for circuit court nominees was 28 \npercent.\n  It constantly amazes me that our Republican critics run away from \ntheir record on judicial nominees, without admitting any error or \nwrongdoing or regrets of course, and seek to hold us to a much higher \nstandard than they achieved. For example, they seek to compare what we \nhave been able to do in less than 13 months with what other Congresses \ndid over two years. They seek to make comparisons without recognizing \nthat in the current situation we have a Republican President nominating \nan extreme group of nominees without consulting with Senators, as \nopposed to other situations in which Presidents and Senate majorities \nof the same party consulted and worked closely together.\n  A good example of this double standard is the Republican critics' use \nof ``confirmation rates for Court of Appeals nominees.'' Remember that \nin 1996 the Republican majority's confirmation percentage for Court of \nAppeals nominees was zero--not a single confirmation of a single Court \nof Appeals judge all year. In 1999, President Clinton sent the Senate \n25 nominations to the Courts of Appeals. Of those six were \nrenominations of people on whom the Senate had failed to take action \ndating back to 1996, 1997 and 1998. Of the 25 nominations to the Courts \nof Appeals by President Clinton, the Republican majority in the Senate \nwould allow only seven to be confirmed by the end of the year, for a \nconfirmation rate of 28 percent. We have already achieved a \nconfirmation rate of 40 percent in our first year.\n  No judicial nominees should be rubber-stamped by the Senate, not even \na President's first few choices. All nominees for these lifetime \npositions merit careful review by the Senate. When a President is using \nideological criterion to select nominees, it is fair for the Senate to \nconsider it, as well. Federalist Society credentials are not a \nsubstitute for fairness, moderation or judicial temperament. When a \nPresident is intent on packing the courts and stacking the deck on \noutcomes, consideration of balance and how ideological and activist \nnominees will affect a court are valid considerations.\n  What the President and his advisors acknowledge they are doing is \nnominating ideologically conservative judicial nominees to stack the \n5th, 6th, and D.C. Circuits with judicial activists of their choice. I \nhave tried to work with the White House on judicial nominations. I have \ngone out of my way to encourage them to work in a bipartisan way with \nthe Senate, like past Presidents, but in all too many instances they \nhave chosen to bypass bipartisanship. I have encouraged them to include \nthe ABA in the process earlier, like past Presidents, but they have \nrefused to do so even though their decision adds to the length of time \nnominations must be pending before the Senate before they can be \nconsidered.\n  This past January, I again called on the President to stop playing \npolitics with judicial nominations and act in a bipartisan manner. In \nJune, I sent a detailed letter to the President on these issues. My \nefforts to help the White House improve the judicial nominations \nprocess have been rejected. I would like to improve the process and \nspeed up the filling of judicial vacancies with qualified, fair-minded \njudges.\n  Advice and consent does not mean giving the President carte blanche \nto pack the courts. The ingenious system of checks and balances in our \nConstitution does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to \none person alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, \nto pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the \nmainstream, and whose decisions would further divide our nation.\n  We have worked hard to balance these competing concerns over the past \nyear: how to address the vacancy crisis we inherited while also not \nbeing a rubberstamp and abdicating our responsibilities to provide a \ndemocratic check on the President's choices for lifetime appointment to \nthe federal courts. These are the only lifetime appointments in our \nsystem of government, and they matter a great deal to our future.\n  We have moved quickly, but responsibly, to fill judicial vacancies \nwith qualified nominees we hope will not be activists. In our first \nyear we confirmed 72 judges and reported 79 judicial nominees. \nPartisans ignore these facts. The facts are that we are reporting \nPresident Bush's nominees at a faster pace than the nominees of prior \npresidents, including those who worked closely with a Senate majority \nof the same political party. We have accomplished all this during a \nperiod of tremendous tumult and crisis.\n  The Judiciary Committee noticed the first hearing on judicial \nnominations within 10 minutes of the reorganization of the Senate, and \nheld that hearing on the day after the Committee was assigned new \nmembers. We held unprecedented hearings during the August recess last \nyear and proceeded with a hearing two days after the 9-11 attacks and \nshortly after the anthrax attack. Today, we held our 23rd hearing for \njudicial nominees. We are doing our best to address the vacancy crisis \nwe inherited.\n  The Democratic majority in the Senate has worked hard since the \nchange in majority last summer. We have a record of achievement and of \nfairness to be proud of at the recess of this session. I thank the \nmembers who have worked cooperatively with me to make progress in so \nmany areas over the last year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7814-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, before we conclude today, I would be \nremiss if I did not thank a number of people.\n  First, in the House, I want to thank Chairman Bill Thomas. He and I \ndisagree on some things--that's for sure. But we share a common goal of \nboth expanding trade and helping workers left behind by trade. And we \nshare the goal of getting this to the President's desk as soon as \npossible so that we can help jump-start this economy. We worked \ntogether to craft a strong trade bill--and I thank him for his efforts.\n  Second--I want to thank Congressmen Cal Dooley, John Tanner, and Bill \nJefferson, who helped craft the House fast track legislation, and also \nAnna Eshoo and Ken Bentsen, who provided so much help on TAA.\n  In the Senate, I first want to thank Senator Daschle, who has helped \nthis trade bill move through every step of the process. I also want to \nthank two Senators who played a key role during the committee process--\nSenator Bingaman for his efforts on TAA and Senator Bob Graham on ATPA. \nAnd I appreciate Senator Breaux's work both during the Senate \nnegotiations and during the conference.\n  I also want to give credit to a number of Senators whose efforts made \nthis legislation much better. Senators Dayton and Craig on trade laws; \nSenator Edwards on the textile negotiating objectives and also on TAA; \nSenator Kennedy on access to medicines; Senator Harkin on child labor; \nSenator Inouye on some of the tuna provisions in ATPA, and Senators \nRockefeller, Murkowski, and Wellstone on benefits for steel retirees.\n  Finally, I, of course want to thank my partner on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Chuck Grassley for being helpful throughout this \nprocess.\n  Of course, to actually complete work on a major bill like this \nrequires the efforts of many others. For more than 18 months, many \nstaff members have made incalculable efforts to prepare this \nlegislation and move it to passage.\n  John Angell and Mike Evans oversaw the efforts of the Finance \nCommittee staff on this legislation and all other activities of the \nCommittee.\n  Greg Mastel led the effort on the Democratic staff to prepare this \nlegislation from the first round of hearings to the final Senate vote. \nHe was ably assisted by a tremendously skilled and energetic staff, \nincluding Tim Punke, Ted Posner, Angela Marshall, Shara Aranoff, and \nAndy Harig.\n  The Finance Committee health and tax staffs also played an important \nrole, especially Liz Fowler, Kate Kirchgraber, Liz Liebschutz, Mitchell \nKent, and Mike Mongan.\n  The Finance Committee also benefited from the able efforts of the \nleading Republican staff members, Everett Eissenstat and Richard \nChriss.\n  In the House, the staff of the Ways and Means Committee and the New \nDemocrats who supported this bill deserve similar credit.\n  This legislation also literally would not have been possible without \nthe help of our skilled legislative counsel, Polly Craighill, Stephanie \nEasley, and Ruth Ernst, and Mark Mathiesen.\n  Finally, I would say a word of thanks to the many members of the \nAdministration who staffed and supported this legislative effort, \nincluding Grant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Peter Davidson, John Veroneau, \nHeather Wingate, Brenda Becker, Penny Naas, and many others.\n  I--as well as the Senate and the country--owe you all a debt of \ngratitude.\n  I also rise today to thank one additional person who played an \nenormous role in the passing of this trade bill--Howard Rosen.\n  I do not believe there is a person in this country who feels more \npassionately about the TAA legislation than Howard Rosen. He helped \nwrite this bill, he worked hard to encourage Members of the Senate and \nMembers of the House to support this bill, and he is a big reason that \nwe now have such a good TAA program.\n  And I know Howard's efforts will not end here. I know he will keep \nworking to make TAA an even better program. We all owe him a great deal \nof thanks.\n\n\n                           anticircumvention\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention \na section of the conference agreement that is extremely important to \nthe future of the U.S. sugar program and to the workers and companies \nin the domestic sugar industry. As the gentleman from Montana knows \nvery well, I am talking about Section 5203 of the Trade Act of 2002, \nregarding sugar tariff-rate quota circumvention. The policy established \nin Section 5203 on sugar tariff rate quota circumvention is very\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\nimportant to the future of the sugar industry in Louisiana and the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am very familiar with Section 5203 and its importance \nto the future of the domestic sugar industry, including the sugarbeet \ngrowers and processors in Montana. I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend Senator Breaux, Senator Craig, and Senator \nThomas for the work they have been doing to address the problem of \ncircumvention of the tariff-rate quotas on sugar and sugar-containing \nproducts.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I accept those kind words on behalf of all of the \nSenators who are working on this issue. Let me explain the problem \nbriefly. The price of sugar on world markets is almost always very low \nand is often below the cost of producing sugar even in the most \nefficient sugar industries. This phenomenon is caused by subsidization \nof sugar exports by the European Union and other governments, and by \ndumping by companies that must export their sugar at any price to avoid \nharming their domestic markets.\n  The U.S. sugar program is intended to keep the price of sugar in the \nU.S. market at a level that assures a reasonable return to U.S. \ngrowers, processors and refiners of cane and beet sugar. A primary \ncomponent of the program is WTO-legal tariff-rate quotas on imported \nsugar and sugar-containing products under Chapters 17, 18, 19 and 21 of \nthe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. These quotas keep \nworld price sugar from disrupting the U.S. sweeteners market and assure \ncountries that are historical suppliers of the U.S. market that they \nwill benefit from U.S. prices.\n  If the tariff-rate quotas do not keep dumped world price sugar off \nthe U.S. market, the sugar program will be severely damaged. Therefore, \nit is essential that attempts to circumvent the tariff-rate quotas be \nidentified and stopped promptly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree. Circumvention definitely has been a problem for \nthe sugar industry. Do you have some examples of such practices?\n  Mr. BREAUX. There are many different kinds of circumvention. For \nexample, designing and importing nonquota sugar-containing products \nthat have no commercial use or using processing technologies that make \ncommercial extraction of sugar from historically traded nonquota \nproducts an economically viable source of sugar. A specific example of \none kind of circumvention is stuffed molasses, in which sugar is added \nto molasses outside the United States and removed from the molasses \nafter importation in the United States. Another example is a product \nthat is created by interrupting the normal refining process of raw cane \nsugar after the first removal of sugar, or first ``strike,'' outside \nthe United States, addition of that product to raw cane sugar while it \nis being refined in the United States. These are not the only methods \nused for circumvention. Importers will try variations of circumventing \nproducts that were imported in the past, and they will try to devise \nnew methods for circumvention.\n\n  Section 5203 directs the Secretary of Agriculture and Commissioner of \nCustoms to monitor continuously imports of products provided for under \nChapter 17, 18, 19 and 21 of the HTS for indications that products are \nbeing used for circumvention. It is my understanding that \n``continuously'' means looking at import statistics for each month. If \nthey see anything suspicious, such as significant increases in imports \nover historic levels or a change in the ports of entry from the \nhistoric pattern, they will look into the transactions to assure \nthemselves there is no circumvention or to determine precisely how the \ncircumvention is being carried out. The Secretary and the Commissioner \nshall report their findings and make recommendations for action to \nCongress and the President every six months in a public report.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Co-Chair \nof the Conference Committee, I agree that you have accurately described \nthis important section and its intent.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Chairman Baucus for clarifying this issue. You \nclearly understand the importance we attach to this monitoring, \nreporting, and recommendation program. I also want to emphasize that we \nexpect the Secretary of Agriculture and Commissioner of Customs to move \nquickly as soon as H.R. 3009 is signed into public law to establish an \neffective monitoring, reporting and recommendation program under \nsection 5203.\n\n\n                                  agoa\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to ask the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee to engage in a colloquy for the purposes of clarifying \nseveral provisions in this conference report as they relate to the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, known as AGOA.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy on that \nsubject.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Section 3108(a)(3) of the conference report amends \nsection 112(b)(3) of AGOA, which provides for duty-free access for \napparel made from regional fabrics, subject to a quantitative cap.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As I understand it, section 112(b)(3) of AGOA, as \namended by the conference report, would also cover garments made from \nregional fabrics that also incorporate U.S. formed fabrics made from \nU.S. yarns, U.S. formed yarns, or U.S. formed fabrics not made from \nyarns that are classifiable under heading 5602 or 5603 of the \nHarmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. An example of this \nmight be a tailored coat made from African wool, that incorporates U.S. \nfabrics, linings, interlinings, or pocketing material. As you \nunderstand it, would such a garment be eligible for benefits under this \nprovision?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe that such a garment would be eligible for \nbenefits under that provision. A garment entered under the regional \nfabric provision of AGOA is not ineligible for benefits simply because \nit happens to incorporate U.S. yarns, fabrics, or components.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. A related question concerns the increase in the \nquantitative cap, provided for in Section 3108(b) of the conference \nreport. As I understand it, the cap increases represent an approximate \ndoubling of the percentages used in setting the caps under current law, \nexcept the increase can only be used for garments containing regional \nor a mixture of regional and U.S. inputs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. The cap is set as a percentage of the \naggregate square meter equivalents of all apparel articles imported \ninto the United States in the preceding 12-month period for which data \nare available. Under current law, the applicable percentage for the 1-\nyear period beginning October 1, 2000 was 1.5 percent. The applicable \npercentage increases by equal annual increments, so that for the period \nbeginning October 1, 2007, the applicable percentage does not exceed \n3.5 percent. Under that formula, the applicable percentage for the 1-\nyear period beginning October 1, 2002 will be approximately 2.072 \npercent. Under section 3108(b)(1) of the conference report, that \npercentage will be increased by 2.17 percent. In other words, the new \napplicable percentage for the year beginning October 1, 2002 will be \n4.242 percent. However, with respect to the increase over current law, \ni.e., the additional 2.17 percent in the year beginning October 1, \n2002, garments must be made from regional or a mixture of regional and \nU.S. inputs.\n  The conference report further provides that in future years, the \napplicable percentage will increase by equal increments, such that the \napplicable percentage for the 1-year period beginning October 1, 2007 \nwill be not greater than 7 percent. For each year, the increase over \nthe applicable percentage under current law pertains only to garments \nmade from regional or a mixture of regional and U.S. inputs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate the clarification.\n\n\n    tuna certification of origin in the andean trade preference act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have long been involved in dolphin \nconservation efforts. In the past, tuna boats were one of the leading \ncauses of dolphin mortality. As a result of legislation that I and \nothers worked on, tuna fishing practices have been modified and dolphin \ndeaths have dropped dramatically.\n  In part, that success has come from clear regulations regarding \ndolphin-safe fishing practices and requirements that must be met before \ntuna can receive the ``dolphin-safe'' label. The\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nUnited States tracks foreign tuna and determines whether it is dolphin-\nsafe by requiring foreign parties to supply a Certificate of Origin for \nimported tuna. Specifically, I am referring to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's Form 370, which is required under the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.\n  I am concerned that the reference to a Certificate of Origin in \nSection 3103(b)(5) of H.R. 3009 may inadvertently create some confusion \nregarding existing tuna certificate requirements. It is my \nunderstanding that the Chairman of the Finance Committee did not intend \nfor this section to affect existing requirements that imported tuna be \naccompanied by a Certificate of Origin (i.e. NOAA Form 370) as required \nunder the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding that nothing in the conference \nreport supercedes or repeals the provisions of law to which the Senator \nfrom California refers.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is also my intent that the Andean Trade \nPreference Act not pertain to existing requirements that foreign \nparties provide a Certificate of Origin for tuna imported into the \nUnited States. This certificate, or Form 370, is necessary to verify \nwhether imported tuna qualifies for the ``dolphin-safe'' label. This \nbill should not affect that process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n               trade adjustment assistance for fishermen\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to engage \nin a colloquy with the Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus  and the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux.\n  I would like to congratulate you both on your work in the Finance \nCommittee and particularly thank you for your dedication to passing a \nstrong Trade Adjustment Assistance bill. This is a strong step forward \nfor U.S. workers indeed; however, I would like to seek your \nclarification as to whether fishermen are eligible for the program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Senator Kerry. I would also like to thank you \nfor all of your efforts in helping both in the Committee and on the \nfloor to draft a strong bill that addresses the needs of America's \nbusinesses, farmers, and workers.\n  It was certainly my intent as Chairman of the Finance Committee and \nthe lead conferee on the part of the Senate to make fishermen eligible \nfor the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers program. It is my \nunderstanding that Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers covers all \ncommodities (including livestock) in the raw or natural state. The \nTrade Act of 1978, defines the term ``livestock'' to cover not only \ncattle, sheep, goats, swine, poultry (including egg-producing poultry), \nand equine animals used for food or in the production of food, but also \n``fish used for food.'' Also, the Food for Peace program, otherwise \nknown as P.L. 480, includes ``fish'' under its definition of \n``agricultural commodity.''\n  Mr. BREAUX. Senator Baucus, I was a member of the conference \ncommittee as well and it was my understanding that fish would be a \nqualifying agricultural commodity for the purpose of this act. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, my intent is that fish--wild, farm-grown, or \nshellfish--and inherently fishermen, be considered for the purpose of \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for farmers. Also, fishermen \ncan apply and should be eligible for the regular TAA for workers \nprovisions.\n  Further, there is also a study added to the conference report on the \ntopic of fishermen and TAA. It is my hope that this study will address \nthe recent controversy about the application of the TAA for firms to \nfishermen as well as provide direction on future approaches to ensuring \nthat fishermen are treated equitably under TAA, including whether a \nseparate TAA for Fishermen program should be created.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you for that clarification, Senator Baucus. It is \nimportant that we make these programs work for all of America's \nworkers, and I look forward to working with you to make that happen. It \nis my understanding that the Administration is preparing letters \nspecifically outlining TAA eligibility for fishermen, and I look \nforward to receiving those very soon.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 3009, the Trade Act of 2002 and \nurge my colleagues to support cloture and final passage of the bill.\n  This bill is the product of over a year and a half of intense \nnegotiations, discussion, and debate among Republican and Democrats in \nboth Houses of Congress. Because of these efforts, the Trade Act \nstrikes a solid and balanced compromise among a number of key issues \nand competing priorities. It is a product which should receive broad \nsupport here in the Senate today.\n  The Trade Act of 2002 renews Trade Promotion Authority for the \nPresident for the first time in almost a decade. Through a spirit of \ncompromise, Democrats and Republicans were able to break the deadlock \nof TPA and reach a balanced compromise on a number of key issues.\n  For example, for the first time TPA contains a negotiating objective \non labor and the environment. Negotiators are directed to seek \nprovisions in trade agreements requiring countries to enforce their own \nlabor and environmental laws. These negotiating objectives also \nrecognize a country's right to exercise discretion and establish its \nown labor and environmental standards without being subject to \nretaliation.\n  The bipartisan TPA provisions also contain carefully balanced \nprovisions on investment, which preserve the fundamental purpose of the \ninvestor-state dispute settlement procedures while ensuring that they \nare not subject to abuse. The TPA provisions preserve the ability of \nthe United States to enforce our trade remedy laws which help combat \nunfair trade practices.\n  Finally, they contain unprecedented consultation procedures which \nensure meaningful and timely consultations with Congress every step of \nthe way, without curtailing the President's ability to negotiate good \nagreements.\n  In short, the Bipartisan TPA bill provides the President with the \nflexibility he needs to negotiate strong international trade agreements \nwhile maintaining Congress' constitutional role over U.S. trade policy. \nIt represents a thoughtful approach to addressing the complex \nrelationship between international trade, worker rights, and the \nenvironment. And it does so without undermining the fundamental purpose \nand proven effectiveness of Trade Promotion Authority procedures. It is \nan extremely solid bill which I am proud to support.\n  I would like to include some material for the Record which provides \nsome background on how we got to where we are today.\n  Today we are on the verge of passing this critical bill and sending \nit to the President's desk for his signature. I want to recognize \nChairman Baucus' strong efforts during the recent House-Senate \nconference on the Trade Act. I think they were key to our success.\n  I would now like to briefly outline two other provisions in the \nbill--Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Andean Trade Promotion Act.\n  First on TAA. The Trade Act reauthorizes and improves Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for America's workers whose jobs may be displaced \nby trade. I think the TAA provisions in the Trade Act are a vast \nimprovement over the legislation that passed the Senate. The Senate TAA \nbill would have entirely rewritten existing law. In doing so, the \nSenate bill added a number of new, costly definitions, time-lines and \nambiguous administrative obligations. The Trade Act removes these \nburdensome and ill-advised changes.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the Conference Report simply amends and \nbuilds upon existing law. It adds new provisions which help to actually \nimprove the TAA program while maintaining its linkage to trade. The TAA \nprovisions in the Trade Act consolidate the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs, \nthereby establishing a uniform set of requirements. It triggers \nimmediate provisions of rapid response and basic adjustment services \nand streamlines the petition approval process.\n\n  The act also reduces by one-third the time period in which the \nSecretary must review a petition. At the same time, the TAA provisions \ndrastically scale back the number of workers who can be eligible for \nTAA, thereby ensuring that only those workers who are truly impacted by \ntrade and in need of\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nretraining are eligible for assistance. The Trade Act includes a 65 \npercent health insurance tax credit, and presents a firm, clear \nalternative to expanding Medicaid and over government run health \ninsurance coverage.\n  In short, the Trade Act improves the Senate passed TAA bill and \nrepresents a more balanced approach to ensuring that workers displaced \nby trade get the assistance and training they need to quickly re-enter \nthe workforce and compete in the international environment.\n  There is another extremely important provision in the Trade Act that \nI would like to briefly mention, and that is the Andean Trade Promotion \nand Drug Eradication Act. This provision will help eradicate drug \ntrafficking in the Andean nations by helping to create new employment \nopportunities for the citizens of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru. \nIt is a vital piece of legislation for our Andean neighbors and a \ncritical tool in our effort to fight drug trafficking.\n  The intent of the Andean Trade Preference Act, from the beginning, \nwas to advance our efforts to combat illegal drug production and \ntrafficking. It was then and is now not so much a trade initiative as \nit is an effort to assist important allies in a critical fight. The \nnations of Latin America expect us to continue to stand by their side \nas we fight the scourge of drugs. They have paid a high price to aid us \nin this effort. It is a battle we cannot afford to lose. So we cannot \nfail to do our duties as legislators and provide them with the support \nthey need with this important legislation.\n  Before I conclude, I want us to step back and take a look at the big \npicture.\n  I will be the first to admit that this bill is not perfect. There are \nprovisions in this bill which I do not support and there are many items \nI wish were in the bill that are not. But all in all it is a good, \nfair, and balanced package. It deserves our strong support, especially \nin this changing international environment.\n  International trade has long been one of the most important foreign \npolicy and economic tools in our arsenal. It was a key component of our \npost-World War II international economic strategy. For over fifty years \ninternational trade contributed to stability and economic growth \nthroughout the world. It helped to lift the nations of Europe and Asia \nout of the ashes of World War II. And it helped America experience \nunprecedented prosperity here at home. International trade can play a \nsimilar role at the beginning of the twenty-first century. But our \nnation must have the tools to lead. This bill will make a difference. \nNations around the world are waiting for our call and our leadership.\n  Today, the eyes of the world are on the Senate. We cannot let them \ndown. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report, vote for \ncloture and final passage of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the information I earlier referenced \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTranscript Excerpt From the Mark-up of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n                     Bill S. 1209--December 4, 2001\n\n\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA\n\n       Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       Obviously, I will repeat some of the things that I said the \n     other day.\n       The Chairman. It does not have to be obvious. You can \n     change.\n       Senator Grassley. Well, these are things that I think we \n     need to remind ourselves of, particularly the bipartisanship \n     of this committee.\n       When this mark-up began last week, I stated that I support \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance. I do not support it, though, in \n     the partisan way that this legislation has been advanced.\n       Now, you took time during your statement to show how there \n     had been cooperation among Republicans and Democrats to deal \n     with some things that ought to be in Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance.\n       So, my remarks in regard to the partisan way are related to \n     the bill containing provisions from the Democratically-passed \n     stimulus package that makes sweeping and permanent changes to \n     our health care system. Just as my colleagues on the other \n     side failed to work in a bipartisan fashion on economic \n     stimulus, they have followed the same course again on these \n     health provisions for Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       These things should be taken up as part of our \n     consideration of health programs and not be mixed with, or at \n     least on the stimulus package, Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       I think we have a situation here, as I said a week ago, \n     where we have got two very good bills. I think when we \n     finally get a Trade Adjustment Assistance bill, unless, for \n     instance, it were to have these health care provisions in it, \n     you have got a bill that will pass the Senate almost \n     unanimously.\n       I think that we would have a situation, if we got trade \n     promotion authority out of here, and one that I think would \n     be very much a bipartisan bill, would pass the Senate \n     overwhelmingly, not unanimously or near-unanimously like \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance might.\n       But when you are going to bring these bills to the floor of \n     the Senate where there is not an arrangement for both to go, \n     whether they go together or go separately, we have a \n     situation where there are two very popular public policy \n     decisions that could be on the Senate floor that could pass \n     by big margins. But one will not pass without the other. That \n     is not a whole lot different than when Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance first came in to public policy 40 years ago. They \n     kind of came in together.\n       So I want to say, again, that we must not lose sight of the \n     importance then of renewing the President's trade promotion \n     authority this year. I know that some members of this \n     committee believe that we should act only after the House has \n     acted on this very important piece of legislation.\n       But it appears to me that this is a criteria that is \n     selectively applied. All you have to do is look at what we \n     are doing this morning, marking up Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance legislation before the House has acted. We also \n     marked up fast track legislation in 1997 before the House \n     acted, and it was strongly bipartisan, that the committee \n     approved, with only one dissenting vote.\n       So making a committee vote on renewing the President's \n     trade negotiating authority contingent with House action is \n     not in accord with recent action of this committee, including \n     what we are doing here today.\n       In addition, Mr. Chairman, I believe, and many members of \n     this committee believe, that Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     ought to be considered in tandem with legislation to renew \n     the President's trade negotiating authority.\n       This is not a new idea. When President Kennedy first \n     designed the Trade Adjustment Assistance program in \n     the 1960s, he specifically stated that adjustment \n     assistance was integrally linked to the Kennedy \n     Administration's overall efforts to reduce barriers to \n     foreign trade.\n       That linkage was explicitly stated in President Kennedy's \n     message to Congress when he announced that the first Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance program was to be part of the Trade \n     Expansion Act of 1962.\n       Here is what he said in 1962: ``I am also recommending as \n     an essential part of the new trade program that companies, \n     farmers, workers who suffer damage from increased foreign \n     import competition be assisted in their efforts to adjust to \n     that competition.''\n       Ever since President Kennedy created the linkage between \n     trade expansion and Trade Adjustment Assistance, that linkage \n     has been maintained, both by Democrat and Republican \n     administrations.\n       The linkage between Trade Adjustment Assistance makes \n     sense. It made sense when President Kennedy designed the \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance program in 1962, so consequently \n     it makes sense today. It ought to be preserved. I will oppose \n     any efforts to sever the historic linkage between trade \n     expansion and Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       Finally, Mr. Chairman, I again regret that we cannot get to \n     a vote by a date certain on the President's most important \n     trade policy initiative. As I said last week, we should not \n     call it trade promotion authority for the President because, \n     quite frankly, we are talking about trade promotion authority \n     for America.\n       That is because America will win if we can realize the \n     promise of opening new markets for our farmers, ranchers, and \n     workers. But America will also lose, our farmers, ranchers, \n     and workers will lose, if our effort to renew the President's \n     trade negotiating authority gets bogged down in partisan \n     bickering.\n       I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to \n     work with me on trade promotion authority for America. We can \n     do this. We must do it. We must do it in a bipartisan way, in \n     the great and enduring tradition of this committee.\n       I also might add that today is the day in which we are \n     going to start applying tariffs and other trade provisions to \n     the Andean Pact nations, because the Andean Pact lapses \n     today. I think that that is an example of our committee being \n     a little late from time to time on very important pieces of \n     trade policy that we should really push.\n       I think we ought to take into consideration that nations \n     that this committee expressed last week need our help, almost \n     unanimously--in fact, it was probably a unanimous vote--that \n     we move ahead with the Andean Pact.\n       It is too bad that we have not moved quickly enough so that \n     these nations continue to be helped, as they have been helped \n     under the Andean Pact, and as we would expand the Andean Pact \n     legislation to do even greater good for those nations to help \n     themselves.\n       Quite frankly, it is only trade and it is not going to be \n     aid that moves the economies of these nations along. It is \n     really a missed opportunity now that, after all these years \n     of\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n     having the preferential treatment of imports from the Andean \n     Pact nations because we felt that it was very necessary to \n     help them to help themselves, which is what trade does, that \n     now there is going to be a greater cost, consequently less \n     trade. Obviously, the economies of these countries are going \n     to be hurt.\n       These are the very same countries that we feel we ought to \n     be helping, because that's where we need to strengthen their \n     economy so that they are not so dependent upon the drugs that \n     they produce that are coming to our country, and a lot of \n     other reasons as well, but that is a very important one for \n     our country.\n       So, I hope we have a very aggressive trade agenda, we move \n     forward. The most important one is trade promotion authority \n     for the President, regardless of what happens in the House of \n     Representatives, because I do not think that the Senate is \n     irrelevant on this issue of trade promotion authority.\n       I yield the floor.\n       The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. I agree with \n     you on the Andean Trade Preferences Act which has passed this \n     committee, and hopefully can be brought up and passed on the \n     floor this year.\n       The bill is now open for amendment.\n       Senator Hatch?\n       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, is it appropriate for me to \n     offer my amendment?\n       The Chairman. Absolutely.\n       Senator Hatch. All right. I will offer on amendment that \n     will add trade promotion authority language to the Chairman's \n     mark. In addition, my amendment would substitute the \n     Chairman's mark's TAA language with the administration's \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance proposal.\n       Traditionally, the Finance Committee has played a \n     leadership role in forging major bipartisan consensus \n     legislation in the areas of importance to the American \n     public. Mr. Chairman, you and Senator Grassley both rose to \n     that occasion in the tax bill earlier this year. Time and \n     time again, this committee stepped up to the plate in \n     difficult areas.\n       For example, we took the lead in 1997 in the Balanced \n     Budget bill and even found a way to weave the Children's \n     Health Insurance program into that critical legislation.\n       I take exception to the view that the prudent course is for \n     this committee to wait and see what the House does on TPA. \n     With all due respect, I simply do not agree with what the \n     Chairman said last week, that it would be a waste of time of \n     this committee and the whole Senate if we were to take up \n     fast track legislation prior to the House action.\n       Frankly, I am not sure that there is any better use of time \n     of this committee and the Senate than in trying to reach a \n     compromise on trade legislation that can help jump-start our \n     stagnating economy.\n       America is fighting a war against terrorism, and we are \n     fighting this war in the midst of a deepening economic \n     recession. As the unemployment statistics climb, it would \n     seem wise to aggressively pursue trade policies that help to \n     create new jobs for Americans.\n       We know that over the last decade, exports have accounted \n     for between one-quarter and one-third of U.S. economic \n     growth. We know that these export-related jobs pay about 13 \n     to 18 percent higher than the average U.S. wage.\n       Mr. Chairman, I do not know about the farmers in Montana, \n     but in the Utah Agricultural Committee they have told me \n     that, in no uncertain terms, that community wants to see TPA \n     pass, because one in three farm acres go for exports. They \n     want to ship even more of their products overseas.\n       In my view, it was unfortunate that we let Ambassador \n     Zoellick go to Doha last month without the mandate that TPA \n     would have given the U.S. delegation. Economists estimate \n     that the next WTO trade round could bring an additional $177 \n     billion in benefits to the United States. So, it is in our \n     national interests for U.S. negotiators to be leaders in \n     bilateral and multilateral trade initiatives.\n       Now, given these facts and circumstances, many of us just \n     do not understand how timely consideration of TPA legislation \n     continues to elude the committee's attention.\n       My amendment is simple. It has two features. First, my \n     amendment would have the committee adopt the same TPA \n     language that the committee reported to the Senate floor back \n     in 1997. Second, I would amend the amendment I filed last \n     week to replace the Chairman's mark on TAA with the \n     administration's Trade Adjustment Assistance proposal.\n       Now, with respect to trade promotion authority, I think \n     that my colleagues who served on the committee will recall \n     the provisions of old S. 1269 of the 105th Congress. There \n     was broad bipartisan support for this measure. It was adopted \n     by the Finance Committee on a voice vote.\n       Now, this amendment consists of carefully constructed \n     language. Twice, it has survived cloture votes on the Senate \n     floor, by a 69 to 31 vote on November 4, 1997, and by a 68 to \n     31 vote a day later.\n       Why do we not simply adopt this non-controversial support \n     of 1997 language again today? For example, we have heard all \n     year about the importance of labor and environment \n     provisions.\n       Here is what the 1997 bill and my amendment says on that \n     score. My amendment says, ``It is the policy of the United \n     States to reinforce the trade agreements process by promoting \n     respect for ``workers'' rights by seeking to establish in the \n     International Labor Organization a mechanism for the \n     systematic examination of, and reporting on, the extent to \n     which ILO members promote and enforce the freedom of \n     association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, \n     a prohibition on the use of forced labor, a prohibition on \n     exploitative child labor, and a prohibition on discrimination \n     in employment.'' What is wrong with that language?\n       With respect to the environment, my amendment calls for \n     ``expanding the production of goods and trade and goods and \n     services to ensure the optimal use of the world's resources, \n     while seeking to protect and preserve the environment and to \n     enhance the international means for doing so.'' So, this \n     amendment addresses both labor and the environment, and it is \n     no wonder why it was so broadly supported back in 1997.\n       Now, I have been around here long enough not to be totally \n     shocked if my amendment is not adopted today. But I do want \n     to leave my colleagues across the aisle with the message that \n     I am prepared to listen to your concerns and work with you in \n     good faith across the aisle to fashion compromise bipartisan \n     TPA legislation that will get the job done.\n       I think that the bipartisan legislation put forward by \n     Senators Gramm and Murkowski might also serve as a good \n     vehicle to get us off the dime. Instead of sitting around \n     waiting for the House to act, why do we not send the House \n     and the American public a strong message that the Senate \n     intends to pass both trade promotion authority and Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance as soon as possible?\n       The political reality may be that both of these measures \n     may have to pass, or both may fail. We can accept failure for \n     either of these measures. While I do not believe that it \n     should be necessary to tie these two pieces together in one \n     bill, there are certain advantages of doing so. The \n     suspension of production by Geneva Steel in Utah last month, \n     the largest steel mill west of the Mississippi, has \n     underscored to me the importance of Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance, among other things.\n       For over 1,400 steelworkers and their families, the future \n     is not clear. Unfortunately, they can benefit from some help. \n     I want to commend Senator Rockefeller for his efforts on \n     behalf of the steel industry at the ITC.\n       With respect to Trade Adjustment Assistance, I am offering \n     the administration's proposal. We have with us at the table \n     Mr. Chris Spear, Assistant Secretary for Policy at the \n     Department of Labor, to discuss the details of the proposal. \n     But I want to make a few points about this part of my \n     amendment.\n       The administration's TAA proposal is a focused, balanced, \n     and revenue-neutral approach. It expands eligibility for \n     shifts in production benefits to workers displaced by shifts \n     in production to countries in which the U.S. enters into a \n     new trade agreement, thereby preserving the nexus between \n     trade and assistance.\n       Recognizing that it makes no sense to maintain two similar, \n     yet separate, TAA programs, the administration's proposal \n     consolidates administration of the TAA program and the NAFTA \n     TAA program. It modifies current requirements for training \n     waivers, specifying five conditions under which training \n     requirements may be waived.\n       Finally, perhaps the most innovative feature of the \n     administration's proposal is the creation of a trade \n     adjustment account option pilot program to offer the option \n     of a limp sum payment in lieu of traditional TAA benefits.\n       The bottom line for American workers and their families has \n     to be for Congress to successfully open up new markets for \n     U.S. goods for the new trade agreements that TPA legislation \n     will help spawn, and to help displaced workers through TAA.\n       The American people want us to work together to help solve \n     our Nation's problems. That is what we did with the counter-\n     terrorism legislation. That is what we will do with the \n     bioterrorism legislation that Senators Frist, Kennedy, Gregg, \n     and many of the others of us are developing. I hope that this \n     committee can meet the challenge we face in fashioning both \n     TAA and TPA legislation, and that is what this amendment \n     attempts.\n       So, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for making this \n     rather lengthy statement, but I sure hope we can pass this \n     amendment.\n       The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Any comments?\n       Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this \n     amendment to renew the President's trade promotion authority. \n     Senator Moynihan said, when this bill was approved three or \n     four years ago, that it was, in his words, ``an extraordinary \n     agreement.''\n       Many of my colleagues who were on the committee four years \n     ago will recall that the 1997 bill was passed by the \n     committee before the House acted, with broad bipartisan \n     support. There was just one dissenting vote, as I recall.\n       It enjoyed equally strong bipartisan support on the floor. \n     The motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed was \n     approved by a vote of 69 to 31. This model of bipartisan \n     trade legislation should serve as our model today.\n       Because it was passed by such a wide and convincing \n     bipartisan margin just four years ago is not enough to \n     dismiss this bill by saying that times have changed. Trade \n     negotiating authority for the President was as controversial \n     then as it is now. The choices in front of us in 1997 were as \n     tough and as challenging then as they are now. The importance \n     of the United States' leadership in trade policy was as \n     important in 1997 as it is now.\n       Let us again reaffirm what Senator Moynihan said in 1997. \n     This is an extraordinary\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\n     agreement and it is worthy of continuation of this \n     committee's historic heritage of bipartisanship in U.S. trade \n     policy. I urge my colleagues to again vote in favor of this \n     legislation by adopting this amendment.\n       In regard to the amendment that Senator Hatch has of \n     connecting Trade Adjustment Assistance to it, as I stated in \n     my opening comments, this is also in regard to a tradition \n     that was started with trade promotion authority during the \n     Kennedy Administration.\n       So I would like to say a word on the administration's TAA \n     proposal because I think the administration has been unfairly \n     criticized in the last few days in the press about its \n     proposal and I would set the record straight.\n       A tremendous amount of effort has gone into developing the \n     administration's proposal. The administration put together a \n     working group consisting of four cabinet-ranked officials, \n     Secretaries Chao, Evans, and O'Neill, as well as Ambassador \n     Zoellick. They developed this proposal.\n       Countless hours were spent drafting and refining a proposal \n     that makes some very positive changes in our Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance laws. They also did this in a very responsible \n     way, from a budget point of view, that is. Rather than throw \n     money at the program, they came up with a revenue-neutral \n     approach that represents a serious and very reasonable \n     compromise.\n       So, I commend the administration this morning for their \n     outstanding work that has gone not their Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance proposal. That is part of Senator Hatch's \n     amendment. It is an excellent proposal and I think it \n     deserves the consideration of this committee and the support \n     of this committee.\n       The Chairman. Any further discussion?\n       Senator Breaux. Mr. Chairman?\n       The Chairman. Senator Breaux?\n       Senator Breaux. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Once \n     again, I think we have proved that we all can play great \n     defense, but the problem is, how do you get an offense \n     together? You cannot win unless you can score.\n       I think that we are in a situation now where our Republican \n     colleagues can prevent us from passing the Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance Act, and we can prevent them from passing fast \n     track.\n       But I really question whether that is what we should be \n     doing. We should be passing things and getting things done \n     instead of just playing defense and blocking each other.\n       The House, I take it, is going to take up fast track on \n     Thursday and there is a real question of whether they are \n     going to pass it or not. It is very controversial over her. \n     The Chairman has made a decision that, let us wait to see \n     what our colleagues are going to do over in the other body.\n       If they pass the bill over there--which is questionable, \n     but I think they will probably put it together and get it \n     done--I think the Chairman has indicated that he is willing \n     to move forward on fast track over here and do both together.\n       Now, here it is, 11:00. We know that we are, I think, not \n     going to get anything done all day long in our committee. \n     That it unfortunate. It would seem that we could get some \n     kind of an agreement to see what the House is going to do, \n     take both of them up, and pass both of them. I mean, that is \n     what I would like to see done.\n       I am for fast track authority for this President, the last \n     President, and the next President. I think they ought to have \n     it. I think it is absolutely needed. I think the Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance bill is also very important. We have \n     got a situation where people need help, and this is a proper, \n     appropriate federal response.\n       So, it is unfortunate that the defense is going to win. \n     Defense is going to win this game today. That is pretty \n     clear. But I just suggest that there ought to be a way to \n     bring these concepts together and get both of them done. I \n     think that after Thursday when the House does it, is the \n     appropriate and proper time to do it. I am for fast track. \n     But I think I am certainly going to follow the leadership of \n     the Chair and say, let us wait and see what the House does. \n     That is just a practical way to handle it.\n       Thank you.\n       The Chairman. I might say also to my good friend from Utah \n     that it is my intention to bring up fast track before the \n     committee if, and when, the House passes the bill. Now, the \n     vote is scheduled for Thursday over in the House. I, frankly, \n     question the advisability of pressing for a fast track vote \n     here at this time in this amendment. This bill is going to \n     lose. That might have some adverse effect on the House vote, \n     I do not know. But I would just urge, therefore, the Senators \n     to withdraw the amendment because our goal here is to pass \n     both fast track and Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       Now, the Chair will schedule a fast track mark-up next \n     week. Not the end of next week. It is in good faith, next \n     week, so that we could consider this bill. I think it is \n     unlikely that fast track will reach the floor of the Senate \n     this session. Highly unlikely. But, as I have said time and \n     time again, if the House dose pass fast track, I will move \n     it.\n       Senator Breaux. Yes, certainly.\n       Senator Breaux. I think the Chairman makes a good point. I \n     would say to our Republican colleagues, to Senator Hatch in \n     particular, we know what is going to happen with this vote. I \n     think, if we have a fast track vote in this committee today, \n     with the very fragile coalition we have in the House, this \n     could be a signal to the House members that the Finance \n     Committee killed it. I think that would be terrible for those \n     who wanted to get it passed. We all know what is happening. I \n     think it is a major point that it should be done.\n       But the House is on a string about whether they have enough \n     votes to pass this. Those who are opposed to it over there, \n     and some of them are Democrats, will use this vote in this \n     committee to help get the bill killed in the House, and \n     therefore prevent it ever coming up in the Senate. You have \n     made your point. Do not push it to a vote because it sends a \n     terrible signal. I think the Chairman is right on target on \n     that point.\n       Senator Kyl. Mr. Chairman?\n       The Chairman. Senator Kyl?\n       Senator Kyl. If I could, just in response to that. I do not \n     understand something here. I guess I have not been on the \n     committee long enough. But if we are all for fast track, why \n     is the vote going to lose?\n       The Chairman. Because this is a vote for another fast track \n     bill. It is not even on the fast track that is before the \n     House. It is totally different.\n       Senator Kyl. If one ways it is totally different, then \n     nobody in the House should take anything from a vote on this \n     particular provision.\n       The Chairman. Well, but we all know that sometimes the way \n     results are written up by the press and around, and different \n     people interpret things different ways, I just think it is \n     inadvisable for us to do this.\n       Senator Kyl. I cannot believe the press would not write \n     this--\n       The Chairman. I cannot either, but sometimes it happens.\n       I might say, too, the House has twice defeated fast track \n     and it was withdrawn a third time. So, that is a very \n     legitimate question of whether the House is going to pass \n     fast track.\n       Senator Hatch. But would it not be comfortable if we did?\n       The Chairman. If I might continue.\n       Senator Hatch. I am sorry. I apologize.\n       The Chairman. I do not think we should waste our time here. \n     That is, if the House does not vote fast track this week, \n     then I think it is inadvisable for us to act this week, and \n     with so few days remaining.\n       Senator Grassley. Did you say in your previous statement, \n     the one befoe now, that you would have a mark-up next week on \n     fast track?\n       The Chairman. If the House passes fast track. Yes. If the \n     House passes fast track, I will have a mark-up next week on \n     fast track.\n       Senator Bingaman. Mr. Chairman?\n       The Chairman. Senator Bingaman?\n       Senator Bingaman. I wanted to also just say a word about \n     the other aspect of Senator Hatch's amendment. As I \n     understand it, is to adopt the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     proposal the administration has made.\n       Senator Hatch. Right.\n       Senator Bingaman. I think that would be a major mistake and \n     a major disappointment for a lot of workers around the \n     country. The truth is, it is revenue-neutral. That means that \n     we are essentially saying that we will be spending no more on \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance in the future than we have spent \n     in the past.\n       Benefits will not be improved in any of the respects that \n     we are intending to in the bill that we are currently trying \n     to proceed with the mark-up on. There will be no assistance \n     to communities.\n       There will be no assistance to secondary workers. There \n     will be no extension of benefits from 52 to 78 weeks for \n     those who are trying to get training to go into other lines \n     of work. I think that would be a major disappointment for a \n     lot of people. So, I hope very much that, on that ground \n     alone, we would turn down the amendment that the Senator from \n     Utah has offered.\n       Senator Grassley. I do not know exactly what the author of \n     the amendment will do. But I would hope that, with the \n     statement by the Chairman that he will mark up next week if \n     the House passes a bill, conversely, that this will give some \n     encouragement to the House of Representatives to move forward \n     and pass it because we have a commitment then that this is \n     not going to be bottled up in this committee. That does not \n     mean what is going to happen on the floor of the Senate, but \n     at least it will not be bottled up here by the Chairman. That \n     might encourage the House to move forward with it.\n       I yield.\n       Senator Hatch. If I could just ask, before I make this \n     momentous decision. I have listened to my colleagues.\n       The Chairman. Careful.\n       Senator Hatch. I am very considerate of my colleagues most \n     of the time, I think. But could I ask Mr. Spear to tell me \n     why Senator Bingaman is not right? I mean, I know why, but I \n     would like to hear it from you.\n       Mr. Spear. Well, Senator, there are some significant \n     differences.\n       Senator Hatch. You can be a little more diplomatic. You do \n     not have to refer to Senator Bingaman. [Laughter].\n       Mr. Spear. There are some significant differences in the \n     two proposals and I would be remiss if I did not say that the \n     administration is grateful to have had the opportunity to \n     work collaboratively with staff on both sides of the aisle \n     for several months now.\n       I think since May, when we first started discussing ways to \n     improve the program, we each had different solutions to that. \n     I think both proposals tried to get at the same goal, just in \n     different ways.\n       I think, in terms of secondary workers, COBRA care, \n     extended income support, these\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n     are all significant things that are items that stand out in \n     the Chairman's mark that are not present in the \n     administration's proposal.\n       The administration worked very hard, based on three GAO \n     reports and a recent IG report in the Department of Labor to \n     improve its program. I do not recall any income \n     recommendations made in those reports that would justify \n     bolstering more money in the program to enhance the \n     performance.\n       I think what we tried to do is to increase performance, to \n     get results, stress training, which is mandatory under the \n     program, and make certain that people get placed as quickly \n     as possible. I think that is the goal of the program. I think \n     the administration's mark gets to that point.\n       Senator Snowe. Mr. Chairman?\n       The Chairman. Senator Snowe?\n       Senator Snowe. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.\n       I hope that we could sever these issues because I do think \n     it is extremely important to move ahead on the \n     reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n       But, more than reauthorization, it is an expansion on the \n     program itself based on the need and tailored to some of the \n     issues that have been developed as a result of so many \n     displaced workers. The demands have been extraordinary on the \n     program, so obviously we need to do far more in providing \n     needs to displaced workers.\n       It does include health care provisions, although I do not \n     agree with the provisions that are in this legislation, \n     particularly. I did support the original provisions that were \n     included in Senator Bingaman's bill. Hopefully we will get \n     back to that, because I think 75 percent, based on this \n     legislation, is unprecedented.\n       But, in any event, I do think we need to go forward with \n     this legislation, and based on changes. I know I have worked \n     with the administration as well and they have been commenting \n     on a number of issues, and I have worked with the Chairman \n     and Senator Bingaman, who have been very responsive to some \n     of my issues as well.\n       I do think that we have to expand the program to include \n     secondary workers, as well as a program for farmers and \n     fishermen, increasing the amount of money available for \n     retraining. In my State of Maine, we have lost thousands \n     and thousands of manufacturing jobs. In just the last few \n     years, there have been more than 7,000 workers in my State \n     that have depended upon the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     program.\n       So, it is not only necessary to move forward with this \n     program, but also to move forward in a way that reflects and \n     accommodates the additional issues that need to be addressed \n     through this reauthorization process that provides a far \n     better benefit to displaced workers, reflects the realities \n     of the workplace in making sure they have that kind of \n     support.\n       In addition, I do think it is critical to provide support \n     to communities. Obviously, when manufacturing plants or any \n     plants are closed down in a community in small towns like in \n     my State, clearly it has a reverberating effect throughout \n     the community.\n       So, we have to identify those firms that had a direct, and \n     in some cases indirect, relationship with the plant that \n     closed that really does present a hardship in the particular \n     community. I think we also have to provide additional support \n     for retraining, as has been recommended in the legislation \n     before us.\n       I would hope that we would separate these two issues. I am \n     not sure where I am on the trade promotion authority. That is \n     something that I am certainly going to reflect upon. I do \n     think that we should mark up that legislation and have a \n     date-certain commitment if the House of Representatives does \n     move forward in this legislation this week.\n       I do think that that is going to be important to address in \n     the final analysis, and I am prepared to work on that \n     legislation this month as well, Mr. Chairman and Ranking \n     Member Senator Grassley, who I know is a strong supporter of \n     the trade promotion authority. Thank you.\n       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman?\n       The Chairman. Senator Hatch?\n       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, I would like a vote on this. \n     But I can see which way the vote is going to go and there is \n     no reason to put anybody through that.\n       Would the Chairman commit to a good-faith effort to, if the \n     House does not pass this or they do not act on this, to \n     bringing this up after the first of the year?\n       The Chairman. Senator, I think we all favor fast track. We \n     all want a fast track that is fair and responsible to \n     American people. I think that a vote today reporting out TAA \n     sends a very strong positive signal for expanding trade, and \n     I hope we pass that bill out today.\n       With respect to your specific question, in the event the \n     House does not pass fast track this session, then next year I \n     will, at the earliest possible time, look for a time when we \n     can take up in the committee and have a mark-up on fast \n     track. I cannot give a specific date because next year is \n     next year.\n       Senator Hatch. Sure.\n       The Chairman. It is just hard to tell what the timing is \n     next year. But I do think that it is appropriate for us to \n     try to take it up.\n       Now, on the other hand, if the House vote is very negative, \n     then it might make sense for us to wait a little longer, or \n     maybe speed it up. It is hard to tell.\n       Senator Hatch. Or we might have to lead on.\n       The Chairman. You just have my attention, that I will bring \n     up fast track as early as practical within a reasonable way, \n     because we all want to get fast track passed in a way that \n     makes sense.\n       Senator Hatch. All right. Well, I have listened to my \n     colleagues. It is apparent that it would be basically \n     defeated for a variety of reasons here today, so I will \n     withdraw the amendment and listen to my colleagues.\n       The Chairman. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference \nAgreement on Trade Promotion Authority. Since 1994, when trade \npromotion authority lapsed, America has been on the sidelines while \nother countries have negotiated free trade agreements beneficial to \nthose countries and harmful to us. Our trading partners around the \nworld have sealed deals on approximately 150 preferential trade \ncompacts, many within our own hemisphere. Yet the United States is \nparty to only three.\n  Encouraging trade has been an undeniable benefit for Arkansas' \neconomy. Arkansas export sales of merchandise for the year 2000 totaled \n$2.07 billion, up over 13 percent from 1999 and 86 percent higher than \nthe State's 1993 total of $1.11 billion. Arkansas exported globally to \n134 foreign destinations in 2000. More than 69 percent of Arkansas's \n1,456 companies that export are small- and medium-sized businesses, and \n61,700 Arkansas jobs depend on manufactured exports. Wages for those \njobs are 13 to 18 percent higher than the national average. For 8 years \nthe United States has missed out on opportunities to increase trade, \nopportunities we frankly could not afford to miss. Today the Senate \nwill complete our debate on granting the President trade promotion \nauthority.\n  This critical legislation gives the President the authority to \nnegotiate and bring trade agreements to Congress that will eliminate \nand reduce trade barriers relating to manufacturing, services, \nagriculture, intellectual property, investment and e-commerce. Most \nimportantly, this legislation ensures that Congress can fulfill its \nconstitutional role in U.S. trade policy and fight for the interests of \nU.S. workers as well as industry.\n  One area of the conference agreement that deserves special \nrecognition is the treatment of trade remedy laws. Our Nation's trade \nlaws are essential to U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and workers. I am \nstrongly committed to preserving U.S. trade laws, as are many of my \ncolleagues. Many of us have written to the President, stating our \nopposition to trade agreements that would weaken trade remedy laws. The \nSenate commitment to preservation of the U.S. trade law is unequivocal.\n  The conference agreement speaks very clearly to this commitment. The \nlegislation before us upgrades, as a ``Principal Negotiating \nObjective,'' the preservation of the ability of the United States to \nvigorously enforce its trade remedy laws. This agreement officially \ncodifies our commitment to the preservation of these laws and to avoid \nweakening measures. It also includes provisions directing the President \nto address and remedy market distortions that lead to dumping and \nsubsidization.\n  Additionally, the conference agreement provides for close \nconsultation between the administration and Congress throughout ongoing \ntrade negotiations. It requires the President to report to Congress 180 \ndays, before entering into a trade agreement, describing the trade law \nproposals that may be included in that agreement and how these \nproposals fulfill the principal negotiating objectives. After that \nreport has been submitted, Congress may consider a resolution under \nspecial rules expressing disapproval of any trade law weakening \nprovisions that may be included in a trade agreement.\n  As the administration moves forward with trade negotiations, I urge \nour negotiators to view the measures adopted today as a clear signal \nthat Congress will take seriously any attempts to weaken our domestic \ntrade laws in the context of these negotiations. The laws currently in \nplace, particularly the antidumping and countervailing duty laws, \nensure that free trade is also fair. These laws are of critical \nimportance to U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and workers, and they must \nbe preserved. I plan to follow our multilateral trade negotiations very \nclosely with an eye toward assuring the integrity of these laws.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to indicate my support for the \nAndean Trade Preference Act conference report\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nnow before the Congress. As my colleagues know, this conference report \ncontains a number of trade provisions, including Trade Promotion \nAuthority.\n  As I have said throughout my service in the Senate, Washington State \nis the most trade-dependent State in the country. Trade and our ability \nto maintain and grow international markets for our goods and services \nis tremendously important to my State. It is an economic issue, a \nfamily-wage jobs issue for my constituents who are accustomed to \ninternational competition. With these new trade tools, the President \ncan give Washington State exporters new and expanded opportunities \nabroad. Expanded trade can play a role in job creation and economic \nrecovery for Washington State.\n  The conference report, like all legislation, is a compromise. And \nwhile I would have liked to see even stronger provisions on trade \nadjustment assistance and worker and environmental protection, the \nconference report represents real progress on many issues I have worked \non and supported over the years.\n  More workers will be eligible for trade adjustment assistance. Some \nworkers from secondary industries will be covered for the first time \nunder the conference report. The Senate bill provides a new health \nbenefit to displaced workers.\n  The Senate bill provided a stronger health benefit for displaced \nworkers. The conference report provides a 65-percent up-front, \nrefundable tax credit for COBRA coverage which is slightly less than \nthe 70-percent up-front credit provided by the Senate bill. This is a \nsignificant benefit. Congress will have to monitor closely the degree \nto which displaced workers are able to access the benefits. If \nnecessary, I will not hesitate to support further modification of this \nprogram to allow displaced workers and their families to keep their \nhealth insurance. This is an issue of ongoing interest to me.\n  Fast track or trade promotion authority has been debated extensively \nnow for 8 years. The President will soon have the authority that he and \nhis Democratic predecessor sought. As the administration looks forward \nto difficult trade talks with Chile, Singapore, and others, I call upon \nthe President and USTR Zoellick to be true to the debate the Congress \nhas had on trade promotion. Many important issues have been raised. And \nwhile not all are included in the final conference report, the issues \nraised by the Congress will play a role in final approval of any trade \nagreement negotiated with TPA.\n  I am concerned that this administration will not be inclusive in \nupcoming trade negotiations. Members of Congress and outside groups \nhave a legitimate role to play in setting national trade priorities and \npolicy and I encourage the administration to be respectful of these \nroles. I have had several discussions with Ambassador Zoellick and he \nhas demonstrated to me an awareness of important issues to my State. \nThe administration should not misinterpret today's TPA vote. It is not \na vote for a trade agreement. Congress will closely scrutinize the work \nof this administration as it negotiates as well as any agreement \nsubmitted for consideration under TPA's expedited procedures. I will be \na very interested observer as the President and his trade team move \nforward.\n  The tremendous importance of international trade to my State, my \nentire State is the strongest argument for my vote in support of trade \npromotion authority.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues, my \nconstituents and the administration on important international trade \nissues. Today's vote is an important step, a complicated step but \nultimately the right step for our country.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the \nconference agreement on the Andean Trade Preferences Act of 2002 that \nwill grant the President authority to negotiate trade agreements and \nsend them to Congress for a straight up or down vote on an expedited \nschedule. This Administration has not demonstrated that it will \npreserve our existing trade laws when making international agreements. \nThat means American workers are very likely to be injured by new trade \ndeals, and I cannot in good conscience give up my rights to protect \nthem through the traditional legislative process. I will vote no on \nthis conference agreement.\n  I remind my colleagues that within the first few months of this \nAdministration, U.S. trade negotiators put our trade laws on the table \nat the urging of foreign interests, as they sought to reach an \nagreement for the agenda of the upcoming trade round in Doha, Qatar. \nThat happened even though 62 Senators had written the President and \ntold him that we did not want any weakening of our trade laws as part \nof those negotiations. And it happened even though personal commitments \nhad been made to me, as a Member of the Senate Finance Committee, that \nsuch actions would not be taken. The Administration knew very well that \na clear, strong bipartisan majority in the Senate believed we should \nfully protect our trade laws, and they made them a bargaining chip \nanyway.\n  Without the assurance that our existing unfair trade laws--including \nour antidumping, countervailing duty laws, will be protected and \naggressively enforced in all instances, I cannot give new authority to \nthe President to negotiate treaties that could leave American workers \nwithout needed remedies for unfair trade. West Virginia's hard \nexperience with illegal trade shows why we must maintain the minimal \nprotections provided by our existing trade laws.\n  As a member of the Senate/House conference committee that hammered \nout this agreement, I know that Members of good faith worked hard to \nproduce a bill that balances trade promotion and assistance for workers \ndisplaced by trade. In my judgment, the beneficial provisions that help \ndisplaced workers in this package do not offset the damage that could \nbe done to American workers through the virtually inevitable weakening \nof our trade laws.\n  During the Senate debate, I made it clear that I had tremendous \nconcern about the potential for new trade agreements to weaken U.S. \ntrade remedy laws, in particular the antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws. These essential laws level the playing field on which our \nfirms and workers compete internationally, and they serve the crucial \nfunction of offsetting and deterring some harmful unfair trade \npractices affecting international trade today.\n  I know the Chairman of the Finance Committee shares my concern that \nwe preserve these laws, but we have a disagreement over the effect that \ngranting fast track to the President will have on our ability to do so. \nWhile I believe it would be a serious mistake for any Administration to \nthink that a trade agreement or package of agreements can be \nsuccessfully presented to Congress for any approval, fast-track or \notherwise, if it includes weakening changes to our trade remedy laws, I \nfear that is exactly what this Administration has demonstrated, through \nits own actions, that it intends to do.\n  This trade bill will make it considerably easier for the \nAdministration to change our trade laws in international negotiations \nbecause it deletes the Dayton-Craig amendment that I, and 60 of my \nSenate colleagues, voted in favor of adopting. The Dayton-Craig \namendment would have ensured that the Senate could separately consider \nany changes to the trade laws. The final conference agreement, \nregrettably, diminishes congressional leverage to protect the trade \nlaws. The conference agreement replaces Dayton-Craig with a process \nwhereby either House can pass a nonbinding resolution expressing \nopposition to proposed changes to our fair trade laws. The \nAdministration could ignore this resolution with no penalty.\n  Arguably, the conference report changes might make it even more \ndifficult for Congress to withdraw fast track, because it would allow \nonly one of either the nonbinding resolution or the more meaningful \n``procedural disapproval resolution'', withdrawing fast track, on any \ntrade agreement. Therefore, if a nonbinding resolution had already been \nreported out of the Senate Finance Committee or the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, both houses would then lose the right to introduce \n``procedural disapproval resolutions'' on the same. The procedural \ndisapproval resolution was a key element of how the original Senate \nbill sought to protect U.S. trade laws, and losing the right to \nintroduce it will actually\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nlimit Congress' ability to withdraw fast track.\n  As a conferee on this trade bill, I entered conference negotiations \nunderstanding that many of the conferees believed we needed to make \nadjustments to the Dayton-Craig language. Unfortunately, the final \nagreement did not retain the basic underpinnings of Dayton-Craig--that \nwe include some mechanism to allow Congress to remove any efforts to \nweaken our trade laws from trade agreements returned under fast track. \nThis is a grave failure of the conference. I believe we will come to \ndeeply regret the conference changes in this regard and that American \nworkers will suffer for it.\n  For my part, I will continue to strongly oppose any weakening changes \nto our trade laws, whether in the WTO, as part of any deal brought back \nunder fast track negotiating authority, or in any other form. But the \nfinal language of the conference agreement will make it harder for me \nto protect U.S. trade law in the future, and that is a major reason I \nwill oppose this bill.\n  I am very proud that the final conference agreement retained much of \nthe Senate's good work on expanding and improving the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program. Under this bill, when workers lose their jobs due \nto imports, they will now, for the first time ever, have some help \naccessing health care coverage. That is a critical new benefit, and is \none of the provisions that was fundamental to moving this legislation \nin the Senate. Health care coverage for displaced workers is an \nessential transitional benefit that American workers deserve and that \nis long overdue.\n\n  I believe the health credit provisions in the Senate bill were \nsuperior to the provisions of the House bill and to the final \nprovisions of the conference report in many fundamental ways. The \nSenate's TAA health provisions worked better than the conference report \nto ensure that workers could access the health credit established by \nthe bill and could afford the health care coverage they need. The \nSenate bill included necessary insurance market reforms to ensure that \nthe new TAA health credit would be available to the workers who needed \nit, but the conference report unacceptably dilutes those protections. \nUnfortunately, in the interest of reaching a quick agreement before the \nHouse adjourned, the amount of the Senate's health subsidy was reduced \nfrom 70 percent of benefit costs to 65 percent, making it that much \nmore difficult for unemployed workers to be able to afford the \ncoverage. I very much regret that conferees did not retain the senate's \nworker provisions in whole.\n  However, I have to not that the final agreement includes one very \nimportant addition to the Senate bill by providing health care coverage \nto early retirees whose companies went bankrupt and who are receiving a \ncheck from the Pension benefit Guarantee Corporation, (PBGC). It's only \na small portion of the retirees I had hoped would get some health care \ncoverage from this trade bill, but it will make a real difference in \nthe lives of tens of thousands of retirees. And I am extremely pleased \nwe have set a precedent that just because people are retired, their \nlives are no less affected by trade.\n  The House had added a provision that helped PBGC beneficiaries access \nits health credit, as it attempted to muster the necessary votes to \nappoint House conferees. The last-minute House provision established a \nnew precedent to extend TAA benefits to retirees, but also included \nunrealistic income limitations that would have effectively made the \ncredit impossible to access for most early retirees, including retired \nsteelworkers who very much need help with their health care coverage.\n  I am very pleased that the conference negotiations built on the House \nprovision and improved it substantially. The conference agreement will \ngive these workers, aged 55-65, access to a more affordable health \ncredit. The final PBGC provision has the complete market protections of \nthe final package, and these early retirees whose companies have shut \ndown can access this health coverage for the duration of the TAA \nprogram as long as they meet the age criteria, are receiving a PBGC \ncheck, and do not have access to other health care coverage. There will \nbe no unrealistically low income limitations on retiree eligibility for \nthis program. I know that at some point, some West Virginia retirees \nwill have to rely on this provision, and I am very glad that the final \nagreement does not forget them.\n  My hope had been to extend the health credit to all steel retirees \nwho lose the health benefits they have earned when their companies go \nbankrupt, and not only to early retirees under age 65. Senators \nMikulski and Wellstone introduced an amendment during the original \ntrade bill debate in the Senate that would have done this. Fifty-seven \nSenators agreed that protecting steel retirees was the right thing to \ndo, but our amendment fell just short of the procedural requirement of \n60 votes, so the Senate bill did not ultimately include this \nprotection. But the final conference agreement at least says we should \nhelp a small group of early retirees, and I am very pleased that \nprovision will become law.\n  The Senate's TAA provisions on secondary workers and shift in \nproduction were far superior to the House's, and the final conference \nerodes some of the Senate's work, to the detriment of American workers \nwho will need the help of TAA. Those concessions are a disappointing \nretrenchment from the Senate bill, and I am disappointed that we did \nnot prevail so that all workers substantially affected by trade could \naccess TAA benefits.\n  In conclusion, despite the hard work of my Chairman who worked \nhimself to exhaustion to complete this agreement under terrible time \nconstraints as well as the consistently excellent work of his dedicated \nstaff, this agreement does not retain the full benefits of the senate \nbill, and American workers lose as a result. Fundamentally, I do not \nbelieve the assurances and trust that would need to exist between the \nAdministration and Congress on preserving our trade laws and protecting \nAmerican interests is sufficient to warrant ceding Congress' \nconstitutional responsibility on trade.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to accompany the trade Promotion Authority/Trade Adjustment \nAssistance legislation. This landmark legislation is a careful \ncompromise that will benefit the American public by creating new jobs \nand investment opportunities.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.\n  This legislation is not only good for the citizens of Utah, it is \ngood for all Americans and it is good for our trading partners, \nespecially those in the developing world.\n  In fact, almost 10% of all U.S. jobs--an estimated 12 million \nworkers--now depend on America's ability to export to the rest of the \nworld. Export-related jobs typically pay 13% to 18% more than the \naverage U.S. wage.\n  This legislation will help bring new jobs into Salt Lake City and \nacross our state. Last year, Utah's manufacturers produced and exported \n$2.7 billion worth of manufactured items to more than 150 countries \naround the world. An estimated 61,400 jobs in Utah are trade-related \nand one in every six manufacturing jobs in Utah--approximately 20,300 \njobs--are tied to exports. Trade is of great benefit to Utah's small \nand medium sized companies. Some 80% of Utah's 1,894 companies that \nexport are small and medium sized businesses.\n  As the Ranking Republican member of the International Trade \nSubcommittee of the Finance Committee, I make international trade a \nhigh priority. International trade plays two important roles: it \nstrengthens the U.S. and world economy; and it is a powerful foreign \npolicy tool. Free trade and respect for freedom go hand in hand.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this measure is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we will face this year. Trade promotion \nauthority is vital to our national economy and security, benefiting \nAmerican businesses and employees everywhere. Simply stated, it means \nmore jobs, higher wages, and better products.\n  Passage of this legislation is a significant victory for the American \npeople, especially our entrepreneurs. It was President Bush's \nleadership that propelled Congress to address this eight-year drought \nin trade promotion authority. I remember well the meeting that the \nPresident convened in the\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nCabinet Room two weeks ago today to urge the trade bill conferees to \nget our work done before the August recess. Today's vote must be seen \nas a great vote of confidence in President Bush's leadership.\n  I commend conference committee Chairman Bill Thomas and Vice Chairman \nMax Baucus for their leadership in expeditiously putting together this \nbipartisan compromise. Senators Breaux and Rockefeller played key roles \nas did Representatives Rangel, Crane, Dingell, Boehner, Johnson, \nMiller, Tauzin, Bilrakis, Burton, Barr, Waxman, Sensenbrenner, Cobie, \nConyers, Dreier, Linder, and Hastings.\n  A full conference agreement on three major bills--TPA, TAA, and the \nAndean Trade Pact completed in three days! That is exactly the way the \nCongress can and should act on behalf of the American people if we put \npartisan politics aside and roll up our sleeves and get to work. In \nparticular, Chairman Bill Thomas performed a legislative tour de force \nlast week. Everyone should know about his leadership and thank him for \nthe way he worked to resolve issues with Senator Baucus and the other \nconferees.\n  I am particularly pleased that we are adopting this bill in August \nrather than October or December. This will give the Administration's \ntrade team led by Secretary of Commerce Don Evans, United States Trade \nRepresentative Bob Zoellick, Undersecretary of Commerce Grant Aldonis, \nand Deputy USTR Jon Huntsman--a Utahn I might add--an immediate \nopportunity to negotiate trade pacts that will bring new jobs home to \nAmerica and help increases the demand for American goods abroad.\n  Not only will passage of this legislation expand the Administration's \nability to negotiate, and for Congress to review, trade agreements, the \ntrade adjustment assistance provisions will provide re-training and \nhealth care benefits to those workers who lose their jobs due to \nforeign trade. We in Utah, home of Geneva steel--where 1,600 workers \nand their families are struggling due to the fact that unfair dumping \nof foreign steel has caused the plant to cease production--known full \nwell that, while most will gain through trade, inevitably some will \nlose out and need transitional assistance. This bill provides $12 \nbillion of such assistance over 10 years.\n  This legislation will also reauthorize the Andean Trade Pact that \nexpired last December. From my work on the Judiciary Committee, I can \ntell you that this is a vital trade pact as we help wean these nations \naway from economic dependence on the illicit drug trade. I want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of Senator McCain on the importance \nof passing the expired Andean Trade Pact before some South American \neconomies topple.\n  This is a good bill. It is legislation that will have both short-term \nand long-term benefits. A strong vote for this bill will indicate to \nour trading partners that the United States intends to play the \nleadership role during the Doha Round of international trade talks.\n  This bill will boost our economy which is still struggling to regain \nits footing. As we face a new type of war, the war against terrorism, \nit is important that we strengthen our relationship with our trading \npartners throughout the world. From mutual economic interests that come \nthrough trade, political alliances can form. This dynamic can only help \nus hunt down and deny safe harbor for any terrorists. At the least, our \nneighbors throughout the world will get to know Americans and our \nvalues and ideals. This will only increase our stature in the world.\n  For all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this \nbipartisan conference report on trade. Let's get the job done for the \nAmerican public and pass this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this time to talk in some \ndetail about the Trade Adjustment Assistance provisions in the \nconference report.\n  I am proud of the entire conference agreement--but I am particularly \nproud of the TAA provisions. For the first time since 1974, we are \npartnering a grant of Presidential authority to negotiate agreements \nthat expand trade with a serious commitment to deal with the downside \nof trade expansion.\n  We all know that trade greatly benefits our economy as a whole. But \nwe also know that a Government decision to pursue trade liberalization \ncan have adverse consequences for some. As President Kennedy recognized \nin 1962, we, as a government, have an obligation ``to render assistance \nto those who suffer as a result of national trade policy.''\n  The trade adjustment assistance program has been around for 40 years. \nDuring that time, it has quietly helped thousands of trade-impacted \nworkers to retrain and make a new start. But the program has also been \ncriticized for being too complicated, underfunded, and available to too \nfew workers.\n  This conference report will go a long way toward solving these \nproblems and making TAA work better for working Americans. Does it have \neverything in it that I could have wished? To be honest, no. That is \nthe nature of compromise. But overall, I think we have done very well \nindeed. So let me know run through some of the most important \nprovisions in the conference report.\n  First, the conference report expands the number of workers eligible \nfor TAA benefits in several ways. Like the Senate bill, the conference \nreport covers secondary workers where the loss of business with the \nprimary firm ``contributed importantly'' to job losses at the secondary \nplant. In addition, where a secondary plant supplies 20 percent of more \nof its sales or production to the primary plant, coverage is presumed. \nThe conference report also provides TAA coverage to downstream workers \nwho are impacted by trade with Mexico or Canada.\n  The conference report also expands coverage to workers affected by \nshifts in production. Workers are automatically covered if their plant \nmoves to a country with which the United States has a free trade \nagreement, or to a country that is part of a preferential trade \narrangement such as ATPA, CBI, or AGOA.\n  For workers whose plant moves to any other country, TAA benefits are \navailable if the Secretary of Labor determines that imports have \nincreased or are likely to increase.\n  While the Senate bill did not require a showing of increased imports, \nthere are virtually no instances in which relocating production abroad \nwould not be accompanies by, or lead to, an increase in imports of the \nproduct. Only workers at a company that produced 100 percent for \nexport, with no domestic sales, would be excluded. And it is \nparticularly important to note that the workers do not have to prove \nthat the increase in imports will come from the country to which \nproduction relocated.\n  In addition, the conference report includes a new TAA program for \nfarmers, ranchers, fishermen, and other agricultural producers. Past \nattempts to shoehorn farmers into eligibility requirements intended for \nmanufacturing workers have left most with no access to TAA. By focusing \neligibility requirements on the relationship between imports and \ncommodity prices, the conferences bill creates a program better suited \nto the unique situation of trade-impacted agricultural producers.\n  The Senate bill actually included two separate programs--one \nspecifically for independent fishermen and one for farmers, ranchers, \nand other agricultural producers. The conference report eliminates the \nseparate program with dedicated funds for fishermen. But that does not \nmean fishermen are excluded from TAA. As agricultural producers, they \nare still able to participate in the general TAA for farmers program.\n  Taken together, these expansions in eligibility are likely to result \nin tens of thousands of additional workers receiving TAA benefits every \nyear. Moreover, the benefits that they receive will be better than ever \nbefore in several ways.\n  Most importantly, the TAA provisions include health care coverage for \ndisplaced workers for the first time in the program's history. Workers \neligible for TAA will receive a 65 percent advanceable, refundable tax \ncredit that can be used to pay for COBRA coverage, or a variety of \nstate-based group coverage options.\n  The credit could not be used for the purchase of individual health \ninsurance unless the worker had a private, non-group policy prior to \nbecoming eligible for TAA. The health care credit is available to \nworkers for as long as they are participating in the TAA program.\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\n  The conference report also improves coverage by extending income \nsupport from 52 to 78 weeks for workers completing training. It adds a \nfurther 26 weeks of training and income supports for workers who must \nbegin with remedial education such as English as a second language. To \npay for this additional training, the annual training budget is doubled \nfrom $110 million to $220 million.\n  For older workers, the conference report offers wage insurance as an \nalternative to traditional TAA. Workers who qualify and who take lower-\npaying jobs can receive a wage subsidy of up to 50 percent of the \ndifference between the old and new salary--up to $10,000 over two \nyears. The goal is to encourage on-the-job training and faster re-\nemployment of older workers who generally find it difficult to change \ncareers.\n  The Senate bill included a two-year wage insurance pilot program. The \nconference report improves on the Senate bill in two ways--by making \nthe program permanent, and by providing TAA health benefits to workers \nunder the program if the new employer does not provide health \ninsurance.\n  There are other enhancements to benefits as well. Job search and \nrelocation allowances are increased. The authorization level for the \nTAA for firms program is increased from $10 million to $16 million \nannually. And the Conference Report improves on the Senate bill by \nproviding TAA health care benefits for up to 2 years to workers \nreceiving pension benefits from the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation.\n  Finally, in addition to expanding benefits and eligibility, the \nconference report makes a number of improvements that streamline the \nprogram. Like the Senate bill, the conference report consolidates the \nexisting TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs. This eliminates bureaucracy and \nconfusion and saves workers the trouble of applying to two separate \nprograms.\n  The conference report also shortens the time in which the Secretary \nof Labor must consider petitions, extends permissible breaks in \ntraining so workers don't lose income assistance during semester \nbreaks, and provides common-sense training waivers for all workers.\n  Taken together, these are extraordinary improvements in the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program. They will make the program fairer, more \nefficient, and more user friendly. Over the past year and longer, I \nhave worked hard--with the help of many colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--to raise the profile of TAA. All along, my message has been that \nif we want to rebuild the center on trade, improving Trade Adjustment \nAssistance is the right thing to do.\n  I am proud of how far we have come toward that goal. I am proud of \nthis conference report. I urge my colleagues to support the conference \nreport and send this historic legislation to the President this week.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a historic day. I am very proud \nof what we have accomplished. The Trade Act of 2002 will soon be sent \nto the President's desk for his signature, and America will once again \ntake a leadership role in promoting international trade in the world \neconomy.\n  Let me briefly highlight the important provisions in this bill. First \nand most momentous, we restored the President's ability to negotiate \nstrong trade deals, and send them back to Congress for an up or down \nvote. This authority has been absent for far too long, and I see this \nas one of the greatest successes of this Congress.\n  Second, we renewed and expanded preferences for our important allies \nin the Andean region, which will help to eradicate the drug trade that \nthreatens their stability, and our health and safety.\n  Next, we reauthorized both the Generalized System of Preferences, \nwhich expired last year, and the Customs Service. And last of all, we \nrenewed and expanded the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for \nworkers who become displaced by trade.\n  Thank you to my colleagues who helped make this happen. I would like \nto commend my colleague and friend, Senator Baucus for his leadership \nand keeping his word that we would get this done. Thank you also to \nSenator Hatch who has been an instrumental ally in the Conference \nCommittee as well as on the Finance Committee, and thank you to Senator \nHatch's staff members Bruce Artim and Chris Campbell for their hard \nwork. Senator Phil Gramm was also a great help in getting us to this \npoint, along with Amy Dunathan from his trade staff. They were key in \nhelping to negotiate a deal when this legislation was first brought to \nthe Senate floor.\n  Next, I would like to thank my staff, who have been dedicated and \nfocused on passing TPA for the past couple of years. This is a great \nsuccess, and I am happy to share it with them. I would like to thank \nthe Staff Director of my Finance Committee staff, Kolan Davis, Chief \nTrade Counsel Everett Eissenstat, and Trade Counsel Richard Chriss. \nThis would not have happened if it were not for their incredible work \nethic and knowledge, along with the hard work and support of trade \nstaff members Carrie Clark and Tiffany McCullen Atwell.\n  My Finance Committee health and pension staff also played an \nimportant role in this process. Thank you to Ted Totman, Colin Roskey \nand Diann Howland for helping us navigate through the complex health \nand pension issues in the Trade Adjustment Assistance section of the \nbill.\n  Senator Baucus had a good staff helping him as well. And I would like \nto thank them for their hard work and long nights that went into making \nthis happen. Senator Baucus' staff was led by John Angell and Mike \nEvans, and his trade staff was led by Greg Mastel, along with Angela \nMarshall Hofmann, Tim Punke, Ted Posner, Shara Aranoff and Andy Harig.\n  A sincere thank you also must be given to Polly Craighill from the \noffice of the Senate Legislative Counsel, for her patience and \nexpertise in drafting this legislation.\n  We can all be proud of this accomplishment, and I look forward to the \nPresident signing it into law.\n  Mr. BACUS. Mr. President, as we discuss the Andean Trade Preferences \nAct, it is important to note that for an Andean nation to qualify for \ntrade benefits it must fulfill seven mandatory criteria. I want to \nfocus on one of those criteria in particular. I am referring to the \nrequirement that a country act in good faith in recognizing as binding \nand in enforcing arbitration awards in favor of United States citizens \nand companies. 19 U.S.C. 3202(c)(3). I focus on this requirement, \nbecause it has come to my attention that a number of ATPA countries may \nhave failed to honor arbitration awards in favor of U.S. companies.\n  To attract foreign investment, ATPA beneficiary countries need to \ncreate a hospitable investment climate. Honoring arbitration awards is \na fundamental component of this climate.\n  This matter is sufficiently important that the Finance Committee drew \nspecial attention to it in its report on the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act Report Number 107-126. In that report, the Committee \nidentified several specific cases in which we understand that Andean \ncountries had failed to honor arbitration awards in favor of U.S. \ncompanies. Some of these cases have remained unresolved for far too \nlong. I urge those countries seeking to qualify for enhanced benefits \nto resolve these situations promptly.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in emphasizing the importance of ATPA \nbeneficiary countries' honoring arbitration awards in favor of United \nStates citizens and companies. I urge the President and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to examine this matter very closely in determining \nwhether to give enhanced benefits to the ATPA countries.\n  I also want to address briefly a provision in the conference report \nconcerning negotiations left over from the Uruguay Round of world trade \nnegotiations. Specifically, section 2102(b)(13) of the conference \nreport concerns certain ``WTO extended negotiations.'' One of these is \nnegotiation on trade in civil aircraft. The conference report \nincorporates by reference the objectives set forth in section 135(c) of \nthe Uruguay Round Agreements Act 19 U.S.C. 3355(c). When the URAA was \nenacted, the objective set forth at section 135(c) was elaborated on in \nthe accompanying statement of administrative action. It is my \nunderstanding that in incorporating by reference section 135(c) of the \nURAA, Congress also is re-affirming the corresponding provisions from \nthe statement of administrative action. This understanding is \nconsistent\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\nwith the explanation in the Finance Committee's report on H.R. 3005 \nReport Number 107-139.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I further want to address an aspect of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, which forms part of the Trade Act of 2002. The Andean \nTrade Preference Act grants duty-free access to certain tuna products \nfrom the Andean countries. Let me first say that I support the \nobjective of the Andean Trade Preference Act to encourage the Andean \ncountries in promoting economic development and fighting the drug \ntrade. I am concerned, however, that some tuna imported into the United \nStates under this preference program may not be legally harvested.\n  A case was recently reported in the news in which the El Dorado, a \nColombian-flagged vessel working for the Ecuadorian company Inepaca, \none of the largest fish processing facilities in Latin America, was \ncaught fishing illegally in Ecuador's Galapagos Marine Reserve. \nIndustrial fishing in the reserve is prohibited under Ecuadorian law. \nThe Galapagos Marine Reserve is a globally significant area that was \nrecognized earlier this year as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n  In addition, the report stated that the vessel was illegally fishing \nfor tuna using a method known as dolphin encirclement. This technique \nis permitted under international law only if its carried out in \ncompliance with dolphin protection requirements imposed through the \nAgreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program and other \nassociated legal requirements. The El Dorado reportedly was not \nauthorized to fish using this method. As a result, dolphins were \ntrapped in the net, and over 60 dolphins were either killed or injured. \nIt concerns me that some of the tuna that will be coming into the \nUnited States duty free under the Andean Trade Preference Act may be \ncaught in the same way--illegally, and without respect for dolphins and \nother marine life.\n  I raised this issue during the conference on the trade bill. I am \nconcerned about our environmental and trade policies being mutually \nsupportive. As my colleagues know, the conference report also sets out \nthe overall trade negotiating objectives of the United States. Those \nobjectives include ensuring that trade and environmental policies are \nmutually supportive, and seeking to protect and preserve the \nenvironment and enhance the international means of doing so, while \noptimizing the use of the world's resources. Moreover, the conference \nreport makes it a principal negotiating objective to ensure that a \nparty to a trade agreement with the United States does not fail to \neffectively enforce its environmental laws in a manner affecting trade.\n  I would like to emphasize that, according to reports, the El Dorado \nincident was not a case where the government simply didn't know about \nthe violation. This was a case of truly ineffective enforcement. As I \nunderstand it, the Galapagos National Park Authorities actually \ncaptured the El Dorado and took videotape of the incident. The Captain \nof the Port, an official of the Ecuadorian navy, fined the El Dorado's \ncaptain four cents. I think we can all agree that a fine of 4 cents \ndoes not even amount to a slap on the wrist. We are waiting to see if \nthe Ecuadorian Government will take additional steps to further \nprosecute this case.\n  I also believe that the El Dorado incident is not an isolated case. I \nunderstand that when the Galapagos National Park authorities found the \nEl Dorado, they were in search of another vessel that had been fishing \nillegally in the Galapagos Marine Reserve.\n  The Andean Trade Preference Act requires the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to report to Congress biannually on beneficiary \ncountries' compliance with the eligibility criteria under the Act. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, I will be asking the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to include in its biannual reports a discussion of the \nextent to which beneficiary countries are enforcing their environmental \nlaws, including the prohibition on industrial fishing in the Galapagos \nMarine Reserve, and complying with their international obligations \nunder the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program.\n  I also note that under section 2102(c)(4) of the conference report, \nthe President is required to conduct environmental reviews of future \ntrade and investment agreements and to report to the Finance Committee \nand the House Committee on Ways and Means. It is my expectation that \nthese reviews will take into account the extent to which trade \nagreement partners are effectively enforcing their environmental laws.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President: for too long, Congress has been deeply \ndivided between those who argued that free trade has no downside, and \nothers who said it is a complete disaster.\n  As a result, we did not give the President the authority to \naggressively pursue new markets for American goods and services, nor \ndid we do enough to help the workers who were being hurt by trade.\n  Today we stand on the verge of recognizing in law a basic truth: our \neconomy as a whole benefits enormously from expanded global trade. But \nsome workers, due to no fault of their own, are hurt by it.\n  We could not have reached this point without the leadership shown by \nChairman Baucus. Simply put, Senator Baucus engineered an agreement \nthat few thought was possible. I have no doubt our nation will be \nstronger because of it.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley, the Ranking member, and Senator \nHatch on the Republican side for their work in crafting a bipartisan \nbill.\n  I want to thank Senator Breaux, who worked so effectively to help us \nachieve the initial compromise that got us into the conference . . . \nand then helping find the compromise that got us out . . . with this \nagreement.\n  And, finally, I want to say a special word of thanks to Senator \nrockefeller for his work in the conference. He was an incredibly strong \nand passionate advocate for the health care provisions and the entire \nworker package. He did the workers of West Virginia, and this country, \nproud.\n  I stand in strong support for this trade legislation for three \nfundamental reasons:\n  First, in this time of economic uncertainty, it sends a strong \nmessage to the American people and to the markets of the world that \nnothing is going to stop us from seizing the opportunities of the \nglobal economy.\n  Second, it makes sure that while we advance trade, we do not trade \naway the values on which prosperity is built: that every American \nshould have the opportunity to succeed.\n  Third, this bill sends a strong message to the nations of the world, \nfriends and enemies alike--that the United States of America will not \nshrink from our responsibilities as a global economic leader.\n  These are uncertain economic times.\n  Americans have seen their confidence in corporate governance shaken. \nThe resulting decline in the stock market has hurt pensions and \nsavings. Families are wondering how they're going to afford a child's \ncollege tuition, or their own retirement.\n  This fear plays itself out against the backdrop of an economy \nstruggling to re-emerge from recession, and a government that has seen \none of the most dramatic fiscal reversals in history.\n  The historic accounting reform bill we passed unanimously last week--\nand that the President signed on Tuesday, will help restore integrity \nto our capital markets.\n  This trade bill is another important step in restoring strength to \nour economy.\n  No nation is better suited or better prepared to benefit from global \ntrade. We have the best-educated workers and most productive workforce \nin the world, the most mature economy, the most developed \ninfrastructure. We are in a position to seize the high-skill, high-wage \njobs generated by open global markets, so long as we don't turn our \nbacks on them.\n  Just as we can't turn our backs on trade, we can't turn our backs on \nthe hard-working American families who have had their lives ruined by \nthe impersonal forces of trade.\n  It can be devastating to a family when a parent loses his or her job \nbecause a factory closes down or moves away. That devastation can turn \nto real fear if losing that job means losing health insurance.\n  The reality is that the jobs we gain from trade do nothing to \ncompensate the men and women who have lost their jobs because of trade.\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\n  That's why, for the first time, this legislation provides a 65 \npercent tax credit to help trade dislocated people keep their health \ncoverage. This represents a significant step in providing families with \na greater sense of security.\n  This bill also makes a number of additional improvements over our \ncurrent system:\n  Under our current TAA program, benefits are available only to those \nindustries that are ``directly'' affected by trade.\n  For example, workers at an automobile plant that closes down due to a \nflood of imported cars will qualify for help. But workers at a parts \nsupplier that's right across the street, and that closes as an \ninevitable consequence of the auto plant's shut-down, are out of luck.\n  Now, for the first time, ``secondary'' workers and farmers will be \neligible for training and other kinds of assistance.\n  This bill also includes ``wage insurance,'' a time-limited stipend \nthat replaces some of a dislocated worker's lost income if he or she \ntakes a lower paying job.\n  Instead of an unemployment check, these workers would receive a \nsubsidy when they take a lower paying job. This new approach will \nencourage this group to get back into the workforce and help them try \nto sustain their standard of living as they approach retirement.\n  Last year, we passed an important education reform bill. We agreed \nthen that we would ``leave no child behind.'' Now we need to make sure \nwe leave no worker behind.\n  By strengthening the safety net for those who are hurt by trade, our \nTrade Adjustment Assistance proposal will help us remedy America's \nother trade deficit, the deficit of support for the workers here in \nAmerica who have been hurt by trade.\n  Finally, passage of this bill will reassert American leadership in \nthe world. We are the freest, wealthiest, and most powerful country in \nthe world. It is in our interest and it is our responsibility to \ndemonstrate global economic leadership, especially in these troubled \ntimes.\n  At a time, when many around the world are doubting our commitment to \nmultilateral action, this legislation says that the United States will \nbe a leader in the effort to establish stronger global trade ties.\n  Expanding trade is not solely about economic leadership, it also \noffers national security and foreign policy benefits. When it is done \ncorrectly, trade opens more than new markets; it opens the way for \ndemocratic reforms. It also increases understanding and interdependence \namong nations, raises the cost of conflict, and alleviates the global \ndisparities in income and opportunity that terrorists seek to exploit \nin order to advance their own deadly aims.\n  For example, the Andean Trade Preferences Act, ATPA was designed as \nan effort to reduce barriers to trade between the United States and \nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It was first passed in 1991 as \npart of a comprehensive effort to defeat narco-trafficking and reduce \nthe flow of cocaine into the United States.\n  The program has already established a record of success.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, between 1991 and \n1999, tow-way trade between the U.S. and Andean nations nearly doubled, \nand U.S. exports to the region grew by 65 percent.\n  The ITC also reports that ATPA has contributed significantly to the \ndiversification of the region's exports, which means that farmers in a \nregion that produces 100 percent of the cocaine consumed in the U.S. \nnow have viable economic alternatives to the production of cocoa.\n  That's the positive power trade can have, and that is why, as part of \nthis bill, we renew and improve the Andean Trade Preferences Act.\n  The word ``trade'' has its roots in an old Middle English word \nmeaning ``path,'' which is connected to the word ``tread'', to move \nforward.\n  This trade package will enable us to move forward in this new global \neconomy in a way that strengthens our national security, and the \neconomic security of American businesses and families on both sides of \nthe trade issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is free trade, no trade, and fair \ntrade. I am for fair trade. And I am also for respecting the role of \nCongress in designing public policy. The Trade Promotion Authority \npackage we are voting on today will not result in fair trade and it \ncedes too much power to the President.\n  I do not believe in giving a President carte blanche to write trade \nlegislation. I do not want to grant him the right to negotiate away \nprotection for American workers and the environment.\n  Imagine if the President could have proposed a corporate \naccountability bill and the Congress would have had only an up or down \nvote. Would we have passed legislation as strong as the legislation the \nPresident signed? We are about to debate pension reform legislation. \nShould we ask the President to make a proposal and then vote up or down \non that proposal? Clearly not. It is our responsibility to work with \nthe Executive branch of government to design policies that respect our \nconstituents.\n  The Trade Promotion Authority legislation fails American workers and \nfails to address the need for smart environmental protections. In \nshort, TPA could result in trade agreements that are free from \nenvironmental and are in no way fair. And it would preclude us from \namending future trade agreements to make them fair.\n  Let me be more specific.\n  This bill will allow a company to sue a developing nation if that \ncountry improves its environmental standards and that improvement \nresults in some monetary loss for the foreign investor. That would \ndiscourage developing nations from improving their environmental \nstandards out of fear of being sued. That is not fair trade, it is only \ntrade that benefits the powerful.\n  This bill will push down the wages and protections of our workers by \nforcing them to compete with workers who go unprotected abroad. It \nfails to provide U.S. trade negotiators with clear instructions that \nthe U.S. not engage in new trade agreements with countries who are \nunwilling to provide their workers with the following core labor \nstandards--freedom of association and the right to bargain \ncollectively, the elimination of forced labor, the abolition of child \nlabor, and the elimination of discrimination in employment. Without a \ncommitment to these standards, and this TPA has made no commitment to \nthese standards, we will not have fair trade.\n  Most disturbing, the conference committee dropped the Senate-passed \nDayton-Craig language on protecting U.S. trade laws. As a result, there \nwill be no reliable mechanism to keep our domestic trade laws from \nbeing weakened or eliminated in upcoming trade negotiations. This \nprovision passed the Senate by a wide margin and the conference \ncommittee's rejection of it is disappointing.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) package for workers who lose \nwork because of changing trade patterns is also inadequate. In \nparticular, service workers were left out the TAA. And I was blocked \nfrom amending the bill to make truckers who will lost their job as a \nresult of trade eligible for TAA.\n  We should have done better. This TPA bill cedes too much authority to \nthe President and the trade agreements that will result from it will \nnot be fair to workers and the environment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the trade law \nprovisions in the conference report.\n  But before I begin, I first want to thank the senior Senator from \nIdaho, who spoke earlier today on this issue. He and I have worked very \nhard together over the years to defend our fair trade laws. I think \nevery industry that faces unfair foreign trade practices owes a great \ndeal of gratitude to Senator Craig for standing up for fair trade.\n  I want to thank both Senator Craig and Senator Dayton for their \ntireless efforts during the Senate debate on the trade bill.\n  Although the Dayton-Craig amendment was modified during the \nconference process, I can say without hesitation that this fast track \nbill contains stronger protections for U.S. trade laws than any fast \ntrack bill we have ever had. And we have those strong protections in \nlarge part because of Senator Craig and Senator Dayton.\n  Now, there have been a lot of questions about the trade law \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\ncontained in this legislation, so I want to take a minute to spell them \nout in some detail.\n  The conference bill protects U.S. trade laws in two ways. First, it \nseeks to ensure that U.S. negotiators do not sign agreements that \nweaken our laws.\n  Second, it seeks to ensure that our trade remedy laws are not further \nweakened by WTO dispute panels--and it seeks to remedy some recent \ndecisions that have undermined these laws.\n  Importantly, the legislation makes protecting our U.S. trade remedy \nlaws a principal negotiating objective. The bill instructs trade \nnegotiators to preserve the ability of the United States to enforce \nrigorously its trade laws, and it provides that the U.S. should not \nenter into agreements that weaken those laws.\n  I will be inserting for the record what is considered to be a \nweakening of the trade laws. I fully anticipate that the administration \nwill take these concerns seriously.\n  In addition, the bill also contains a principal negotiating objective \ninstructing trade negotiators to address and remedy market distortions \nthat lead to dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, \ncartelization, and market-access barriers.\n  This bill also ensures that Congress is a full partner when it comes \nto the issue of U.S. trade laws. The conference bill requires the \nPresident to notify Congress of proposed changes to U.S. trade laws 6 \nmonths in advance of completing an agreement.\n  This will give Congress a chance to comment on proposed changes \nbefore an agreement is final--while there is still an opportunity to \nfix the agreement.\n  The President's report will trigger a process allowing a resolution \non whether the proposed trade law changes are consistent with \nnegotiating objectives.\n  After the President submits the report, any Member of either House \nmay introduce a resolution stating that the proposed changes to U.S. \ntrade laws are inconsistent with the negotiating objective that \nrequires no weakening changes.\n  That resolution is referred to the House Ways & Means Committee or \nthe Senate Finance Committee. If the committee reports the resolution, \nit will receive privileged consideration on the floor.\n  I fully expect to bring such a resolution, if introduced, to the \nFinance Committee for consideration. I will not bottle up a meritorious \nresolution in the Committee.\n  While committees may only report out only one resolution per \nagreement--either a resolution regarding U.S. trade laws or a so-called \nreverse fast track resolution--I would note here that fast track \nprocedures area considered to be rules of the House and Senate.\n  The Constitution is quite clear that either body may change those \nrules at any time. And if Congress's concerns regarding trade laws are \nnot heard, I expect Congress would quickly derail an agreement.\n  Second, this bill seeks to improve dispute settlement in the World \nTrade Organization. Our trading partners are now engaged in a \nsystematic attempt to weaken our trade laws through harassing WTO \nlitigation. They are seeking to achieve through dispute resolution what \nthey could not achieve in negotiations.\n  The conference bill seeks to address this problem in several ways. \nLike the Senate bill, the conference bill includes an overall \nnegotiating objective instructing trade negotiators to strengthen \ninternational dispute settlement.\n  In addition, the conference bill contains a principal negotiating \nobjective instructing negotiators to seek adherence by dispute \nsettlement panels to the relevant standard of review applicable under \nthe WTO, including greater deference to the fact-finding and technical \nexpertise of national investigating authorities.\n  That means that these panels should not be inappropriately second-\nguessing the U.S. International Trade Commission or the Department of \nCommerce.\n  In addition, the conference bill includes a finding expressing \nCongress's concerns about these recent bad decisions. In particular, \nthe finding notes Congress's concern that dispute settlement panels \nappropriately apply the WTO standard of review.\n  Under the conference bill, the Secretary of Commerce must provide a \nreport by the end of this year setting forth the administration's \nstrategy for addressing these concerns. Fast track procedures will not \napply to legislation implementing a WTO agreement if the Secretary does \nnot provide the report in a timely manner.\n  I plan to submit for the record a list of WTO cases that raise \nparticular concerns.\n  In closing, let met simply say this: The Senate has made its views on \ntrade laws very clear. Last year, 62 of my colleagues joined me in \nsending a letter noting that the Senate would not tolerate agreements \nthat weakened our trade laws.\n  And during the Senate debate, 61 Senators re-emphasized their support \nfor trade laws by passing the Dayton-Craig amendment.\n  There can now be no doubt about the Senate's resolve on this issue. \nAgreements that weaken our trade laws--in any way--simply will not \npass. And the procedures in this fast track legislation should \nunderscore that point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I opposed the Senate fast track bill even \nthough it was an improvement over the House fast track bill. \nUnfortunately, the conference report we are considering today has \ngutted many of the improvements made in the Senate. I felt the Senate \nbill did not go far enough. The fast track conference report we are \nbeing asked to vote on today is a significant step backwards from what \nthe Senate passed.\n  I did not support the Senate version of this bill because it would \nnot allow Congress to amend a trade agreement, even to improve it to \nmake sure it was in the best interests of U.S. workers, industry, or \nagriculture. It also did not go far enough to encourage the adoption of \ninternationally accepted labor standards or protect the environment. It \ndid not ensure that U.S. products would have fair access to foreign \nmarkets in exchange for granting access to our markets. I cannot \nsupport a bill that is significantly weaker than the Senate bill.\n  Granting the President broad ``fast track'' authority to negotiate \ntrade agreements means Congress must adopt a law to implement any trade \nagreement on a straight up or down vote, without the ability to offer \namendments. I believe in free trade. I supported the Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement, the Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, and granting China \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR. But I am reluctant to give up \nthe Congressional right to amend trade legislation, sight unseen. When \nwe do that, we are throwing away one of the most effective tools in \nforcing fairer trade practices.\n  This fast track bill is significantly flawed because it does not \nensure that future trade agreements will protect human rights and labor \nand environmental standards. Nor does it require that fair trade \npractices are included in future trade agreements.\n  I am disappointed that conferees dropped my amendment that would make \nit a principal negotiating objective of the United States to reduce \nbarriers in other countries to U.S. autos and auto parts, especially in \nJapan and Korea where American autos and auto parts have been all but \nshut out for decades. Surely, one of our chief objectives should be \nincreasing our products' access to markets which are closed or \npartially closed to us.\n  Other countries have full access to our market for their autos and \nauto parts. We should insist that foreign markets are equally open to \nour autos and auto parts. The conference report makes it a principal \nnegotiating objective to expand trade and reduce barriers for trade in \nservices, foreign investment, intellectual property, electronic \ncommerce, agriculture, and other sectors. Yet the biggest portion of \nour trade deficit is in autos. In 2001, our automotive deficit made up \nover 31 percent of our total trade deficit with the world. In 2001, our \nautomotive deficit was 59 percent of our total trade deficit with Japan \nand 53 percent of our total deficit with Korea. I don't believe that \nthe Senate should approve an omnibus trade bill without addressing \nbarriers to our products which are the largest contributors to our \ntrade deficit. Unfortunately, this flawed bill does not meet this \ncriterion.\n  Unfortunately, America's trade policy over the past 30 years has been \na\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\none way street. The U.S. market is one of the most open in the world, \nyet we have failed to pry foreign markets equally open to American \nproducts. Some of the trade agreements the U.S. has entered into have \nfallen far short of opening foreign markets. To ensure that future \ntrade agreements better promote free and fair trade, Congress must not \ngive up its ability to amend the legislation implementing those \nagreements.\n  I have fought hard to strengthen U.S. trade laws to help open foreign \nmarkets to American and Michigan products such as automobiles, auto \nparts, communications equipment, cherries, apples, and wood products. \nUnfortunately, without the ability of Congress to amend and improve \ntrade agreements we will not always get the best deal for American \nproducts, if past history is any guide.\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, enacted January 1, \n1994, is a good example of a trade agreement negotiated under ``fast \ntrack'' authority. It contained provisions allowing Mexico to protect \nits auto industry and discriminate against U.S. manufactured \nautomobiles used cars and auto parts for up to 25 years. It allowed \nMexico to require auto manufacturers assembling vehicles in Mexico to \npurchase 36 percent of their parts from Mexican parts manufacturers. It \nalso extended for 25 more years the Mexican law against selling used \nAmerican cars in Mexico, a highly discriminatory provision against U.S. \nautos.\n  When NAFTA was presented to Congress, it was an agreement which \ndiscriminated against some of the principal products that are made in \nMichigan. I surely could not vote for the bill the way it was written, \nnor could I try to amend the bill because the ``fast track'' authority \nthe President had at that time prohibited implementing legislation from \nbeing amended. Consequently, after NAFTA was enacted, the U.S. went \nfrom a trade surplus of $1.7 billion in 1993 to a trade deficit of $25 \nbillion with Mexico in 2000. Over the same period, our trade deficit \nincreased from $11 billion to $44.9 billion with Canada. Since NAFTA \nwas enacted, the automotive trade deficit with Mexico has reached $23 \nbillion.\n  Moreover, between January 1994, and early May 2002, the Department of \nLabor certified that over 400,000 workers lost their jobs as a result \nof increased imports from or plant relocations to Mexico or Canada. \nThese job losses occurred all over the county and in and around \nMichigan. For example, 27 employees from the Blue Water Fiber Company \nin Port Huron who produced pulp for paper lost their jobs as a result \nof NAFTA imports. One hundred and twenty-nice employees of Alcoa \nFujikura Limited in Owosso who made electronic radio equipment lost \ntheir jobs to Mexico; 1,133 employees of the Copper Range Mine in the \nUP lost their jobs when operations were moved to Canada. Three hundred \nemployees of Eagle Ottawa Leather in Grand Haven who made leather for \nautomobile interiors saw their jobs moved to Mexico. The list of NAFTA-\nTAA certified job losses goes on and on. These job losses didn't result \nfrom a level ``playing field''. These job losses resulted from a \n``playing field'' tilted against us.\n  We've lost too many manufacturing jobs because our trade policies \nhave been so weak over the decades. I've always believed that when \ncountries raise barriers to our products that we ought to treat them no \nbetter than they treat us. Fast track authority makes it more difficult \nfor Congress to insist on fair treatment for American products and \nequal access to foreign markets.\n\n  Calling NAFTA a free trade agreement was an oxymoron. NAFTA protected \nMexican industries and it gave special treatment to certain U.S. \nindustries. For example, leather products and footwear got the longest \nU.S. tariff phase out, 15 years, and NAFTA included safeguard \nprovisions against import surges in these sectors. Agricultural \ncommodities and fruits and vegetables, including sugar, cotton, dairy, \npeanuts, oranges, also got a 15-year U.S. tariff phase out, a quota \nsystem, and the reimposition of a higher duty if imports exceed agreed-\nupon quota levels. It's clear that those who were represented at the \nnegotiating table were able to strike favorable deals to protect \ncertain industries and products. That is not free trade.\n  NAFTA was not the only trade agreement that included specially \ntailored provisions for certain products. The trade bill we are being \nasked to vote on contains special provisions to protect textiles, \ncitrus, and some other specialty agriculture commodities.\n  I believe that writing labor and environmental standards into trade \nagreements is an important way to ensure that free trade is fair trade. \nRegrettably, this legislation does not ensure that international labor \nand environmental standards will be present in trade agreements. We \nneed trade agreements with enforceable labor and environmental \nprovisions but this bill does not provide for it.\n  This is particularly unfortunate given that Congress is already on \nrecord supporting strong labor and environmental standards in trade \nagreements. The Senate passed the Jordan Free Trade Agreement on \nSeptember 21, 2001; it broke new ground in its treatment of labor and \nenvironmental standards in trade agreements. For the first time, a \ntrade agreement required that the parties to the agreement reflect the \ncore internationally recognized labor rights in their own domestic \nlabor laws.\n  The conference report does not require countries to implement the \ncore ILO labor standards. It only requires them to enforce their \nexisting labor laws, however weak they may be. It also specifically \nstates that the U.S. may not retaliate against a trading partner that \nlowers or weakens its labor or environmental laws.\n  This language undercuts our ability to negotiate strong labor and \nenvironmental standards in future trade agreements because our trading \npartners know we can't enforce what we negotiate through the use of \nsanctions and the dispute settlement process.\n  American workers already compete against workers from countries where \nwages are significantly lower than in the United States. Our workers \nshouldn't also have to compete against countries that gain an unfair \ncomparative advantage because they pollute their air and water and \nwon't allow their workers to exercise fundamental rights.\n  The United States enacted environmental standards that protect our \nair and water. We have enacted labor standards that allow for \ncollective bargaining and the right to organize, that prohibit the use \nof child labor, and provide protections for workers in the work place. \nThese are desirable standards that we worked hard to get. We should not \nforce American workers to compete against countries with no such \nstandards or protection for its workers.\n  The Senate tried to improve this fast track legislation to address \nsome of the concerns I've outlined. I supported many of these efforts. \nUnfortunately, many of the strengthening provisions added in the Senate \nwere dropped in conference. The Dayton-Craig provision was dropped. \nThis amendment would have allowed the Senate to have a separate vote on \nany provision of a trade agreement that would change or weaken U.S. \ntrade remedy laws. Instead, the conference report moves rhetoric from \nanother section of the bill regarding Congressional intent not to \nweaken U.S. trade remedy laws to the principal negotiating section. \nThis is a much weaker provision than allowing the Senate an up-or-down \nvote on whether to weaken our trade laws or not.\n  This conference report fails to address these concerns. The weak fast \ntrack bill we are voting on today is all the more reason Congress \nshould not give up its role under the Constitution. We should keep all \nthe tools available to fight for free and fair trade, including the \nCongressional right to amend and improve a trade agreement. To do less \nthan that is not doing justice to our nations workers, manufacturers, \nfarmers or small business.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Trade bill \nthat is being considered on the Senate floor. I will keep my comments \nshort, as I know others wish to speak on the issue.\n  I want to begin by emphasizing the positive. We have come a long way \nto where we are today on trade adjustment assistance. The provisions in \nthe conference report are far better than what exists in current law. I \nwant to thank all my colleagues for their support on trade adjustment \nassistance,\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nand I want to thank the Administration for finding a path to compromise \non this very important legislation.\n  But I also want to take this opportunity to say that this conference \nreport does not go nearly far enough in terms of what needs to be done. \nIn fact, on trade adjustment assistance, I would have to say that the \nend result in many respects misses the point of what my original bill \ntried to do.\n  In short, there were four goals to the original bill:\n  First, we wanted to combine existing trade adjustment assistance \nprograms and harmonize their various requirements so they would provide \nmore effective and efficient results for individuals and communities; \nsecond, we wanted to recognize that trade frequently has regional \nimpacts and create a program to help communities; third, we wanted to \nencourage greater cooperation between Federal, regional, and local \nagencies that deal with individuals receiving trade adjustment \nassistance; and fourth, we wanted to establish accountability, \nreliability, speed, and consistency in the trade adjustment assistance \nprogram.\n  Each of these goals was created with the view that the system needed \nto be fair, equitable, accessible, and implemented similarly no matter \nwhere you lived in the country. From my perspective, the bill that we \nhave before us does not do this.\n  Briefly, not all secondary workers, shifts in production, and \ncontract workers are covered under this bill. There are no TAA for \ncommunity provisions in this bill. The language that allowed the Senate \nFinance Committee to request the Department of Labor to initiate a \ncertification is not in this bill. The language that compelled the \nDepartment of Labor to monitor the implementation of the program across \nstates is not in this bill. The language that required the Department \nof Labor to submit an annual report to Congress is not in this bill. \nThe language that encouraged greater cooperation between Federal, \nregional, and local agencies on Trade Adjustment Assistance is not in \nthis bill. And the language that established accountability, \nreliability, and consistency in the trade adjustment assistance program \nis not in this bill.\n  I could go on, but this should give you an idea of the key components \nrelated to administration and implementation of trade adjustment \nassistance that were deleted in conference. I have no idea why this \noccurred, as it seems to me these provisions would be acceptable to \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. But I want to emphasize here and \nnow that these are not minor problems, as they are in fact the essence \nof whether trade adjustment assistance works well, or just works.\n  The fact of the matter is we have created a trade adjustment \nassistance program that serves more people and that is both appropriate \nand long-overdue. But the program still does not cover all the people \nthat are negatively affected by trade, and that is, I am afraid, \ninappropriate and equally long-overdue. Of equal significance, it does \nnot guarantee that the people who are covered by trade adjustment \nassistance get the efficient, effective, and prompt services they \ndeserve. These assurances are nowhere to be found in the bill. This is \nunfortunate and unsatisfactory, as it is the fundamental reason that I \nwrote the trade adjustment assistance legislation in the first place.\n  Although we have come a long way on trade adjustment assistance, we \nhave a longer way to go, and it is my intention to revisit this issue \nin the 108th Congress. I introduced this trade adjustment assistance \nbill, I will introduce another in the next Congress, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it\n  On the fast-track bill, let me say that here too we did not go as far \nas I would have liked on a range of very important issues: labor, the \nenvironment, investment, and trade remedy laws. But that said, we have \ncome farther than we ever have before in the past, and we have signaled \nto the administration and the international trade community that we \nwill not enter into agreements that do not address these issues \ndirectly.\n  As for the lack of ``teeth'' in the bill, I would have to agree to a \ncertain extent. That said, there are provisions in this bill to ensure \nthat Congress has very significant input in the trade negotiation \nprocess. Moreover, Congress has the option to withdraw fast-track \nauthority if the administration does not consistently and honestly \nconsult with Congress on these key trade issues. As far as I am \nconcerned, the oversight provisions are the crux of the matter, as \nwithout them, even the strongest language on labor, or the environment, \nare meaningless. It is incumbent upon Congress now to analyze what \noccurs in trade negotiations and ensure that what is agreed to \nincreases high-wage jobs and American competitiveness.\n  In sum, I think there are significant problems with the trade bill, \nbut not enough to warrant a vote in the negative. I think we have taken \na strong step forward here in that this bill provides us with the tools \nto increase the economic security of the United States. I don't believe \nwe help American workers by sitting back and doing nothing on trade. \nRather, I think it is important that we take an active role in defining \nthe terms of trade, and this bill allows us to do that.\n  The debate on the trade bill occurred, we have found a compromise, \nand now it is time for the Administration and Congress to make trade \nwork for the American people.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in recent years, I have supported fast \ntrack legislation, I voted for NAFTA, for the last round of the GATT \nand the creation of the WTO. I supported China's accession to the WTO.\n  I am convinced by the overall fundamental performance of our economy, \nduring a period of expanded trade and the successful completion of \ntrade deals, that expanding international trade generally and expanding \nmarkets for American products in particular is good for the United \nStates.\n  With every step down the road toward a freer, more open international \ntrading system, I believe that the risks are becoming greater and the \nrewards are less clear.\n  The risks we face--to our own workers' ability to control their \ndestinies, to the peoples of our new trading partners, to the global \nenvironment--are growing as we expand trade deals into regions of the \nworld that lack many of the fundamentals needed for a balanced trade \nrelationship.\n  The rewards from moving deeper into those less developed economies \ncould be substantial, for us and for them. But I am afraid that without \nstronger protections, and those benefits may never materialize for the \nvast majority of the citizens of the poorest developing nations.\n  At the same time, without strong protections for the men and women \nwhose jobs--in some cases whose towns, in many cases whose whole way of \nlife is at risk without protections for them, they, too, will see \nlittle or nothing of the benefits of freer trade.\n  That is why I am going to vote against the conference report before \nus today, not because I expect it to be defeated, but because I fully \nexpect it to pass, and I want to make it clear that I, as one Senator, \nhave gone about as far as I can go in my support of freer trade without \nsome stronger assurances that the gains will outweigh the risks, and \nthat those gains will be fairly and efficiently distributed.\n  I voted for many amendments to the Senate fast-track bill, amendments \nthat would have provided some of the assurances I am seeking. I voted \nfor stronger protections for our State and local environmental laws \nwhen they are threatened by foreign firms. I voted for stronger \nprotections for labor and environmental standards in trade deals with \ndeveloping nations.\n  Even though those and other amendments were not adopted, I \nnevertheless supported sending the bill on to a conference with the \nHouse.\n  Today we are voting on a bill that not only lacks those provisions, \nbut has weakened many of the important improvements in the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program that were contained in the Senate \nversion.\n  As we expand trade among the nations of the world, we are engaged in \na real-life experiment in economic theory. I believe that expanding \nmarkets and opportunities are indispensable to a better life for the \npeople of our country as well as for the citizens of other nations.\n  Just as indispensable are political rights, human rights, a healthy \nenvironment--things that we cannot just take for granted, things that \naren't provided automatically by the invisible hand of the market.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n  That is particularly true as we undertake to integrate our developed \neconomy--as well as our system of political and human rights, our \nstrong environmental protection standards, our history and institutions \nof labor rights.\n  We do ourselves no good, and the citizens of other nations no good, \nif we fail to maintain those values in balance with the real, tangible \nbenefits of free trade.\n  Because this new chapter in the history of expanding trade presents \nso many challenges, public opinion, here and abroad, shows a deep \nconcern about the ultimate costs of global economic integration.\n  Of course, there are still those who believe trade itself is the \ncause of most of the world's problems, and on the other side, there are \nthose who blithely assume that expanded trade itself is the highest \ngoal.\n  I think we should listen to the common sense of the average citizen, \nboth here and abroad. They understand the benefits that can come from \nfree markets, but they hold other values, too.\n  They want to maintain control over their own fates, and the fates of \ntheir families, their towns, their countries. They want to treat the \nenvironment responsibly.\n  They want, to maintain some balance among the values they hold.\n  So I will vote no today, in the knowledge that we will be granting \nthis administration and the next one the authority to negotiate and \nbring home important new trade deals, in a new round of WTO talks, and \nin other key areas.\n  I hope they use this authority wisely, and that they treat the \nnegotiating objectives we are giving them today as a floor and not a \nceiling on the standards they apply in their negotiations.\n  If they do not, they should not bring us trade deals for our \nconsideration under this fast track authority. Along with the authority \nwe are granting the administration, we are providing ourselves, in \nCongress with new oversight of the progress of trade talks.\n  We will use this new authority to keep our negotiators on course. The \nslim margin in the House, and the vigorous debate on the Senate bill \nshould provide ample guidance about the standards we will apply to any \ntrade deal negotiated under this authority.\n  We will continue to remind our negotiators of those concerns over the \nthree-year life of this authority. A 2-year renewal will not be \nautomatic not in this new climate of concern about the net benefits of \ntrade nor should it be.\n  My ``no'' vote today is not a vote against expanded trade. It is a \nvote against complacency in the conduct of our trade negotiations.\n  Today is not the end of the debate on this new grant of fast track \nauthority. It is the beginning.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in reluctant support of this \nconference report. The underlying bill granting the President authority \nto negotiate trade agreements is critical. The problem is all of the \nother extraneous costly provisions in the trade assistance portion of \nthe report. On balance, it has only been marginally improved during \nconference, and, in fact, one could argue that it has been made worse \nby the addition of a misguided and fiscally reckless new entitlement \nprogram.\n  When this bill last came before the Senate, I outlined four main \nconcerns, and said that how those issues were addressed in conference \nwould influence my vote on the final version of the bill. First, I said \nthe conference report would have to maintain the 2002-2006 suspension \nof the 4.9 percent tariff on steam generators for nuclear power \nfacilities. That was accomplished. Second, the conference report would \nhave to remove the so-called Dayton-Craig language. That was \naccomplished. Third, it would need to either eliminate or substantially \namend the language creating a ``wage insurance'' program for workers \nage 50 and older who are certified under the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program. That was not accomplished. Fourth, the conference \nreport would have to make significant changes in the health-insurance \ntax credit for TAA-certified workers. That was not accomplished, and \narguably, the provision was made worse.\n  More specifically, the Senate-passed bill and the conference report \nwill suspend for a period of five years the 4.9 percent tariff on steam \ngenerators used by nuclear facilities. These generators are not \nmanufactured in the United States, so there is no domestic industry to \nprotect through the imposition of tariffs. Tariffs should never be \nimposed on products that are not domestically manufactured, especially \nthose products that are critical for maintaining the U.S. domestic \nsupply of energy.\n  The existing tariff amounts to a ``tax'' of approximately $1.5 \nmillion per generator. Although ostensibly paid by utilities, the cost \nwould actually be passed on to ratepayers and consumers. In the case of \nthe Palo Verde plant in Arizona, the nation's largest nuclear power \nfacility in terms of production, the additional cost, due to the \ntariff, would be over $8.2 million for the six generators that it will \nneed to import.\n  The tariff suspension will save ratepayers money, which is why it has \nstrong bipartisan support. I appreciate the conferees maintaining this \nprovision in the conference report.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees agreed to remove the so-called \n``Dayton-Craig'' language. This is a provision that would have made it \neasier to defeat legislation negotiated under trade-promotion authority \nif it amended U.S. trade remedies, no matter how technical or even \nbeneficial the change might be. It would have resulted in the \nunraveling of successful trade negotiations. Moreover, the provision \nwas unnecessary since language is already included in the bill to \n``preserve the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its \ntrade laws'' and ``avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \ndomestic and international disciplines on unfair trade.''\n  The next issue of concern to me involved the many trade-adjustment \nassistance, TAA, provisions in the bill. One such provision was the new \n``wage insurance'' entitlement, which would provide a subsidy of up to \n$5,000 for older TAA-certified workers who are subsequently employed at \nlower-paying jobs. With no data supporting the efficacy of such a \nproposal, this provision would create significant disincentives for \nworkers to forgo needed training or conduct a more intensive job \nsearch, likely resulting in workers choosing lower paying and perhaps \nlower-skilled jobs with taxpayers liable for the difference. It is \nindeed unfortunate that conferees were unable to remove this provision. \nAlthough the nature of the entitlement is altered somewhat, it remains \ndeeply flawed.\n  Another provision in this conference report would provide an \nadvanceable, refundable health-insurance tax credit to TAA-certified \nworkers. Although the conferees agreed to lower this tax subsidy from \n70 percent to 65 percent, the credit remains at an arbitrarily high \npercentage of the premiums' cost.\n  With one small exception, the credit can only be used to subsidize \nthe cost of company-based, COBRA, or pooled health-insurance policies. \nI believe that it is unfair for American taxpayers, many of whom may \nnot have health insurance themselves, to provide such a generous \nhealth-insurance subsidy. Under an extremely small exception, \nindividuals will be able to use the credit for the purchase of an \nindividual health insurance if the policy is bought at least one month \nbefore unemployment. This restriction makes the small exception for the \npurchase of individual health insurance nearly worthless.\n  Worst of all is the poison pill that was added to the conference \nreport. By expanding the eligibility for the health tax credit to \nretirees receiving benefits from defunct pension plans taken over by \nthe Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, PBGC, the conference report \nhas taken a significant step backwards. Potentially, this provision \ncould end up covering individuals who worked for companies that went \nout of business 20 years ago. Today, these individuals will be eligible \nfor this new benefit. These individuals, who will often be 55 years or \nolder, will be included in the pool of workers benefitting from new \nTrade Adjustment Assistance health provisions, making it even more \nexpensive for the relatively younger workers to purchase health \ninsurance. Aside from doubling the costs of these health provisions, \nwhich now total over $4.8 billion over 10 years, this legislation could \nhave numerous other unintended consequences on our pension system. It\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nallows companies that over-promised benefits to walk away from their \nobligation and leave taxpayers with the bill.\n  As a matter of principle on the one hand, and sound economic policy \non the other, I still believe it is imperative that we grant the \nPresident trade-promotion authority. As a Senator who is committed to \nexpanding free trade and its accompanying benefits, I am frustrated \nthat this legislation has been loaded up with costly new entitlement \nprograms.\n  I will vote for this bill because I know how important it is to grant \nthe President Trade Promotion Authority. But because of the numerous \nbad provisions in the bill, and the bad precedents they set, the \ndecision does not come easy. That shouldn't have been the case.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support this conference \nreport. Although I am disappointed that several provisions were removed \nin conference, on balance this legislation still represents a major \nexpansion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance that is crucial for those \nworkers who have lost their jobs due to imports or plant relocations to \nother countries.\n  I supported this legislation during the Finance Committee's markup, \nas well as during the Senate vote in May as I have been involved with \nthis legislation for over a year with hearings, markups, negotiations, \nconsideration by the Senate, and now the consideration of the \nconference report. I worked with Senator Bingaman on the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, TAA provisions and then with Senators Grassley \nand Baucus. In the same manner, both agreed to a critical expansion of \nthe existing TAA program while also including provisions I advocated to \naccelerate assistance to dislocated workers and provide them with \ngreater options in the utilization of these benefits. And, when the \nhealthcare provision of TAA threatened to scuttle the bill, Senator \nBaucus and I worked together to fashion a deal that would be acceptable \nto both Republicans and Democrats.\n  At no point was my decision to support the Senate package, and the \nTPA section in particular, a foregone conclusion, as I have opposed \ntrade agreements and fast-track authority in the past. I did so because \nI never felt they struck the proper balance between free and fair \ntrade, and I've been concerned that both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations approached the enforcement of U.S. trade laws not with \nvigor, but with at best a benign neglect.\n  However, when the Finance Committee marked-up this fast-track \nlegislation in December and the Senate passed it in May, I supported it \nprecisely because it did strike the appropriate balance, and because of \nthis administration's commitment to aggressively enforce our trade laws \nso that American workers aren't undermined by unfair trade practices.\n  Furthermore, while some oppose linking TPA and TAA as contained in \nthis trade package, my support is contingent on this linkage and I have \nrepeatedly emphasized the importance of joining these proposals that \nare inextricably joined. TAA would not even exist if not for the fact \nthat trade agreements impact U.S. jobs, so attempting to bifurcate TAA \nand TPA is like trying to divide the ``heads'' from the ``tails'' on a \ncoin--sure, it may be possible, but the end product won't be worth one \nred cent!\n  TPA and TAA were enjoined and I supported that approach because we \nmust never forget that in the engagement of trade there is a downside--\nchiefly, that real lives are affected, people not just statistics. When \nAmericans become unemployed due to increased imports or plant \nrelocations to other countries, it is because of trade agreements \nnegotiated by the government of the United States and passed by \nCongress. Therefore, we have an obligation to also work toward forging \na system that provides these trade-impacted Americans with the new \nskills needed to gain new employment.\n  This conference report does contain many provisions on both trade and \ntrade adjustment assistance that I think are critical components that \nmake them better than in the past. An expanded TAA program is going to \nbe created, which I support, that will allow more workers to receive \nre-training and income support assistance quicker and for a longer \nperiod of time. This income support and re-training is vital to ensure \nthat these workers can re-enter the workforce and also provide \ntemporary assistance while they are learning new skills.\n\n  There are also provisions I fought for that will help speed up the \napproval process. Specifically, besides consolidating the current TAA \nand NAFTA-TAA programs into one, more efficient program, the bill \nincludes my proposal to speed-up assistance to displaced workers by \ndecreasing the TAA petition time for certification from 60 days to 40 \ndays. Reducing this time by 20 days will allow people to get on with \ntheir lives that much quicker.\n  The TAA section also provides a 65 percent tax credit for trade-\nimpacted workers to continue their health coverage for themselves and \ntheir family. This tax credit is ``advanceable'' so that people will \nreceive this assistance immediately rather than paying up front to get \na tax refund later.\n  Moreover, this bill addresses another issue that has created problems \nin my State this year, the current budget for training assistance. \nSince last year, Maine has run short of training funds by almost $3 \nmillion, forcing them to apply for five different Department of Labor \nNational Emergency Grants and potentially causing a freeze in re-\ntraining assistance. By providing $220 million in funding, this \nshortfall will be fully addressed.\n  And we didn't stop there. Not only does this funding level address \nstate shortfalls, but it also ensures expanded coverage for secondary \nworkers affected by trade. Specifically, under the compromise developed \nby Senators Grassley and Baucus, secondary workers with a direct \nrelationship to the downsizing or closing of a plant will be covered by \nTAA, while so-called ``downstream workers'' covered now under a \nStatement of Administrative Action, SAA, as part of the NAFTA-TAA \nprogram will also be covered through the SAA's codification.\n  But make no mistake, the conference report does not contain some \nprovisions that would be vital to people and communities adversely \nimpacted by trade. Specifically, a small business pilot program that \nwould allow those workers receiving TAA to start a small business \nwithout losing their benefits was dropped. Performance assessments of \nthe TAA program that included the economic condition of the state were \ndropped, as were all performance requirements.\n  Not only were these removed but so was TAA for fishermen. Instead, \nthis bill requires a study to determine whether TAA for fishermen is \n``appropriate and feasible''. What is amazing is that TAA for farmers \nis covered in this bill but that somehow their coverage would be \ndifferent than for fishermen. That is why we are working right now with \nthe Department of Labor on administrative procedures to ensure that \nfishermen will be eligible for TAA.\n  TAA for communities was also dropped in conference. This would have \nallowed communities that suffered a plant closure due to import \ncompetition to apply for grants in order to attract new businesses. As \nin my home State of Maine, many States have rural towns that are \ndependent on a single plant for their livelihood and this provision \nwould have given them a chance should that plant close.\n  In addition, coverage for workers that have watched their plant \nmove overseas, known as shifts in production, has also been limited in \nthe bill. As opposed to granting eligibility to workers whose plant \nmoved to any country overseas, this conference report limits coverage \nonly to those workers whose plant moved to a country that has a Free \nTrade Agreement, FTA, with the U.S., is a country receiving the reduced \nduties or duty-free benefits of the ATPA, the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act, AGOA, and the Caribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, or, if \nthere has been an increase in imports from the country to which the \nplant moved.\n\n  This may appear to cover all the bases, except for the possibility \nthat a plant will move overseas and may not actually import back to the \nU.S., thus there will be no increase in imports. If the U.S. has no FTA \nwith that country or it is not participating in a U.S. duty-reduction \nprogram like the ATPA, then those workers are not eligible for TAA. How \nare these workers\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\naffected differently from others who lose their jobs due to imports?\n  As I said earlier, on balance, the TAA provisions represent a \nsignificant expansion and improvement of the former TAA and NAFTA-TAA \nprograms and will provide an invaluable service to those dislocated \nworkers as they seek new jobs. While the government is assisting \nworkers whose jobs have been lost due to imports, this bill also \nprovides the Administration with the ability, through TPA, to negotiate \ntrade agreements that will improve and increase U.S. exports. As I \nmentioned earlier, my past opposition to fast-track, due to concerns \nabout the balance between free and fair trade and our enforcement of \nour trade laws, have been addressed in this bill.\n  The bottom line is that enforcement is an inseparable component of \nfree and fair trade. If you don't believe me, just look at the record. \nIn the past, when free trade and fair trade have been treated as \nmutually exclusive, import-sensitive industries in Maine and America \nwere decimated by foreign competitors. Why? Because foreign businesses \nenjoyed the benefits of a lack of reciprocity in trade agreements, \nforeign industry subsidies, dumping in the U.S. market . . . and non-\ntariff trade barriers.\n  For this reason, I was disappointed that the Dayton-Craig language on \ntrade remedy laws was removed in conference. However, the fact that the \nexisting language on maintaining our ability to ``enforce rigorously'' \nour trade remedy laws became a Principal Negotiating Objective \ndemonstrates a recognition of the utmost importance with which we hold \nthese laws. In that regard, the Administration should take note that no \ntrade agreement should ever be submitted to this Congress that weakens \nour trade remedy laws. As a member of the Finance Committee, I will do \neverything that I can to ensure that no trade agreement never ever \nweakens or undermines these laws.\n  The enforcement of our trade remedy laws are vital as the surrender \nof our rights have had serious consequences in the lives of real \npeople. In Maine alone, we lost nearly 15,400 manufacturing jobs since \nNAFTA's inception including 2,400 textile jobs, 6,000 leather products \njobs, 500 apparel jobs, 3,700 paper and allied products jobs, and 4,800 \nfootwear jobs, excluding rubber footwear, and 5,200 manufacturing jobs \nso far just this year. We failed those people because we abdicated our \nresponsibility to take a balanced, comprehensive and integrated \napproach to trade.\n  That is why I can not and will not support the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, ATPA. I opposed this during the Finance Committee's \nmarkup of the legislation and, although I supported the Senate's trade \npackage legislation, I opposed its inclusion in the trade package.\n  The ATPA represents a unilateral action by the U.S. to open our \nmarkets to the Andean countries in order to bolster their economies in \nthe hopes of reducing drug cultivation. Its effect the last ten years \nhas been questionable with the ITC not able to make a definitive, \naffirmative determination that it has greatly contributed to the \nreduction of drug cultivation by providing economic opportunities.\n  The amount of exports from these countries which fall exclusively \nunder the ATPA has remained relatively constant at 10 percent over the \nyears. The fact that this has changed little indicates that there has \nbeen no major change in the production structure of ATPA economies \nmeaning that these countries have not been taking more advantage of \nwhat ATPA offered. Therefore, what this legislation seeks to do is \nchange our policies to conform to the Andean countries rather than \nthese countries changing to take advantage of what the U.S. has already \noffered. U.S. jobs are on the line for an unproven trade benefit \nprogram.\n  That is why I worked in the ATPA to provide the rubber footwear \nindustry with a comparable tariff provision to that which they received \nin NAFTA. The original ATPA further threatened this industry by giving \nthe four Andean nations a tariff phase-out schedule that was only half \nas long as the 15-year schedule contained in the NAFTA. I was pleased \nthat the Senate passed the trade package last May with this same 15 \nyear phaseout, because without it we would have set a precedent that \nwould be demanded by other countries as well.\n  This conference report drops this provision and with it went the \nhopes of the domestic rubber footwear industry and its 3,400 workers--\n1,000 of which are in Maine. Not only was my provision lost, but the \nSenate receded to the House. Under this, all footwear--that was \nexcluded under the expired ATPA legislation, as well as textiles and \napparels, leather products, and watches will enter the U.S. duty-free \nwith no phaseout.\n  Such an immediate tariff reduction to zero will only serve as a sign \nto other countries, particularly Chile and Latin America nations, that \nthe U.S. rubber footwear industry, once considered import-sensitive, is \nnot only open for business, but for decimation. For this reason, I have \nbeen working with the USTR to impress upon them the significance this \nprecedent will have on other trade agreements, particularly with Chile. \nI am pleased that the USTR provided me with unequivocal assurances that \nthe ATPA provisions regarding rubber footwear in no way establishes a \nprecedent for Chile, and that they will continue their efforts to \nprevent any adverse impact during trade negotiations on domestic rubber \nfootwear.\n  And while we cannot bring back these or other jobs that were lost due \nto the miscues of the past, we can learn from those miscues and apply \nthe lessons to our present and future actions. We can change our \napproach at the negotiating table. We can enforce existing trade laws.\n  In the real world, we have to acknowledge that there are many nations \nthat don't care about labor or environmental standards. And that \ncreates a tilted playing field where it's harder for us to compete. In \nthat regard, this legislation goes further than any past fast-track \nbills on the issues of labor and the environment. The bill before us \ntoday not only sets as an overall objective the need to convince our \ntrading partners not to weaken their labor or environmental laws as an \ninducement to trade, but it also requires the enforcement of existing \nlabor and environmental laws as a principal negotiating objective.\n  The conference report also recognizes the need to take steps to \nprotect the import sensitive textile and apparel industry. It calls for \nreducing tariffs on textiles and apparels in other countries to the \nsame or lower levels than in the U.S., reducing or eliminating \nsubsidies to provide for greater market opportunities for U.S. textiles \nand apparels, and ensuring that WTO member countries immediately \nfulfill their obligations to provide similar market access for U.S. \ntextiles and apparels as the U.S. does for theirs.\n  And this legislation includes new negotiating objectives to address \nthe issue of foreign subsidies and market distortions that lead to \ndumping. As a result, many industries stand to benefit from the \nadoption of this legislation, including the forest and paper, \nagriculture, semiconductor, precision manufacturing, and electronic \nindustries of my home state. According to Maine Governor Angus King the \nfast track approach is, ``On balance . . . beneficial to Maine. There \nmight be some short term problems, but in the long run, we have to \nparticipate in the world economy.''\n  And Maine has been participating. From 1989 to 1999, total exports by \nMaine companies increased by 137 percent from $914 million to $2.167 \nbillion, with the largest industry sector for trade being \nsemiconductors--employing about 2,000 in Maine. The computer and \nelectronics trade, which includes semiconductors, accounted for 33 \npercent of Maine's exports in 1999, followed by paper and allied \nproducts at 17 percent.\n  The Maine industries that benefit from exports have also seen job \ngains in the state. From 1994 to 1999, the electrical and electronics \nindustry had a job gain of 2.3 percent and the agriculture, forestry \nand fishing industry saw a 19 percent increase in jobs. In 2000, \nMaine's exports supported 84,000 jobs.\n  Mr. President, these measures and commitments represent a significant \nstrengthening of our resolve and our ability to utilize existing \nremedies to protect American industries and workers. This comes not a \nmoment too soon, as the success of our economy relies more than ever on \nfair and freer\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\ntrade U.S. exports accounted for one-quarter of U.S. economic growth \nover the past decade . . . nearly one in six manufactured products \ncoming off the assembly line goes to a foreign customer . . . and \nexports support 1 of every 5 manufacturing jobs.\n  Given these facts, it is an understandable concern that the U.S. has \nbeen party to only 3 free trade agreements while there are more than \n130 worldwide. Since 1995, the WTO has been notified of 90 such \nagreements while the U.S. only reached one in the trade arena, the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement. In contrast, the European Union, EU, has \nbeen particularly aggressive, having entered into 27 free trade \nagreements since 1990 and they are actively negotiating another 15. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, the Business Roundtable reports that 33 \npercent of total world exports are covered by EU free trade agreements \ncompared to 11 percent for U.S. agreements.\n  Why should these facts raise concerns? Because every agreement made \nwithout us is a threat to American jobs. Nowhere is this better \nexemplified than in Chile which signed a free trade agreement with \nCanada, Argentina and several other nations in 1997.\n  Since that time, the U.S. has lost one-quarter of Chile's import \nmarket, while nations entering into trade agreements more than captured \nour lost share. According to the National Association of Manufacturers \n(NAM), this resulted in the loss of more than $800 million in U.S. \nexports and 100,000 job opportunities. One specific industry affected \nwas U.S. paper products which accounted for 30 percent of Chile's \nimports but has since dropped to only 11 percent after the trade \nagreements were signed.\n  We need to look to the future of our industries and open doors of \nopportunity in the global marketplace. In order to do so responsibly, \nwe need to learn every economic lesson possible from the past, and this \npackage provides for not only a study I requested of the economic \nimpact of the past five trade agreements, but also an additional \nevaluation of any new agreements before TPA is extended.\n  And we need to make sure that everyone who can benefit from these \nagreements can get their foot in the door. Small businesses, for \nexample, account for 30 percent of all U.S. goods exported, and in \nMaine more than 78 percent export, so I am pleased this bill includes \nmy proposals placing small businesses in our principle negotiating \nobjectives.\n  Finally, the package includes consultation rights for the House and \nSenate Committees with oversight of the fishing industry. As the past \nChair and current Ranking Member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans \nand Fisheries, I can tell you that the actions of other countries with \nregard to fishing plays a crucial role in ensuring our industry has a \nlevel playing field on which to compete. Last year this country \nexported $11 billion worth of edible and nonedible fish products, and \nin Maine the industry--which is our 5th leading exporter--generates \n26,000 jobs.\n  In the eleventh hour race, Mr. President, as was the case with many \nTAA provisions, some other items that were crucial for small businesses \nwhich make up 99 percent of all U.S. businesses were also lost. One was \na provision to create a small business Assistant USTR which the Senate-\npassed bill included. Although the conference report states that the \nAssistant USTR for Industry and Telecommunications would be responsible \nfor this portfolio, it contains a only sense of Congress that the title \nreflect that. I am shocked at how seemingly difficult it was for us to \ncreate a position for small business at the USTR with a title that \nreflects that fact.\n  Similarly, a provision requiring the USTR to identify someone to be a \nsmall business advocate in the WTO is also no longer in this bill. Why? \nIs it that controversial for us to ensure that the interests of small \nbusiness are represented in the WTO?\n  This is not a perfect bill but the adoption of this comprehensive \npackage will ensure that trade agreements will be pursued in a fair and \nbalanced manner to the benefit of all Americans while also recognizing \nthe need for expanded assistance for those who lose their jobs due to \ntrade.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the \nfast-track conference agreement.\n  Once again, the supporters of this measure seek to characterize this \nvote as a vote on the issue of whether or not we should have trade \nagreements. They argue that to favor the bill is to favor trade, and to \noppose the bill is to oppose trade.\n  Of course, this is nonsense.\n  As a number of my colleagues have noted, the issue of whether to \nenact fast-track procedures is not a question of whether one favors or \nopposes free trade, but rather what role Congress plays in trade \nagreements.\n  Under this bill, that role will be little more than that of one of \nthose bobble-head dolls--nodding its head ``yes'' or shaking its head \n``no'' in response to proposed trade agreements.\n  And it may actually be worse, because nothing in the measure before \nus limits this bobble-head role strictly to trade agreements. Under \nthis bill, the President is at liberty to submit just about any policy \nhe wants as part of a fast-track protected trade bill, and Congress \nwould have to swallow that policy if it wanted to endorse the trade \nagreement to which it was attached.\n  As I noted during the debate on this bill last May, this has, in \nfact, occurred. The last fast-track protected trade agreement this body \nconsidered, the measure implementing the Uruguay Round of the GATT, \nincluded more than $4 billion in tax increases that were beyond the \nreach of this body to amend or even delete.\n  Of course, some may argue that the risk that extraneous matters might \nbe slipped into a fast-track protected trade bill is greatly reduced \nbecause the two trade committees--the Finance Committee in the Senate \nand the Ways and Means Committee in the other body--will stand guard \nagainst such an event, protecting congressional prerogatives.\n  Let me first note that the GATT bill, with its $4 billion in tax \nincreases, came to us with the blessing of those two committees.\n  More recently, the track record of those two committees on this very \nlegislation is not reassuring. The bill before us includes many \nquestionable provisions, but let me cite two in particular that have \nabsolutely no business being in the measure. They both raise serious \ncivil rights and civil liberties concerns.\n  The first of these two issues relates to immunity for customs \nofficers. Central to any lawsuit against a government official alleged \nto have committed misconduct is the immunity standard for that \nofficial. Under Supreme Court law, every government official--federal, \nstate and local--is protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity. \nThis is a very broad shield from liability. In the words of the Supreme \nCourt, it protects ``all but the plainly incompetent or those who \nknowingly violate the law.'' And it is the type of immunity that sets \nthe bar plaintiffs must overcome to win law suits.\n  In the legislation before us, a provision was slipped in that will \nmake it harder to hold an abusive customs officer accountable for bad \nbehavior. The bill changes the immunity standard from one of \n``objective'' immunity, meaning an official had to prove that he or she \ndid not violate clearly established law, to ``good faith'' immunity, \nmeaning that the official only had to prove that he or she believed \nthat he or she was not violating a person's constitutional rights and \nwas not acting with a malicious intent.\n  The practical effect of this change is that an abusive officer will \nmerely have to file an affidavit stating that he or she acted in good \nfaith, and the case will be dismissed. This would make it very \ndifficult for a court to hold a customs officer accountable for abusive \nbehavior, behavior such as racial profiling.\n  Putting aside the question of whether or not this provision belongs \nin a bill that relates to the procedures under which Congress considers \ntrade bills, the provision is not justified. There is no record of any \ngreat abuse of the existing system.\n  Some might suggest that because customs officers work on the border, \nthey need special protection. But Border Patrol agents and other law \nenforcement officers like FBI, DEA, and local police are stationed near \nborders, and they will all continue to work under an objective immunity \nstandard.\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\n  Beyond that, this provision has no business in this bill. It has \nnothing to do with how Congress should consider trade agreements. And \nit certainly merits the kind of scrutiny that it will not get as part \nof a conference report that cannot be amended.\n  A similarly inappropriate but little discussed provision in this bill \nwould allow customs officers to search outgoing mail without the \napproval of a court. That is right. Under this bill, a customs officer \ncan open mail you send overseas without getting a search warrant.\n  The provision applies to all mail weighing more than 16 ounces no \nmatter how it is sent, and it also applies to any mail under 16 ounces, \nthat is sent through a private carrier, such as Federal Express or UPS.\n  This is an enormous change in law. A customs officer would no longer \nhave to go to court to obtain a warrant to search our mail. It takes \naway much of the protection we all thought we had when we mail a letter \nto a friend or relative overseas.\n  Again, setting aside the question of whether the provision has merit, \nit simply has no business in this bill.\n  These two provisions are deeply flawed, in and of themselves, but \nthey should also give us pause when we consider what future proposals \nwe might see included in fast-track protected trade bills--measures \nthat cannot be amended. If the congressional committee watchdogs \nallowed these provisions to be slipped into this bill, what might find \nits way into future measures?\n  And I remind my colleagues that there are no requirements in this \nbill that fast-track protected bills consist only of provisions \ngermane, or even relevant, to the trade agreement to be implemented.\n  The bill is flawed in a number of other critical ways. As others have \nnoted, the bill moves backwards in the area of worker rights and the \nenvironment. It even backslides from the modest progress made in the \nJordan Free Trade Agreement.\n  The bill also guts the Dayton-Craig provisions that sought to ensure \nour own trade laws would not be undercut as part of a fast-track \nprotected trade bill. That amendment was supported by a strong majority \nof the Senate, but it was essentially eliminated in conference. In \nfact, there is little doubt that it was dropped even before this bill \nwent to conference.\n  Nor does this bill address the so-called Chapter 11, issue where \nforeign investors can use secret trade tribunals to effectively weaken \nor eliminate existing state and local laws and regulations that protect \nour health and safety. Because that problem is not addressed, we can \nexpect future trade agreements to include this anti-democratic \nprovision.\n  As I noted during the debate we had on this issue last May, fast-\ntrack is not necessary for free trade. We have entered into hundreds of \nagreements without those procedures.\n  More importantly, fast-track may actually undermine the cause of \nimproved trade.\n  As I noted then, rather than encouraging trade agreements that \nproduce broad-based benefits, fast-track has instead fostered trade \nagreements that pick ``winners and losers,'' and in doing so has \nundermined public support for pursuing free trade agreements.\n  Fast-track also advances the short-term interests of multinational \ncorporations over those of the average worker and consumer. With \nopposition to the entire trade bill the only option left, Congress has \nswallowed provisions that advance corporate interests, even when they \ncome at the expense of our Nation's interests. The so-called Chapter 11 \nprovisions are an excellent example of this. Here again, fast-track \nprocedures actually work to undermine public support for trade \nagreements.\n  Let me reiterate that many of us who support free and fair trade find \nnothing inconsistent with that support and insisting that Congress be a \nfull partner in approving agreements.\n  Indeed, as the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has \nnoted, support for fast-track procedures reveals a lack of confidence \nin the ability of our negotiators to craft a sound agreement, or a lack \nof confidence in the ability of Congress to weigh regional and sectoral \ninterests against the national interest, or may simply be a desire by \nthe Executive Branch to avoid the hard work necessary to convince \nCongress to support the agreements that it negotiates.\n  I can think of no better insurance policy for a sound trade agreement \nthan the prospect of a thorough Congressional review, complete with the \nability to amend that agreement.\n  This was a bad bill when it left the Senate. It is much worse now, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President. I rise to share my thoughts on the trade \nbill we passed this afternoon that gives our President renewed trade \nnegotiating authority\n  Like many of my colleagues, I hail from a State that is particularly \nsensitive to foreign imports of agricultural products, for example \nWyoming's two largest cash crops are sugar and cattle, and where trade \nmakes a big impact on certain industries.\n  I believe in fair trade, and I support the efforts of our President \nas he works to improve our multilateral and bilateral relationships. I \nhave also worked diligently with Members from both sides of the aisle \nto improve our ability to participate in international trade. You will \nremember I urged my colleagues last year to vote for the Export \nAdministration Act, a bill which would streamline our export control \nsystem so that items that do not need to be controlled may move more \neasily across borders. I believe that international trade is an \neffective way to boost the economy, but it must be done responsibly and \ncarefully.\n  I voted in favor of this bill today for three primary reasons.\n  First, I strongly support the bill's provisions that recognize the \nsensitive nature of some industries. I believe the most essential \nprovision related to import sensitive goods is the mandate that \nrequires the President to consult with Industry Advisory Committees and \nthe International Trade Commission on certain negotiations. This bill \nrequires the administration to notify and gather input during trade \nnegotiations from people like ranchers and farmers who produce import-\nsensitive products.\n  Second, as an original cosponsor of the Craig-Dayton Amendment, the \nnew language in the bill addressing trade remedy laws is critical. The \nbill provides that if negotiators don't listen to concerns about \nproposed changes to trade remedy laws, Congress can pass a formal \nresolution of disapproval. This puts up a red flag to the negotiators \nthat they are treading on shaky ground and may want to rethink their \nposition. In addition, I am also pleased this bill sets rigorous \nenforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws as a principal negotiating \nobjective and increases reporting requirements for possible \nmodifications to trade laws.\n  Third, there is specific language in this bill that addresses a major \nconcern of sugar producers. Wyoming sugar producers have been hurt by a \n``sugar laundering'' operation being conducted through Canada. The \nprocess starts when a commodity trader in Canada blends sugar, water \nand molasses in a ratio that would exempt the mixture from U.S. import \nduties Canada enjoys under the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nNAFTA. This mixture is then trucked across the U.S. border to a factory \ncontrolled by the same commodity trader where the sugar is separated \nfrom the molasses mixture. The sugar is then sold in the U.S. market \nfree of tariffs and the rest of the mixture is returned to Canada to be \n``stuffed'' again. The ``sugar loophole'' and others like it would be \nclosed by this trade bill. The bill makes the determination that \nstuffed molasses should be considered imported sugar and therefore \nsubject to tariffs. It also requires the Secretary of Agriculture to \nmonitor other existing or likely circumventions of tariff-rate quotas \nand report on these to the President.\n  Beyond these specific reasons, I cast my affirmative vote today \nbecause fair trade is essential to the economic growth of all \nindustries. The next step is rule and regulation, and I will carefully \nwatch to ensure that the interests of Wyomingites are protected.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will support this final conference report \nto give the President the authority to negotiate nonamendable trade \nagreements and to reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. \nI am\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\npleased that this TAA package provides greater benefits to more workers \nthan ever before.\n  The Nation's economy is fundamentally linked to our Nation's ability \nto export. Today, one-tenth of all jobs in this country are directly \nrelated to our ability to export goods and services. When you consider \nmultiplying effects, that number rises to nearly one-third. Businesses \nin Massachusetts alone sold more than $19.7 billion worth of goods to \nmore than 200 foreign markets last year. That is more than $3,000 worth \nof goods sold abroad for every resident. Massachusetts businesses also \nhelp break the stereotype of international trade as the arena of large \ncorporations. Almost 75 percent of my State's exporting businesses are \nsmall businesses.\n  Of larger businesses which have overseas subsidiaries, almost three-\nfourths of profits earned abroad are returned to parent companies in \nthe United States. That means more jobs and higher wages at home. These \nstatistics present a strong case for support of this bill.\n  I believe strongly that more international trade results in a greater \noccasion to help developing countries grow and develop the roots of \ndemocracy. The chance to improve ties with other countries and use \ntrade as one means of advancing American foreign policy is an \nopportunity that we should not pass up. And so I will support this \nconference report.\n  However, we do ourselves a great disservice to ignore the growing \nconcerns of our own people who view the trade equation as imbalanced: \nWorking families in mill towns across New England or steel towns in the \nMidwest who fear that we have looked only at the export side of the \npuzzle, ignoring our fundamental obligations to a clean environment, \nbasic labor standards and to those Americans whose lives change when \nfactories close or businesses cannot compete with cheaper foreign-\nproduced products.\n  Some important safeguards were in the Senate-passed bill. Indeed, the \nbill that passed the Senate in May was precedent-setting in many ways. \nWe would have provided trade promotion authority to the President while \nalso firmly stating that our Nation's trade remedy laws should not be \neviscerated by trade agreements. Significantly, we provided the \nstrongest safety net ever to workers left jobless by the short-term \neconomic upheaval that comes from increased international trade. We \nalso had a thorough debate on the importance of labor and environmental \nstandards in trade agreements, and on my efforts to prevent investor-\nState disputes from undermining U.S. public health and safety laws. I \nhave no doubt that the Senate will come back to these issues in the \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report represents a mild retreat from \nthe Senate-passed bill. The conference report does not protect American \ntrade remedy laws. The safety net for workers is less comprehensive \nthan it could have, and should have, been. It still does not adequately \npreserve American sovereignty in directing trade negotiators how to \ndevelop settlement panels for investor-State disputes.\n  As a result, we can only hope that our trade negotiators will not \nundermine the values that many Americans worry are not being honored in \nour trade agreements. To be quite honest, though, I have some concerns \nthat the President will not make a full commitment to either the \nenvironment or the basic rights of workers in future trade agreements, \nbecause he has not done these things at home. And so it must fall to \nthe Senate to put the President on notice that he must address the \nconcerns that Americans have about trade. I, for one, will be watching \nagreements that grow out of this trade promotion authority very \nclosely.\n  I must make one more point. With respect to the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program, this bill is not as good as the one the Senate \npassed 3 months ago. But this bill does expand benefits for workers who \nlose their jobs due to increased foreign competition in ways that, \nfrankly, would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. That is \nreal progress. If we are to continue to seek the benefits of increased \ntrade, we must also fulfill our commitment to families and communities \nwhose lives are disrupted by the short-term impacts of trade.\n  I am particularly disappointed that the conference report did not \nretain the important new program making TAA available to fishermen. \nThis program was included in the TAA bill marked up by the Finance \nCommittee last December and included in the bill that passed the Senate \nin May. U.S. fish imports now outstrip exports by $7 billion, due in \nsome measure to the fact that no other nation in the world requires \nsustainable fishing practices. This deficit may soon put some fishermen \nout of business.\n  While a separate program for fishermen makes sense, the \nadministration has informed me that fishermen who seek TAA benefits \nthrough the Department of Labor will indeed be eligible, although they \nmay have to seek a blending of TAA and Workforce Investment Act \nbenefits. Nonetheless, I have the Department's pledge to work with me \non this issue, and I look forward to doing just that.\n  I have also been informed that the Secretary of Agriculture will do a \nrulemaking to determine whether fishermen are eligible for the TAA for \nFarmers program as well. I will make sure that the Secretary is aware \nof my strong belief that fishermen are no different from farmers, and \ndeserve equivalent consideration in this program. I ask unanimous \nconsent that these letters be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Labor, Assistant Secretary for \n           Employment and Training,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I understand that you have a strong \n     interest in providing assistance to workers and fishermen \n     impacted by trade or for other reasons. We at the Department \n     of Labor share your desire to help all dislocated workers get \n     back to work.\n       Workers, including fishermen, who lose their jobs through \n     no fault of their own can receive a wide range of employment \n     and training services through the Workforce Investment Act \n     formula programs. On July 1, 2002, Massachusetts received an \n     allotment of $55,189,519, of which $12,321,163 is allocated \n     to serve dislocated workers. When these formula funds are \n     insufficient to respond to a mass lay-off, plant closure or \n     natural disaster, the Secretary of Labor has discretion to \n     award National Emergency Grants, which are authorized under \n     section 173 of the Workforce Investment Act. National \n     Emergency Grants provide resources for job training and \n     reemployment assistance, as well as supportive services for \n     child-care, transportation and needs-related payments for \n     income support while a worker is enrolled in training.\n       Workers who are impacted by trade may qualify for TAA \n     benefits. Although the Department of Labor has not received \n     any petitions for certification of eligibility for TAA \n     assistance from fishermen over the last five fiscal years, \n     they certainly could apply as long as they meet the \n     requirements of the Act. For example, one of the criteria for \n     TAA eligibility is that the impacted firm has to be involved \n     in the production of an article. We consider fresh fish to be \n     an article. Therefore, if imports of that fish or other fish \n     that were directly competitive contributed importantly to the \n     decline in the sales or production of the fishing firm and \n     the loss of jobs of the crew, the group of workers could be \n     certified for TAA. An owner who works on a fishing vessel \n     with as few as two crew members would be eligible to initiate \n     the petition for TAA.\n       It may also be noted that the Conference Report that is \n     currently before the Senate expands eligibility for TAA to \n     cover certain secondary workers, including suppliers of \n     component parts. In the case of a firm and its fishermen that \n     provided fresh fish to a company that canned the fish and \n     sold the canned fish, and imports of that canned fish led to \n     the workers in the canning company being certified under TAA, \n     the fishermen who supplied the fish could also be certified \n     as secondary workers. This would also require that the loss \n     of business with the canning company constituted at least 20 \n     percent of the fishing firm's sales or contributed \n     importantly to the loss of the fisherman's jobs.\n       It is important to recognize, however, that there are \n     certain limitations on the assistance provided under TAA. One \n     of the requirements for receiving extended income support \n     under TAA, in addition to being enrolled in training or \n     receiving a waiver from that requirement, is that the worker \n     was eligible for and exhausted regular State unemployment \n     insurance. Generally, fishermen on vessels of under 10 tons, \n     and that are not involved in the commercial fishing of salmon \n     or halibut, are excluded from unemployment insurance \n     coverage. Therefore, even if certified for TAA benefits, many \n     fishermen may not qualify for the income support benefit. \n     Therefore, in some cases, fishermen may be able access to \n     income support to enable them to participate in training \n     through WIA formula funded programs, and to the extent\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\n     possible, through a National Emergency Grant awarded in \n     response to a state application, where eligibility for \n     unemployment insurance is not necessarily a prerequisite.\n       I share your concern for all workers who have been laid-off \n     due to trade or other reasons, and I want to assure you that \n     my staff will work with you to help respond to layoffs that \n     may impact fishermen in Massachusetts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Emily Stover DeRocco.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 The Secretary of Agriculture,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry, As you are aware, the conference \n     agreement on H.R. 3009, the Andean Trade Preference Expansion \n     Act is pending before the Senate. This Act includes \n     provisions important to the Administration on Trade Promotion \n     Authority and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).\n       We understand you have concerns regarding the eligibility \n     of the fishing industry to participate in the TAA programs \n     for agriculture authorized in the legislation. As well, we \n     understand the difficult situations that have faced the \n     fishing industry in your State over the last few years.\n       There has been precedent for including certain fishing \n     enterprises in previous USDA disaster programs. As the \n     Department promulgates the necessary regulations to implement \n     the new authorities provided in the Act, we would be willing \n     to carefully examine and discuss with you whether we can \n     include the fishing industry in the appropriate regulations \n     on TAA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ann M. Veneman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7839-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7839-S7843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that we continue to be unable to \nreach an agreement on the Patients' Bill of Rights that would protect \nthe interests of patients instead of the profits of insurance \ncompanies. The sponsors of the Senate Patients' Bill of Rights, \nSenators McCain, Edwards and I, have spent many months talking with the \nWhite House. We have repeatedly tried to reach a fair compromise that \nwould address many of the concerns voiced by the opponents of this bill \nwithout sacrificing the protection patients need. Unfortunately, we \nwere not able to reach an agreement with them. The Bush administration \nhas simply been unwilling to hold HMOs and insurance companies fully \naccountable when they make medical decisions. In the end, they were \nmore committed to maintaining special preferences for HMOs and big \ninsurance companies than passing legislation that would protect \npatients.\n  This is, at heart, an issue of corporate accountability. HMOs and \ninsurance companies have not been held accountable for their medical \ndecisions; and, as a result patients are being injured every day. Just \nas Congress took the lead on corporate accountability in the Sarbanes \nlegislation when the White House would not take strong action, I \nbelieve Congress will now take the lead and enact a strong Patients' \nBill of Rights. The political climate is very different today than it \nwas when the House acted last year. The public is focused. I do not \nbelieve the Republican leadership will be able to resist the tide of \npopular opinion.\n  Throughout this process, we have been particularly concerned about \nthose patients who sustain the most serious, life-altering injuries. If \nthe law does not allow them to obtain full and fair compensation for \ntheir injuries, we will fail those who are most in need of our help. \nYet, the administration has steadfastly refused to agree to liability \nprovisions that would treat the most seriously injured patients justly.\n  Holding HMOs and health insurers fully accountable for their \nmisconduct is essential to improving the quality of health care that \nmillions of Americans receive. Nothing will provide a greater incentive \nfor an HMO to do the right thing than the knowledge that it will be \nheld accountable in court if it does the wrong thing. Placing arbitrary \nlimits on the financial responsibility which HMOs owe to those patients \nwho have been badly harmed by their misconduct would seriously weaken \nthe deterrent effect of the law. Yet, the administration has insisted \non a series of provisions which were designed to limit the \naccountability of HMOs.\n  The Bush administration wanted to weaken the authority of external \nreview panels to help patients obtain the medical care they need. They \ndemanded a rebuttable presumption against the patients in many cases \nthat would effectively deny them a fair hearing in court. They demanded \nan arbitrary cap on the compensation which even the most seriously \ninjured patients could receive. They wanted to allow HMOs and insurance \ncompanies to block injured patients from going to court at all, forcing \nthem instead into a much more restrictive arbitration process. They \ninsisted on preventing juries from awarding punitive damages even if \nthere was clear and convincing evidence of a pattern of intentional \nwrongdoing by the HMO. At every stage of the accountability process, \nthe administration was unwilling to treat patients fairly. A right \nwithout an effective remedy is no right at all, and the administration \nwas unwilling to provide injured patients with any effective remedy.\n  Every day, thousands of patients are victimized by HMO abuses. Too \nmany patients with symptoms of a heart attack or stroke are put at risk \nbecause they cannot go to the nearest emergency room. Too many women \nwith breast cancer or cervical cancer suffer and even die because their \nHMO will not authorize needed care by a specialist. Too many children \nwith life-threatening illnesses are told that they must see the \nunqualified physician in their plan's network because the HMO won't pay \nfor them to see the specialist just down the road. Too many patients \nwith incurable cancer or heart disease or other fatal conditions are \ndenied the opportunity to participate in the clinical trials that could \nsave their lives. Too many patients with arthritis, or cancer, or \nmental illnesses are denied the drugs that their doctor prescribes, \nbecause the medicine they need is not as cheap as the medicine on the \nHMO's list.\n  The legislation passed by the Senate would end those abuses, and it \nwould assure that HMOs could be held responsible in court if they \nfailed to provide the care their patients deserved. The Senate bill \nsaid that if an HMO crippled or terribly injured a patient, it had a \nresponsibility to provide financial compensation for the victim and the \nvictim's family. It said that if an HMO killed a family breadwinner, it \nwas liable for the support of that patient's family.\n  The Senate passed a strong, effective patients' bill of rights by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote. It was not a Democratic victory or a \nRepublican victory. It was a victory for patients. It was a victory for \nevery family that wants medical decisions made by doctors and nurses, \nnot insurance company bureaucrats. It said that treatment should be \ndetermined by a patients' vital signs, not an HMO's bottom line.\n  Under our legislation, all the abuses that have marked managed care \nfor so long were prohibited. Patients were guaranteed access to a \nspeedy, impartial, independent appeal when HMOs denied care. And the \nrights the legislation granted were enforceable. When HMO decisions \nseriously injured patients, HMOs could be held accountable in court, \nunder state law, under the same standards that apply to doctors and \nhospitals.\n  The story was different in the House. There, a narrow, partisan \nmajority insisted on retaining special treatment and special privileges \nfor HMOs. That legislation granted HMOs protection available to no \nother industry in America. Under the guise of granting new rights, it \ndenied effective remedies. It tilted the playing field in favor of HMOs \nand against patients. The Republican majority in the House said yes to \nbig business and no to American families. Their bill represents the \ntriumph of privilege and power over fairness.\n  Under the House Republican bill, a family trying to hold an HMO \naccountable when a patient was killed or injured would find the legal \nprocess stacked against them at every turn. The standard in their bill \nfor determining whether the HMO was negligent would allow HMOs to \noverturn the decision of a patients' family doctor without being held \nto the same standard of good medical practice that applies to the \ndoctor. Think about that. One standard for a doctor trying to provide \ngood care for patients. Another, lower standard for the HMO which \narbitrarily overturns that doctor's decision because it wants to \nprotect its bottom line.\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\n  The House Republican bill puts artificial limits on the liability of \nHMOs when a patient is killed or injured. The Republicans often \ncomplain about one-size-fits all legislation, but their bill is an \nextreme example of it. No matter how seriously a patient is injured, no \nmatter what remedies are available under state law, no matter how \nnegligent or outrageous the actions of that HMO, no matter what a judge \nand jury decides is an appropriate remedy, there is the same flat \ndollar limit on the HMOs' liability. And the limit in the Republican \nbill is far below what the most seriously injured patients receive when \nthey are badly hurt by a doctor's negligence or by the negligence of \nany other industry. For a child paralyzed for life by an HMO's penny-\npinching--an arbitrary limit on compensation. For a child who loses \nboth hands and feet--an arbitrary limit on compensation. For the \nfamilies of women needlessly killed by improper treatment for breast \ncancer an arbitrary limit on compensation. For a father or mother \nhopelessly brain-damaged--an arbitrary limit on compensation.\n  In addition, the bill essentially provides no punitive damages to \ndeter the most egregious denials of care. Even if the HMO denies \nmedically necessary care over and over and over again, no punitive \ndamages. Even if the HMO engages in fraud or willful misconduct, no \npunitive damages. Even if the HMO routinely turns down every request \nfor expensive treatment, no punitive damages.\n  If a patient ever gets to court under the Republican plan, they face \na form of double jeopardy--the so-called ``rebuttable presumption.'' If \na patient loses an appeal to an external review agency, that patient \nfaces an almost impossible legal hurdle in court. But if an HMO loses \nan external appeal, the patient does not gain a comparable advantage. \nIn effect, the patient has to win twice. The HMO only has to win only \nonce. This one-way presumption is grossly unfair.\n  In area after area of Federal legislation, Congress has set minimum \nstandards guaranteeing basic fairness but allowed states to go farther \nin protecting their citizens. But the House Republican bill sets a \nceiling instead of a floor. States are not permitted to have stronger \npatients' rights laws. The bill would preempt the external review \nprocess in more than 40 states, abolishing state laws that provide \ngreater protection for patients.\n  In a bill that purports to expand patient protections, it is \nremarkable that the Republican bill actually takes rights away. The \nFederal RICO antiracketeering statute is a powerful weapon against \nfraud. Under current law, patients and businesses buying health \ninsurance policies have the right to bring a RICO class action suit \nagainst a health insurance company which has engaged in systematic \nfraud. The House Republican bill would in essence repeal that right, \nerecting new barriers to class actions against health insurance \ncompanies.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to protect patients against \nHMO abuse, it includes unrelated provisions that could actually harm \npatients. The bill provides new tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy \nby expanding and extending so-called ``Medical Savings Accounts.'' \nThese accounts are the pet project of certain insurance companies that \nhave made large donations to the Republican party. They not only \nbenefit the healthy and wealthy purchasing high deductible insurance \npolicies, but a number of independent analyses have concluded that they \ncould result in dramatic premium increases for everyone else. Every \nday, we seem to find new evidence that the Republicans have never found \na tax break for the wealthy that they didn't eagerly embrace.\n  And finally, the Republican bill eliminates state regulation of so-\ncalled ``association health plans,'' a new name for multiemployer \nwelfare arrangements. While well-run plans of this kind can benefit \nconsumers, too often they have failed financially and left patients \nholding the bag. Fraud has been their frequent companion. Most \nauthorities believe that they need more regulation, not less. And not \nonly does the Republican plan expose millions of families to financial \ndisaster, it would deny more millions important benefits required by \nstate insurance laws--benefits that help women at risk of cervical \ncancer, children with birth defects, and the disabled. According to \nestimates by the Congressional Budget Office, hundreds of thousands of \npeople, predominantly those in poorer health, could lose their coverage \nas a result of this proposal.\n  I am disappointed that we were unable to reach an agreement with the \nAdministration that would have made it possible to pass a strong, \neffective patients' bill of rights--one that would have protected \npatients without providing sweetheart deals for HMOs.\n  It is unfortunate that this Administration so consistently sides with \nthe wealthy and powerful and against the interests of ordinary people. \nThe positions taken by the White House on these critical health issues \ndo not represent the views of the American people. Just a few days \nafter the President called for severe limitations on a patient's right \nto seek compensation when he or she is seriously injured by medical \nmalpractice, a strong bi-partisan 57-42 majority of the Senate rejected \nthe President's position and sided with patients.\n  The Senate version of the patients' bill of rights--supported by \nvirtually every group of patients, doctors, nurses, and advocates for \nworkers and families--passed the Senate with a strong, bipartisan \nmajority of 59-36 . In contrast, the key vote in the House of \nRepresentatives gutting the provisions of the bill which would hold \nHMOs accountable for injuring patients passed by a narrow partisan \nmajority of only six votes--and then only after the Administration used \nevery weapon of arm-twisting and patronage in the book to hold their \nvotes in line.\n  In the last two weeks, the Senate debated the critical issues of \nreducing the high cost of prescription drugs and providing a long-\noverdue prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Over the strenuous \nobjections of the Republican leadership and the Administration, the \nSenate voted by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 78-21 to end \nabuses by wealthy and powerful drug companies that stifled competition \nand raised prices to patients.\n  A majority of the Senate also voted to provide comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare--but the objections of the \nAdministration and the Republican leadership proved too strong to reach \nthe 60 votes necessary for passage. The misplaced priorities behind the \nRepublican position were made clear by separate comments of the \nPresident and the Republican leader. Senator Trent Lott stated that \nboth the comprehensive plan a majority of the Senate supported and even \nthe scaled-back downpayment plan were too expensive for the Republican \nleadership. But while Republicans rejected prescription drug coverage \nfor the elderly as just too expensive, the President reiterated \nyesterday his support for extending the trillion dollar plus tax cuts \nthat primarily benefitted the wealthy.\n  While I am disappointed by the failure to reach agreement on the \npatients' bill of rights and to achieve 60 votes for Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, I am not discouraged. The American people \nwant action, and in the end, I believe the Congress will listen to \ntheir voice.\n  We will never give up the struggle for prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare until we mend the broken promise of Medicare and \nguarantee senior citizens the prescription drug coverage they deserve. \nAnd we will never give up the fight for a strong, effective patients' \nbill of rights.\n  Now we will move to a patients' bill of rights conference with the \nHouse of Representatives and try once again. We commit today that we \nwill do everything we can to make the conference a success. We will \nnever give up this fight until all patients receive the protection they \ndeserve. We will not rest until medical decisions are made by doctors, \nnurses, and patients, instead of insurance company bureaucrats.\n  Finally, I want to once again commend my two friends and colleagues \nwho provided such important leadership here on the floor of the Senate. \nThey were valued advisers, counselors, and helpers in trying to work \nthrough, in a constructive and positive way, the differences that \nexisted. They took an enormous amount of time, including great \ndiligence, expertise, and understanding of the issues at stake; They \nwere enormously constructive and\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nhelpful in trying to move this in a positive way. We were unsuccessful \nin that phase of this path towards completing our mission of achieving \nan effective Patients' Bill of Rights, but we are all committed to \nachieving it ultimately. I thank them for all the good work they have \nachieved.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEdwards for the over-a-year-long effort we have been involved in \nattempting to reach agreement on S. 1052, the bipartisan Patient \nProtection Act. It has been over a year since the Senate passed it. It \nhas been just under a year since another version was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. The White House was instrumental in crafting \nthe House-passed version.\n  So since last year Senator Kennedy, Senator Edwards, and I have \nworked with the White House in the hopes of reconciling the Senate and \nthe House bills. Much progress has been made as a result of these \nnegotiations. But, regrettably, a resolution eludes us, and I think it \nis time to appoint conferees.\n  America has been patiently waiting for Congress to pass a Patients' \nBill of Rights. It will grant American families enrolled in health \nmaintenance organizations the protections they deserve. For too long \nthis vital reform has been frustrated by political gridlock, \nprincipally by trial lawyers who insist on the ability to sue everyone \nfor everything and by the insurance companies that want to protect \ntheir bottom line at the expense of fairness. Caught in the middle are \naverage citizens who are members of HMOs. Americans want and deserve \nquick enactment of this legislation.\n  Several years ago I began working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to address the problems in HMO's provisions in health care \nand to craft a bipartisan bill that truly protects the rights of \npatients in our Nation's health care system.\n  The Senate passage of the bipartisan Patient Protection Act furthered \nthe effort to restore critical rights to HMO patients and doctors.\n\n  I, again, express my appreciation to the Senator from North Carolina, \nMr. Edwards, for his incredibly fine work. Both the Senate- and the \nHouse-passed versions contain important patient protections for the \nAmerican people. I am confident that with perseverance we can resolve \nthe few differences that remain. If we do not continue to work toward a \nresolution on this issue, we will be turning our backs on strong \npatient protections included in both bills.\n  This is really the shame of our failure so far because included in \nboth bills are external and internal review, direct access to an OB-GYN \nfor women, direct access to pediatricians for children, access to \nclinical trials for cancer patients, access to emergency room care, \naccess to specialty care, and access to nonformulary prescription \ndrugs. If we do not negotiate, and if we do not reach a successful \nconclusion, these important commonalities and progress will be lost.\n  I believe a conference report represents one final opportunity to \nwork out the differences between the House and Senate efforts to enact \nmeaningful HMO reform. I remain committed to working with Members of \nboth bodies, and with the President, to make sure we will enact into \nlaw these important protections for which too many Americans have \nwaited far too long.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference to bridge \nthe differences between the House and the Senate bills and provide \npatients with the protection they deserve.\n  The problem, as I see it, is that we have very small differences, and \nduring the course of our negotiations there will be different versions \nabout how close we came and what our differences were. But I believe \nthey were very narrow differences, and I am very disappointed that they \nwere unable to work out. And I got to spend a lot more time than my \ncolleagues wanted--Senator Kennedy and Senator Edwards and I together--\nbut I believe there was a good-faith effort made.\n  I believe we are going to lose so many important advances on behalf \nof patients because of a small difference that really has to do with \ncases that will be adjudicated in court. And that is a very small \nnumber of these cases because with internal and external review, and \nother safeguards in the bill, there would be a minuscule number of \ncases that actually would end up in court. And that is the aspect of \nthis agreement on which we were unable to reach agreement with the \nWhite House. And I regret it very much.\n  So as Senator Kennedy just stated, I believe we will prevail over \ntime, just as we have prevailed on other issues over time, because this \nis something the American people need and deserve.\n  There are too many compelling cases out there of people who have been \ndeprived of fundamental care which has inflicted incredible damage, \nhardship, and sorrow on so many Americans because they have been \ndeprived of simple rights, such as a woman to see an OB-GYN, such as \nthe right of a child to see a pediatrician, such as a doctor making a \ndecision rather than a bureaucrat.\n  This is what it is all about: Who makes the decisions on patients' \ncare? Should it be someone who is wearing a green eyeshade who can \ncount up how much the costs are or should it be a doctor, a qualified \nphysician, who makes the decision? That is really what this reform is \nall about.\n  Unfortunately, it has gotten hung up over court proceedings and who \nshould go to court and whether there should be caps on economic and \npunitive damages, and other aspects of the minuscule number that would \never be required to do so.\n  So I hope we can all step back and look at this situation. In the \ncontext of how far we have gone, we have gone 99 percent of the way in \ndoing what my colleagues and I set out to do a long time ago; and that \nwas to provide members of health maintenance organizations with \nfundamental protections which they need and deserve.\n  So, again, I conclude by thanking Senator Kennedy and Senator Edwards \nfor their hard work and for their dedication to the resolution of this \nissue. I thank the White House for their efforts as well. In the little \ninterest of straight talk, I think from time to time they were \nconstrained by the other body in the latitude as to the agreements they \ncould make, but I also understand that is how the system works.\n  But I believe that while we are gone in August, back with our friends \nand neighbors and fellow citizens, our friends and neighbors are going \nto come to us and say: Look, we deserve this legislation--the millions \nand millions of Americans who are members of HMOs--we deserve that we \nget certain basic protections.\n  I hope that will reinvigorate us, upon our return, to enact final \nlegislation and resolve the few remaining differences in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. CLINTON). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, first, I say thank you to my colleagues \nand my friends, Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, who have worked so \nhard on this legislation. Senator Kennedy worked long and hard on this \nbefore a number of us, including Senator McCain and myself, became \nactively involved. He has been rowing the boat for a long time. And his \nwork has been critical to the progress that has been made on behalf of \npatients. And Senator McCain has had such an enormous influence on the \nwork that has been done and the progress that has been made.\n  Today conferees will be appointed, which is unfortunate. I want to \nsay a word about why this matters and why it matters for people, for \npatients, and why most of the people in this country don't care at all \nabout the process or the procedures inside the Senate or a conference \nbetween the House and the Senate. All they care about, and all they \nknow, is they write those checks every month to the insurance company \nfor their insurance premiums, and they want to get what they are paying \nfor.\n  They expect, if they are going to pay the insurance company for \nhealth care coverage, they ought to get it. If their child needs to see \na specialist, that child ought to be able to see that specialist. When \nthey are going to the emergency room, they should not have to call a 1-\n800 number to get permission to go.\n  If a woman wants to participate in a clinical trial, she ought to be \nable to participate in a clinical trial. If the insurance company and \nthe HMO say, we\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nare not paying for this, we will not give you the care toward which you \nhave been writing those checks for every month, they ought to have a \nsimple, inexpensive, fast way of getting that decision overturned. That \nis what the Patients' Bill of Rights is about. It affects real people's \nlives.\n  There is a fellow from North Carolina named Steve Grissom whom I got \nto know over time. Steve developed all kinds of health problems as a \nresult of a blood transfusion. It got to the place where he needed \noxygen basically 24 hours a day in order to continue to function. All \nof his doctors, including a specialist at Duke University, said he \nneeded it--everybody except an HMO bureaucrat who came along after the \nfact and said: You don't need this. We are not going to pay for it.\n  Steve, because of what happened to him, became an enormous advocate \nfor doing something about patients' rights and the Patients' Bill of \nRights. He became a powerful, passionate voice for regular people \nagainst the HMOs in order to do what needs to be done for families to \nbe able to make their own health care decisions.\n  Steve lost his life this week, not as a result of what the HMO did, \nbut he is the personification of the problem that exists all over \nAmerica and what HMOs are doing to patients all over America. Millions \nand millions of people, children, and families can't make their own \nhealth care decisions. Health care decisions are being made by \nbureaucrats sitting behind a desk somewhere who have no training, no \nbusiness making those kinds of decisions, and the patients and the \nfamilies can do nothing about it. They are totally powerless.\n  HMOs live in a privileged, rarified world that no other business in \nAmerica lives in. In this era of corporate responsibility, we are \ntrying to say on the floor of the Senate that corporations ought to be \nheld accountable for what they do, for their decisions, they ought to \nbe responsible for what they do; not HMOs, HMOs can do anything they \nwant, and we are powerless to do anything about it.\n  What the Senate did in the Patients' Bill of Rights, which received \nstrong bipartisan support, was create real rights for patients: \nAllowing people to make their own health care decisions, to go to the \nemergency room, to participate in clinical trials, to get bad decisions \nby HMOs overturned. That is what we did in the Senate. All we said was \nthis: We want HMOs to be treated like everybody else. Why in the world \nshould every person in America be responsible for what they do, every \nother business in America be responsible for what they do, but we are \ngoing to put HMOs up on a pedestal and treat them better and \ndifferently than everybody else? They can't be held responsible. They \ncan't be held accountable. They are different. They are better than all \nthe rest of us.\n  Well, they are not. They are just like everybody else. What could be \na better example of the abuses that occur than what we have seen happen \nover the course of the last several months with the corporate \nirresponsibility that has had an enormous effect on all American \npeople--investors, Wall Street, the economy?\n  In this era of trying to do something about corporate responsibility, \nare we going to maintain this special, privileged, protected status for \na group of businesses that have proven--there is no question about it--\nthat they are willing to engage in abuses, all in the name of profit \nand all at the expense of patients? That is what this is all about.\n\n  That is the reason virtually every group in America that cares about \nthis issue supported the Patients' Bill of Rights that passed the \nSenate. Unfortunately, when the bill went to the House, a much weaker \nbill passed, a bill that in many cases would have actually taken away \nrights that States had put into place on behalf of patients. Many would \nargue it was an insurers' bill of rights, not a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  If you put the bills side by side, on every single difference between \nthe Senate bill and the House bill, the Senate bill favored the \npatients, the House bill favored the HMOs. It is no more complicated \nthan that. As a result of having two bills passed--a strong bill in the \nSenate and a weak bill in the House--it was necessary for Senator \nMcCain, Senator Kennedy, and me to begin negotiating with the White \nHouse because, as I said earlier, the people of this country couldn't \ncare less about the process of what goes on inside Washington. They \nwant to be able to make their own health care decisions. They depend on \nus to do something about that.\n  So over the course of many months, Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, \nand I had a whole series of meetings, many meetings over long hours, to \ntalk about trying to bridge the differences. I do have to say, on every \nsingle one of the discussions, the differences between us and the White \nHouse in the negotiations were the same as the differences between the \nSenate bill and the House bill. Our position favored the patients; \ntheir position favored the HMOs.\n  They did make a good faith effort to talk to us. Senator Kennedy, \nSenator McCain, and I made a very good faith effort to try to bridge \nthe gap. The differences could not be bridged.\n  At the end of the day, decisions have to be made. To the extent there \nis a conflict, you have to decide which side you are on. You can \ncompromise. You can compromise. You can compromise. We made so many \nproposals in these discussions, new, creative proposals to try to \nbridge the gap, to try to find a way to bring the differences together. \nOver the course of time, we did make progress. Senator McCain said \nthat. He is right. We did make some progress.\n  But at the end of the day, a judgment has to be made about whether \nyou are going to decide with patients and families or whether you will \ndecide with the HMOs. It gets to be a fairly simple judgment.\n  At the end of the day, the White House stood with the HMOs, and we \nwere with the patients, as we have always been. We were willing to \ncompromise. We were willing to make changes. We were willing to do \nthings to get something done. Throughout the whole discussion, we were \nwilling to do that. But our focus was always on the interests of the \npatients, not on the interests of the HMOs. We knew the HMOs were being \nvery well represented, both in terms of their voice here in Washington \nand on Capitol Hill, and their influence with the administration.\n  Unfortunately, this is a pattern. This is not one isolated example. \nThe White House stands with the HMOs, and has throughout this process, \nand against patients. They have done exactly the same thing in standing \nwith pharmaceutical companies. When we try to do something about the \ncost of prescription drugs, about bringing a real and meaningful \nprescription drug benefit to senior citizens, we know where they are; \nthey are with the pharmaceutical companies. They always have been.\n  The same thing is true when we try to protect our air. Right now they \nare changing the law, the regulations under the Clean Air Act, to give \npolluters, energy companies, the ability to pollute our air at the \nexpense of children with asthma and senior citizens who have heart \nproblems. We know where they stand. They don't stand with the people \nwho are going to be hurt. They stand with the energy companies that are \ndoing the polluting.\n  Over and over and over, they were dragged kicking and screaming into \ndoing something about corporate responsibility, and they finally \nembraced the Sarbanes bill that passed in the Senate. This is not an \nisolated incident. This has happened over and over and over. And at the \nend of the day, it is about corporate responsibility. There is \nabsolutely no question about that.\n  We will, though, get a bill. We will get a bill for exactly the \nreason Senator McCain said: Because ultimately we will do what the \nAmerican people are demanding that we do. They have been saying to us \nfor years now: We are not going to continue to stand by and have HMOs \nrun over us. We will not let insurance companies make health care \ndecisions. We want you, our elected leaders, to make decisions that are \nin our interest, not in the interest of the HMOs.\n  We all know we can't move out here without bumping into some lobbyist \nfor an HMO. They are everywhere. Who is going to look out for the \ninterests of regular people in this country, for kids and families who \nneed to be able to make their own health care decisions? We are going \nto; that is who is going to.\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n  That is why, when this process is over, we will have a real Patients' \nBill of Rights. We will put decisionmaking authority back in the hands \nof kids, back in the hands of families. And if HMOs are going to make \nhealth care decisions, they ought to be treated just like the people \nwho make health care decisions every day--doctors and hospitals.\n  We never said we wanted them to be treated any worse. What we did in \nthe Senate was pass a bill that said exactly that. If you make a health \ncare decision--if some HMO bureaucrat makes a health care decision and \noverrides the decision of a doctor or of a hospital, they are going to \nbe treated exactly as the hospital and the HMOs are treated. They will \nstand in the shoes of the people who make the decisions. We are going \nto treat them as everybody else.\n  Madam President, we are still optimistic. We believe we can do what \nneeds to be done for the American people. This is a critical piece of \nlegislation to families all over America. We will not stop. We will not \nstop until this legislation and this law that is so desperately needed \nis signed by the President of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, they said they are standing with the \nAmerican public on what they are demanding. The American public is \ndemanding health care insurance. The Patients' Bill of Rights \ndramatically increased the cost of health insurance. If we are \ninterested in what the American public is demanding, it is lower health \ninsurance bills. What they would have gotten if this bill had passed \nand become law in the Senate is higher health care bills, because under \nthis bill we would allow employers to be sued--yes, not HMOs. You \nalways hear HMOs, HMOs. Look, I am happy to have HMOs, but what this \nbill allows, what they have been arguing for from day one is to allow \npeople who have employer-provided insurance is to let the employer be \nsued.\n  To be clear, I haven't talked to one employer in Pennsylvania who, if \nthe Senate bill were passed, which allows employers to be sued simply \nby providing insurance to their employees--I haven't talked to one who \nsaid: I am out of the insurance business; that is not my job; that is \nnot why I provide insurance to employees. I do it as a benefit and to \nbe competitive in the marketplace. But do you know what. I am not going \nto open up the books and the entire revenues of my company to trial \nlawyers suing on behalf of my employees because they got a bad health \ncare outfit.\n  This bill will not only drive up costs, but it will drive employers \nout of providing health insurance. That is not what the American public \nis demanding. They are not demanding higher costs and to be uninsured \nby their employers. That is what this bill would do.\n  I respect greatly the President for standing firm and saying we are \nnot going to cause massive uninsurance, we are not going to cause \nmassive increases in health insurance, all to the benefit of the trial \nlawyers of America. That is not what we are about, and it is not what \nthe American public wants, and that is not what we are going to do. I \nthank the President for not going along with this scheme to end up \ndriving the private markets into the ground and then having those who \ndrove the market into the ground come back to the Senate floor and say: \nSee, look, private employers are not doing their job anymore, so we \nneed a Government-run health care system; let's pass that.\n  Madam President, that is not why I got up to talk. That is what \nhappens when you listen to other people's speeches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7843-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7843-S7844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PRESIDENT'S FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, we have been trying over the last few \nhours to get a unanimous consent agreement on the President's faith-\nbased initiative called the CARE Act, passed out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis. We have been working, first, to clear \na unanimous consent agreement to get the CARE Act, as passed by the \nFinance Committee, cleared without amendments being offered by either \nside, simply a managers' amendment that includes provisions not in the \nFinance Committee mark because the Finance Committee didn't have \njurisdiction over those elements of the bill that Senator Lieberman and \nI and the President have agreed on as a compromise. We tried to clear \nthat, and there was objection.\n  So Senator Lieberman and I talked with Senator Daschle to see if we \ncould clear a unanimous consent with the limitation on amendments--not \nrelevant amendments but simply tax amendments. We suggested five on \neither side. That was cleared on our side. That was acceptable to us, \nto have a limitation on amendments of five on each side. We have just \nbeen informed that is not acceptable on the Democrat side. We asked if \nsix was. No. Seven? No.\n  So my concern is that we will not take the bill clean or with a \nlimitation on amendments. I guess I have to ask--and I will not \npropound a unanimous consent request, but I believe there are Members \non both sides working in good faith to see if we can get this piece of \nlegislation before the Senate and get it enacted into law. It is \nsomething I know Members on both sides of the aisle feel very strongly \nabout--to support charitable giving at a time when charitable giving \nhas really taken it on the chin, other than with respect to 9/11. With \nthe stock market down, we have seen charitable giving go down and, in \nsome cases, dramatically. This is needed to help the nonprofit sector \nto provide for the human service needs out there in America.\n  So I will withhold a unanimous consent request, even though I think \nwe had some agreement to try to propound one tonight, because there are \nobjections on the Democratic side of the aisle. I just encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to work with us to see if \nwe can find a regime in which we can bring this legislation to the \nfloor with some sort of limitation on amendments and debate and have a \ngood discussion and then move forward and pass this legislation. Maybe \neven if it is acceptable, we can get the House to accept it and move it \non to President, and we must go to conference.\n  I hope we can work in a bipartisan spirit to help. This is targeted \nto help those who are in need in our society. It is something the \nPresident cares about and Senator Lieberman, as do others, including \nSenator Daschle.\n  Let's have a good-faith effort here to move forward on this \nlegislation and find some sort of unanimous consent agreement to move \nus forward on this important piece of legislation that is so needed by \nthose who want to be helpful to others in need in our society.\n  Thank you.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the necessity to provide \nbroader flexibility to States in their effort to reward work, lift \npeople out of poverty, and benefit children. As we contemplate the \nreauthorization of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, \nprogram, we have to ask ourselves: On what basis do we want to judge \nthe success of welfare reform?\n\n  Will we focus only on the reduction of case loads and increases in \nwork participation, without regard to whether the wage levels raise \nfamilies out of poverty and children are better off? Or, do we want to \nbuild a system that truly breaks the cycle of poverty and supports the \nlong-term economic well-being of welfare recipients and results in a \nbetter future for children?\n  We need to move to the next generation of welfare reform. Our goal \nshould be to reduce poverty, reward work, and ensure the well-being of \nchildren.\n  Much of the debate on welfare policy revolves around the issue of \nwork, but how do we reward work? During the past two decades states \nhave experimented with new approaches to cash welfare assistance for \nlow-income families. These initiatives have included mandatory \nemployment services, earnings supplements, and time limits on welfare \nreceipt.\n  How do we know which strategies work best? A federally-funded \nevaluation of welfare-to-work experiments by Manpower Demonstration \nResearch Corporation, MDRC, provides a wealth of information on the \neffect of these strategies on employment and income, as well as child \nwell-being. This rigorous random-assignment research lays a strong \nfoundation for legislative deliberations about the reauthorization of \nTANF.\n  Although most of these initiatives increased the employment rate \namong welfare recipients, programs that included only mandatory \nemployment services usually left families no better off financially \nthan they would have been without the programs.\n  The only programs that both increased work and made families \nfinancially better off were those that provided earnings supplements to \nlow-wage workers. These programs also increased job retention and \nproduced a range of positive effects for children, including better \nschool performance and fewer behavioral and emotional problems for \nelementary school-age children. One income-raising program also \nsignificantly reduced domestic violence and family breakup.\n  Earnings supplements are easily provided to working recipients by \nallowing them to keep more of their benefits. For example, some States \nhave not cut or eliminated a family's assistance on a dollar-for-dollar \nbasis when the family enters employment.\n  However, under current law, States are restricted in how they can use \ntheir TANF block grant funds to help working families, because any \nmonth in which Federal funds are used to provide ``assistance'' to a \nworking family counts against the Federal time limit on assistance.\n  Some States, including my state of Rhode Island, Illinois, Delaware, \nMaryland, and Pennsylvania, operate programs using State money to help \nlow-income working families. In Rhode Island, our Family Independence \nProgram, FIP, provides a State earnings supplement as a work support \nand does not count it as ``assistance'' if a parent is working at least \n30 hours per week.\n  Using this FIP wage supplement, families have funds to buy basic \nnecessities.\n  Knowing that their income will not plummet after some artificial time \nlimit is an incentive to find a job. Providing stable income helps \nparents stay attached to the workforce and rewards work.\n  For example, a mother with two children, who works 30 hours per week \nand earns the average starting wage of about $7.80 per hour in Rhode \nIsland, receives a supplemental FIP payment of $132 per month. This \nbrings her total income to about $1,044 per month. Even with this \nsupplement even with her work, that $1,000 per month is still only 83 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  With a supplement and with work these women are still not making \nincome relative to the poverty level.\n  If Rhode Island did not use state dollars for the wage supplement, \nwhen a mother reached her 5-year time limit and the FIP payment \nstopped, she would lose 13 percent of her total income.\n  Using State funds offers broader flexibility for States to support \nfamilies that meet work requirements and yet remain eligible for \nearnings supplements because of low wages. However, with State budgets \nbeing severely constrained, the ability to sustain this work support \nfor low-income families is in jeopardy.\n  Further, as a State equity issue, all States should have the \nflexibility to use their Federal TANF funds to help low-income working \nfamilies without restrictions--for the simple reason that it works.\n  Sadly, the income-enhancing effects of wage supplements and the \npositive effects on children are undermined by current restrictions on \nthe use of TANF funds and definitions of what counts as ``assistance.''\n  Income gains disappear after families reach their time limits. The \nrigidity of the current system that counts wage subsidies as \n``assistance'' conflicts with the success of supplemental cash \npayments, which rewards work.\n  If we want to reward work and help children, we must give States the \nflexibility and the option to provide continuing assistance to working \nfamilies using Federal TANF dollars, ensuring that these supplements \nare not considered ``assistance'' under this program.\n  If the Senate were to permit TANF funds to be used in this flexible \nway, families would continue to be subject to all other Federal and \nState TANF requirements, including work and universal engagement \nrequirements. But States would have flexibility in deciding whether to \nexercise the option and for how long to exercise this option. This \nprovision has no cost; it would simply give States more flexibility in \nusing existing Federal TANF funds to support low-income working \nfamilies.\n  Earnings supplements have a proven record for boosting work and \n``making work pay.'' These programs reward those who do the right thing \nby getting jobs and it results in better outcomes for children.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me during the upcoming debate on \nthe welfare reauthorization bill to ensure the inclusion of this \nbroader flexibility for States.\n  I again thank the Senator from Utah for his kindness and \ngraciousness. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7844-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7844-S7847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, 1 month ago today on July 1, 2002, the \nInternational Criminal Court was formally brought into existence. There \nhas been objection to the International Criminal Court in America and, \nindeed, there has been a great deal of angst among our friends and \nallies around the world over the fact that President Bush removed \nAmerica's signature from the treaty that created the International \nCriminal Court.\n  I have read some of the press around this controversy with great \ninterest. I have been particularly struck by the fact that Chris Patton \nof the European Parliament, who is probably as good a friend as America \nhas anywhere in Europe, has, in the American newspapers, expressed his \ngreat concern about our failure to endorse the International Criminal \nCourt and to fully support it.\n  I cannot speak for the administration. I cannot speak for my \ncolleagues in the Senate, but I can speak for myself, and I think Chris \nPatton and the others throughout the world who have expressed concern \nwith our actions on this issue have the right to understand why some \nAmericans are opposed to the International Criminal Court. I intend to \nlay out today the reasons why I, as one Senator, am opposed to the \nInternational Criminal Court in an effort to help our friends around \nthe world understand some of the difficulties that many Americans have \nand to make it clear that my opposition to the International Criminal \nCourt is not a knee-jerk response as some European newspapers may \nexpect.\n  First, I should make it clear for those who may be listening or who \nmight read the speech afterwards what the International Criminal Court \nis because I find that many of my constituents have no idea what it is. \nSo very\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nquickly, Madam President, I will lay out what it is we are talking \nabout here.\n  The International Criminal Court is a permanent international \njudicial institution that was organized and established by countries \naround the world for the purpose of redressing the most serious crimes \nin the international community. And here we are talking about those \ncrimes that historically have lent themselves to war crimes tribunals--\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Those are the crimes \nconsidered to be so horrific that nations and leaders of nations can be \nheld responsible for their commission.\n  The International Criminal Court is similar in purpose to the World \nWar II tribunals that were convened after the end of that conflict. We \nknow of the Nuremberg trials and the trials related to the Japanese war \ncriminals. The International Criminal Court was created as a permanent \ntribunal of that kind. It is comparable to two tribunals that are \ncurrently in operation: The International Criminal Tribunal for Former \nYugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n  In both cases, those two bodies are moving forward to identify the \nindividuals who committed crimes against humanity, or war crimes, and \ntake action against them in an effort to establish an international \nnorm of behavior and make it possible to hold people accountable for \nhow they behaved in conflicts.\n  Currently, over 75 countries have ratified or otherwise accepted the \nstatute that created the International Criminal Court. That statute \nsaid when 60 countries had ratified, it would become effective. It is \neffective as of July 1. It is located in The Hague.\n  So with that background, let me outline why I am opposed to America's \nratification and support of the International Criminal Court as it \ncurrently stands. I will begin by saying why I am not taking this \nposition.\n  I am not taking this position because I believe America should not \nenter into international agreements. I know there are some who say we \nshould not have any international agreements at all. That position is \nfoolish, in my view. We have to enter into international agreements in \nthe world in which we now live. Indeed, one could argue it is to \nAmerica's benefit to do so.\n  There has been controversy, for example, about the World Trade \nOrganization, the WTO. I have constituents who complain about America \nmembership in the WTO saying it is terrible that we are under this \ninternational agreement. I tell them that the WTO was America's idea \nand that the WTO makes it possible for Americans to do business around \nthe world. If we did not have this kind of mechanism to sort through \nthe disagreements on trade issues, America would not be able to export, \nAmerica's economy would be damaged, and Americans would be put out of \nwork. It is a good thing for the United States to be part of the WTO. \nSo my opposition to the International Criminal Court is not because I \nam automatically opposed to international agreements.\n  Also, it is not because I want, as some European journalists suggest, \nAmerican dominance around the world; that America is so haughty and so \nproud that we cannot honor any kind of international law. I am enough \nof a student of history to know that any superpower that tries to \ndominate the world through their own power ultimately falls. The Romans \nfound they could not maintain a worldwide empire. The Ottomans found \nthey could not maintain the far-flung empire that existed all the way \nfrom Spain to the borders of India. More recently the British, with the \nviceroy in India and troops around the world, discovered they could not \ndo it either.\n  I do not think the International Criminal Court is a bad idea because \nI want America to take some kind of hyper-power position of dominance \naround the world. I think America's record throughout history is very \ngood on this issue. We should remember that Americans, when they win \nwars, do not occupy territory. When we won the Second World War, we not \nonly liberated the Dutch, the French, and the Belgians, we also \nliberated the Germans. They are freer today than they were under the \nNazis. They have more human rights and more individual property rights \nthan they ever had prior to the war.\n  America leaves behind, as we now are demonstrating in Afghanistan, a \nlegacy of freedom and food, and that legacy will continue. So the \nsuggestion that opposition to the International Criminal Court stems \nfrom some kind of empire impulse on the part of Americans is something \nI reject.\n  Finally, I do not reject the International Criminal Court because I \nwant Americans to dismiss the importance of international law. After \nall, the United Nations, which heavily influences the development of \ninternational law, was an American idea and is located on American soil \nand has been supported by American appropriations. Most United Nations \nfunctions around the world involve American troops. So I reject many of \nthe journalistic arguments that supposedly explain why I oppose \nthe International Criminal Court. I do not think they are appropriate.\n\n  So why do I object to the International Criminal Court? I need to go \nback a little bit in history, and I hope my colleagues will indulge me \nas I go into America's history to lay the predicate for the position I \nam taking. We in America adopted as our first state paper a document we \ncall the Declaration of Independence. It is perhaps the most important \nstate paper we have ever adopted.\n  In the Declaration of Independence, we lay down certain principles \nwhich the Continental Congress believed were beyond debate; that is, \nself-evident truths. One of these self-evident truths held that \nindividual rights do not come from government. The phrase in the \nDeclaration of Independence is ``endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights.'' The purpose of government is set forth in that \ndocument. The purpose of government is to secure these rights, deriving \nits just powers from the consent of the governed.\n  These are sacred words to Americans, and they come, as I say, from \nour first state document, and I believe still our most powerful.\n  The reason they are so sacred is because we are the only nation in \nthe world that is founded on an idea. Every other nation throughout the \nworld is founded on a tribe. People are bound together by a common \nethnic history. That may have been our beginning, but it is not the \nnation we now have.\n  If I may go back to an example very close to Utah and talk about the \nOlympics. If one watched the Olympics on television and saw the \nathletes coming from the various countries around the world, one can \nalmost always identify where the athlete is from by his or her name or \nthe ethnic look that he or she brings to the television. But that \ncannot be done with Americans. The American Olympians are named Kuan \nand Lapinski, Louganis and Blair, Jordan and Byrd. They are Black, they \nare White, they are Asian in ethnic background. They come from all over \nthe world.\n  In America, we do not have a common tribal base. All that holds us \ntogether as a nation is a dedication to the ideas set forth in the \nDeclaration of Independence, the ideas that our rights come from God \nand that the purpose of government is to secure those rights, not grant \nthem in the first place.\n  That is demonstrated by the fact that those of us in this Chamber, \nunlike any other parliamentarians or officeholders around the world, do \nnot take an oath to uphold and defend the country or the people. Our \noath is to uphold and defend the Constitution that was drafted to \nincorporate the core idea of this Nation. We have a sworn oath recorded \nin Heaven, to use Lincoln's phrase, to uphold and defend the \nConstitution against all enemies. So we have a unique attitude about \nrights, about law, and about our responsibilities to a document and an \nidea that undergirds that document.\n  Let me speak a little more American history, and any of our European \nfriends who might ultimately read this speech might, I would hope, find \nthis somewhat interesting. I think there is something of a parallel \nbetween the adoption of the Constitution and the discussions that are \ngoing on around the world right now.\n  The 13 States that made up the United States of America in the first \nplace were united against a common\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\nenemy during the Revolutionary War. But when the war was over, they \nbegan to quarrel among themselves. They each printed their own money. \nThere were tariff barriers between States. There were all kinds of \narguments about what law would apply from one State to the other, \nsomewhat like the confusion that goes on around the world today.\n  The decision was made to try to find a way to impose a single rule of \nlaw across all 13 of these States. That is what produced the \nConstitutional Convention. When the Constitution was written and then \nsubmitted to the 13 States for ratification, it said, much like the \nunderlying statute of the International Criminal Court, that it would \ntake effect as soon as three-fourths of the States had ratified it. It \ndid not require unanimous ratification but said that as soon as three-\nfourths of these States have ratified it, it will take hold and it will \napply to all. Now, in the practical world of that time, one State could \nprevent it from taking hold because if that one State, which was so \nmuch more powerful than the others, had not ratified it, the whole \nthing would have fallen apart. That was the State of Virginia. Another \nState arguably in that same position would be the State of New York. If \nVirginia and New York had not ratified, the other 11 could have, and we \nstill would not have had a workable document.\n\n  This, if I may be so bold, is somewhat similar to the situation that \npeople are raising with respect to the International Criminal Court. \nThey say 75 nations may ratify it but if the United States doesn't, it \nwill not work. And the United States is outside.\n  Back to our own history for a moment. Virginia was outside. Virginia \nwas not the first State to ratify, Delaware was, followed by \nPennsylvania, followed by Georgia, and so on. But Virginia was holding \nout. One of the reasons Virginia was holding out was that the man who \nwas arguably the second most powerful politician in Virginia--the No. 1 \npolitician in Virginia was, of course, George Washington--and the \nsecond most powerful politician in Virginia, Patrick Henry, multiple \ntimes Governor of Virginia, was unalterably opposed to the \nConstitution. He led the fight against ratification in Virginia on this \nground: He said there is no bill of rights in this Constitution. The \nrights that it seeks to protect for us Americans are not specified. I \nam not sure that he used the term ``vague'' but he could have because \nthe Constitution, as originally drafted, was very vague about which \nrights would be preserved.\n  Now, the leading politician in Virginia seeking ratification, James \nMadison, and Alexander Hamilton, who did get it ratified in New York, \nargued with Patrick Henry. Madison and Hamilton said to Patrick Henry: \nYou don't want these rights laid out specifically in this Constitution; \nyou want to leave it vague. If you enumerate them specifically, you \nwill inevitably forget something, and then by not listing that which \nyou forget, you will put that right in peril.\n  Everybody understands, Madison and Hamilton said, that all of the \nrights we have are protected by the Constitution as it exists, and to \nspecify them will limit them. You are making a mistake if you demand \nspecificity.\n  Patrick Henry was having none of that. Patrick Henry stood firm and \ndemanded the defeat of the ratification resolution in the Virginia \nLegislature. However, he ultimately gave way to the predominant rule of \npolitics in America in the 18th century which is: Anybody who opposes \nGeorge Washington loses. George Washington, as the president of the \nconstitutional conference, had enough prestige that the Constitution \nwas, indeed, ratified in Virginia but with this political \nunderstanding: James Madison said, if you ratify the Constitution, I \nwill run for Congress. I will go into the House of Representatives--\nwhich he assumed would be the dominant body of the new government--and \nI will propose a bill of rights. That promise took enough sting out of \nPatrick Henry's argument that Patrick Henry lost the fight and Virginia \nratified and the Constitution was adopted and we had the new nation.\n  True to his political promise, Madison went to the House of \nRepresentatives, and offered 12 articles of amendment to the \nConstitution, 11 of which were adopted. The first 10 we now revere as \nthe Bill of Rights. We can now, looking back after two centuries, \nrealize that Patrick Henry was right, that the Bill of Rights is as \nmuch a revered part of the idea that holds this country together as \nanything else that is written in the Declaration of Independence or the \nrest of the Constitution itself. We hold commemorative ceremonies \nhonoring the adoption of the Bill of Rights.\n\n  Now, what does this have to do with the International Criminal Court? \nAt the risk of being overly egotistical, let me try to play Patrick \nHenry. The International Criminal Court is based on a statute that is \nvague, so vague that I believe my constitutional rights, those for \nwhich Henry, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington and all the rest of them \nfought, are in peril. When I say that to my European friends, quite \nfrankly, they laugh. Or they say to me, reminiscent of Madison's \nargument to Hamilton, no, no, no. You misunderstand. The International \nCriminal Court is not going to threaten your constitutional rights in \nany way. It is designed to go after the bad guys. It is designed with \nthe same intent as the tribunal for Yugoslavia or the tribunal for \nRwanda. It is designed to make sure that we have a permanent tribunal \nin place.\n  My reaction to the assurances that my rights will never be attacked \nis, I think, in concert with Patrick Henry's reaction to the assurances \nthat he was given by Madison and Hamilton. My concerns are reinforced \nby some of the things I have heard. For example, I have been told there \nare groups that want to bring suit in the International Criminal Court \nagainst President Bush, charging him with a crime against humanity for \nhis failure to send the Kyoto treaty to the Senate for ratification, \nthat his opposition to the Kyoto treaty constitutes such a gross \nviolation of the opportunities around the world that it is a crime \nagainst humanity.\n  I have inquired whether or not such an action could come before the \nInternational Criminal Court and have gone through it with legal \nscholars. The answer is, yes, such an action could come before the \nCourt, but, of course, it would be laughed out by the prosecutor and \nthe President would never have to go to trial. That does not give me a \nlot of reassurance, that the case could be brought--but of course the \nPresident would not be found guilty.\n  How can we know, 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, that some \nfuture President would be found guilty for making a policy decision \nthat he or she decided was in the best interest of the United States \nbut that the International Criminal Court decided was not in the best \ninterest of the rest of the world, and so it would be defined as a \ncrime against humanity? And given the vague nature of the statute of \nthe International Criminal Court, that is a very real possibility.\n  Let me give another possibility that comes very much to home. There \nare those around the world who are insisting that the United States \npick a numerical target for foreign aid; that is, we pick a number \nwhich would be a percentage of GDP. And they are saying in their \nrhetoric that the United States is not meeting its responsibility to \nthe underdeveloped world until it meets this arbitrary percentage of \nGDP in adopting foreign aid.\n  I am a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, the subcommittee that determines how much \nforeign aid we appropriate. Under the language of the International \nCriminal Court, am I liable for my actions as a Member of the \nSenate? The language is very specific. Being a member of the parliament \ndoes not exempt one from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal \nCourt.\n\n  Suppose someone decides that the U.S. failure to meet that artificial \nnumber constitutes a crime against humanity and that if we do not raise \nour foreign aid to that number, all of those who are legislators, most \nspecifically those who are appropriators, can be hauled before the \nInternational Criminal Court and prosecuted for our failure to adopt \nthat kind of appropriation.\n  I do not want to run the risk. When I raise it, once again, with \nthose who are in favor of the International Criminal Court, they laugh \nit off and say\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nthat is not why it was designed, that is not what it will look at, no, \nthat kind of prosecution will never be brought.\n  Then when I raise the question: But could it be brought under the \nlanguage of the statute as it currently exists? They say, Well, yes, it \ncould be. But you know the prosecutor would never go forward with such \na case.\n  Again, at the risk of being immodest, I want to be Patrick Henry on \nthis issue. I want to say we will not proceed--I will not proceed; \nagain, I will not speak for my colleagues--I will not proceed to vote \nto ratify a treaty on the International Criminal Court until I am \nsatisfied that the language is so absolute that I will not lose any \nrights I currently have under the U.S. Constitution.\n  I say to those who say: no, no, this is only going to deal with \npeople like Milosevic. We are never going to see this sort of frivolous \nactivity, and the United States should understand that you have no need \nto worry whatsoever about this international tribunal. Indeed, the \nUnited States helped create safeguards that are already in the \nInternational Criminal Court that say if the United States proceeds to \nprosecute someone who is accused of a war crime, the International \nCriminal Court will lose its jurisdiction. In other words, if an \nAmerican serviceman is accused of a war crime, as happened in Vietnam \nin the village of Mi Lai, and the United States prosecuted that \nserviceman, as we did under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, then \nthe ICC has no jurisdiction and backs away. So you, who have a great \ntrack record of prosecuting war crimes among your own servicemen, need \nhave no worry whatsoever of this international tribunal.\n  We have two precedents that are now before us that have just come up \nin the last few months, and I find them disturbing in the face of all \nof these reassurances. The first one has been written about rather \nextensively in the Washington Post and the New York Times. It involves \na Washington Post reporter who has been subpoenaed. He happens to live \nin Paris right now. He has been summoned by the tribunal dealing with \nYugoslavia to come in and testify. And he said: I don't want to come in \nand testify. It would have a chilling effect on reporters covering the \nwar if we thought the things we wrote about the war would be subject to \nthe jurisdiction of a war crimes tribunal afterwards.\n  The Washington Post has taken the position that the reporter is \nexactly right. It has been written up in the New York Times also, \nsympathetically.\n  The reporter's name is Jonathan C. Randal. He is retired from the \nPost. As I say, he now lives in Paris. The Yugoslavia tribunal has \nsaid: You do not have the right to refuse. We are going to require you \nto come. And he can be arrested by the police in Paris, handed over to \nthe tribunal by the police in France, and he loses his American \nconstitutional rights because the statute creating that tribunal is \nvague on the area of his rights.\n\n  There is another incident that has just come up. The same tribunal, \nwhich we are told is a precedent for the International Criminal Court, \nhas been asked to indict William Jefferson Clinton and his National \nSecurity Adviser, Anthony Lake; and the then-Deputy National Security \nAdviser, Samuel Berger; and Ambassador Richard Holbrooke; and the U.S. \nAmbassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, all of whom are being accused \nof complicity in war crimes conducted by a Croatian general who was \nacting within the framework of American foreign policy at the time.\n  Here is a case where a President and his advisers make a decision in \nthe best interests of the United States. The President and his advisers \nare now being investigated to see whether or not they should be called \nbefore the tribunal.\n  The specter of an American President called before an international \ntribunal for actions as straightforward as President Clinton's actions \nwere in this circumstance is a specter I do not want to see repeated \nbefore the International Criminal Court. I do not want any future \nAmerican President to believe that he or she is in danger of being \nnamed as an accomplice in some act of some other individual. We do not \nknow whether or not the International Criminal Court could do that \nunder its present statute. It is so vague that it cannot answer that \nquestion. In other words, under the present circumstance, it is not \njust an American citizen such as the reporter from the Washington Post \nwho might be called in, it is not just a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee who might be called in, there is a precedent being \nestablished that the President of the United States might be called in \nto answer in this international forum for actions he or she took in the \nbest interests of the United States as those interests were defined at \nthe time.\n  So I come back to my reasons for not wanting to ratify the treaty \ncreating the International Criminal Court. I understand that as he \nsigned it, President Clinton himself said this treaty is not ready for \nratification. President Bush took our signature off it in order to make \nit clear to the world that it was not ready for ratification. I applaud \nthat position--both President Clinton's position that it is not ready \nto be ratified and President Bush's decision to remove all doubt as to \nAmerica's position on this point.\n  But I do want to make it clear, as I tried to do at the beginning, \nthat I am not opposed to the idea of creating some kind of tribunal \nthat can deal with these heinous crimes we see around us in this world \nthat is still not rid of the horrific activities that are called war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity. I am not opposed to America being \nsubject to the rule of international law in an area where America's \ntrack record of behavior is so good that I am sure America could handle \nthis without any difficulty. My problem is the vagueness. My problem is \nthe possibility that the International Criminal Court will go far \nbeyond what we think of as war crimes and will invent new ones, like \nthe ones I have described here. My problem is that we do not have a \nclear outline of rights that will be protected in this Court.\n  Just as Patrick Henry stood and said, do not ratify the Constitution \nof the United States until there is a clear bill of rights written into \nit, and held that position to the point that James Madison finally gave \nin and gave us the Bill of Rights, I think American legislators should \nstand and say: Do not ratify the International Criminal Court until \nthere is a bill of rights, until we know exactly that the rights we \nhave under the Constitution, that the Declaration of Independence \ndeclares as being ours by God-given sanction, are protected, that \nAmericans will not be called before this Court in a way that would put \nus in jeopardy of those rights. That is my bottom line with respect to \nthe International Criminal Court.\n  I believe the United States should stay engaged and involved in \ndiscussions about it. I don't think we should turn our backs and walk \naway and say we will never have anything to do with it or be involved \nin it. I think by virtue of its observer status, which it still has \nwith respect to the International Criminal Court, the United States \nshould continue to talk to the other countries in the world about this.\n  But the bottom line should be that when the United States finally \ndoes decide to ratify the International Criminal Court, it will be in a \nregime where no American citizen will lose any of the rights that are \ncurrently guaranteed to him or her under the American Constitution.\n  I believe it can be done. I encourage everyone around the world to \nfocus on that and not say we don't need to talk about that, that this \nis just for the bad guys, but recognize that if you are building an \ninstitution that is going to last for 50, or 100, or 200 years, as our \nConstitution has, you must be as careful in creating it as the Founders \nwere in creating our Constitution in the first place.\n  We are the freest nation in the world. We would like the rest of the \nworld to have the same benefits as we do. Let us be very careful as we \ncreate an international judicial body to make sure that it maintains \nthat high standard of freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7847-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7847-S7849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRADE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today, sadly, to express my \nsincere disappointment with the passage of the Trade Act conference \nreport.\n  It is deeply troubling to me. I will go through a number of the \nreasons I have\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\nthese feelings and why I think they need to be expressed in an explicit \nnature.\n  I come from a business background, as many know. While I was a very \nsympathetic and active promoter of the passage of NAFTA early in the \nnineties, I believe in the principle of comparative advantage and \nunderstand that it can work to maintain competition in prices for many \ngoods and services broadly throughout our society, and in certain \nsectors of our economy it certainly can promote job growth.\n  But on balance, when we look at the nature of a lot of the elements \nthat are a part of this so-called fast-track trade promotion authority \ngiven today, I think the costs and the benefits don't align themselves \nwell at all. I feel particularly troubled by the dilution of many of \nthe elements that were in the Senate bill that went to conference that \nreally left us in an even weaker position with respect to where we \nstand in protecting workers' environmental rights and the ability of \nAmerica to represents its own interests in negotiations.\n  There are also some fine-print issues that I am very concerned \nabout--the potential for degradation of our antitrust laws and the \nability for American law to be represented on a coequal basis with what \nwe see as potentially being dictated by trade laws as we go forward. I \nwill try to itemize some of those.\n  Again, I understand there is a strong theoretical case for \ncomparative advantage. But I think when you put it in the specific \ncontext with the fine print of the details we are talking about with \nregard to this trade law, this is a very troubling piece of \nlegislation. And I hope it is one that I am wrong about and that we \nwill not come to regret over a period of time.\n  Let me start with the reality that anytime something passes, there \nwill be shifts in economic fortunes for sectors of the economy. One of \nthe reasons we fought so hard for trade adjustment authority in the \npackage in the Senate--and that many of us believed we made a little \nprogress thereon--was health care benefits and employment insurance. \nSome of those stayed. But, in fact, I think we undermined very \nseriously the conference report benefits that we were applying in \nhealth insurance versus the simple elementary move from a 75-percent to \na 5-percent tax credit. We undermined the definition of the pool in \nwhich workers would be available.\n  While we have the language that we are aiding those who lose their \njobs as a result of trade activities and shifts in production offshore, \nwhen you look at the details, it will be very hard for those to be \napplicable, and in the practical context of people's lives it is really \na false presentation.\n  By the way, there are no standards with regard to the health benefits \npeople will get. There is no premium protection for individuals. The \ndetails just do not match the rhetoric with regard to the hope that I \nthink we promised.\n  There is also talk that coverage is going to be broad. But when you \nlook at the fine print, the fact is that the element of production \nshifts doesn't include some of the biggest marketplaces--places where \nproduction is likely to shift because of the applicability of the law \nas it stands.\n  For instance, in fact, Brazil and China and Southeast Asia are \ngenerally left uncovered. If a factory moves out of the State of \nWashington or the State of New Jersey and moves to those countries, \nthey are excluded from some of the definitions of how a shift in \nproduction would apply and whether there is a need for trade \nassistance.\n  While countries such as Jordan, Israel, and the Caribbean Basin, and \nthe Indian region are included in those definitions, they make up about \n5 percent of the American trade, and large blocks of that are in places \nleft out of the shift in coverage for production. I think it is a real \nproblem. It is a real problem with the reality of matching the \nlanguage.\n  We talk, particularly in the Senate bill, about substantial resources \nfor workers who lose their jobs. The conference committee report came \nback $30 million below CBO's estimate and $80 million below what the \nSenate bill authorized--already a skinny number and one that I think \nmakes the hope of real job retraining something that is a false hope \nfor a lot of folks when you translate it into the reality of how it \nwill work.\n  Continuing. Labor and environmental standards: We all fought for the \nJordanian standard, the agreement that was negotiated on a specific \ntrade agreement. It was to make sure that those standards were met in \nall future trade agreements.\n  When the conference agreement came back, we found that it allows for \nthe preservation of status quo elements with regard to basic \nprotections for children under 14. That means in Burma, if they are \ntruly practicing slave labor, they can maintain the status quo in any \nkind of trade negotiations. It denies the basic rights of workers to \noperate with collective bargaining in countries where they don't \nalready have it. There is no change for those countries to which we \nmight want to apply those standards. That is really a quite serious \nbacking away from the standards that were included in the Jordanian \nagreement which I think most people would embrace. And they would have \nmade for a very serious, positive step forward in our trade \nnegotiations. This is a very serious backing away that I think really \ndoes undermine the labor standards.\n  I will not go into details, but there are some provisions that we \nhave backed away from on environmental standards. We have, basically, a \nstatus quo standard for anyone who enters into these negotiations. That \nis a difficult way to approach fair trade, as well as free trade, if \nyou are looking for those kinds of elements in a legitimate movement \nforward in our trade relationships.\n  With regard to the role of Congress, there was debate on the floor \nabout Dayton-Craig, which we adopted, which had to do with having a \nreal challenge to trade remedies in these packages. We pulled back, and \nwe now have a sense of the Congress. I do not think anybody believes \nthat is going to seriously impact how this process is going to go \nforward. It may sound good for press releases and sound bites, that we \nare really being involved in the process, but I do not think it deals \nwith the facts as we see them. I think it is a serious problem.\n  There is another element that I also think is truly important with \nregard to fast track and an element with regard to the role of \nCongress. The conference agreement adds a completely new restriction \nthat was not in the House bill or the Senate bill, and that would \nprovide that there is only one privileged resolution per negotiation on \nany given trade treaty--one.\n  We had no restrictions on those in other situations. We could now see \na real weakening of the ability of Congress to have a legitimate role \nin debate with regard to the elements of trade negotiating.\n  Finally, on this particular piece, one element that troubles me the \nmost is that in many ways we have changed the language, where we are \ngoing to provide greater rights for foreign investors than are \navailable to U.S. investors under U.S. law. And that is because we just \nchanged a word in the language to say: Foreign investors should not be \naccorded greater substantive rights than U.S. investors. The only thing \nnew is that we put in the word ``substantive.'' And ``substantive'' \nleaves it open to trade negotiators to decide what rights are equal or \nunequal.\n  By the time we get done applying that, we could very well see \nsubstantially different treatment for foreign investors than we would \nsee for U.S. investors. I think it is a definite weakening of what is \nappropriate as we go through the application of these trade laws and \nneeds to be watched very carefully. I suspect it will lead to an \nenormous amount of litigation as time goes forward. But a lot of the \ndecisions with regard to that will be taking place behind closed doors \nand by trade negotiators and trade adjustment bodies. So there are a \nnumber of issues that concern me.\n\n  There are a couple of other issues I want to cite before I yield the \nfloor because I think they are also important.\n  It seems to me, in line with what I was talking about before, we have \nput ourselves into a position where foreign investors might very well \nhave their international disputes resolved by trade negotiators as \nopposed to courts.\n  Let me just remind people that when we were debating this on the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nfloor, we used the example of a Canadian company that sued the State of \nCalifornia with regard to the use of MTBE. The elected representatives \nof the people of California determined that MTBE was not such a good \nthing for their health and environmental quality of life. We have that \nsame proposition in New Jersey.\n  But the judgment of one of these international trade bodies could \noverrule that decision made by the people, in legislation that was \nproperly passed, if the language is used that we talked about, that \nsubstantive quality principle that was mentioned. I think this is \ndangerous as we go forward, and it truly concerns me.\n  Mostly, I am concerned that the principle of privatization may very \nwell be subject to rulings from trade bodies making a decision about \nwhether something is appropriate or not, whether privatization is a \nrestraint of trade or not. We had a very close vote with regard to the \nsubject in the Senate, but I think, very possibly, you could see many \nservices that are provided by State and local governments, and even \nSocial Security by the Federal Government, being argued that it is a \nrestraint of or a break in our trade agreements, restricting the \nability of the foreign company to come in and provide those services on \na private basis. This has been certainly challenged in other countries, \nand I am very fearful that we have set up a regimen that allows those \nkinds of processes to happen.\n  Finally, there is an area that also is quite concerning to me, and \nthat deals with some of what I am concerned about with regard to civil \nliberties. I am pleased that included in the conference report was the \nSenate provision I authored with regard to the Customs inspection of \nmail, to make sure you have to get search warrants to look at small \nletter carrier mail.\n  But I am very concerned that the conference report includes a \npotentially egregious violation of civil liberties, in my view, and an \nexpansion which is based on the expansion immunity for Customs \nofficials. Quite simply, there is a blank check for Customs officers to \nengage in illegal behavior, particularly and including racial \nprofiling.\n  I think the Presiding Officer knows I have long been an outspoken \nopponent of racial profiling. I introduced legislation with Senators \nFeingold and Clinton and Representative Conyers in the House, the End \nRacial Profiling Act, which really does work against the kind of action \nI think we have seen documented with the Customs Service in previous \nmeasures. I think that needs to be addressed.\n  The President and the Attorney General have recognized that racial \nprofiling is wrong and must be ended. The President acknowledged that \nin his very first State of the Union speech. I think we are taking a \nstep backwards by providing these immunity provisions on profiling for \nCustoms officials that are included in this legislation.\n  Current law provides qualified immunity to Customs agents which is \nbased on the assessment of what a reasonable officer should have done \nin any given situation. This means that the Customs agent is entitled \nto immunity from suits if they conduct an unconstitutional search based \non a reasonable but mistaken conclusion that reasonable suspicion \nexists. This legislation expands that protection and establishes a new \nkind of immunity called good faith immunity.\n  Essentially, a victim of an unconstitutional search would not be \nentitled to relief unless the officer acted in bad faith, a nearly \nimpossible standard to meet. So I think it is a significant weakening \nof the protections in our current law, and I find it dangerous.\n  In March 2000, the GAO had a report that found that African-American \nwomen were nearly nine times more likely to be subjected to x rays and \ncustoms searches than White women, and they were less than half as \nlikely to be found carrying any kind of contraband: The whole point of \nwhy racial profiling is not only morally wrong, it is bad law \nenforcement, and doesn't lead to better results.\n  In fact, under the stewardship of Commissioner Ray Kelly of the \nCustoms Service, they implemented significant changes in policies to \nstop the racial profiling that was occurring. I think we are taking a \nstep backward here. It is just another one of the fine details that one \nsees in this conference report that make this not even ideal but, I \nbelieve, bad legislation.\n  For a whole host of reasons--the dilution of our trade adjustment \nauthority; the issues with respect to the role of Congress, the role we \nrightfully should be playing in this process; the role of foreign \ninvestors in America and their ability to use trade agreements to \nsupersede U.S. law; some of the civil liberties issues I pointed out \nand my concern about the use of the new trade laws to undermine public \nresponsibility roles; the challenge to privatization that is a \nlegitimate question that our elected officials should decide, not trade \nnegotiators--I am led to the conclusion that we have the potential for \nwhat could be a very seriously flawed piece of legislation.\n  I voted against it in the Senate, and I am even more strongly opposed \nto the conference report. I hope I am wrong and the majority in the \nSenate are correct. But there are grave dangers embedded in this. We \nwill need to monitor very carefully the application of this trade law \nas we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7849-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7849-S7851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GRAHAM-SMITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPROMISE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, yesterday, July 31, the Senate voted not \nto waive the Budget Act to allow consideration of the Graham-Smith \nprescription drug compromise. This legislation was estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office to cost $390 billion over the 10-year \nperiod, a cost which turned out to be within a few percentage points of \nthe legislation offered by the Republicans. Although unscored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the sponsors of the Republican legislation \nestimated that their cost was in the range of $370 billion.\n  However, in spite of the fact that both the Democratic and the \nRepublican plans were above $300 billion, which had been provided in \nthe 2001 Budget Act, almost 18 months out of date, in spite of that \nfact, we could not get the 60 votes to waive the Budget Act and allow \nconsideration of the substance of the proposal to provide a critical \nadditional health care benefit for America's older citizens.\n  Had we gotten to the proposal, what would the Graham-Smith compromise \nhave provided? It would have provided full coverage to the 47 percent \nof America's seniors whose incomes were below 200 percent of poverty, \napproximately $17,700 for a single person. It would have provided a \nmechanism for significant discounts, in the range of 15 to 25 percent, \nas well as a Federal subsidy on top of those discounts for all \nAmericans. For all Americans, it would have also provided insurance \nagainst catastrophic costs, costs beyond $3,300 of payments made by the \nbeneficiary.\n  Think of this: Had we been able to get to the substance of our \namendment, Americans could have had the opportunity of purchasing an \ninsurance policy for $25 a year that would have given them the peace of \nmind they would not be crippled, potentially financially devastated, by \nthe consequences of a major health emergency, such as a heart attack or \nbeing determined to have a chronic disease such as diabetes. All \nseniors who fell into that category would have had all of their \nprescription drug costs above $3,300 per year paid with only a modest \n$10-per-prescription copayment.\n  This compromise would have afforded very real protection and \nassistance to all Medicare beneficiaries at a cost which both \nRepublicans and Democrats had deemed to be reasonable.\n  One of the fundamental reasons this failed yesterday and I appear \ntoday is because at the last minute--I correct that to say, within the \nlast hour before the vote was taken, the information on this chart was \ndragged from some source and reproduced on a floor chart used by one of \nmy colleagues and in handouts which were circulated in the Chamber, \nwhich purported to show that the effect of adopting our amendment would \nbe to impose massive new costs on the States.\n  It was stated that the first-year cost would be over $5 billion, and \nthe 10-year cost would be $70 billion.\n  Madam President, I accept the fact that we have rules in the Senate \nand\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nthat one of those rules requires that to waive the Budget Act, you have \nto have 60 votes. But what I cannot accept is the method that some of \nour opponents used to defeat our plan.\n  There is an old adage: Everyone is entitled to their opinion; no one \nis entitled to their own facts.\n  It is impossible to have an honest debate without everyone using the \nsame factual basis as the premise for their arguments and opinions. We \ncan't pass legislation in 1 week to make businesses adopt honest \naccounting practices and standards and then not apply honest accounting \nstandards to ourselves. Using only partial information that \nintentionally misleads U.S. Senators--in this case, misleading them to \nthe wrong conclusion--is demeaning to this, the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.\n  Several of our colleagues used a chart which misled other Senators \ninto believing that the Graham-Smith amendment imposed these massive \nunfunded mandates. In the words of one of our colleagues: ``$70 billion \non the States.''\n  This is simply untrue. It is, in my opinion, an intentional \nmisrepresentation of the facts.\n  The floor chart used yesterday, as well as the paper distributed on \nthe Senate floor, contained no source as to where the data was \nanalyzed, or who among our colleagues would assume responsibility for \ndistributing this information. No one--in violation of the spirit of \nthe Senate rules--would accept personal responsibility for these \ndistortions.\n  What happened yesterday was Enron accounting come to the Senate \nChamber. It makes a point based on an inaccurate representation of the \nfacts. It seems to me that if we are going to require companies to be \nmore accountable, require their chief executives to sign the financial \nstatements before they are released to the public, we should require \nthe same of ourselves in the Senate.\n  In addition to distributing this distorted information, there were \nalso statements made as to the motivation of the sponsors of this \namendment. I will quote a statement made by one of our opponents who \nstated that:\n  The sponsors chose to spring the text of this amendment on the Senate \nyesterday for the first time. Perhaps they thought they could slip in \nsomething new that we would not catch. Well, we caught it, and you know \nwe have caught it by the speeches of the Senator from Maine. We \nactually have had a chance, and we have studied the Graham amendment. \nThe Graham amendment imposes a massive new burden on States just when \nState treasuries are in terrible shape.\n  We have been accused of bad faith in offering this amendment, \nsurreptitiously attempting to commit the States to a massive new \nunfunded commitment. That is not true. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office is the basis of the analysis that we have done. It was \nthe basis of the support that was sought and gathered for the Graham-\nSmith amendment. None of its supporters, intentionally or otherwise, \nwould have allowed a provision to be included that increased State \ncosts.\n  On the other hand, we have an analysis that was developed by an \nunknown source, distributed by unknown persons to the Senate floor.\n  The basis of our estimate is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, a set of experts with no political stake in this debate. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the Graham-Smith amendment \nwould not increase State spending.\n  Let's look at an analysis upon which the Congressional Budget Office \npredicated that statement, realities which the Republican analysis \ntotally ignores: States would receive considerable relief from the \ncreation of this new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Let me explain why. Under current law, States are required to provide \ndrug benefits to those eligible for Supplemental Security Income, SSI--\ngenerally, those below 75 percent of poverty--and others fully eligible \nfor Medicaid.\n  In addition, some States have elected to go up to 100 percent of \npoverty. Those seniors' drug costs are now paid by the States at their \nregular Medicaid matching rate. Therefore, States are paying for part \nof total drug costs for these seniors, and the Federal Government is \npaying for part.\n  Under our proposal, the Federal Government would assume 100 percent \nof the cost above $3,300 incurred by each senior currently covered by \nthe Federal-State match.\n  In addition, the Federal Government would be solely responsible for 5 \npercent of the costs incurred by each senior currently covered by the \nFederal-State match; that is, 95 percent of the costs below the stop \nloss would continue to be shared between the State and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  However, all the costs above $3,300 would be assumed by the Federal \nGovernment. Additionally, the Federal Government will pay for 100 \npercent of 5 percent of the drug costs.\n  The 100-percent Federal assumption of costs that are currently shared \nbetween the Federal and State governments would result in substantial \nsavings to the States. None of these savings are included in this \nanalysis.\n  Just yesterday, the administration approved a Medicaid waiver for the \nStates of Maryland and Florida. This waiver will allow those States to \nextend coverage for prescription drug costs to their citizens between \n175 percent and 200 percent of poverty, respectfully, at the regular \nMedicaid matching rate.\n  These States, plus others with similar waivers, would receive \nsignificant relief from having both a Medicare drug benefit and a \nhigher Federal matching rate--including 100 percent matching rate for \ncosts of those with incomes between 150 and 200 percent of poverty. \nNone of these savings are included in the analysis presented by my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  The Graham-Smith amendment does not include a ``maintenance of \neffort'' provision on current State spending on these programs.\n  According to the National Council of State Legislators, 31 States \nalready provide pharmacy assistance programs and Medicaid drug waiver \nprograms to seniors above 100 percent of poverty. Three more are \nauthorized to do so, but have not yet implemented their authorization. \nAll of these States would receive significant relief under my proposal. \nYet, none of these savings are included in the analysis presented by my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, states are currently \nspending roughly $95 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries through the Medicaid program. A significant portion of \nthis amount would be assumed by the Federal Government under the \nGraham-Smith compromise amendment, resulting in savings to the States.\n  The floor chart used by my colleagues showing $70 billion of new \nexpenses was incomplete. I don't know if the $70 billion figure is \naccurate, but I do know that the State savings achieved by the Federal \nassumption of costs currently borne by the states is not reflected on \nthat chart.\n  So what we have is an analysis that only stated what the new cost to \nthe States would be as a result of this program and failed to include \nthe new savings to the States as a result of this program.\n  Even the most junior budget analyst would not make the mistake of \nforgetting that States will save dollars as a result of the Graham-\nSmith amendment from the Federal assumption of many costs.\n  This is more than an oversight; it is a deliberate omission \nintended--unfortunately, in some instances it apparently had this \neffect--to scare off potential supporters of a responsible prescription \ndrug benefit for older Americans.\n  This analysis is but one of several politically motivated analyses \nwhich have come out of the White House that conveniently support their \npolicy positions.\n  Let me just review a few of those positions. On July 18, 2002, the \nOffice of Management and Budget wrote:\n  However, the administration opposes S. 812, [the underlying generic \ndrug bill that the Senate, by an overwhelming majority, passed \nyesterday] in its current form because it will not provide lower drug \nprices.\n  No analysis by the Office of the Actuary supports that claim, and the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated that the bill will save $60 \nbillion to American prescription drug consumers over the next 10 years.\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\n  The Senate, by its overwhelming vote, obviously decided with the \nCongressional Budget Office and not with the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Second, the White House produced an analysis claiming that the \noriginal Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill would ``bankrupt'' the Medicare \ntrust fund--when this drug benefit, like the drug benefits in the \nRepublican plan, is funded through a distinct fund that has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with Medicare's Part A.\n  Third, just this month, OMB made its midsession review look \nsubstantially more rosy by including only $190 billion for prescription \ndrugs, despite the fact that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, former Gov. Tommy Thompson, stated before Congress in April:\n  Congress has seen fit to raise the funding for prescription drugs to \n$350 billion, and I came here today to indicate to you that the \nadministration wants to work with that latter number.\n  This administration has not demonstrated in actions or words that it \nprioritizes State fiscal relief. As such, its concern for States, as \nexpressed on this distorted chart, is a new revelation, only emerging \nwhen it is seeking an excuse to oppose an amendment to provide \nsignificant prescription drug assistance to America's seniors.\n  Less than a week ago the Administrator of Medicare, Mr. Tom Scully, \nstated the administration opposed increasing the Medicaid matching rate \neven temporarily, an amendment which has been aggressively sought by \nthe States in order to receive some relief from rapidly escalating \nMedicaid costs. The administration opposed that amendment. The Senate, \nby an overwhelming vote last week, adopted it.\n  I might say that during the consideration of the tax bill, I was \nconcerned that the proposal of the White House was to accelerate the \nrepeal of the State's portion of the estate tax at a substantially \nfaster rate than the repeal of the Federal estate tax. In fact, the \nState's portion of the estate tax will evaporate in approximately 3 to \n4 years, while the Federal Government's share of the estate tax \ncontinues until the year 2010.\n  The effect of that early acceleration of the repeal of the State \ncomponent of the estate tax will have a significant adverse financial \neffect on the States beginning this fiscal year.\n  The 47 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 200 \npercent of poverty would have gained comprehensive drug coverage had \nthe Graham-Smith amendment been adopted. Seniors in all States would \nhave been helped. Seniors in all States would have been given the peace \nof mind that if they suffered a debilitating illness or disease or \naccident that they would have been helped with their catastrophic drug \ncosts, and the States would have been helped by getting relief through \nthe Federal assumption of costs that they are currently bearing.\n  I conclude by saying that I hope in future debates on the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that we will all rely on the facts, not on \nincomplete and distorted analysis. Our seniors deserve better than what \nwe have done to date, because what we have done is talk about, talk \nabout, talk about, the need for a prescription drug benefit. We have \nnot yet delivered, delivered, delivered a responsible prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  It is going to be our challenge over the next few weeks, working with \nthe facts and with honest analysis of those facts, to arrive at a \nprescription drug plan that will meet the needs of our seniors, will \nprovide us with the basis of integrating a prescription drug benefit \ninto a comprehensive health care program for older Americans, and to \nfind the political will to act this year.\n  That will be our challenge and that quest will be advanced if we all \nagree that we are going to differ in our opinions, yes, but that we \nwill all agree that we would use the same set of legitimate facts.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to speak on a matter \nof great importance to this country, keeping the soundness of Social \nSecurity--and I say to my colleague from Florida how much I appreciate \nthe great leadership that he has given to the Nation in the last \nseveral weeks as he has led the effort to try to honor the senior \ncitizens of this country with a prescription drug benefit that would \nmodernize Medicare to provide for what senior citizens ought to have in \nthe year 2002.\n  It has been my privilege and pleasure to support him in his efforts. \nIt is beyond me why we could not get the 60 votes. Some of the \nmisinformation that was distributed, as the senior Senator from Florida \nhas explained, is part of the reason. Part of the reason I happen to \nthink has something to do with partisan politics as well, \nunfortunately, during an election year.\n  I want him to know my profound appreciation for him as a colleague, \nas a friend, and as a leader for this Nation in offering a needed \nchange to Medicare for a prescription drug benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7851-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7851-S7852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOUNDNESS OF SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, tonight I want to discuss \nanother subject which is near and dear to our hearts, particularly the \ntwo of us coming from Florida, on the attempts to privatize Social \nSecurity. In fact, it even comes down to the fact that in the State of \nFlorida, the pension program for Florida retirees was changed within \nthe last 2 years by the legislature of Florida to basically allow a \nprivatized element, other than a defined benefit element for all \nFlorida's 600,000 retirees.\n  It sounded awfully good while the stock market was doing so well, but \nnow in the last few months, the stock market has not been doing well. \nLo and behold, would you believe that out of 600,000 retirees in \nFlorida on the Florida retirement system, the State pension, only 3,000 \nretirees out of 600,000 have signed up for the privatized retirement \nplan. That should give us a clue as to why we should not be privatizing \nSocial Security.\n  I do not want to hold my colleague on the floor, but before he left \nthe floor, I wanted to share that with him as I get into my comments on \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. With pleasure.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Florida retirement plan, prior to its modification, \nwas in what would be called a defined benefit plan that gave security \nassurance to Florida's retirees as to what they would have in \nretirement, what they could count on, what they could sleep comfortably \nat night knowing was going to be available to them.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is exactly right. It was a defined \nbenefit. Every retiree did not have to worry about the vicissitudes of \nthe stock market and part of their retirement suddenly disappearing \novernight.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is that not the same basic structure that we have had \nfrom the very beginning with Social Security, that it also provides the \nsame level of security and peace of mind to its beneficiaries because \nit also is a defined-benefit program?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It certainly is--the same system that has been \nin place in Florida for years, the system over which the senior Senator \nfrom Florida presided as Governor, and therefore the chairman of the \nState Board of Administration that oversaw the State retirement system, \nand when I had the pleasure years later, as the elected State \ntreasurer, of being one of the three trustees of the State pension \nfund.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Finally, does not the Senator think there are ample \nopportunities available for a person who wishes to take the risk and \nassume the chance that they may be buying into a stock market which is \nnot always going up, they might be buying into a stock market such as \nin recent months it seems that goes down more than up, that they have \nplenty of opportunities with their savings, and if they have an \nindividual retirement account or a 401(k) to take some risk, but with \nthe core of\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\ntheir retirement, Social Security and the basic retirement through \ntheir employer, that they would be well served to have the confidence \nand assurance of knowing what they are going to do and not be on the \nWall Street roulette wheel as to what their retirement benefits will \nbe?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator has said it very well, and Social \nSecurity is a social safety net. The retirees, the senior citizens of \nthis country, should know that it is a defined benefit that is going to \nbe there when they need it and it is not subject to the roulette wheel, \nas the Senator has suggested, in the case that the stock market is \nsuddenly in a downward trend. So, too, the State retirement system of \nthe State of Florida was a defined benefit in the past, when the two of \nus had the opportunity of being part of the governing body of the board \nof trustees, and it gave confidence because there was a defined \nbenefit.\n  So there is an exact parallel between what we have seen in the State \nof Florida and what we want to talk about tonight, which is President \nBush wanting to privatize a part of Social Security and transfer a \ntrillion dollars out of the Social Security trust fund over to private \nindividual accounts that the individual would then invest in the stock \nmarket. That sounded like a good idea to a lot of people when the stock \nmarket was going up, but now that the stock market is going down, it is \nbeyond me that the President is still insisting, as recently as last \nweek, that he have Social Security privatized.\n  That is what I wanted to talk about tonight, and I am so delighted I \ncame to the Chamber before my colleague from Florida left so that he \ncould engage in this colloquy and dialogue with me. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I will summarize my remarks \nbecause Senator Graham and I have pretty well covered it in the \ndiscussion we had, that one only has to look back a couple of years. \nThe Nasdaq has fallen by 75 percent, and the broader S has dropped \nmore than 40 percent, and given this market downturn, as we say in the \nSouth, it is beyond me, I am surprised that the Bush administration is \nsticking by its proposal to allow workers to divert some of their \nSocial Security into private accounts of the stock market instead of \nthere being a defined benefit that would give the Social Security \nretiree the security, the knowledge, the confidence that when their \nretirement years came, they knew they had a certain amount they could \nrely on, even though most retirees are going to have to supplement that \nSocial Security benefit, but at least they would know that benefit was \nthere and was not going to evaporate if, in fact, the Social Security \nprivatized account was invested in stocks that had suddenly taken a \nturn going down.\n  That is the essence of what I wanted to share. I will be speaking \nfrequently on this matter when we resume in September, because this \nissue has had scant attention--an article here, an article there, about \nhow the Bush White House is so intent that it wants to privatize these \naccounts. Clearly, if the times had not been of the economic downturn \nand the suffering that so many people have had in the stock market, \nperhaps they would have been lulled into a false sense of security. But \nwith the stock market doing what it has done--a reflection, by the way, \nof the corporate scandals that have come to light and therefore a \nlessening of the confidence of the investing public of America in those \ncorporations--if that had not come, the governmental decision process \nmight have been seduced into going for this privatized part of Social \nSecurity. Clearly, that is not, in my judgment, in the best interest of \nour senior citizens.\n  That is what I wanted to share tonight. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7852-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7852-S7856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE ACTION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as we wrap up this summer session prior \nto the August break, I want to make a few comments. Several of my \ncolleagues have discussed different issues.\n  First, let me state that I am very pleased that this Congress was \nsuccessful in passing trade promotion authority and the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act. Both of those are vitally important and long overdue. \nThe Andean Trade Preferences Act should have been passed by the end of \nlast year. Unfortunately, the majority said it had to be packaged with \ntrade promotion authority and with trade adjustment assistance. I have \nno objection to passing trade adjustment assistance; I think we should. \nWe have always done it. I happen to agree with it.\n  Unfortunately, the majority--in this case the Democrats--said, in \naddition to trade adjustment assistance, we want to put in new \nentitlements and expand trade adjustment assistance not only for \nindividuals who might directly lose their job to imports, they also \nsaid indirectly. That is an expansion. They also said we want to \ninclude agricultural workers. You might have every agricultural worker \nin America who says they lost a job, that it was due to imports because \nwe are in an international market and prices go down. Now they want \nFederal assistance.\n  Then we also made a mistake because there was a new benefit added \nthat said, in addition to trade adjustment assistance, in other words, \nbeing trained to pick up a new job, now the Federal Government is going \nto pick up 65 percent of the health care cost, an advanceable, \nrefundable tax credit. We don't do that for somebody employed. We don't \ndo that for a lot of people. But we will do it for somebody who says, I \nwas unemployed because of trade. And they will be eligible to receive \nthat for 2 years.\n\n  Then in conference, inexplicably, it was suddenly altered to qualify \nthose now receiving benefits under the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation, if they are between ages 55 and 65, to receive the tax \ncredit. That little amendment which didn't pass the Senate is going to \ncost over $2 billion.\n  So the entitlement portion of the trade adjustment assistance has \nmore than doubled, and I am constantly amazed at the number of people \nwho always say: Wait a minute. Spending is going up, we should not be \nspending here, but it is fine if we do it in entitlements. They insist \nwe do it in entitlements. That is real money. And a lot of times \nentitlements are hard to roll back.\n  I wanted to express my displeasure with the almost frivolous way we \nhave greatly expanded the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program and then \nheld trade promotion authority hostage to get this kind of expansion.\n  That being said, the good of trade promotion authority and the Andean \nTrade Preferences Act outweighed the negative of the expansion of the \nentitlement. So I voted for it. I am pleased we were able to pass it. \nIt is a very significant accomplishment.\n  Chairman Greenspan said we could do two things to advance the economy \nin this country, one of which was to show fiscal discipline--we have \nnot done that--two, he said, to expand trade. By passing trade \npromotion authority, we have made it possible for this country to \nregain its leadership which we had lost. We lost it during the Clinton \nadministration. Every previous President, going all the way back to \nJerry Ford in 1974, had trade promotion authority. Bill Clinton had it \nin his first 2 years of office. He did not get it extended in 1996.\n  He was running for office. It expired in 1994. He didn't ask for an \nextension until after his reelection in 1996. At that time he couldn't \nget it through the House. The House was controlled by the Democrats. It \nwas controlled by the Democrats when he was in power the first 2 years. \nHe didn't get it extended then, and he couldn't get it extended later. \nIn the Senate we had the votes to extend it. He wasn't able to get it.\n  Now this President, President Bush, is going to get it. I am glad. I \nthink that will help expand trade and again regain our leadership role \nas it has been, as it should be, as really the promoter, the leader, \nthe cheerleader, frankly, for international free trade. Ronald Reagan \nhelped expand it in the\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nearly 1980s, and that has certainly been a benefit to our economy and \nthe economy of the free world.\n  A couple of other issues have been brought up. I want to touch on \nthem.\n  I heard some of my colleagues say we need to pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights, and maybe there will be an attempt to appoint conferees to \nconference on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I will probably be a \nconferee.\n  I have been involved in that issue for several years now. I look \nforward to working with our colleagues on both the House and the Senate \nsides to pass a good Patients' Bill of Rights package. But I do find it \nkind of curious that we passed the bill over a year ago. Let me repeat \nthat. We passed Patients' Bill of Rights over a year ago. The House \npassed it a year ago tomorrow, on August 2 of last year. We are just \nnow appointing conferees. This was the most important item on the \nagenda for the Democrats who regained control of the Senate last \nsummer--the first major legislative item we passed. However the House \npassed it a year ago.\n  We could have appointed conferees a year ago. We are just now getting \naround to doing that. I find that kind of curious. I still want to pass \na bill. I might be able to refresh my memory enough to see if we can't \nnegotiate a positive package. Let me restate that I don't want to pass \na package that will greatly increase health care costs for patients. \nUnfortunately, that is what passed the Senate 13 months ago--a bill \nthat would increase health care costs, estimated by the CBO, by 4 or 5 \npercent. I think at one time they scored it at 4.7 percent. And this is \nan increase over and above the increases already coming in on health \ncare inflation and insurance costs, and health care insurance costs are \nexploding.\n  The California health care plan, CalPERS, may be one of the largest \nplans in America. I remember reading the headline that their health \ncare insurance costs are going up 25 percent. Small business insurance \ncosts are going up 15 to 20 percent. Nationally, almost everybody's is \ngoing up 12 to 14 percent. This is going to add another 4, 5 percent on \ntop of it.\n  I don't want to do that. I will work energetically to see that we \ndon't pass a bill that would greatly increase health care costs. Also, \nI don't want to pass a bill that will increase the number of uninsured. \nIf I remember the Senate bill accurately, the bill also had new causes \nof action where people could sue not only the big, bad HMO, but \nemployers as well. Some of us wanted to protect employers. We know if \nyou make them liable for health care costs, employers don't have to \nprovide them, and a lot of employers won't provide health care costs. \nThe net result will be more people joining the ranks of the uninsured.\n  We should do no harm. We should not pass any bill that will increase \ncosts dramatically or increase the number of uninsured. I am afraid \nthat will happen if we pass the Senate bill. I am happy to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. If you are looking at what the \nmajor changes are--when I was chairman of the task force--and I was \nchairman of the conference committee for over a year, which dealt with \nthis issue--we had internal appeals in the bill we passed in the Senate \nat one time; we had external appeals. So if somebody is denied \ncoverage, they can get an immediate response and get it overturned if \nit was unfairly denied by a big, bad HMO bureaucrat. That decision can \nbe final. We can make a penalty if somebody doesn't abide by the \nexternal appeal. We can make that binding, where it would be \nridiculous, or expensive, for somebody not to comply with the appeal so \nthey can get health care when they need it.\n  Some people don't want to have that be the final solution. They think \nthe real solution should be in court. Oh, yes, they want unlimited \ndamages, or damages that, frankly, are so high it would scare a lot of \nemployers away. I don't want to do that--pass a bill that will increase \nthe number of uninsured, or the cost of health care beyond the reach of \ncountless businesses and individuals across the country.\n\n  I am happy to work with our colleagues. I don't know why it has taken \nus a year to appoint conferees. I find it almost ironic. I look forward \nto working with my friends on both sides of the aisle to do it.\n  Mr. President, next I want to touch on the issue of prescription \ndrugs. Some of our colleagues who were proposing an amendment yesterday \ncame to the floor tonight and were implying that colleagues who opposed \nthat proposal were not truthful. I was reading the remarks and thought, \nwait a minute, is he talking about me? I opposed the proposal. And I \nthink I was right. I remember hearing a colleague saying that you are \nentitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own \nfacts. I use that, also. I thought, he is using that against me or my \ncolleagues.\n  That bothers me. I would do anything before I would mislead my \ncolleagues. If I ever mislead colleagues, I will be more than happy to \ncome and apologize, correct the record, you name it. I want to win \nbadly, but I never want to win so badly that I would distort the \ntruth--ever. I think that was implied. I hope it wasn't. If it was, I \nbelieve it is in violation of rule XIX of the Senate. That should not \nhappen.\n  Certainly, nobody should be misled. The issue at hand was on Medicaid \ncosts. I am happy to talk about the facts of that. I did see a chart \nthat was shown on the floor of the Senate. I saw a chart that showed \nthat a lot of States would pay a lot more money in Medicaid costs. \nWhere did that chart come from? Somebody said it is some anonymous \nchart, and I guess it didn't have any identification on it. It wasn't \nhanded had out to every Senator. It was handed out to a lot. It was \navailable in the Chamber. It came from the administration, from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, to try to get kind of an \nestimate on what the impact of the last Graham proposal offered because \nwe are trying to figure it out. Senator Graham read a comment that was \nmade. I thought it was made by me, but it turned out to be made by \nSenator Grassley. He implied that it was incorrect. I looked at that. I \nhappen to know Chuck Grassley, and he would never misstate anything \nintentionally, and I don't think he misstated one word.\n  I am bothered that somebody would quote somebody in the Record--when \nhe is not here to defend himself--and imply that he didn't tell the \ntruth in order to win the debate. That bothers me. I love the Senate \nand I hate to see this kind of almost accusation.\n  Let's look at the facts. Senator Graham's amendment was introduced \nyesterday. We never saw a copy of it until it was introduced. It was \nheld overnight. I think it was brought to the floor at 2, 3 o'clock in \nthe afternoon on Tuesday. We voted on it Wednesday morning. Granted, \novernight, the Department of Health and Human Services looked at it and \ngave us some estimates.\n  I know in my State it would cost a lot. The Medicaid Director, Mike \nFogerty, said Oklahoma would not be able to do it without cutting the \nprogram's financing. If there is any cost, the only way you can find \nthe money is other places in the program.\n  We did find some serious problems with the Graham amendment. It said \nwe are not going to just expand Medicare, we are going to have a low-\nincome benefit, and do it through Medicaid. Medicaid happens to be, \nfactually, a Federal-State program. The Federal Government pays a \nportion and the State pays a portion. In some States it is 50/50. In \nsome States, it is 70/30. The Graham amendment said we are going to \nprovide a brand new drug benefit with very small copays from the \nbeneficiary--$2 and $5--and we are going to provide this benefit for \nanybody who makes less than 200 percent of poverty. Well, State \nMedicaid drug benefits for most States--31 States, maybe 30--I counted \nthem yesterday, and I think I counted 31, but it may be plus or minus. \nThis had to be done very quickly. It may not be 100 percent accurate \nbecause it was done quickly. Every State has to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicaid up to 74 percent of poverty. They do that on \nthe State match.\n  So, again, for this drug benefit, whatever benefit the State has--in \nmy State, you get three prescriptions per month and the State pays its \nshare--in my case, 30 percent--and the Federal Government pays 70 \npercent. That is up to 74 percent of poverty. The Graham amendment says \nlet's make that 120 percent of poverty. In other words, we\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\ngreatly expanded the pool of eligible people because our State, right \nnow, is only 74 percent. So we greatly expanded it to 120, and the \nState is still liable for its share.\n  Well, that is a big new unfunded mandate for which the State has to \npay. That will cost millions and millions of dollars because there is \nno limit on the number of drugs. The State will have to make its match, \ndepending on what the State match is. Between 120 and 150 percent, a \nState still has to pay.\n  There is an enhanced match. The State would get S-CHIP. S-CHIP \nusually has a reimbursement rate of 78 percent, I believe, on average. \nThe State would still have to put in 22 percent. So you are expanding \nthe eligible pool of people who are going to receive the benefit, and \nyou are also expanding what the State has to pay. Those are facts. \nThose are in the Senator's bill.\n  Between 150 percent and 200 percent of poverty, the Federal \nGovernment would pay 100 percent. The Federal Government pays that, so \nI guess that is not an unfunded mandate. It is just a cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  Below 150 percent of poverty, between, frankly, 74 percent and 150 \npercent of poverty, there is a big new mandate on the Federal \nGovernment and on the State government. The State would have to pay its \nshare, and that would cost----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a series of \nquestions?\n  (Mr. NELSON of Florida assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield in just a moment. That is a \ngreat big cost. That has to be accounted for somehow. Someone might \nsay: There might be savings because we have catastrophic on the other \nend. Right now, maybe the State is paying that--that may be--but that \nmay not get there.\n  Mr. President, 80-some percent of the people do not have drug costs \nthat exceed $2,000. Catastrophic did not kick in until $3,300. No doubt \nsome people would benefit, but maybe the majority of the people would \nnot. It looked to me as though it was a real loser for the States. I \nthink OMB happens to agree. They estimate it would cost my State \nsomething like $62 million. I would not be a bit surprised if it cost \nmore than that. Our State cannot afford that. We have a Medicaid \nProgram that is already going bankrupt.\n  My point being--and I mention this with my friend from Florida here. \nI have respect for my colleagues, but always I think it is important we \nnot impugn the integrity of Senators.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think my integrity was impugned when it was suggested \nyesterday that we had slipped into this amendment, hoping it would go \nundiscovered, a provision that would end up costing the States some $70 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That is close to a verbatim statement.\n  That was made on the basis of this sheet which was printed and \ndistributed on the Senate floor without a source and without anyone \naccepting personal responsibility. This is what I call Enron \naccounting. You only accounted for the additional cost to the States \nwithout any reference to the savings the States would get as a result \nof the Federal Government picking up substantial costs the States are \ncurrently incurring which the Congressional Budget Office has stated to \nbe approximately equal to what the States would have to expend in terms \nof these new obligations. No reference was made----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No reference was made on this chart to the fact there \nwere very substantial savings to the States in addition to the costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regain the floor. I looked at the \nchart. The chart does not have all States. Maybe some States were not \nimpacted as much. Maybe they highlighted the States that have the most \nadditional cost.\n  I mentioned my State. I know my State would be out of a lot of money. \nWe offered a drug benefit that goes up to 74 percent of poverty, and we \nare going to put a new mandate between 74 and 150 percent of poverty. \nThe State has to make that match. I know it is going to cost my State \nmillions. HHS said it cost $68 million. They said the cost for the \nfirst year is over $5 billion. Maybe some States are pluses, maybe some \nare winners. Maybe they did not include all this.\n  I will say a couple words about the legislative process. I happen to \nbe a believer in the legislative process, and I think my colleague from \nFlorida knows that. We did not abide by the legislative process.\n  We did find his amendment greatly increases Medicaid costs for a lot \nof States. Yes, we exposed that. That happens to be factual. This was \nnot just a Medicare expansion. It was a Medicaid expansion, and the \nStates have to match Medicaid.\n  Did we find it? Yes. Did we find in the original Graham proposal that \nthe proposal limited the prescription drugs to one, up to two, drugs \nfor therapeutic class? We did. I think it probably is one of the \nreasons that proposal did not pass--because it is such a limitation.\n  Did we find it? Yes, it was in the language. Did we have a whole lot \nof time? No, we told people about it. I do not back off that a bit. I \nthink we have a right to point out the weaknesses of arguments. As \nalways, my colleague can point out this was not a complete chart. We \ndid not have time to get a complete chart. I did not. Maybe there is a \ncomplete chart around, but the amendment was offered in the afternoon \nand we were voting on it in the morning.\n  One of the things that is really wrong is to try to legislate in a \nmanner such as this. I believe in the legislative process. I believe in \nhearings. I would love to have a hearing on the proposals we voted on \nthis week. I would love to have experts testify on the pluses, the \nstrengths, the weaknesses, the gaps, the minuses on the various \nproposals. We have had some good proposals. We have had some that are \nnot so good. I heard my colleague from Florida say that CBO by e-mail \nsaid this is a net wash for the States. HHS shows me that some States, \nor these States that are listed, would have a net loss of $5 billion in \n1 year. This is a 10-year program.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The point I am making: It would be nice to go through \nthe process, have a bipartisan markup, have hearings, have experts, and \nnot be relying on e-mails that came from somebody in CBO.\n  Incidentally, I noticed in CBO's scoring of the proposal, it was \nscored and was estimated to be $394 billion, but there is an asterisk: \nScoring done by estimates, not by the language of the bill. In other \nwords, they did not have the language of the bill on which to do the \nscoring. This is the most important expensive expansion of an \nentitlement that we have dealt with in decades. It is the most \nexpensive important expansion of any entitlement, and we are doing it \nwith CBO not even having legislative language to look at.\n  I find that to be a pretty crummy way to legislate. I am offended by \nthis process. I am offended by being a member of the Finance Committee \nand not even being able to offer an amendment in the markup of the \nbill. I am offended by the fact--I looked at the history of the Finance \nCommittee, which is one of the great committees of the Senate. I waited \n16 years to get on that committee. It took a long time. It is a great \ncommittee. I thought it would be worth the wait because we would be \nmarking up very substantive legislation, such as Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, and taxes. Yet the committee is \nbypassed, so we have 20 members of the committee who did not get a \nchance to offer an amendment.\n  We have an amendment that was created somewhere and scored overnight \nnot by legislative language. No one gave us a chart and said here is \nthe impact of your State. I would love to see the impact to my State. \nMy State Medicaid director says this is going to be a real problem; we \ncannot do it.\n  We exposed that a lot of States would have a problem doing that. \nThere is no reason to apologize for doing that. I just want to make \nsure that Senate debate never improperly impugns the integrity--I \nbelieve my colleague who was quoted was Senator Grassley--I do not ever \nwant anybody's integrity\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nto be impugned on either side of the aisle. That is below the Senate, \nand there happen to be Senate rules against it. I wanted to make that \npoint.\n  I will just assume and take for granted no one meant to do that. But \nwe have to be very careful not to do that. We have to be careful that \nwe are factual. Sometimes maybe in the heat of the debate things get \ngoing.\n  I want to move on to one other subject.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before the Senator does that, will he \nyield since we are on this subject?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield just for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does this chart in any of the columns contain the offset \nsavings which the States would have secured as a result of the passage \nof the underlying Graham-Smith amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The chart does not show any offsetting. It shows a total \ncost increase of the new Medicaid mandate. I think the Senator is \ntrying to imply there may be some savings for some areas if a State had \na lot of catastrophic and the Federal Government were going to pick up \n100 percent of that cost, I guess. That may be correct, but it does not \nhave a column that shows that. Maybe if we would have had a little more \ntime--the answer is no.\n  I ask my colleague, though, since CBO did some work for the Senator, \ndid they do a State-by-State analysis on what the impact of the State \nof Oklahoma would be?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. They did not do a State-by-State analysis. I do not know \nwho did the analysis of the State-by-State costs presented by my \nRepublican colleagues so I cannot have any means of even determining \nwho to go to talk to about where these numbers came from. But the \nanswer to the question, which is relevant, is there are very \nsubstantial savings to the States. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the savings to the States as a result of \nthe passage of this prescription drug amendment would be equal to----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. These additional costs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator can answer the question. I have the floor \nand I will state again, some States lose under the Senator's proposal \nbig time. I am not sure all States do; some States lose big time.\n  The Senator stated that he did not have a State-by-State analysis, so \nevery fact that is on this chart may well be accurate. The Senator also \nstated that CBO did not do a State-by-State analysis, and I will say if \nwe are going to be changing Medicaid formulas, or if we are going to be \nchanging Medicaid programs and States have to make a certain percentage \nmatch, it is only prudent that we would do an analysis of what the \nimpact would be on a State-by-State basis.\n  Unfortunately, CBO did not do that. Fortunately, the Department of \nHHS did. The States that are included on this list are the States that \nget hit the hardest, and we expose that.\n  Now, there may be some offsets, but I tell my colleague from Florida, \nI can almost assure him, since 80 percent of seniors have prescription \ndrug costs that are $2,000 or less, that catastrophic program savings \nwould not come near to offset the increased costs of utilization. And \nthe fact that they have to make matches up to 50 percent, almost to 100 \npercent, for the program, minus a small deductible for people under 200 \npercent of poverty, it would not come too close to make it. It would \nnot come close in the State of Nebraska or the State of Oklahoma. I \nknow that. There are not near that many people who would have the \nsavings through the State.\n  In our State program, the individual who gets three prescriptions per \nmonth is not going to come close to $3,000. That program is not that \ngenerous in my State so the savings on the catastrophic side would not \ncome close to making the savings or the increased costs that is on the \nlow-income side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Could I ask the Senator another question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What leads the Senator to believe that the only way in \nwhich the States would secure savings under the Graham-Smith amendment \nwould have been through the catastrophic savings?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Well, I will tell my colleague, all we had from CBO on \nthe Senator's amendment was one page that said, one, it never went \nState by State and, two, it said $394 billion and it said it was not \nbased on legislative language. We had nothing to score off of from what \nwas provided for by CBO or by the Senator, except for the Senator's \nword that he had an e-mail that said the States net out about even.\n\n  I did have work that was done by HHS, and it may not have included \nevery extrapolation, but they did compute the cost of the low-income \nbenefit and how much that would cost the States to make the match, and \nit is in the billions of dollars, to the tune of $5 billion for some \nStates. Maybe some States would come out better. I am not sure. But \nthat is my point. This is not the way to legislate.\n  This is legislating as if we are going to legislate on the back of an \nenvelope. It is almost as if Senator Daschle said, do not go to \ncommittee, do not have a markup, here is $400 billion, $500 billion, \n$600 billion, or $800 billion and can we not cobble together 60 votes?\n  That is a crummy way to legislate. We could have passed a \nprescription drug bill if we had done two things. If we would have \npassed a budget, this Senate--the House passed a budget. Incidentally, \nthe House passed a budget with a prescription drug amount of $350 \nbillion. The Senate passed a budget a year ago, I might mention when \nRepublicans were in control of the Senate, and it was a $300 billion \ntotal Medicare change. It could be prescription drugs or it could be \nfor something else.\n  That is what we are relying on in the Senate today. Why? That is a \nyear old. Because the Senate Democrats, or the leadership of the \nSenate, did not pull up a budget. We do not have a budget. We did not \npass a budget, first time since 1974, and because we did not, a budget \npoint of order lay against anything that was over $300 billion.\n  If we had passed a budget, gone to conference with the House and \nresolved whatever amount that would be--and let's presume the House \nwould prevail--then the committees would have been instructed to pass a \nbill, if the House prevailed, up to $350 billion. It could be passed if \nit went through the Finance Committee. Any bill could be reported out \nthat would be up to $350 billion, and it could pass with a majority \nvote. No budget point of order would lay against it. We could have \npassed a prescription drug benefit this week. Unfortunately, that did \nnot happen.\n  So the committee did not mark up any proposal that came out that was \nover $300 billion. Last year's level had a budget point of order, had \nto have 60 votes, had to have a supermajority. The real fault of that \ncame because we did not pass a budget earlier.\n  Again, I love the Finance Committee but I hate the way the Finance \nCommittee has been trampled on. I hate the fact that the Finance \nCommittee is being ignored, the fact they did not mark up the bill, the \nfact I did not have a chance to offer one amendment, the fact I did not \nget to have the chance to ask the Medicaid director: How does this \nimpact you? Is this a good proposal? Do you mind if we put on this new \nrequirement, oh, yes, below 150 percent of poverty? Here is this brand \nnew benefit. It is going to cost you a ton of money. How much does it \ncost? Can you afford it? Could you pay for it? I am afraid the answer \nwould be, no, no, no, no.\n  We did not have a chance. Instead, we had to try to write the bill on \nthe floor, and in this case we had to take up this amendment and we had \nless than 24 hours to deal with it.\n  Again, my purpose in expanding this is not to redebate the amendment. \nMy purpose is to defend my colleague, Senator Grassley, whose integrity \nI value more than anything. I would not--and I know he would not--\nmisstate a fact to win a debate for anything.\n\n  I came to the Senate with Senator Grassley in 1980. That was 22 years \nago. We have cast thousands of votes together. I know him very well. I \nagree with him most of the time--not all the time--but I would defend \nhis integrity every day of the year.\n  I am going to start making points of order, rule XIX, if people imply \nor impugn the integrity of another Member. I am going to do it, and \nthose words will be stricken from the Record and\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nthe Senator will not be allowed to get access to the floor for the rest \nof the day; and maybe other penalties. We have not done that, but maybe \nwe need to do it. So that is my purpose for coming to the floor.\n  I want to make a couple of other comments.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not going to yield. I am going to make one other \ncomment on a different subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7856-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7856-S7857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. NICKELS. Mr. President, earlier today we confirmed a total of \neight judges. A lot of people said, boy, didn't we do great? We have \ndone more in the last 12 months than anybody has done in the last 12 \nmonths.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, and others because we did \nconfirm a few more circuit court judges, but let me state my \ndisappointment in the fact that we have not done near enough. I want to \nput out facts. We have now confirmed 13 circuit court judges. President \nBush submitted 32. We are in the second year of his Presidency. We are \nnot quite finished, but we have confirmed 40 percent of his circuit \ncourt nominees. I looked at the first 2 years of the Clinton \nadministration, and this Senate confirmed 19 of 22. That is 86 percent. \nI looked at the first 2 years of the first President Bush, the 101st \nCongress, and we confirmed 22 of 23 circuit court judges. That is 95 \npercent.\n  I looked at the first 2 years of President Reagan, 97th Congress, we \nconfirmed 19 of 20 of his circuit court nominees. That is 95 percent.\n  So for the three previous Presidents we confirmed over 90 percent of \ntheir circuit court nominees in their first 2 years.\n  This Congress--and granted, the first several months, the first 6 or \n7 months of this Congress was controlled by Republicans and we did not \nconfirm any judges because the President was just sending his nominees \nthrough and they did not have time, and that is not unusual. We usually \ndo not confirm very many in the first 6 months of any administration.\n  So far this year, we have done 13 out of 32; that is 40 percent. That \nis less than half the percentage of what we did in three previous \nPresidencies. Those are just facts. I heard someone said we confirmed \n72 judges. Great, 72 is a lot more than we confirmed in the last 2 \nyears of the Clinton administration. Granted, we usually don't confirm \nvery many in the last year of a President's terms, but in the first 2 \nyears we usually do, and we are way behind.\n  Some of the individuals were nominated 449 days ago--over a year ago. \nThey were nominated last May--a year ago May. Some of these are the \nmost outstanding nominees I have ever seen. John Roberts, nominated for \nthe DC Circuit, has argued 37 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Is \nthis individual qualified? He was nominated a year ago in May, and he \nhas yet to have a hearing. He has argued 37 cases before the Supreme \nCourt. How do you get more qualified? Miguel Estrada argued 15 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court and was unanimously rated well qualified by \nthe ABA. He emigrated to the United States as a teenager from Honduras \nand spoke virtually no English. He graduated magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law School, editor of the Harvard Law Review, law clerk to \nJustice Kennedy, a former assistant solicitor general and assistant \nU.S. attorney. He has not received a hearing.\n  I guess you can say, we have confirmed 72 this year, how is it fair \nto have 2 individuals such as John Roberts and Miguel Estrada not even \nhave a hearing, having been nominated over a year ago? Senator Leahy \nmade a commitment we would do Miguel Estrada. I am waiting.\n  Priscilla Owen: We had a hearing in July of this year but no vote. \nThe Republicans asked that be postponed because we are not sure where \nthe votes are. Texas Supreme Court justice since 1994; unanimously \nrated well qualified by ABA; Baylor Law School graduate; member, Baylor \nlaw review; highest scorer on the Texas bar exam; eminently qualified.\n  Maybe some people are now putting a litmus test in the committee. We \ndid not used to do that. People used to rail against having a litmus \ntest, and now people are trying to come up with a litmus test. If she \nis not confirmed, that is a travesty.\n  Terrence Boyle was nominated in May, a year ago chief judge of the \nU.S. District Court, District of North Carolina, since 1997; \nunanimously rated well qualified. He worked as counsel in the House \nSubcommittee on Housing; was a legislative assistant in the Senate; \nprior district judge, 1984 to 1987; very well qualified and still no \nhearing and certainly has not had a vote.\n  Michael McConnell, nominated to the Tenth Circuit; presidential \nprofessor of law, University of Utah; unanimously rated well qualified \nby ABA; one of the country's leading constitutional law experts; argued \n11 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court; prior assistant solicitor \ngeneral; law clerk for Justice Brennan and cannot even get a hearing.\n  Deborah Cook, nominated to the Sixth District; justice to the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio since 1994; unanimously rated well qualified by ABA. The \nSixth Circuit is almost half vacant, with 7 out of 16 seats empty in \nthe Sixth Circuit; exceptionally well qualified and no hearing.\n  Jeffrey Sutton, nominated to the Sixth Circuit as well; rated well \nqualified by ABA and qualified by ABA; graduated first in his class, \nOhio University College of Law; law clerk to Supreme Court Justices \nPowell and Scalia, and argued 9 cases and over 50 merits and amicus \nbriefs before the Supreme Court; and prior State Solicitor of the State \nof Ohio. He has yet to have a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Dennis Shedd, nominated to the Fourth Circuit; a judge in the U.S. \nDistrict Court of South Carolina since 1991; rated well qualified by \nABA; 20 years of private practice and public service prior to becoming \na district judge; law degree from the University of South Carolina; \nmaster of law degree from Georgetown. He received a hearing on June \n27--still not reported out of committee.\n  I thank my colleagues for the fact we have confirmed 72 judges, but I \nmentioned 8 nominees who were nominated in May of last year; a couple \nhave had a hearing, and the rest have not had hearings and have not \nbeen voted on in committee, and we have not had a chance to have a vote \non the floor. A year and a half, how much is enough? This is an \noutrage. I don't think this should be done, Democrat or Republican.\n  I plan on being back in the majority, and I tell my friends and \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, I plan on treating judicial \nnominees fairly. Regardless of who is in the White House, we should \ntreat them fairly. If there is a judge really out of the mainstream, \nlet's debate it. But to hold up these individuals who have argued 30, \nand 15, and 9, and 10 cases before the Supreme Court and we do not even \ngive them a hearing in committee, that is not fair. That is an \ninjustice. That is an abuse of power.\n  Maybe we are confirming district judges, and that is great, and \ndistrict judges have sponsors of Senators. These are appellate court \njudges, circuit court judges, next to the highest court in the land, \nnext to the Supreme Court, and they cannot get a hearing. I don't think \nthat is right. I don't think it is fair. I am not saying there have not \nbeen injustices before by Republicans. Enough of this nonsense: You did \nnot treat us right, we are not going to treat you right.\n  Again, the tradition of the Senate: We do not usually confirm a lot \nof nominees in a President's last year or so. We certainly do his first \nyear or so, as evidenced by the fact--and I will put this in the \nRecord--that 95 and 96 percent of the three previous Presidents' \ncircuit court nominees were confirmed in the first 2 years--almost all \nof them--and this year we are at 40 percent on circuit court nominees.\n  That is totally unsatisfactory. That is not fair to those \nindividuals. It is not fair to the judicial system. It is certainly not \nfair to the Sixth Circuit Court, which is almost half vacant.\n  I tell my colleagues, we have made some progress, and my compliments. \nBut we have a lot more to do, especially on circuit court nominees and \non individuals such as John Roberts and Miguel Estrada. Let's lower the \nrhetoric and get some people confirmed. Let's treat them like \nindividuals, with dignity. They have been nominated to\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nthe highest courts in the land. They have been nominated for lifetime \nappointments. Let's do our work. The Senate traditionally, over the \nyears, would move judicial nominees expeditiously. And they are getting \nmore difficult.\n  Now people are saying: We want to review every case that the judge \nhas ever written; we want to review every case on which he made a \nrecommendation. That is ridiculous. It is an excuse for delay. That is \nnot right. It is not for the majority or the minority. I urge my \ncolleagues to be fair to the nominees and get as many confirmed and \nmove the Senate along as we should and restore the Senate through the \ngreat traditions that the Senate has long held so we can be worthy of \nthe title of Senator, and not have a reputation of: I am sorry, judge, \nwe are sorry about your political career or, Mr. Attorney, you were \nnominated by the President of the United States, but we are sorry you \nhave waited a year and a half and you cannot get a hearing before the \nSenate; they are too busy. That embarrasses me.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7857-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7857-S7858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is the last day of a long legislative \nseason. We are about to take the month of August to go back to our home \nStates, be with our constituents, and maybe have a little opportunity \nto get some personal relaxation and rejuvenation, and come back after \nLabor Day and complete this 107th session of Congress.\n  It is exactly this time in the legislative calendar where maybe \ntempers and tolerance are beginning to wear thin and short.\n  I share with my friend from Oklahoma high feelings for the persons \nwho debated vigorously over the last 2 weeks on an issue whose \nimportance we all understand and feel deeply about, which is the issue \nof providing a health care program to 40 million senior Americans by \nadding to that 37-year-old program, at long last, a prescription drug \nbenefit. I think the goal is one we all share. We have somewhat \ndifferent ideas as to how to get to that goal.\n  The reason I came to the floor earlier today was out of, yes, a sense \nof personal attack but also a sense of the need to set a very obvious \nerroneous record somewhat straighter. My concern was piqued by a \nstatement that was made which implied that I, Senator Smith, and \nothers, tried to slip something by the Senate. And that ``something'' \nwas not a small amount, but a very substantial, maybe as much as a $70 \nbillion additional cost on the States according to my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  I knew that was not accurate because I had received from the \nCongressional Budget Office, which had scored our legislation, the fact \nthat they had determined that, in fact, there was no additional cost to \nthe States and I had made that representation to my colleagues. I felt \nmy personal credibility was at stake. So I went back to the \nCongressional Budget Office today to recheck what they had said and \nthey reaffirmed the statement that there was no additional cost to the \nStates.\n  I showed them this--\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me just finish, get the facts out, and then we will \ntalk about the policy.\n  So I showed them this chart. They pointed out what was obvious which \nwas that this chart only shows half, in fact less than half of the \nequation. It shows the additional costs to the States that will come \nincident to their picking up some of the prescription drug costs. What \nit does not show is that the States are going to be relieved of a \nsubstantial amount of their current costs.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma mentioned one of these costs. But, in \naddition to that, there are other costs from which the States will \nreceive relief. For example, there are 31 States that provide State \npharmacy assistance for low-income senior citizens, the States which \nhave received Medicaid waivers in order to allow them to cover \nadditional groups of seniors. As the Federal Government has dawdled on \nthe subject of providing prescription drugs for senior Americans, many \nStates have stepped forward and have done so.\n  So within the Medicaid Program as well as in areas where the States \nhave tried to fill the void that the Federal Government has left \nbehind, there are substantial savings to the States--thus the report of \nthe Congressional Budget Office that there is no increased cost to the \nStates. But there is no column or figures on this chart which reflect \nthe fact that there are these offsetting savings to the States.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What got Enron in trouble was it set up a whole \nconstellation of off-budget partnerships in order to hide their \nexpenses.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And therefore it overstated their profitability.\n  We have a chart here which does the opposite. We have a chart here \nwhich hides the benefits the States are going to get and only \nhighlights those additional costs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am almost there.\n  Therefore, presenting the impression that the passage of this \namendment would result in substantial additional cost to the States--\ntouted to be $70 billion--is a patently untrue statement.\n  I wanted to set the record straight before we went home so none of \nour colleagues spend August worrying that they might have been deceived \ninto believing there was going to be a very major additional cost to \nthe States and that might have influenced their vote on this matter.\n  So my only purpose was to make those corrective comments and express \nmy hope that in the future we would follow the spirit and custom of the \nSenate, which is when you distribute a document such as this, you put \nyour name on it so someone is held accountable. And I suggest it would \nalso be helpful if we adopted the custom that there be some source \ngiven for documents such as this, so those who are interested in \npursuing the basis upon which the calculation was made would at least \nknow whose telephone number to call.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am wondering about all these savings. I am looking at \nmy State. You said if the State had a prescription drug program, the \nFederal Government might be picking up a lot of that State program so \ntherefore it is saving. My State doesn't have that, other than the fact \nwe provide Medicaid prescription drugs up to 74 percent, and that is \nlimited to three prescriptions per month.\n  So where is the savings for my State? HHS said this is going to cost \nmy State something like $62 million. My director of Medicaid said it is \ngoing to cost our State, and we can't afford it.\n  There, obviously, under your proposal are some States, maybe a lot of \nStates, that would be losers; isn't that correct? It would increase \ntheir Medicaid costs dramatically?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What CBO has said is that for the States as a collective, \nthat there would be no additional cost as a result of this. I have \nasked CBO to prepare a State-by-State analysis of what those offsetting \nsavings would be. I do not have those numbers today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Isn't it likely that some States would be losers?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But I think it is a given that no State is going to have \nzero savings. So that every one of these State-by-State numbers is \noverstated.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I don't know. I will just state to my friend that these \nare additional new costs. There may be some offsets. I mentioned one \npossibility. You mentioned: Well, if they have the State drug program, \nthat might be a savings. I didn't have that program.\n  The only offsets I could see is if the Federal Government is taking \nover some of the catastrophic, and I don't see that hardly ever \nhappening. So I\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nthink these are pretty accurate costs. I will be very interested maybe \nCBO will have a chance to do it. Maybe if we would legislate correctly \nand not just have a new proposal on the floor, we would have a chance \nfor CBO to score it, not through e-mails saying that we think it is no \nnew net cost but have them give a State-by-State. Then we could be more \nthorough in our analysis and in our description. And if someone \nhighlights a couple of columns and leaves out a couple of columns, that \ncan be brought out in the debate.\n  Unfortunately, we did not have that time afforded to us the way this \nbill was brought to the floor and the way we were considering serious \nalternatives.\n  I appreciate my colleague saying, wait a minute, maybe this is not \ncomplete. There should have been a column that shows some offsets. But \nI am absolutely certain that some States would lose millions upon \nmillions of dollars, maybe in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And \nsome States would be real net losers.\n  There might be some that have some better reimbursement from the \nFederal Government. In fact, it may be for some of the States that are \nwealthier, that have more generous programs, we are going to pick up \nthe cost of their doing the program which was a previous State program. \nMaybe that is an offset.\n  But I hope, and I think my colleague would agree--or wouldn't you \nagree--that we should have a more thorough cost analysis by the \nrelevant agencies, whether it is OMB, Labor-HHS, or CBO, when we \ndiscuss programs of this significance and the significant impact it \nwould have on our States?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I completely agree. I think we should have an analysis \nthat includes both the debit and the credit side of the accounting \nledger so we will be able to make an informed judgment as to what the \nreal economic consequences of our decisions will be.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think on that note of common agreement I wish to thank \nmy friend from Oklahoma for having allowed me to ask him a few \nquestions earlier. I hope he has a very good August recess, and I look \nforward to seeing him back here on the day after Labor Day, refreshed \nand ready to complete this session of the Congress.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, on June 27, the Senate voted 99 to 0 to pass \nS. 2690 to reaffirm the reference to ``One Nation under God'' in the \nPledge of Allegiance and the National Motto ``In God We Trust.'' Today, \nto be absolutely sure that the Nation's courts abide by the original \nintent of our Founding Fathers, I am proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the Untied States that would make it clear that the \nestablishment clause in the first amendment was never meant to be \nconstrued in a manner that would prevent schools from leading our \nchildren in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance simply because it \ncontains the words ``under God.''\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives--and the vast majority of \nthe American people--have all expressed their outrage at the decision \nby the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 26 that reciting the \nPledge of Allegiance in school is unconstitutional because it includes \nthe phrase ``under God.'' People are still understandably stunned and \nfind it not only unbelievable, but indefensible.\n  The fact that two Federal circuit judges were capable of making such \nan absurd decision points up, once again, how vitally important these \nFederal judicial appointments are in guiding not only the Nation's \npresent, but its future as well. Judges are important at every level, \nbut particularly at the appellate court--the circuit court--level.\n  And this may not be the end of such shocking decisions. There have \nbeen reports that similar court challenges will be made to the use of \nthe National Motto ``In God We Trust'' on our currency and to \nreferences to God in our official oaths of office. It is simply \nincomprehensible that so many Federal judges are so quick to find that \nthe Constitution protects the right of child pornographers to debase \nsociety while at the same time requiring the removal of every last \nvestige of God from the public forum.\n  It is easy for us all to say the Pledge of Allegiance with gusto and \nmean it, but we need to look behind this latest decision--and examine \nhow and why it came about. And America's voters need to understand that \nthese Federal judgeships, and who fills them, do make a difference in \nthe kind of society that not only will we live in, but our children's \nchildren will live in as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7858-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7858-S7859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHARLES KOTHE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on June 19, the people of Oklahoma, and \nmany others around the world lost a great servant and friend with the \npassing of Charles Kothe. He was 89. Charles Kothe, a long time Tulsa \nresident and nationally recognized attorney who specialized in labor \nlaw, was born October 12, 1912. Kothe received his B.A. degree from the \nUniversity of Tulsa in 1934 and his J.D. degree, with honors, from the \nUniversity of Oklahoma in 1938. In his Tulsa based law practice he \nserved as labor relations counsel to companies in various industries \nthroughout the country.\n  During his six year tenure as Vice President of Industrial Relations \nat the National Manufacturers Association he authored two books on \nlabor relations and conducted seminars on Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct. He was personally commended for this activity by President Lyndon \nJohnson, and later served as an advisor to Secretaries of Labor \nMitchell, Goldberg, and Wirtz. In 1990, he was appointed by the White \nHouse to serve as a member of the Federal Service Impasses Panel.\n  In business, he was an Officer and Director of several corporations, \nincluding T.D. Williamson, Inc.; Coburn Optical Co.; and Macnick. Known \nas a compelling speaker, he appeared as the keynote speaker at \nconventions and conferences across the Nation. He was named Tulsa \nCitizen of the Year in 1946, was named as a Distinguished Alumnus of \nthe University of Tulsa, and is listed in the United States Junior \nChamber of Commerce Hall of Fame.\n  He taught labor law at the University of Tulsa and was Dean of the \nOklahoma School of Business Accountancy and Law. He also served as \nDirector of Civil Rights and Human Resources in the Graduate School of \nBusiness at Oral Roberts University and was the founding Dean of the \nO.W. Coburn School of Law. For more than 25 years, he taught the \nChristian Fellowship Class at First Presbyterian Church and later \nactively served at Boston Avenue Methodist Church. He was very involved \nwith the National Prayer Breakfast here in Washington.\n  Beyond his credentials and recognitions, Charles Kothe displayed a \nprofound commitment to a cause much greater than himself. This \ncommitment is evident in the life of Janet, his wife of 65 years and in \ntheir 4 children and 7 grandchildren. It is evident in the lives of the \nstudents that he trained in the rigors of law, many of whom would have \nnot had the opportunity to study but for his encouragement and support. \nIt is evident in his numerous efforts to use the law as a tool for \nhealing in the midst of conflict rather than solely as a means for \nretribution. You see, Charles Kothe believed that his purpose was \nrooted in the greatest commitment of Jesus: to love God with all his \nheart and soul, mind, and strength, and to love his neighbor as \nhimself.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nThis ability to love and share God's love with others was his greatest \ngift, his greatest accomplishment, and his greatest legacy.\n  Many of his former students have spoken of his encouraging example, \nquick wit, unmatched humor, and how his influence is still felt in \ntheir lives today. Countless individuals were transformed by their \nrelationship with Charles Kothe. Through these lives and because of \nCharles Kothe's influence on these lives, God will effect positive \nchange in our world for generations to come. He will be greatly missed.\n  Let me conclude by stating that Charles Kothe's tenacious energy, \ntremendous intellect, and inspiring enthusiasm has undoubtedly \ninfluenced countless numbers across our great land. This scholar, this \npatriot, this man of God, this friend committed himself to our Republic \nas a prudent, optimistic, and faithful son.

Mr. President, I read with interest the statement that \nRepresentative Hyde made on July 23, 2002 about the American \nServicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) during House consideration of the \nconference report on H.R. 4775, the fiscal year 2002 Supplemental \nAppropriations bill for Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist \nAttacks on the United States.\n  Although neither Mr. Hyde nor his staff were present during the \nnegotiations on ASPA, he suggests that the House readily accepted \nsection 2015, also known as the ``Dodd-Warner amendment'', which was \nunanimously included in the Senate-passed version of ASPA. I do not \nthink it is necessary to engage in an exhaustive discussion of the \nlegislative history of the Dodd-Warner amendment because it is clear on \nits face. And, the first rule of legislative interpretation is that one \nlooks to the history only if a provision is ambiguous.\n  To the extent that the legislative history is relevant, I believe \nthat I can comment on this issue, as I was involved with the drafting \nof the amendment and was an original co-sponsor. Moreover, I was \ninvolved in negotiations over section 2015 during the conference on the \nSupplemental, and my staff was actively engaged in discussion on this \nissue throughout.\n  Contrary to Mr. Hyde's suggestion that the House receded on section \n2015 because it is ineffectual, the House understood that the effect of \nthe Dodd-Warner amendment is to qualify provisions of ASPA, including \nsections 2004, 2006, and 2011, in cases involving foreign nationals. It \nwas for that reason that the House conferees repeatedly and vigorously \nsought to remove all or part of it from the conference report.\n  Those present at the negotiations know that the House agreed to \naccept the Dodd-Warner amendment only when the Senate agreed to drop \nits provision related to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), \nwhich House supporters of ASPA strongly opposed.\n  Mr. Hyde also asserts that section 2015 ``simply reiterates that this \nlegislation does not apply to international efforts besides the \nInternational Criminal Court to bring to justice foreign national \naccused of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.'' As a \nformer prosecutor and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nappreciate the creativity of Mr. Hyde's argument. But he is trying to \nput a square peg into a round hole, and one would have to rewrite the \nprovision to support his interpretation. The flaws in this \ninterpretation are self-evident, if one simply reads the text of \nsection 2015:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United States from \n     rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to \n     justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama bin Laden, \n     other members of Al Qaeda, leaders of Islamic Jihad, and \n     other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n\n  The language of this section is clear, and it is noteworthy that any \niteration of the phrase ``besides the International Criminal Court'' \ndoes not appear anywhere in the text.\n  In fact, when Senator Dodd and I were drafting this amendment, I \nspecifically added the phrase ``and other foreign nationals accused of \ngenocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity'' to ensure that this \nsection would apply to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC \ncurrently has jurisdiction over these three crimes.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the importance of this phrase was not lost on \nthe House, and opponents of the Dodd-Warner amendment tried repeatedly \nto nullify or remove it. It was even reported to me that, at the \neleventh hour, House staff members sought, unsuccessfully, to insert \nthe word ``other'' before the phrase ``international efforts to bring \nto justice . . .'', in an attempt to prevent the Dodd-Warner amendment \nfrom applying to the ICC and heavily qualifying portions of ASPA.\n  Another important phrase in section 2015 is: ``Nothing in this title \nshall prohibit . . .'', which makes unequivocally clear that no \nprovision in ASPA prevents the U.S. from cooperating with the ICC in \ncases involving foreign nations.\n  No one disputes the fact that Congress has serious concerns about \nAmericans coming before the ICC, which is the reason that ASPA was \npassed. During consideration of ASPA, Senator Warner made that point \nclear:\n\n       This amendment would protect U.S. military personnel and \n     other elected and appointed officials of the U.S. government \n     against potential criminal prosecution by an international \n     tribunal court to which the United States is not a party.\n\n  However, through the Dodd-Warner amendment, Congress sets a different \nstandard with respect to non-Americans. Congress wanted to be clear \nthat the U.S. can cooperate with international efforts, including those \nby the ICC, to bring foreign nationals to justice for genocide, war \ncrimes, and crimes against humanity, as Senator Dodd pointed out during \nthe Senate debate:\n\n       My amendment merely says that despite whatever else we have \n     said, when it comes to prosecuting these people, we would \n     participate and help, even though we are not a signatory or \n     participant in the International Criminal Court.\n\n  This is precisely why the Senate unanimously accepted the Dodd \namendment and why the lead sponsor of ASPA, Senator Warner, joined as \nco-sponsor of the amendment.\n  I see that Chairman Byrd is here on the floor and I would ask if he \nagrees with my recollection of events that transpired during the \nconference negotiations on the Supplemental and my interpretation of \nthe Dodd-Warner amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with what Senator Leahy has said about section 2015 \nof the Supplemental Appropriations bill. The House strongly resisted \nefforts to incorporate the Dodd-Warner amendment in the bill, and \nreceded only in exchange for the Senate agreeing to drop a provision on \nUNFPA.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman. I want to take this opportunity to \nsay a few words about the importance of section 2015. A primary reason \nfor the creation of the ICC is to remove the uncertainty and protracted \nnegotiations surrounding the establishment of ad hoc tribunals to try \nthose accused of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. In \nthe future, the ICC may be the only venue for bringing to justice those \naccused of these heinous crimes.\n  The Dodd-Warner amendment simply ensures that the United States can \nassist the ICC, or other international efforts, to try foreign \nnationals accused of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. \nIt is not difficult to think of a number of instances when it would be \nin the interest of the United States to support such efforts. For \nexample:\n\n  What if 50 Americans, traveling overseas, are brutally killed by a \nsuicide bomber and the ICC attempts to bring to justice the \nperpetrators of this horrendous act?\n  What if a group of terrorists commits war crimes against U.S. \nmilitary personnel who are posted abroad and the ICC is involved with \nefforts to bring them to justice?\n  What if the ICC prosecutes some future Saddam Hussein, Slobodan \nMilosovic, or Osama bin Laden who is responsible for the deaths of \nthousands of people?\n  Would we want the President of the United States to be hamstrung by \nASPA in these, or a number of other cases, and prevented from actively \nsupporting efforts by the ICC to bring\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nthese types of notorious criminals to justice? Of course not.\n  Finally, I want to point out that Mr. Hyde also goes to great lengths \nto provide an interpretation of sections 2004, 2006, and 2011. Although \nI was not involved with the negotiations on ASPA with the \nAdministration, I must say that the State Department's efforts with the \nHouse on this issue were miserable, and I know this is not typical of \nthe way the Department represents U.S. interests abroad.\n  The explanation that the State Department offers for supporting ASPA \nis that it did so in exchange for releasing the U.N. dues. This does \nnot withstand the most basic scrutiny.\n  In the wake of the September 11 attacks, there was overwhelming \nsupport in Congress to assist with efforts to prevent and respond to \ninternational terrorism. After September 11, without any quid-pro-quo, \nthe Senate voted to confirm Ambassador John Negroponte to the position \nof U.S. representative to the United Nations. I am confident that the \nState Department, with a little ingenuity, could have persuaded the \nRepublican majority in the House to meet our obligations to the United \nNations--something that is clearly in our national security interests--\nwithout having to agree to support ASPA.\n  In any event, I take issue with Mr. Hyde's interpretation of sections \n2004, 2006, and 2011, even though they are heavily qualified by the \nDodd-Warner amendment. Again, one should look to legislative history \nonly if the text of the provision is unclear, and in this case the text \nof ASPA is clear and does not support his reading. For example, there \nis nothing in the waiver language concerning the President's executive \nauthority or authority as Commander-in-Chief that limits the waiver to \na subset of this authority. Moreover, ASPA clearly states that the \nwaiver applies to ``any action or actions . . .'' not to ``some'' \nactions.\n\n  For Mr. Hyde's interpretation to be correct it would be necessary to \nadd language to the provision such as: ``if it would be \nunconstitutional for Congress to restrict the exercise of this \nauthority.'' Moreover, ASPA states that it applies to ``any action'' \ntaken by the President as Commander-in-Chief or exercising ``the \nexecutive power'' of the Presidency. If the President has the \nconstitutional authority to take an action, this provision permits him \nto do so, notwithstanding any other language in the bill. It is not \nrelevant whether Congress could have prohibited such actions.\n  Further, no matter what was said between those who negotiated ASPA, \nMr. Hyde's interpretation of the provision was not necessarily in the \nminds of the majority of Members voting on ASPA because it simply was \nnot mentioned during the House or Senate debates. These waiver \nprovisions complement section 2015 which is highly relevant in \ninterpreting them, as Senator Warner alluded to during the Senate \ndebate. Congress decided that it did not want to tie the President's \nhands if he determined that it makes sense for the United States to \ncooperate with any international body, including the ICC, in \nprosecuting foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes, and \ncrimes against humanity.\n  I want to thank Senators Dodd and Warner for their efforts to ensure \nthat ASPA does not include overly-burdensome restrictions on the \nPresident that prevent the U.S. from cooperating with the ICC. I also \nwant to thank Senator Dodd's staff for providing valuable advice on \nthis issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7860-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ARTICLE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to include in the Record \ntoday an inspiring and uplifting occurrence in my home State of New \nMexico. Percent news from any Army Corps of Engineers publication, \nEngineer Update, provides a particular instance in which the Corps went \nthe extra mile to successfully rescue sand hill cranes under uncommon \ncircumstances.\n  In the middle of repairs on Jemez Dam the cranes were foraging for \nfood and getting trapped in the mud left over from having to drain the \nreservoir. The depth of the mud and the size and nature of the cranes \nmade the situation extremely hazardous for anyone to get involved.\n  After bringing in a special boat that could handle the mud they were \nable to capture the birds and get them to safety where they were \ncleaned and released. All the while, the Corps put forth the measures \nto prevent anymore birds from being trapped in the mud.\n  This was an exceptional effort on the Corps of Engineers' part to \nhandle both the job at hand and the surrounding effects of their labor. \nI commend them on their concern for the environment in the midst of \ntheir already tough labor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Trapped Birds Rescued From Mud\n\n                             (By Joan Mier)\n\n\n                          albuquerque district\n\n       When Jemez reservoir was drained Nov. 1 to repair a \n     bulkhead guide on the dam, no one could have foreseen the \n     effect it would have on sand hill cranes, which were about to \n     begin their migration to the Bosque del Apache. Using Jemex, \n     about 30 miles from Albuquerque, N.M., as a stopover point on \n     their journey was common. What was not common was the \n     particular area they chose to land in when they began their \n     migration Nov. 6.\n       ``These birds land between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. The sheen on \n     the mud left behind after the reservoir drained looked like \n     water to these birds, and some of them chose to land there,'' \n     said Susan Shampine, Chief of Operations of Division. About \n     58 birds became mired in the 30-foot deep mud of the drained \n     reservoir.\n       Rescue efforts posed a couple of big challenges. First, \n     getting to the birds was problematic and risky. Second, the \n     five-foot-tall birds with long and very strong beaks can be \n     dangerous, according to biologist William DeRagon. ``The \n     beaks of sand hill cranes have been known to crack the skull \n     of a cow,'' he said.\n       District personnel located a hovercraft operator, but the \n     craft could not operate on the reservoir because of the \n     pudding-like consistency of the mud.\n       ``We also contacted the Army National guard because we were \n     thinking maybe we could use one its helicopters, but they \n     said the prop wash from the rotors would do more harm than \n     good,'' Shampine said.\n       Meanwhile, as these efforts were underway, the district \n     immediately initiated deterrent activities to prevent any \n     more cranes from landing in the mud. Spotlights, horns and \n     firecrackers were largely successful in preventing more \n     cranes from landing in the area. However, a few more became \n     trapped there, according to Ron Kneebone, project manager.\n       ``We think what happened was that cranes that landed \n     elsewhere at the reservoir would begin foraging for food at \n     dawn and wander over to the mud flats and become stuck,'' he \n     said. After that, deterrent methods were also initiated at \n     dawn.\n       Although one bird was captured on Nov. 8 and treated and \n     released at the Bosque a couple of days later, personnel were \n     not having much luck reaching the other cranes. As news of \n     the trapped birds hit the media carloads of concerned \n     citizens began showing up at Jemez interested in saving the \n     cranes.\n       ``Conditions at the reservoir were extremely dangerous,'' \n     Kneebone said. ``We certainly appreciated that people were \n     concerned, but we couldn't risk endangering human life.'' \n     Therefore, the road leading to the area was closed to the \n     public.\n       A break came when personnel contacted New Orleans District \n     and learned about an engine that could enable a regular \n     motorboat to operate in mud. The 20-horse-power engine was \n     flown in overnight from Go-Devil Outboard Motors in Baton \n     Rouge, LA.\n       ``We got it on Nov. 14 and began testing it the next day,'' \n     Kneebone said. ``That afternoon, we began recovery efforts \n     using trained volunteers and Corps personnel, and we were \n     successful in capturing nine cranes.''\n       Rescue operation continued through the migration season, \n     and 15 cranes were rescued. Of those, three died and 12 were \n     successfully treated and released.\n       Most of the rescued cranes were cleaned up and \n     rehabilitated at the Rio Grande Zoo in Albuquerque, N.M. Each \n     bird took 45 minutes just to clean because each feather had \n     to be cleaned separately, according to Melissa Stock, editor \n     of Zooscape Magazine.\n       ``It was a three-person job,'' Stock said. ``One person had \n     to hold its feet, another its legs, and then another cleaned \n     the bird.''\n       ``We received a lot of help and cooperation from other \n     agencies and organizations,'' said Kneebone. He credited the \n     Santa Ana Pueblo, which owns the land at the reservoir, U.S. \n     Air Force, and Hawks Aloft for assisting in efforts to both \n     rescue the cranes and prevent more from landing in the area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7860-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7860-S7861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LIVESTOCK DISASTER LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the conference on the farm bill, \nthe conferees threw out my bipartisan amendment on reasonable payment \nlimits. I was extremely disappointed\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nthe provision was dropped. Reasonable, legitimate payment limits were a \ntop priority to Iowa's family farmers. It is important to the farmers \nof Iowa that we fix this shortcoming of the new farm bill.\n  American's recognize the importance of the family farmer to our \nNation, and the need to provide any adequate safety net for family \nfarmers. In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under \nincreasing scrutiny.\n  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms \nreap most of the benefits of these payments. The reality is, 60 percent \nof the payments have gone to only 10 percent of our Nation's farmers.\n  What's more, the payments that have been designed to benefit small \nand medium-sized family famers have contributed to their own demise. \nUnlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and \nhave contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices, driving \nmany families off the farm.\n  The new farm bill fails to address the use of generic commodity \ncertificates which allow large farming entities to circumvent payment \nlimitations. The supposed ``reform'' in the farm bill is worthless due \nto the lack of generic certificate reform. In recent years, we have \nheard news reports about large corporate farms receiving millions of \ndollars in payments through the use of generic certificates. Generic \ncertificates do not benefit family farmers but allow the largest \nfarmers to receive unlimited payments.\n  Legitimate, reasonable payment limits are critical to family farmers \nin Iowa. I feel strongly the farm bill failed Iowa's farmers when it \nfailed to effectively address the issue of payment limitations. \nHopefully, the proposal I am introducing with Senator Enzi and Senator \nHagel will help to restore public respectability for Federal farm \nassistance by targeting this assistance to those who need it the most, \nwhile providing the much needed disaster assistance for livestock \nproducers.\n  This new proposal allow for a total of $35,000 for direct payments, \n$65,000 for counter-cyclinal payments, $150,000 for LDP/MLA payments, \nand $30,000 over the LDP limit for generic certificates.\n  This new proposal allows for a total of $35,000 for direct payments, \n$65,000 for counter-cyclical payments, $150,000 for LDP/MLA payments, \nand $30,000 over the LDP limit for generic certificates.\n  This new farm bill establishes an $80,000 limitation on direct \npayments, $130,000 on counter-cyclical payments, $150,000 on LDP/MLA \npayments, and no limitation on generic certificates.\n  The grand total for the new farm bill payments is $360,000 with \nunlimited payments through the use of generic certificates. The \ncumulative payment limit under the Enzi-Grassley legislation is \n$250,000 plus $30,000 for generic certificates.\n  There is no ``active participation'' requirement in this proposal, as \ncompared to my farm bill payment limit proposal.\n  This legislation does not eliminate the three entity rule, but it \ndoes eliminate the need for multiple entities by allowing farmers who \nchoose not to participate in multiple entities to participate at an \nequal level as those that choose to receive the same benefits from up \nto three entities.\n  This legislation finally establishes tangible transparency regarding \nthe fourth payment that only the largest farming entities utilize. That \npayment is the generic commodity certificate payment.\n  While I believe generic certificates should be eliminated, I \nunderstand the importance in developing a fourth payment limitation so \nthat my colleagues realize there is another payment. Currently, generic \ncertificates are an endless stream of funding only limited by the \nmaximum extent of commodity production by the entity receiving \npayments.\n  This legislation would help offset the cost of the much needed \nlivestock disaster assistance and help small and medium-size producers \nnationwide who are tired of the Government subsidizing large farm \nentities which drive land rent expenses to unreasonable margins due to \neconomics of scale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7861-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRESERVE THE PEDIATRIC RULE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am very pleased that today the Senate HELP Committee \nvoted unanimously to report S. 2394, the Preserve the Pediatric Rule \nAct of 2002, out of Committee, as amended by consensus language to \nassure that, for already-marketed drug, companies have an opportunity \nto conduct studies voluntarily before the rule is invoked, which is \nconsistent with current Food and Drug Administration practices.\n  Mr. DODD. Does the Senator agree that with the exception of the \nagreed-to amendment to allow a manufacturer to voluntarily study an \nalready-marketed drug before the rule is invoked, the legislation we \npassed tracks the existing language and policy of the rule, and ensures \nthat FDA and HHS will not weaken or undermine current protections for \nchildren on drug safety and labeling?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I agree.\n  Mr. DODD. Also, as the Senator will remember, last year's Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act BPCA, established a mechanism by which \ndrugs that companies did not voluntarily study would automatically be \nreferred to the National Institute of Health, HIH, to be contracted out \nfor study. Is it not Congress's intention that this tool along with the \nrule should be used to secure safety and efficacy information for kids \nas quickly as possible?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We are committed to fighting for dollars for these \nstudies, because the contracting process at NIH only works if there are \nfunds available. If there are no funds available, we must have the rule \nto ensure that we get needed studies done so that the necessary \ninformation can be added to the labels of the medicines children use. \nWould the Senator agree that the language of the amendment allows other \ntools to be used, but also makes clear that the rule will be available, \nenforceable, and unencumbered when needed?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would agree.\n  Mr. DODD. We will continue to examine the contracting process at the \nNIH to ensure that it works effectively, in conjunction with the rule, \nso that there is no delay or bottleneck in conducting the studies and \nsecuring this information for children.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct. Congress made several tools, including \nthe contracting process under the BPCA, available, but Congress never \ncontemplated the exhaustion of all the tools under BPCA before the rule \ncould be invoked. This amendment makes clear that as long as the FDA \nhas first asked a company to voluntarily conduct the study, the FDA \nwill be able to invoke the rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7861-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7861-S7862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAX RELIEF FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2762, a bill \nwhich would provide tax relief to livestock producers who are forced to \nsell off part of their herds due to drought. I would also like to \ncommend my colleague, Senator Thomas, for introducing this legislation.\n  In my home State of Montana, we are currently in our fifth year of \ndrought. Livestock producers are running out of grass for their herds \nand very few ranchers in Montana have carry over hay. Their choices are \nlimited. If ranchers can find hay, it is expensive and often hundreds \nof miles away. Their only other option is to sell off part or, in \nextreme situations, their entire herds.\n  The effect on Montana's economy can be seen in the numbers. In 2000, \nwe had 2.6 million head of cattle in my State. As of today, after two \nsevere years of drought, we have 2.4 million head of cattle. The \ndrought is equally devastating on sheep numbers. In 2000, we had \n370,000 head of sheep. Today we have 335,000 head of sheep in Montana.\n  When these cattle and sheep leave the State, the effect on the local, \nrural economies is great. Ranchers aren't buying as much feed, they are \nbuying fewer veterinary supplies, and worse yet, the ranchers may go \nout of business all together. These are ranches and herds that have \nbeen built up over generations and will be extremely difficult to \nreplace. I have heard from many ranchers these animals won't come back \nto Montana. They are gone forever.\n  I have been working on getting disaster relief for producers \nsuffering\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\nfrom drought since early last fall. I am currently a co-sponsor of a \nbill with Senator Baucus that would provide emergency funds to farmers \nand ranchers suffering crop and livestock loss. I believe Senator \nThomas' bill fits in perfectly with my earlier efforts to help our \nproducers. It is a common sense approach to a real problem.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7862-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7862-S7864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF TIMOTHY WHITE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to note the \npassing of Timothy White, who was the editor-in-chief of Billboard \nmagazine until he died unexpectedly a few weeks ago, leaving a wife and \ntwo young sons. He has been honored by many throughout the music \nindustry, particularly for his trumpeting of new, not yet famous \nartists, working to give them space in a medium generally reserved for \nthe already successful.\n  We worked with Tim on artists' rights issues, such as work-for-hire, \nduring my tenure as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. His efforts on \nbehalf of all artists will be remembered.\n  Looking to boost artists whom he felt deserved more attention, he \nwrote, ``At its high end, rock `n' roll can periodically fill in the \nhollows of this faithless era--especially when the music espouses \nvalues that carry the ring of emotional candor.'' I share the hope that \ntrue artists who offer a lift to their listeners from the weight of the \nworld will be found by those seeking the joy and inspiration music can \noffer, and note with sadness the passing of a friend of that cause, as \nI also join my friends in the music industry in extending our \ncondolences and best wishes at this difficult time to Tim's wife and \nsons. I trust they will find Tim's legacy a source of pride and solace \nin the coming months and years.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words \nabout human cloning as the Senate will soon be recessing for the month \nof August. Not only has the Senate failed to ban human cloning \naltogether, we have not had a meaningful debate on this critical issue.\n  Let me begin my remarks with an insightful and profound line in the \nmovie ``Jurassic Park,'' delivered by a mathematician played by Jeff \nGoldblum. AS the creator of the park is praising his scientific team \nfor taking science into uncharted waters, Goldblum's character \ninterrupts him. ``Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or \nnot they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.'' The Senate \nneeds to stop and think if it should.\n  In my remarks today, I will outline five reasons why the Senate \nshould vote for the Brownback-Landrieu bill which bans all human \ncloning. Let me start by saying that there has been a lot of talk about \n``the two different kinds of cloning''--that is, reproductive and \ntherapeutic. But let me be clear: All human cloning is reproductive, in \nthe sense that it creates--reproduces--a new developing human intended \nto be genetically identical to the cloned subject. The difference is \nthat one is intended to be carried to term and the other is intended to \nbe deliberately killed for its cells.\n  Therapeutic cloning is when scientists clone an embryo solely to \nutilize its stem cells either to create large ``control groups'' or to \nattempt mass production of genetically matched stem sells for treatment \nof diseases. Many of my colleagues believe that only reproductive \ncloning is immoral, but they are in favor of therapeutic cloning. They \nsay that therapeutic cloning is beneficial because it has the potential \nto help people with diseases. They don't want a cloned embryo to be \nimplanted in a woman's womb and begin to grow, but they support \ncreating the embryo and then plucking its stem cells until it dies.\n  The first reason my colleagues should vote to ban all human cloning \nis that the human embryo is a human life with a soul, whether it is \ncloned or is conceived naturally, and should be destroyed for any \nreason. There is not one person in the Senate or on the face of the \nEarth who did not begin their life as a human embryo.\n  If we allow the creation of embryos solely for their destruction, we \nwill effectively be discriminating against an entire class of human \nbeings by saying to them: I will destroy your life for the sake of \nsomeone else's or my own. If we accept the notion that some lives have \nmore value than others, if we allow scientists or doctors or \npoliticians to play God and determine which lives have value and which \ndo not, then we have demolished the very foundation upon which we have \nbuilt our freedom. Human embryos are not machines to be used for spare \nparts, all in the name of ``medical progress.'' We cannot view human \nlife as an exploitable natural resource, ripe for the harvest.\n  Some base their passion for so-called therapeutic cloning upon the \nfalse premise that what is created in the lab is not a human embryo. \nThe facts dispute these unsupported claims. Dr. John Gearhart of Johns \nHopkins University, one of the discoverers of human embryonic stem \ncells, told the President's Council on Bioethics on April 25, 2002, \nthat he thinks the product of cloning is and should be called an \n``embryo.'' He said: ``I know that you are grappling with this question \nof whether a cloned embryo created in the lab is the same thing as an \nembryo produced by egg and sperm, and whether we should call it an \n`embryo', but anything that you construct at this point in time that \nhas the properties of those structures to me is an embryo, and we \nshould not be changing vocabulary at this point in time.''\n  Even the American Medical Association believes that the clone is \nfully human. The Senate should also listen to the House of \nRepresentatives and the American public. The House passed a strong \nprohibition on human cloning last summer, and poll after poll shows \nthat the vast majority of American citizens are opposed to all human \ncloning.\n  The second reason to ban all human cloning is that there are better \nand more ethical ways to discover cures for diseases that do not \ninvolve the destruction of a human embryo, especially in light of the \nfact that cloning may not even work!\n  Almost weekly we read of amazing breakthroughs in the scientific and \nmedical communities using adult stem cells and other noncontroversial \ntissues and cells to treat human conditions. Adult stem cells are used \nwith success in more than 45 human clinical trials, while embryonic \nstem cells and stem cells from human clones have not helped a single \nperson. Here are just a few examples of the successes of adult stem \ncells:\n  Last July, the Harvard University Gazette reported that mice with \nType 1 diabetes were completely cured of their disease using adult stem \ncells. Additionally, University of Florida scientists reported recently \nthat adult rat liver stem cells can evolve into insulin- producing \npancreatic cells, a finding that has implications for the future of \ndiabetes research.\n\n  On June 15 of last year, the Globe and Mail reported that Israeli \ndoctors injected a paraplegic with her own white blood cells, and she \nregained the ability to move her toes and control her bladder.\n  In December of last year, Tissue Engineering, a medical journal, \nreported that researchers believe they will be able to use stem cells \nfound in fat to rebuild bone. If this research works, people with \nosteoporosis and other degenerative bone conditions could benefit \nsignificantly.\n  A researcher at the University of Minnesota has discovered what is \nbeing called the ultimate stem cell. The stem cells found in adult bone \nmarrow have passed every test by proving that they can form every \nsingle tissue in the body, can be grown in culture indefinitely with no \nsigns of aging, can be isolated from humans, and do not form cancerous \nmasses when injected into adults.\n  Scientists from Celmed BioSciences reported that adult neural stem \ncells taken from a patient's own central nervous system have been \nsuccessfully used to treat Parkinson's disease. Their research suggests \nthis method of using adult stem cells may possibly be useful in \ntreating a variety of other neurological conditions.\n  Scientists reported success last week in converting skin cells into \nimmune cells. This development has great promise for treating diseases \nsuch as diabetes, immune deficiencies, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and \nspinal cord injuries. When using cells from the patient's own body, the \nrisk of rejection is overcome.\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\n  Researchers found that intravenous injections of cells from human \numbilical cord blood improved the neurological and motor function of \nrats recovering from severe traumatic brain injury. The study appears \nin the June 6 issue of the journal Cell Transplantation, a special \nissue that focuses on emerging approaches in neural transplantation and \nbrain repair.\n  In fact, these ethical approaches to stem cell research are also \nsafer for patients than embryonic stem cell research because embryonic \nstem cells may cause tumors in patients, and the body may reject \nembryonic tissues in the same way the immune system rejects \ntransplanted organs. As President Bush has stated: ``the benefits of \nresearch cloning are highly speculative. Advocates of research cloning \nargue that stem cells obtained from cloned embryos would be injected \ninto a genetically identical individual without risk of tissue \nrejection. But there is evidence, based on animal studies, that cells \nderived from cloned embryos may indeed be rejected.'' Embryonic stem \ncells have never been used successfully in a human trial. The haven't \neven been used to completely cure disease in a rat or a mouse.\n  With the success of adult stem cells, you do not need to clone human \nbeings. Let's invest in medical research that the entire Senate can \nsupport. There is also increasing evidence to indicate that human \ncloning may not even work! You may disagree with my moral or ethical \narguments, and you may not care how successful adult stem cell \ntherapies have been, but I hope you will at least pay attention to this \nimportant point. Let me repeat it: There is convincing evidence that \nhuman cloning may not even work.\n  The April 5, 2001, issue of Nature reports that cloning human embryos \nto harvest their stem cells is being abandoned by many researchers as \ninefficient, costly, and unnecessary. The article says that ``many \nresearchers have come to doubt whether therapeutic cloning will ever be \nefficient enough to be commercially viable.'' Noting the short supply \nof human eggs and the expense and inefficiency of cloning, the article \nconcludes that the prospects for therapeutic cloning have ``dimmed'' \nand those who still favor it are taking a ``minority view.''\n  Dr. Stuart Newman of NY Medical College noted in his March 5 Senate \ntestimony that genetically matched cells from cloning may well be \nuseless in treating conditions with a genetic basis such as juvenile \ndiabetes--because these cells will have the same genetic defect that \ncaused the problem in the first place.\n  Due to these factors, as well as advances in genetically tailoring \ncells without using cloning, many experts do not now expect therapeutic \ncloning to have a large clinical impact. In fact, this whole approach \nis said to be ``falling from favor'' among both British and American \nresearchers.\n  Last December, Michael West of Advanced Cell Technology predicted \nthat within 6 months, his company would be ready to create `magic'' \ncells that would save 3,000 lives per day because he would be able to \nclone a human embryo. However, it was later revealed that West was \nunable to garner stem cells from his cloned embryos. Scientists quickly \npronounced West's cloning experiment a failure. Dr. Donald Kennedy \nsummarized the study this way: ``This scientific effort did not succeed \nby any measure.''\n  Thomas Okarma, the chief executive of Geron Corp., a cell therapy \ncompany, has no interest in using cloned embryos to produce customized \ntreatments for disease. According to the L.A. Times, he said the odds \nfavoring success ``are vanishing small,'' and the costs are daunting. \nHe also said that it would take ``thousands of [human] eggs on an \nassembly line'' to produce a custom therapy for a single person. ``The \nprocess is a nonstarter, commercially,'' he said.\n  Let's review the headlines of what the experts say about cloning: \n``Did not succeed'', ``Falling from favor'', ``may well be useless'', \n``prospects have dimmed'', ``vanishing small'', ``did not succeed'', \nand ``nonstarter''. If I were a cloning advocate, I wouldn't want this \nto be made public.\n  Writer Wesley J. Smith says human cloning is indeed immoral. But that \nisn't the reason it will eventually be rejected. He says ``there is \nincreasing evidence that therapies based on cloned embro cells would be \nso difficult and expensive to develop and so utterly impractical to \nbring to the bedside, that the pie-in-the-sky promises which fuel the \npro-cloning side of the debate are unlikely to materialize. Not only is \nhuman cloning immoral but it may have negative utility--in other words, \nattempting to develop human cloning technologies for therapeutic use \nmay drain resources and personnel from more useful and practical \ntherapies.''\n  I want to briefly mention another form of hype that ties into the \nnotion of human cloning and its ``boundless potential.'' Let's talk \nabout the much ballyhooed fetal tissue transplantation experiments. It \nwas originally thought of as the ``ultimate cure of the future'' and \nthat interfering with these experiments was to interfere with saving \ncountless lives. Now, after 13 years of private and publicly funded \ntrials, some of the worse case scenarios have come to pass, while \nnothing of scientific value has been accomplished.\n  Today there is a thriving market in the sale of baby body parts, \nwhich I brought to light a couple of years ago. Also, the methods and \ntiming of abortions are being changed to garner better tissue for \nresearch, and the most comprehensive study on the use of fetal tissue \nto treat Parkinson's showed no overall health benefit. Research \ndescribed side effects of the treatment as ``absolutely devastating.'' \nPatients implanted with fetal tissue chewed constantly, writhed and \ntwisted, and one patient had to be put on a feeding tube because his \nspasms were too severe. Dr. Paul Greene says it best: ``no more fetal \ntransplants.'' Some panacea.\n  Gene therapy is another example of hype that not only as yielded no \nresults, but is has also been responsible for the deaths of many people \nand over 1,000 serious adverse effects. A patient's group advocate \nnoted: ``It's hardly gotten anywhere. I have been very disappointed.''\n  The only thing cloning will do is ``clone'' all the similar hype that \nhas gone before it.\n  Additionally, trials in animal cloning indicate that 95 to 99 percent \nof the embryos produced by cloning will die; of those that survive \nuntil late in pregnancy, most will be stillborn or die shortly after \nbirth. The rest may survive with unpredictable but devastating health \nproblems. In fact, a review of all the world's cloned animals suggests \nevery one of them is genetically and physically defective.\n  Four years ago, it took about 270 attempts to clone Dolly, the sheep. \nIs the Senate willing to go on record to sacrifice 270 human lives in \norder to successfully produce 1 cloned human being?\n  The third point I would like to drive home to you is the slippery \nslope argument. It is interesting to see how this debate has evolved, \nespecially when one considers last year's debate, which was about \nwhether to condone the dissection of embryos that would be destroyed \nanyway. This year's debate is about whether to destroy embryos that \nwouldn't have been created otherwise. One of my colleagues, on the \nsubject of killing embryos, had this to say: ``Private companies are \ncreating embryos specifically for stem cells, and I think that's a very \nbad idea.'' However, he is now sponsoring a bill that would allow what \nhe once opposed: the creation of embryos specifically for stem cell \nresearch.\n\n  If the debate alone has evolved and is subjective and prone to change \nand charging down a slippery slope, how much more so the issue of \nmedical experimentation with human beings? Many clonings supporters \nscoff at the slippery slope argument, but let's look at what is \nhappening with animal experimentation. Already scientists have taken \ncloned cow embryos past the blastocyst stage, allowed them to develop \ninto fetuses, and reimplanted their tissue back into the donor animal.\n  If we allow for therapeutic cloning--again, this is cloning where you \ngrow a cloned embryo simply to utilize its cells for medical research--\nwhy not allow cloned embryos to further develop until their organs can \nbe harvested for transplantation? If a cloned baby could save or \nimprove the lives of many people, why not sacrifice its organs for the \nsake of many other people's quality of life? The only distinction, if \nmorality and ethics are not a\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nconsideration, is a few months of time to wait for the embryos to \ndevelop.\n  It is no secret that our society wants to live forever. What would \nstop a person with financial means from cloning little versions of \nthemselves so that when they get old, they could pluck out a younger \nversion of a failing organ from their clone?\n  If we are willing to use cloned human embryos to save human lives, \nwhy shouldn't we consider sacrificing other ``less important'' people \nfor our own gain? For example, how about taking healthy organs from \npersons who are in a permanent vegetative state? What about plucking \nparts from the terminally ill, mentally retarded, or ``old'' people \npast the age of 60. I know this may sound far-fetched to my colleagues, \nbut let us ask ourselves what the Senators standing in this Chamber a \nmere 25 years ago would have thought of a debate such as the one we are \nhaving here today on human cloning. They would have thought predictions \nof deliberation on such matters were far-fetched as well.\n  Once we start down the slippery slope of creating life for \nutilitarian purposes, there is no definitive line that separates what \nwe ought and ought not to do. There are no ethical boundaries that will \nkeep scientists in check once we accept the premise that the goal of \ncuring diseases outweighs the ethical or moral value of human life. But \nonce we accept the ``anything goes'' philosophy, then ``everything \ngoes.'' When we begin to decide who should live and who should not, we \neffectively remove God from every area of our lives and our Nation. \nAfter the events of September 11, it is clear that this Nation needs \nGod more than ever.\n\n  This is to say nothing of the eventual creation of a brave new world. \nWill genes be modified to give people higher IQs or eliminate the \ntendency to be overweight? What if we inadvertently introduce \ndisastrous abnormalities into the human race? Will we introduce \nabnormalities that lead to new diseases that afflict our fellow man? \nCloning is just not worth it.\n  The fourth point to consider is that human cloning represents the \ncommodification and commercialization of human life. Some biotech firms \nhope to patent specific cloned human embryos for sale for many types of \nexperimentation--just as designer strains of cats, mice, and other \nanimals are already patented and sold as ``medical models.'' These \nfirms are amoral and will pursue whichever path provides the greatest \npotential for financial gain. They will not regulate themselves. This \nCongress bears the responsibility of regulating these companies. It is \nour duty to the American public to hold amoral corporations to a higher \nethical standard. These biotech firms are forgetting that human life is \nnot a good to be traded in the marketplace nor a means by which they \ncan profit financially.\n  The fifth and final reason we should not allow any form of human \ncloning is that it will be impossible to keep women from implanting \ncloned embryos into their wombs.\n  A ban on reproductive cloning will not work because cloning would \ntake place within the privacy of a doctor-patient relationship and \nbecause the transfer of embryos to begin a pregnancy is a simple \nprocedure. Would the woman be forced to abort the ``illegal product''? \nThis has been called the ``clone and kill'' approach because you would \nforce the woman to kill her unborn child.\n  Even the Department of Justice agrees that it is nearly impossible to \nenforce a bill that allows for the creation of human embryos for \nresearch. They said: ``Enforcing a modified cloning ban would be \nproblematic and pose certain law enforcement challenges that would be \nlessened with an outright ban on human cloning.'' And ``anything short \nof an outright ban would present other difficulties to law \nenforcement.''\n  If you think we will never see an implanted clone, think again. \nItalian fertility specialist Severino Antinori is now explicitly \nclaiming that three women are pregnant with clones. One of the \npregnancies is in its 10th week.\n  The bottom line is that if we only vote to ban reproductive cloning \nbut allow for therapeutic cloning, at some point we will start hearing \nstories of women who are pregnant with clones of their dead children, \nclones of their husband, and clones of themselves. We will have opened \nup the Pandora's box, and we will bear the responsibility for all that \nmay follow.\n  Unless humans are seen as created in God's image and endowed by Him \nwith the right to live, there will be no stopping the scientists and \ndoctors from doing whatever they want to do.\n  We stand here today in an important moment in time. Pro-cloning \nadvocates have promoted the lofty claims of miraculous breakthroughs. \nThey play on the emotions of the ill and those who care about them, \nwhich is all of us. But just below the surface there is a dark, \nfrightening premise. They believe that science has the right to play \nGod, to create a lower form of human life to be harvested for medical \nresearch. This is ethically and morally wrong. Even science does not \nback all the hype from the pro-cloning side. There is no proof that \nsacrificing our ethics and morality to allow human cloning will even \nhelp these patients. There are better, ethical solutions.\n  Today, my colleagues, we must choose. This one decision will protect \nhuman life as we know it, or it will open the door to an ethical, \nmedical, and moral wasteland, We can help those suffering with diseases \nwithout sacrificing our Nation's core principles. To oppose any form of \nhuman cloning is to preserve the sanctity of human life while providing \nreal solutions based on real science. Let us choose what is right. We \nmust ban all human cloning, no matter how it is cloaked. Future \ngenerations will judge us based upon what we do today. We must think of \nthe future we want for our children--an ethical world that use sound, \nmoral science to heal, and that respects the dignity of every human \nlife.\n  Our country stands at a crossroads. I hope the United States will not \nfollow the road taken by God's chosen people many years ago as recorded \nin the Holy Bible: ``In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as \nhe saw fit.'' (Judges 21:25)\n  I hope and pray that the Senate will eventually ban all forms of \nhuman cloning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7864-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7864-S7865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a statement on Iraq that I gave before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Mr. HAGEL. I would like to congratulate the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Member for holding these timely hearings on Iraq. \n     I agree with my colleagues that we need a national dialogue \n     on what steps we should take to deal with the threat posed by \n     Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Americans need to be informed about \n     the complexities and consequences of our policies in Iraq.\n       I look forward to listening to and learning from the \n     distinguished witnesses before us today about the nature and \n     urgency of the threat we face from Iraq, including their \n     evaluations of what the best policy options may be for \n     meeting this threat; the prospects for a democratic \n     transition after Saddam Hussein; and what the implications of \n     our policies in Iraq may be for the stability of the Middle \n     East and our security interests there.\n       Much of the debate by those advocating regime change \n     through military means have so far focused on the easy \n     questions. Is Saddam Hussein a ruthless tyrant who brutally \n     oppresses his own people, and who possesses weapons of mass \n     destruction that have the potential to threaten us, his \n     neighbors and our allies, including and especially Israel? \n     Yes. Do most Iraqis yearn for democratic change in Iraq? Yes, \n     they do. Can Saddam be rehabilitated? No, he cannot.\n       In my opinion, complicated and relevant questions remain to \n     be answered before making a case for war, and here is where \n     these hearings will play an important role. What is the \n     nature, and urgency, of the threat that Saddam Hussein poses \n     to the United States and Iraq's neighbors? What do we know \n     about Iraq's programs of weapons of mass destruction? There \n     have been no weapons inspectors in Iraq since December 1998. \n     Is Iraq involved in terrorist planning and activities against \n     the United States and US allies in the Middle East and \n     elsewhere?\n       What can we expect after Saddam Hussein in Iraq? What do we \n     know about the capabilities of the opposition to Saddam \n     inside Iraq? While we support a unified and democratic \n     opposition to Saddam Hussein, the arbiters of power in a \n     post-Saddam Iraq will likely be those who reside inside, \n     not outside, the country. And these individuals and groups \n     we do not know. Who are they? And where are they? These \n     are the Iraqis we need to understand, engage, and \n     eventually do business with.\n       What will be the future of Iraqi Kurdistan in a post-Saddam \n     Iraq?\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\n       How do we accomplish regime change in Iraq given the \n     complexities and challenges of the current regional \n     environment? The deep Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues; \n     our relations with Syria are proper though strained; we have \n     no relationship with Iran; Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and \n     Jordan have warned us about dangerous unintended consequences \n     if we take unilateral military action against Iraq; and \n     Afghanistan remains a piece of very difficult unfinished \n     business, an unpredictable but critical investment for the \n     United States and our allies.\n       I can think of no historical case where the United States \n     succeeded in an enterprise of such gravity and complexity as \n     regime change in Iraq without the support of a regional and \n     international coalition. We have a lot of work to do on the \n     diplomatic track. Not just for military operations against \n     Iraq, should that day come, but for the day after, when the \n     interests and intrigues of outside powers could undermine the \n     fragility of an Iraqi government in transition, whoever \n     governs in Iraq after Saddam Hussein.\n       An American military operation in Iraq could require a \n     commitment in Iraq that could last for years and extend well \n     beyond the day of Saddam's departure. The American people \n     need to understand the political, economic, and military \n     magnitude and risks that would be inevitable if we invaded \n     Iraq.\n       There was no such national dialogue or undertaking before \n     we went into Vietnam. There were many very smart, well \n     intentioned professionals, intellectuals, and strategists who \n     assured us of a US victory in Vietnam at an acceptable cost. \n     Well, eleven years, 58,000 dead, and the most humiliating \n     defeat in our nation's history later we abandoned South \n     Vietnam to the Communists.\n       Let me conclude by saying that I support regime change and \n     a democratic transition in Iraq. That's easy. The Iraqi \n     people have suffered too long, and our security and interests \n     will never be assured with Saddam Hussein in power. The tough \n     questions are when, how, with whom, and at what cost. I look \n     forward to the testimony of our witnesses over the next two \n     days on these critical questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7865-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The House of \nRepresentatives passed this bill on May 16 by a vote of 390-22.\n  The Afghan Freedom Support Act comments the United States to the \ndemocratic and economic development of Afghanistan. In addition to the \neconomic and political assistance found in Title I of the legislation, \nTitle II seeks to enhance the stability and security of Afghanistan and \nthe region by authorizing military assistance to the Afghan government \nand to certain other countries in the region, including assistance for \ncounter narcotics, crime control and police training.\n  The United States must stay actively engaged in helping Afghanistan \nthrough a very dangerous and difficult transition to stability, \nsecurity, and, ultimately, democratic government. We are at the \nbeginning of a long process. We cannot be distracted or deterred from \nthis objective. Our credibility, our word, and our security are \ndirectly linked to success in Afghanistan. And there cannot be \npolitical stability and economic development in Afghanistan without \nsecurity.\n  This legislation authorizes $2.5 billion over 4 years for economic \nand democratic development assistance for Afghanistan. This amount \nincludes Senator Lugar's proposal for a $500 million enterprise fund to \npromote job creation and private sector development. In addition, S. \n2712 authorizes up to $300 million in drawdown authority for military \nand other security assistance.\n  This legislation includes a Sense of the Congress resolution, at the \ninitiative of Senator Biden, which urges the President to commit the \nfull weight of the United States to expand the International Security \nAssistance Force (ISAF) beyond Kabul. The resolution calls for $1 \nbillion to support ISAF expansion for FY 2003 and FY 2004, if the \nPresident makes that call.\n  The main elements of the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act are as \nfollows:\n  It authorizes continued efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in \nAfghanistan and among Afghan refugees in neighboring countries;\n  It also authorizes resources to help the Afghan government fight the \nproduction and flow of illicit narcotics;\n  It assists efforts to achieve a broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-\nsensitive, and fully representative government in Afghanistan;\n  It supports strengthening the capabilities of the Afghan Government \nto develop projects and programs that meet the needs of the Afghan \npeople;\n  It supports the reconstruction of Afghanistan through creating jobs, \nclearing landmines, and rebuilding the agriculture sector, the health \ncare system, and the educational system of Afghanistan; and\n  It provides resources to the Ministry for Women's Affairs of \nAfghanistan to carry out its responsibilities for legal advocacy, \neducation, vocational training, and women's health programs.\n  This legislation also strongly urges the President to designate \nwithin the State Department an ambassadorial-level coordinator to \noversee and implement these programs and to advance United States \ninterests in Afghanistan, including coordination with other countries \nand international organizations with respect to assistance to \nAfghanistan.\n  In general, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act provides a \nconstructive, strategic framework for our Afghan policy, and flexible \nauthority for the President to implement it.\n  Let me add that this legislation is explicitly and strongly committed \nto increasing the participation of women in Afghan politics. One of the \n``principles of assistance'' of this bill states that ``Assistance \nshould increase the participation of women at the national, regional, \nand local levels in Afghanistan, wherever feasible, by enhancing the \nrole of women in decision-making processes, as well as by providing \nsupport for programs that aim to expand economic and educational \nopportunities and health programs for women and educational and health \nprograms for girls.''\n\n  We must not allow the Afghan government of President Karzai to \nunwind. The United States must make the necessary investment of \nresources to help stabilize and secure Afghanistan in order to support \na democratic transition there. This bill addresses an urgent need. It \nis critical to America's security interest in Afghanistan and Central \nAsia. If Afghanistan goes backward, this will be a defeat for our war \non terrorism, for the people desiring freedom in Afghanistan and in \nCentral Asia, and for America symbolically in the world. This defeat \nwould undermine the confidence in America's word around the world. \nAfghanistan is the first battle in our war on terrorism. We must not \nfail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7865-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7865-S7866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARY JANE SMALL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the work of the Senate would be impossible \nwere it not for the talents and tireless efforts of our staffs. These \nare the men and women who serve behind the scenes, with few \nexpectations of reward save for the opportunity to make a difference.\n  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge a member of my staff who \nhas worked for me on behalf of the people of West Virginia for 25 \nyears. Mary Jane Small joined my staff on August 1, 1977. I was \nMajority Leader at the time.\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\n  She came to my office with 6 years of Capitol Hill experience, having \nworked for Congressman Ed Jones of Tennessee and then-Congresswoman \nBarbara Mikulski from Mary Jane's own home town of Baltimore, MD.\n  Over the years, Mary Jane Small has worked in my legislative \ndepartment, providing a much-valued link between my Washington office \nand the people of West Virginia. There have been a lot of changes in \nhow Senators correspond with constituents since the time Mary Jane \nstarted working for me.\n  Back in 1977, no one had heard of e-mail. We did not have fax \nmachines. Mary Jane joined my staff before we had computers. She was \nwith me in the days when we produced letters the old-fashioned way--on \ntypewriters--which must seem archaic to the younger generation of \nCapitol Hill staff.\n  But despite the lack of telecommunications and high-tech gadgetry, \nour staffs produced quantity and quality. I am proud to count Mary Jane \nas one of those staff members who has been with me through so much \nchange. And though times are different, she still shines with the \nenthusiasm and drive that she had when she first joined my staff.\n  The work of Senators will be recorded in history. Our names, our \nspeeches, our legislative accomplishments will have been printed in \nnewspaper articles and in the Congressional Record. But most of the men \nand women who have toiled on our staffs will never get any public \nnotice of their devoted service to their fellow citizens. Twenty-five \nyears of Senate service is certainly deserving of recognition.\n  I thank Mary Jane for her dedication to the people of the State of \nWest Virginia and for the work she has done for our country. And I look \nforward to the next 25 years with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7866-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORIAM: HILDA MARCIN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share with the \nSenate the memory of one of my constituents, Hilda Marcin, who lost her \nlife on September 11, 2001. Mrs. Marcin was 79 years old when the \nflight she was on, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked by \nterrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field, \nkilling everyone on board.\n  Mrs. Marcin was born in Schwedelbach, Germany. When she was 7 years \nold, her family emigrated to the United States to escape oppression. \nLike many immigrants, her family left all possessions behind and came \nonly with the clothes on their backs.\n  Her family settled in Irvington, New Jersey, where she attended local \nschools. She worked seven days a week in the payroll department of the \nNew Jersey shipyards during World War II.\n  A friend arranged a blind date with Edward Marcin and they were \nmarried on February 13, 1943. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and \nCarole. The Marcin family enjoyed participating in school functions, \nclass trips, the PTA, and various church activities. Mr. and Mrs. \nMarcin were also socially and politically active in Irvington. Mrs. \nMarcin later worked as a special education teacher's aide.\n  Hilda Marcin embraced life with enthusiasm and made the most of every \nminute. She adored her family and her granddaughter, Melissa Kemmerer \nLata. She was an inspiration to those she touched, including the \nspecial needs children in the school where she worked. Her friends \nadmired her positive attitude and her desire and ability to continue \nworking during the later years of her life. Mrs. Marcin treasured \nfreedom and democracy, and her American citizenship.\n  At the time of her death, Mrs. Marcin was flying to San Francisco to \nlive with her younger daughter, Carole O'Hare. She is survived by her \ndaughter, Elizabeth Kemmerer and son-in-law Raymond Kemmerer; daughter \nCarole O'Hare and son-in-law Thomas O'Hare; and granddaughter Melissa \nLata and Melissa's husband, Edward Lata.\n  Mr. President, none of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, \nand many Californians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic \nday. Some were trapped in the World Trade Center towers. Some were at \nwork in the Pentagon. And the fates of some were sealed as they boarded \nplanes bound for San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n  I offer today this tribute to one of the 51 Californians who perished \non that awful morning. I want to assure the family of Hilda Marcin, and \nthe families of all the victims, that their fathers and mothers, sons \nand daughters, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters will not be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7866-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7866-S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to help bring attention back to \nthe issue of fiscal discipline and protecting Social Security and \nMedicare for the generation to come.\n  All parents want the best for their children. Parents will scrimp and \nsave so that they can take care of their kids, buy them new clothes, \nand help them go to school. We do it because we love our children, and \nbecause it's the right thing to do.\n  On a societal level, we are doing exactly the opposite. Rather than \nsaving for the future needs of the next generation, rather than paying \ndown debt to prepare for their future needs, rather than investing in \nassets now so that we will be better able to provide for the next \ngeneration, the Government instead has decided to spend its resources \nand more on current consumption. And that's the wrong thing to do.\n  When we can see our children's faces and hear their dreams, we try to \ndo whatever we can for them. But when we act as a society, when we make \ngovernment policy, we seem unable to control our appetites for current \nconsumption, we seem unable to do anything for the millions of our \nchildren's generation. And that is simply, on a moral level, the wrong \nthing to do.\n  For when we in this generation choose to spend on current consumption \nand to accumulate debt for our children's generation to pay, we do \nnothing less than rob our children of their own choices. We make our \nchoices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with debts that they \nmust pay from their tax dollars and the sweat of their brow.\n  On top of that, the demographic wave of the baby boom generation adds \nanother burden on our children's generation. We know now--there is no \ndoubt about it--that our generation will retire in large numbers \nbeginning in the next decade. By the nature of older age, we know that \nour generation will require increased spending on income support and \nhealth in the decade to come and thereafter. And by the nature of the \nSocial Security system, and by the nature of Medicare and Medicaid, we \nknow that the Government will have greatly increased obligations to \nfund. Even if we as a society choose to provide the baby boom \ngeneration with exactly the same benefits that society provided our \nfather's and mother's generation, even if we do not provide for \nMedicare coverage of prescription drugs--and I believe that we should \nprovide those benefits--we as a society will need to devote greater \nresources to these important programs.\n  We could at least in part prepare for those needs by paying down our \nGovernment debt now, so that the Government would have greater freedom \nto borrow in the decades to come. Some suggest that we could at least \nin part prepare for those needs by accumulating financial assets now, \nwhich the Government could sell in the future as an alternative to \nraising taxes in the future. These actions would be the functional \nequivalent of saving by the Government.\n  In the last year and a half, we have done exactly the opposite. We \nhave chosen to do the functional equivalent of binge consumption. The \nGovernment has gone on a spending spree.\n  In February of last year, the Bush administration's Office of \nManagement and Budget started with a baseline projection that the \nGovernment would run a surplus of $282 billion in this year, fiscal \nyear 2002. Earlier this month, in contrast, the OMB projected that we \nwill in reality run a deficit of $165 billion this year, a difference \nof $447 billion between their initial baseline projections and their \nlatest predictions for one year alone. In less than a year and a half, \nthe deficit picture for this year alone has clouded by nearly half a \ntrillion dollars.\n  The Bush administration's own numbers tell a similar story for the \ndecade as a whole. Last February, the OMB projected baseline surpluses \nof $5.6 trillion for the 10 years to come. Looking\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nat the data that the OMB provided the Budget Committees along with the \nOMB's Mid-Session Review of the Budget, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities calculated that $3.9 trillion of that 10-year surplus has \nevaporated, and that the Administration seeks an additional $1.3 \ntrillion in tax cuts and spending increases over the same period. Thus, \nby the OMB's own numbers, in the past 17 months, we have dissipated \nnearly all of the surplus for the decade to come.\n  Putting the receipts of the Social Security Trust Funds aside, last \nFebruary, the OMB's baseline projections showed the Government running \nsurpluses throughout the decade. This month, the OMB policy projections \nshow the non-Social Security budget running deficits through 2012, and \nprobably for decades thereafter.\n  Thus, instead of reducing the Federal debt, we are adding to the debt \nthat our children's generation must pay. Instead of saving for the \nfuture, we are consuming future resources for ourselves.\n  The causes and solutions to these circumstances are simple to see, \nalthough clearly, amassing the political will to act on them is far \nless simple to do. Plainly, last year's tax cut was too large, and the \nGovernment is spending too much. To meet our obligations to our \nchildren's generation, we should address both failings.\n  By the OMB's own numbers, fully 38 percent of the reduction in \nsurplus over the coming decade results from last year's tax cut. Two-\nfifths of our problem results from that tax cut.\n  Now that the fiscal realities have come home to roost, we should \nreevaluate future tax cuts. This is not to say that we should require \nanyone to pay higher taxes than they do now. To contribute mightily to \nour fiscal responsibility, we do not need to raise people's taxes \nhigher than they pay now. If we simply keep future, additional tax cuts \nthat benefit the highest income brackets from taking place, we would go \na long way toward balancing the budget.\n  According to Citizens for Tax Justice, if we simply froze tax rates \nfor the top 1 percent of the income scale, it would save almost half of \nthe loss to the Treasury from the tax cut in future years, once the tax \ncut is fully phased in. Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that $477 \nbillion of last year's tax cut will go to the top 1 percent of the \nincome scale. That's an average tax cut of $342,000 each for taxpayers \nin that category, over the decade to come. And while the well-off have \nreceived some of those tax cuts already, as have most taxpayers, fully \n80 percent of the tax cuts for the top 1 percent are scheduled to take \neffect in years after this year--most after 2005. There is still time \nto correct this unbalanced tax cut, without raising anyone's tax rates \nhigher than today's.\n  Additional discipline is needed not only on the tax side, but also on \nthe spending side. According to OMB's new numbers, spending for this \nyear, fiscal year 2002, is up 11 percent over last year's levels. And \nas we have not enacted caps for 2003, we are at great risk of \ncontinuing these unsustainably large increases in spending into the \nfuture.\n  Some have pointed to the fight against terrorism as reason enough for \nsuch spending levels. But we cannot make the fight against terrorism \nbear the vast weight of the entire Government's spending.\n  We should not exempt military spending from its due scrutiny, but I \ndo not propose that we constrain military spending alone. We should \nconstrain both military and domestic spending. We need to put some \nconstraint on spending levels, or they will continue to add to the \nFederal debt.\n  The Federal Government's budget is obese. We can exercise some \nwillpower now and cut back our consumption, or the doctors will put us \non a far stricter diet later. And surely the credit markets and the \neconomy will be a rigorous doctor. We delude ourselves if we imagine \nthat the need to cut back will not come.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have twice come to the floor this year \nto offer amendments to extend the spending caps in the budget law, on \nJune 5 with Senator Gregg and on June 20 with Senator Conrad. Although \nneither effort obtained the necessary 60 votes, the Gregg-Feingold \namendment received 49 votes, and the Feingold-Conrad amendment received \n59 votes. And between the two amendments, 91 Senators have voted for \ncaps of one duration or another.\n  To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, we as a Senate have established \nthat we are for caps. We are just haggling over the price.\n  I assert to my colleagues that caps at any level are better than no \ncaps at all. We must have some restraint, or the Government will grow \nbeyond any limit.\n  We need to strengthen our budget process, to get the Government out \nof the business of using Social Security surpluses to fund other \nGovernment spending.\n  That is a goal with a long and bipartisan history. In his January \n1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton called on the \nGovernment to ``save Social Security first.''\n  That is also what President George W. Bush said in a March 2001 radio \naddress, that we need to, in his words, ``keep the promise of Social \nSecurity and keep the Government from raiding the Social Security \nsurplus.''\n  We should stop using Social Security surpluses to fund the rest of \nGovernment because it is the moral thing to do. For every dollar that \nwe add to the Federal debt is another dollar that our children must pay \nback in higher taxes or fewer Government benefits.\n  Our children's generation will not forgive us for our failure of \nfiscal responsibility. History will not forgive us, if we fail to act.\n  The task before us is plain. We must restrain future tax cuts, and we \nmust restrain future spending.\n  The task before us is not too difficult for us to achieve. We saw in \nthe 1990s that when the Government balanced its budget, invested in \neducation, and regulated business sensibly, it combined to lower \ninterest rates, bolster consumer and investor confidence, and help the \neconomy grow. We can do that again.\n  We are not the first generation who has been asked to live with \nsacrifice. And the sacrifices that are asked of us are by far not the \nhardest with which generations have lived.\n  All parents want the best for their children. Let us act on behalf of \nour children not just as individuals, but as a generation, as well. Let \nus return to fiscal discipline. And let us restore to our children's \ngeneration the freedom to choose their own future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7867-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7867-S7868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORIAM: DEORA BODLEY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

As a high school student, she \nvisited local high schools to discuss HIV/AIDS with her peers. She \nvolunteered with the Special Olympics and a local animal shelter. Chris \nSchuck, her English teacher at La Jolla Country Day School, recalls \n``Deora was always thinking big and going after big game.''\n  At the time of her death, Ms. Bodley was studying psychology at Santa \nClara University. She coordinated volunteers in a literacy program for \nelementary school students. Kathy Almazol, principal at St. Clare \nCatholic Elementary, recalls Ms. Bodley had ``a phenomenal ability to \nwork with people, including the children she read to, her peer \nvolunteers, the school administrators and teachers. We have 68 kids who \nhad a personal association with Deora.''\n  In the words of her mother, Deborah Borza, ``Deora has always been \nabout peace.'' At the tender age of 11 years, Deora wrote in her \njournal, ``People ask who, what, where, when, why, how. I ask peace.'' \nA warm and generous person, Deora was a gifted student and a wonderful \nfriend. Wherever she went, her light shined brightly.\n  Deora's father, Derrill Bodley, of Stockton, CA, feels her life was \nabout ``getting along'' and sharing a message of peace.

Mr. President, the people of Macedonia and Montenegro \nwill participate in parliamentary elections-on September 15 and October \n6, respectively. Given recent history in that region, the successful \nconduct of these polls is in the security interests of both the United \nStates and all of southeastern Europe.\n  Free and fair elections in Macedonia could serve as the beginnings of \na new chapter for that country. It was only last year that ethnic \ngrievances in Macedonia turned violent, resulting in deaths, \ncasualties, and thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. \nWhile on the mend, successful elections could prove to be a critical \nmilestone for both the people of Macedonia and the international \ncommunity.\n  A major challenge for the Government of Macedonia and all political \nparties is to earn the trust and confidence of the electorate before \nthe first ballots are cast. Let me be clear: there is no room for \nelection chicanery and violence.\n  The Government of Macedonia should be aware that the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, increased \nfiscal year 2003 funding provided to the Assistance for Eastern Europe \nand Baltic States, SEED, account. The subcommittee has suggested that \nadditional funds be provided to Macedonia--over and above the \nadministration's request, but our continued support will be gauged by \nthe successful conduct of the September polls.\n  In Montenegro, I am troubled by Parliament's recent amendments to the \nelection and public information laws, and the method by which these \nchanges were made. In the past, Parliament utilized a process of \nconsensus and agreement when deliberating election-related issues, \nwhich helped create a democratic and stable framework for contentious \npolls. Last month, the majority coalition in Parliament disregarded \npast practices and the technical advice of the international community \nand muscled through changes to the laws. Such heavy-handedness \nundoubtedly sours the preelection environment, and raise suspicions and \npolitical tensions.\n  The amendments to the laws are equally troubling, particularly for \nthe ethnic-Albanian community whose reserved seats in Parliament were \nreduced from five to four. The majority coalition in Parliament \nempowered themselves to appoint members to national and local election \ncommissions, permitting total and partisan control over the electoral \nprocess. Further, changes to the laws prohibit pollwatchers to question \nor challenge officials on the conduct of the poll on election day, and \nprivate media is banned from accepting paid advertising from political \nparties.\n  Let me close by strongly encouraging the State Department, along with \nthe OSCE, to take appropriate actions to ensure free and fair elections \nin Montenegro. I will continue to closely follow developments in that \nregion, as well as the reports and updates issued by the International \nRepublican Institute and the National Democratic Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7868-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORIAM: NICOLE CAROL MILLER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

She took \ngreat joy in life and exemplified this with her wonderful outlook and \ntenacious personality. Nicole's radiant smile could light up a room and \nshe energized those around her. She knew how to be an outstanding \nfriend.\n  Nicole was blessed with two families. Her father and stepmother, \nDavid and Catherine Miller of Chico, California and her mother and \nstepfather, Cathy and Wayne Stefani, Sr., of San Jose, California.\n  In her father's words, ``She had that sweet baby quality. She could \nmake you smile and forget your troubles for a little bit.'' Friend \nHeidi Barnes describes Nicole as ``very friendly and welcoming. She had \na big heart and it was open to everyone.''\n  She lived in San Jose, CA, with her mother and stepfather, Cathy and \nWayne Stefani, Sr. She attended local schools and graduated from \nPioneer High School in 1998. A talented softball player during all four \nyears of high school, Nicole won a college softball scholarship during \nher senior year. Even though she had never been a competitive swimmer, \nshe tried out for the Pioneer High swim team as a freshman and made the \nteam.\n  At the time of her tragic death, she was a dean's list student at \nWest Valley College in Saratoga, working part-time and weighing whether \nto transfer to California State University at Chico or San Jose State \nUniversity.\n  Nicole is survived by her mother, Cathy M.

PENNINGER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with the Senate the memory of one of my constituents, Robert \nPenninger, who lost his life on September 11, 2001. Mr. Penninger was \n63 years old when the plane he was on, American Airlines Flight 77, was \nhijacked by terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into the \nPentagon, killing everyone on board.\n  Robert ``Bob'' Penninger grew up in Chicago, IL. He earned a Bachelor \nof Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University and \nreceived a Masters Degree in Business Administration from Northeastern \nUniversity. After graduating from college, he married his wife Janet \nand they raised their daughter, Karen, in Massachusetts. At the time of \nhis tragic death, Bob was working as an electrical engineer for the \ndefense contractor BAE Systems in Rancho Bernardo, CA, and was \nreturning home from a business trip on September 11.\n  Mr. Penninger lived life to the fullest and is greatly missed by all \nwho knew him. His wife, Janet, recalls, ``Bob was always willing to \nhelp everyone he met. He was a great storyteller and he always had a \nsmile on his face and a cheery hello for all.'' Mr. Penninger enjoyed \nmotorcycle trips with his wife and friends. He also loved taking his \n1999 Electric Green Cobra Mustang convertible to car shows, where he \nwon many trophies.\n  Kit Young lived next door to Penninger for eight years and remarked, \n``Bob brought a lot of joy to this neighborhood. He developed a special \nrelationship with my 11-year-old\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\ngrandson, Sean. He took my grandson to a car show in Los Angeles and \nthey were planning another outing. A lot of people wouldn't care \nanything about an 11-year-old kid, but Bob did.''\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day.

Mr. President, just over four years ago, the U.S. \nPostal Service began issuing semipostal stamps to raise money for \nbreast cancer research. The breast cancer research stamp is the first \npostal stamp in our Nation's history to raise funds for a special \ncause. Since its inception in the summer of 1998, the program has \nraised over $27.2 million for research.\n  The stamp is just as strong today as it was 4 years ago when Congress \npassed legislation I introduced based on a creative idea of my \nconstituent, Dr. Ernie Bodai, and the hard efforts of others, including \nBetsy Mullen of the Women's Information Network Against Breast Cancer \nand the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\n  The price of a breast cancer research stamp recently increased to \nkeep pace with the cost of first class mail, ensuring that breast \ncancer research will continue to reap the benefits of the stamp's \nsuccess.\n  It has also focused public awareness on a devastating disease and \nprovided a symbol of hope and strength to breast cancer survivors, \ntheir loved ones, and others who care about eradicating breast cancer \nas a life-threatening disease.\n  I am pleased to announce today that the concept of a semipostal \nbreast cancer research stamp has now spread across international \nborders. The country of Italy recently has followed the United States \nlead and is issuing a semipostal stamp for breast cancer research.\n  Breast cancer is not just an American problem, but it is also a \nglobal problem. Approximately 250,000 new cases of breast cancer are \ndiagnosed annually in the European Union. Each year, in Italy alone, \nmore than 30,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 11,000 die \nof this disease.\n  Modeled after the U.S. version, the Italian stamp is priced above the \nvalue of a first class letter with proceeds dedicated to the battle \nagainst breast cancer. Converted into U.S. dollars, approximately 20 \ncents for each letter sent with the new semipostal will be used to \nfight breast cancer. In total, Italy expects to raise approximately \n$2.5 million dollars for breast cancer research, education, screening \nand treatment programs throughout the country.\n  Italy's new semipostal stamp, which will be available through 2003, \ncommemorates the 50th anniversary of the death of Queen Elena di \nSavoia, whose philanthropic efforts included funding the first cancer \ncenter in Italy. Approximately 12.5 million stamps will be produced.\n  I am pleased that lessons we have learned from the launch of the U.S. \nbreast cancer stamp are being applied in Italy. I would especially like \nto commend the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation for its efforts \nto make the Italian stamp the success that it is here in the United \nStates. In the words of Nancy Macgregor, the Komen Foundation's \nInternational Director: ``Breast cancer knows no boundaries, and Italy \nis no exception.''\n  I wish Italy the same success with its semipostal that we continue to \nenjoy here in the United States. Working together and building on each \nother's successes, we increase our strength in the battle against \nbreast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7869-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7869-S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF D. BROOKS SMITH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nstatement on July 30, 2002, on the nomination of D. Brooks Smith, \nlocated on pages S7553-S7558, that three letters be printed in the \nRecord. The letters are: resolution from the City Council of \nPhiladelphia; Monroe Freedman, Professor of Legal Ethics, Hofstra \nUniversity and; Stephen Gillers, Vice Dean and Professor of Law, New \nYork University.\n  There being no objection, the letters was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The nomination of Pennsylvania district court \n     Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals \n     in Philadelphia was voted out of the U.S. Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on May 23, 2002 by a 12-7; and\n       Whereas, Judge Smith's nomination is opposed by a wide \n     range of public interest organizations. Among the \n     organizations that have formally expressed opposition to \n     Smith's appeals court nomination are People For the American \n     Way, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP, Alliance \n     for Justice, National Organization for Women, Community \n     Rights Council, National Women's Law Center, NARAL, \n     Earthjustice, ADA Watch Action Fund, National Partnership for \n     Women & Families, Planned Parenthood, Defenders of Wildlife, \n     National Employment Law Association, Committee for Judicial \n     Independence, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, \n     Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund, Feminist \n     Majority, Friends of the Earth, Bazelon Center for Mental \n     Health Law, National Disabled Students Union, and the \n     National Council of Jewish Women; and\n       Whereas, Judge Smith's membership in a discriminatory club, \n     his failure for ten years--in violation of governing ethical \n     standards--to resign from the club despite his commitment to \n     do so during his district court confirmation hearing, and the \n     contradictory explanations he has offered for his actions all \n     raise serious issues about Smith's judgment, willingness to \n     follow rules, and candor; and\n       Whereas, Ethical questions have been raised regarding a \n     highly publicized bank fraud case involving millions of \n     dollars of public school money. Judge Smith continued to \n     preside over and issue orders in the case, even though the \n     fraud claims implicated a bank at which his wife was an \n     employee and in which he had substantial financial interests. \n     Several years later, he took on a related case, recusing \n     himself only after he was requested to do so by one of the \n     attorneys in the case, revealing only his wife's involvement \n     and not his own financial interest. On March 14, 2002, after \n     reviewing the facts and the arguments by Smith and his \n     defenders, noted legal ethics professor Monroe Freedman wrote \n     to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Smith committed \n     ``repeated and egregious violations of judicial ethics'' and \n     that Smith had been ``disingenuous before this Committee in \n     defending his unethical conduct.'' Professor Freedman \n     concluded that as a result, Smith is ``not fit to serve as a \n     Federal Circuit Judge''; and\n       Whereas, Since his appointment in 1989, Judge Smith has \n     been reversed by the court of appeals to which he has been \n     nominated 51 times. This is a larger number of reversals than \n     any of the judges approved and rejected by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee during this Congress for appellate court \n     posts, including Judge Charles Pickering. More important than \n     the number of these reversals, however, is their nature. Many \n     of these reversals concern civil and individual rights, and \n     reflect a disturbing lack of sensitivity towards such rights \n     and a failure to follow clearly established rules of law and \n     appellate court decisions; and\n       Whereas, A number of Smith's reversals have concerned \n     discrimination or other claims by employees. For example, in \n     Wicker v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 142 F.3d 690 (3rd Cir.), \n     cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1012 (1998), the court of appeals \n     unanimously reversed Smith's decision to dismiss a suit by \n     Conrail employees who claimed that years of on-the-job \n     exposure to toxic chemicals was making them sick. Smith had \n     concluded that their lawsuit was barred because they had \n     signed a waiver as part of a settlement of unrelated injury \n     claims against the railroad. The appellate court ruled that \n     Smith's ruling was contrary to the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation of federal law; and\n       Whereas, The Third Circuit unanimously reversed Smith's \n     decision in Ackerman v. Warnaco, 55 F.3d 117 (3rd Cir. 1995), \n     in which he upheld a company's unilateral denial of severance \n     benefits to more than 150 employees after they were laid off; \n     and\n       Whereas, In Colgan v. Fisher Scientific Co., 935 F.2d 1407 \n     (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 941 (1991), the appellate \n     court unanimously reversed Smith for granting summary \n     judgment against an age discrimination claim as untimely by \n     ruling that the statute of limitations began to run not when \n     the employee was terminated, but instead when he simply \n     received a negative performance review; and\n       Whereas, In Schafer v. Board of Public Educ. of the School \n     Dist. of Pittsburgh, Pa., 903 F.2d 243, 250 (3rd Cir. 1990), \n     the Third Circuit unanimously reversed Smith for dismissing a \n     claim that a school district's family leave policy improperly \n     allowed only women, not men, to take unpaid leave for \n     ``childbearing'' as well as childbirth. Based\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n     on such decisions, the National Employment Lawyers \n     Association has opposed Smith's confirmation, explaining that \n     his record displays ``an attitude inimical to employee and \n     individual civil rights''; and\n       Whereas, In other reversals involving individuals or other \n     plaintiffs against government or corporations, the Third \n     Circuit has specifically criticized Smith for abusing his \n     discretion or failing to follow the law. For example, in \n     Urrutia v. Harrisburg County Police Dept., 91 F.3d 451, 456-\n     457 (3rd Cir. 1996), the appellate court found that Smith had \n     ``abused his discretion'' in refusing to allow a prisoner to \n     amend a complaint contending that he had been repeatedly \n     stabbed while handcuffed and in the custody of police \n     officers who looked on while failing to take any action; and\n       Whereas, In Metzgar v. Playskool, 30 F.3d 459, 462 (3rd \n     Cir. 1994), three Reagan appointees reversed Smith for \n     dismissing a claim involving death by asphyxiation of a 15-\n     month-old child who had choked on a toy, noting that they \n     were ``troubled by the district court's summary judgment \n     disposition'' of his parents' claims; and\n       Whereas, In In re Chambers Development Company, 148 F.3d \n     214, 223-225 (3rd Cir. 1998), concerning a claim against a \n     county utility authority, the Third Circuit took the \n     extraordinary step of issuing a writ of mandamus--an unusual \n     direct command to a judge to rule a certain way--against \n     Judge Smith, who had ``ignored both the letter and spirit of \n     our mandate'' in a prior ruling in the case. As the court of \n     appeals explained, this was a ``drastic remedy'' that is \n     utilized only ``in response to an act amounting to a judicial \n     usurpation of power''; and\n       Whereas, Judge Smith has also been criticized for rulings \n     not later reversed on appeal. For example, the Washington \n     Post expressed concern about his decision in United States v. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565 (W.D. Pa. \n     1995), aff'd, 96 F.3d 1436 (3rd Cir. 1996), in which the \n     federal government had sued the state over allegedly \n     substandard conditions in a facility for persons with mental \n     disabilities. As the Post put it, although ``care was, in \n     Judge Smith's words, `frequently not optimal'--maggots were \n     found in one resident's ear, ants on others' bodies--the \n     judge found these to be `isolated incidents' '' and concluded \n     there was no constitutional violation. In another case, \n     Quirin v. City of Pittsburgh, 801 F. Supp. 1486 (W.D. Pa. \n     1992), the National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA) \n     found that Smith had improperly applied the ``aggressive'' \n     standard of ``strict scrutiny,'' which is reserved for claims \n     of racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination, to strike \n     down an affirmative action policy designed to remedy past \n     discrimination against women. As NELA concluded, such rulings \n     ``show a disturbing pattern of disregard and hostility for \n     the rights of minorities and protected classes,'' now \n     therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the City Council of Philadelphia, That we \n     hereby strongly urge the United States Senate to reject the \n     nomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Further Resolved, That we hereby urge Pennsylvania Senators \n     Specter and Santorum to withdraw their support for the \n     confirmation of Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this resolution be \n     sent to all members of the United States Senate as evidence \n     of the grave concern by this legislative body.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              New York University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am replying to your May 9, 2002 \n     request for my views on three issues surrounding the \n     nomination of Federal District Judge D. Brooks Smith to a \n     seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \n     Circuit. I assume familiarity with your letter and with the \n     facts, many of which have been discussed in testimony and \n     correspondence the Committee has received. I do not know \n     Judge Smith and have no interest one way or the other in \n     whether Judge Smith is confirmed. I take my facts mainly from \n     Judge Smith's testimony or his written submissions and partly \n     from other materials you have sent me and which I cite below. \n     The facts do not seem to be in dispute.\n       Briefly, my qualifications for giving my opinion on your \n     questions are: I am vice-dean and professor of law at New \n     York University School of Law, where I have taught since \n     1978. Regulation of Lawyers (``legal ethics'') is my primary \n     area of teaching and research and writing. I have taught this \n     course for a quarter century here and as a visitor at other \n     law schools. I have a leading casebook in the area, first \n     published in 1984 and now in its 6th edition. Legal ethics \n     includes the ethical responsibilities of judges and a chapter \n     of my book is devoted to those issues. I have published in \n     the area in law journals and written extensively on the \n     subject for the popular and legal press. I speak widely on \n     legal ethics before bar groups, at judicial conferences, at \n     law firms, and at corporate law departments.\n       In summary, my conclusions are:\n       A. If Spruce Creek Red and Gun Club is in fact a purely \n     social club, and not a venue in which business or \n     professional interests are pursued, then Canon 2(C) of the \n     Code of Conduct for United States Judges would not forbid a \n     federal judge to be a member of the club. On this assumption, \n     the answers to the first two questions under Part A of \n     your letter are ``yes'' (the club is exempt from the \n     prohibition against membership in an organization that \n     invidiously discriminates) and ``no'' (Judge Smith did not \n     violate the Code by maintaining membership for 11 years). \n     My answer to your third question is that Judge Smith had \n     no obligation to seek an opinion from the Advisory \n     Committee on the propriety of his membership in the club. \n     Judge Smith had the responsibility to make sure that the \n     club was and remained a purely social club and that his \n     membership was therefore allowed.\n       B. A federal judge who is invited to a privately funded \n     judicial education seminar, with expenses paid, has on \n     obligation to identify the source of funding to ensure that \n     acceptance of the gift is proper. This duty is not eliminated \n     because the sponsor of the seminar is a law school or other \n     educational institution that would not itself require the \n     judge to refuse the invitation. Funding for the seminar may \n     come from a person or entity whose generosity the judge \n     should not accept but whose contribution does not appear on \n     the face of the invitation. Consequently, Judge Smith should \n     have inquired of the sponsor of private judicial seminars he \n     attended to learn the source of funding and establish that \n     there was no impropriety in accepting the invitation under \n     the circumstances.\n       C. Your third inquiry, concerning the timing of Judge \n     Smith's recusal decisions in SEC v. Black and U.S. v. Black, \n     is quite complicated. In sum, I conclude that Judge Smith \n     should have revealed his and his wife's investment in Mid-\n     State Bank or in Keystone Financial, Inc., its holding \n     company (hereafter, collectively ``Mid-State''), not later \n     than October 27, 1997. Having failed to do so, he should have \n     made this disclosure on October 31, when he did recuse \n     himself. Failing to do so then, he should have done so as \n     soon as he knew of Mid-State's financial exposure for Black's \n     frauds so that counsel could, if advised, seek to vacate \n     Judge Smith's rulings based on a violation of the judicial \n     disqualification statute. Whether Judge Smith should have \n     recused himself on October 27 given what he says he knew at \n     the time is a more difficult question, which I address below. \n     However, I conclude that Judge Smith should have recused \n     himself on October 27 based on what he could have known and \n     should have discovered on that day. Judge Smith should have \n     recused himself form United States v. Smith as soon as it was \n     assigned to him.\n\n\n                   the spruce creek rod and gun club\n\n       Judge Smith promised more than he had to at his 1988 \n     confirmation hearings. The Code of Conduct for United States \n     Judges did not then forbid membership in purely private clubs \n     that had no business or professional purpose. Although the \n     Code was thereafter strengthened, following on amendments to \n     the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct in 1992, even as \n     strengthen the Code does not forbid membership in Spruce \n     Creek. This assumes, however, that the club has no business \n     or professional purpose or function. Of course, the \n     opportunity for club members to meet in informal, social \n     situations, to get to know each other in that way, can \n     itself be seen as professionally or commercially \n     advantageous, but that alone does not make the club's \n     discrimination ``invidious.'' Defining the line between \n     clubs that may exclude women (or men, for that matter) and \n     those that may not because they have a business or \n     professional dimension is not always easy. But there is a \n     line and it is rooted in constitutional jurisprudence.\n       I am assuming that club members sponsor no events or \n     meetings that could be characterized as business-related or \n     profession-related. If my assumptions are wrong, however, if \n     the club is not strictly social, then my conclusion will \n     change. I understand that the Committee has received \n     information that the club did allow its members to host \n     business or professional meetings. If it did, it would not be \n     purely private as I have been using that term, and its \n     discrimination against membership for women would then be \n     ``invidious'' within the meaning of the Code's prohibition. \n     This would be true even if women were allowed to attend some \n     or all business or professional meetings hosted by the club's \n     male members. Since the propriety of Judge Smith's membership \n     depended on the club maintaining a purely social purpose, he \n     had the responsibility of assuming that it has and retained \n     this status.\n       Judge Smith suggests that he reexamined his obligations \n     under the Code of Conduct in 1992, when it was revised, and \n     concluded that his 1988 promise obligated him to do more than \n     the Code required him to do. As I wrote, the post 1988 \n     amendments actually strengthened the prohibition against \n     membership in discriminatory clubs, but even as strengthened, \n     Spruce Creek does not, on the assumptions made, qualify as a \n     club that ``practices invidious discrimination on the basis \n     of . . . sex'' within the meaning of Canon 2(C).\n       Two other comments on this issue: First, while Judge Smith \n     could have asked the Advisory Committee to give him an \n     opinion on whether the club's discriminatory policy was \n     ``invidious,'' I know of no rule imposing a duty to do so. \n     Second, I realize that Judge Smith made a promise to the \n     Committee in 1988 and then seems to have concluded that\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n     he had promised more than the Code required. Whether and to \n     what extent the Committee should be influenced by Judge \n     Smith's failure to keep his promise notwithstanding this \n     later conclusion, or by the Judge's failure to inform the \n     Committee that he did not intend to keep his promise because \n     of this conclusion, is not properly a question for me.\n\n\n                      judicial education seminars\n\n       As you know, expense-paid seminars for judges has been a \n     challenging issue. The gap between judges' reactions to \n     criticism of these events and the perspectives of the critics \n     does not seem to be shrinking. Many judges are annoyed that \n     anyone would think they would compromise their objectivity \n     because of an invitation (or many invitations) to a privately \n     funded judicial seminar. Critics, on the other hand, argue \n     that only certain groups of litigants have the wherewithal to \n     support these seminars and that it diminishes the appearance \n     of justice when judges attend them at luxury resorts to hear \n     programs designed by those who can afford to sponsor them. \n     Unfortunately, we have little in the way of guidance, \n     mainly Opinion 67 of the Advisory Committee and several \n     judicial opinions, including Judge Winter's opinion in In \n     re Aguinda, 241 F.3d 194 (2d Cir. 2001). Judge Winter \n     wrote: ``[A]ccepting something of value from an \n     organization whose existence is arguably dependent upon a \n     party to litigation or counsel to a party might well cause \n     a reasonable observer to life the proverbial eyebrow. . . \n     . Judges should be wary of attending presentations \n     involving litigation that is before them or likely to come \n     before them without at the very least assuring themselves \n     that parties or counsel to the litigation are not funding \n     or controlling the presentation.'' Judge Winter cites In \n     re School Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d 764 (3d Cir. \n     1992), another leading case from Judge Smith's Circuit. \n     the judge there was disqualified after attending a \n     conference without ascertaining the source of funding for \n     it. The source made the judge's attendance improper.\n       The authorities agree that before attending an expense-paid \n     judicial seminar, a judge should learn who is picking up the \n     tab for the judge's travel and housing. This indeed is what \n     Opinion 67 says: ``It would be improper to participate in \n     such a seminar if the sponsor, or source of funding, is \n     involved in litigation, or likely to be so involved, and the \n     topics covered in the seminar are likely to be in some manner \n     related to the subject matter of litigation. If there is a \n     reasonable question concerning the propriety of \n     participation, the judge should take measures as may be \n     necessary to satisfy himself or herself that there is no \n     impropriety. To the extent that this involves obtaining \n     further information from the sponsors of the seminar, the \n     judge should make clear an intent to make the information \n     public if any question should arise concerning the propriety \n     of the judge's attention.''\n       Obviously, there would be room for much mischief if a judge \n     invited to an expense-paid judicial seminar could rely on the \n     non-profit nature of an apparently neutral sponsor to \n     immunize the judge's attendance. Judge Smith is therefore \n     wrong in his assumption, in reply to your follow-up question \n     6a, when he wrote that because ``George Mason's sponsorship \n     of LEC was apparent from the face of the materials I received \n     regarding the seminars, I conclude that no further inquiry \n     into sources of funding was required.'' If was required.\n\n\n                              sec v. black\n\n       Conflicts in the Black cases arise from the fact that the \n     Smiths owned stock in Mid-State or Keystone. How much is \n     uncertain. I understand that Judge Smith's financial \n     disclosure form In 1997 revealed between $100,000 and \n     $250,000 in stock in Keystone. The form also indicated \n     that his wife had a 401(k) account with Mid-state, where \n     she was an officer. Her account ranged between $100,000 \n     and $250,000, but Judge Smith's financial disclosure form \n     did not say where the money was invested. In answers to \n     recent questions you posed (question 14), Judge Smith \n     wrote: ``At the time in question [October 1997], my wife \n     and I held stock in Mid-state and she was employed by the \n     company.'' So now we do know that Mrs. Smith also held \n     stock in Mid-State, but we don't know how much. As a \n     result, we do know the amount of the Smiths' joint \n     holdings in Mid-State or Keystone in October 1997 and \n     thereafter or what percentage of their wealth it \n     represented.\n       Anoter basis for a possible conflict in the Black matters \n     was the fact that Mrs. Smith was an officer in Mid-State. \n     However, Judge Smith recently responded to your written \n     quesiton1 7 by stating that his wife ``was a corporate loan \n     officer for Mid-state, a position far removed from those \n     parts of the bank that had dealings with John Gardner \n     Black.''\n       In this answer,I will assume that the Smiths had a \n     substantial financial interest in Mid-State or Keystone or \n     both (it was between $100,000 and $500,000) and that that \n     interest represented a signficant portion of their wealth. No \n     submission offered by or on behalf of Judge Smith has \n     asserted otherwise and the record we have supports this \n     conclusion.\n     a. October 27, 1997\n       I want now to focus on October 27, 1997 and the weeks \n     immediately preceding:\n       On October 24, ``all investment funds were removed from \n     Mid-State Bank'' by the Trustee. Letter of Mark A. Rush, 2/\n     22/02, at 2, Judge Smith knew this because the fact is \n     recited in an order he issued October 27. Letter of Douglas \n     A. Kendall, 2/20/02, at 5.\n       In the chambers conference with the Trustee and his counsel \n     on October 27, Judge Smith was told ``that information, \n     although in its very early developmental phases, was being \n     uncovered which may change Mid-State-Bank's involvement in \n     the case from that of merely a depository of funds.'' He was \n     advised ``of only a developing but not confirmed suspicion by \n     the Trustee that Mid-State Bank's role may be more than a \n     depository.'' Rust letter at 2, 3.\n       In September and October, the press in Pennsylvania \n     reported the possibility that defrauded school districts \n     would sue Mid-state. Kendall letters, 5/10/02, at 4 and \n     exhibits. Certainly, the possibility of bank liability, or at \n     least exposure to litigation, would have been apparent to any \n     lawyer. Suits were in fact filed, starting as early as \n     October 31, 1997. Id at 4. The suit was reported in the \n     press the next day. Id.\n       Papers before Judge-Smith suggested that the bank prepared \n     reports to the school districts showing the market value of \n     their account at $157 million, while reporting to Black that \n     the market value of these accounts was only $86 million. This \n     information was in a footnote that was in an exhibit to an \n     exhibit in the papers before Judge Smith, who apparently did \n     not recognize its significance or did not see it. Reply to \n     your follow-up question 8. However, the discrepancy was \n     reported in the local press on October 31. Id. at 3.\n       In the October 27 chambers conference, Judge Smith told the \n     Trustee and his counsel ``of his wife's employment in an \n     unrelated division of Mid-State Bank.'' And the Judge \n     ``indicated an intention to consider recusing himself based \n     on the potential for a future appearance of a conflict.'' \n     Rush letter at 3. Judge Smith did not then reveal the Smiths' \n     financial interest in Mid-State or Keystone.\n       The information Judge Smith knew on October 27 required him \n     to reveal his family's financial interest before ruling on \n     the applications before him. So far as the Trustee and his \n     counsel knew, the only basis for recusal was Mrs. Smith's \n     employment in an ``unrelated division'' of the bank. That is \n     all they were told. Understandably, they did not see that as \n     a fact that required recusal or further discussion. (More on \n     this below.) But had Judge Smith revealed the Smiths' \n     financial interests in Mid-State on October 27, then the \n     Trustee and his counsel, and counsel for the school districts \n     seeking to unfreeze money held by Black in non-Mid-State \n     banks, would have been able to provide the Judge with \n     information (already in the press) about Mid-State's and \n     Keystone's potential future liability for Black's frauds. \n     Then, the footnote in the exhibit to the exhibit in the \n     papers before Judge Smith could have surfaced and its import \n     explained. Then, too, the public discussion about the \n     possibility of legal action against Mid-State could have \n     surfaced. The Trustee and counsel would then have had reason \n     to be more expansive about their statement in chambers that \n     ``Mid-State Bank's involvement in the case [may change] from \n     that of merely a depository of funds.''\n       In fact, had Judge Smith revealed not merely his wife's \n     employment in an ``unrelated division'' of the bank on \n     October 27, but also his family's substantial financial \n     investment in the bank, it would have been incumbent on \n     counsel to reveal all they knew about the bank's legal \n     exposure and to explore with the Judge whether what they \n     knew, but did not see any need to elaborate, and what Judge \n     Smith knew, but did not reveal, required recusal under \n     Section 455(b)(4), which disqualifies a judge if the judge or \n     the judge's spouse has ``any . . . interest that could be \n     substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.'' \n     Based on what parties collectively knew at the time, this \n     exploration should have led to Judge Smith's recusal on \n     October 27, before he ruled on the school districts' effort \n     to unfreeze non-Mid-State accounts in Black's control \n     (totalling about $175 million). Once Judge Smith learned of \n     the probable lawsuits against Mid-State, he would have had to \n     step out of the case. By failing to reveal his family's \n     financial interest, however, Judge Smith effectively \n     prevented the entire inquiry and led to a ruling he was \n     disqualified from making because a bank in which his \n     family had a substantial investment had an interest in the \n     ruling, as discussed further below.\n       Although I focused above on the particular ruling Judge \n     Smith made on October 27, that ruling is incidental to a more \n     imposing fact. Even if there were no application for a ruling \n     on October 27, Judge Smith should still have recused himself \n     based on information that he could and should have discovered \n     on that date. That information revealed the enormity of Mid-\n     State's potential liability. As stated above, and as reported \n     in the press in October, Mid-State's own documents showed a \n     potential shortfall of $71 million in school district funds \n     that Black had deposited with Mid-State. So I want to stress \n     that it was this exposure, and not alone the ruling Judge \n     Smith was asked to make on October 27, that required recusal \n     by that date if not sooner. In short, Judge Smith should not \n     have been sitting in a matter when, as he could have and \n     should have known, a bank in which he had a substantial \n     investment faced financial liability in tens of millions of \n     dollars. As we now know, Keystone eventually paid $51 million \n     to settle depositor claims.\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\n     b. October 31, 1997\n       On October 31, Judge Smith recused himself citing only his \n     wife's employment. He has explained to the Committee that he \n     did so because he foresaw the possibility that the bank might \n     be a source of evidence in the case. Letter of 2/25/02, at 2. \n     As stated, Judge Smith has acknowledged that his wife was in \n     a ``position far removed from those parts of the bank that \n     had any dealing with John Gardner Black.'' It is hard to \n     understand why Mrs. Smith's position caused Judge Smith to \n     recuse himself, even assuming that Mid-State officials might \n     be deposed or that Mid-State might be the source of \n     documents. At this point Judge Smith believed that the bank \n     was merely a ``depository.'' If that were all it was, it \n     should make no difference that officers or employees, from a \n     part of the bank ``unrelated'' to the one in which his wife \n     worked, might be deposed or that the bank might be a source \n     of documents. In fact, Judge Smith does not appear to believe \n     that he even had to recuse for this reason. In his answer to \n     your question 13, he wrote that he had no ``legal \n     obligation'' to recuse when he did, but did so ``out of an \n     abundance of caution.'' (See also the answer to your question \n     14.) Judge Smith acknowledges in his answer to question 18 \n     that there was a possibility that his wife might herself be a \n     witness. By failing to reveal the Smiths' investments on \n     October 31, Judge Smith denied the litigants information that \n     they could have used to overturn on October 31, Judge Smith \n     denied the litigants information that they could have used to \n     overturn his October 27 ruling refusing to unfreeze half the \n     money (about $77 million) that Black maintained in non-Mid-\n     State accounts.\n       A ruling by a judge who should have been disqualified may \n     be vacated. This is true even if the judge, when ruling, was \n     unaware of the basis for the disqualification. Liljeberg v. \n     Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.s. 847 (1988) Judge \n     Smith's rulings in SEC v. Black, and in particular his ruling \n     on October 27 refusing to unfreeze all of the non-Mid-\n     State funds in Black's control, could have been challenged \n     based on the Smiths' financial interest. However, because \n     Judge Smith did not reveal the Smiths' financial interest \n     in Mid-State on October 27, or on October 31 when the \n     Judge did recuse himself, or thereafter, parties to the \n     proceedings before him, including the school districts \n     that sought to unfreeze all of their non-Mid-State funds, \n     could not use this interest as a basis for vacating the \n     Judge's rulings. While it is true that a judge may recuse \n     without giving any reason, where there are reasons for \n     recusal that could retroactively affect the legitimacy of \n     orders already entered, the judge must reveal that \n     information so that the parties can determine whether to \n     challenge the judge's orders on this basis. Id. at 867. \n     The fact that a judge might not believe that a particular \n     fact would suffice to warrant recusal, or to warrant an \n     order vacating a ruling, is not a justification for \n     failing to make the disclosure. A judge should not, \n     through silence, be the ultimate arbiter of his or her own \n     disqualification. If a fact could reasonably support \n     disqualification or an effort to overturn a ruling, as is \n     true here, that fact should be revealed so that counsel \n     may argue it or bring it to the attention of another judge \n     or an appellate court. Id.\n     c. Events after October 31, 1997\n       Even if Judge Smith continued to believe on October 31 that \n     the bank's role was solely as a prospective witness in its \n     capacity as depository, it shortly thereafter became \n     apparent, when lawsuits were filed, that this was not so, and \n     that in fact the bank would be exposed to financial \n     liability. At that point, at least, Judge Smith should have \n     revealed the Smith's financial investment in Mid-State. While \n     it is true that Judge Smith no longer had jurisdiction over \n     SEC v. Black after October 31, he did not need jurisdiction \n     to make financial information known. So even assuming Judge \n     Smith did not realize the bank's financial exposure as of \n     October 31, which I do assume, and even assuming (which I do \n     not) that he had no duty even to explore the possibility of \n     the bank's financial exposure with counsel on October 27, \n     Judge Smith should nevertheless have revealed his family's \n     financial interest in the bank once its potential civil \n     liability became evident, as it did soon after October 31.\n       Those appealing Judge Smith's order would have benefited \n     from knowledge of the facts and amounts of the Smiths' Mid-\n     State investment because that investment meant Judge Smith \n     should not have ruled on any issue that could affect Mid-\n     State's financial exposure. The effort to unfreeze the non-\n     Mid-State money is such an issue because the more money \n     available from other sources to compensate school districts \n     with Mid-State accounts, the smaller would be Mid-State's \n     exposure. In other words, if money in non-Mid-State banks \n     could be used to compensate districts whose funds were in \n     Mid-State accounts, Mid-State could be benefited. So could \n     the Smiths as substantial investors.\n       In Liljeberg, supra, Judge Collins ruled in a case even \n     though at the time, he was a fiduciary of a non-party \n     (Loyola) that stood to gain financially from the ruling. At \n     the time he ruled, he did not know of Loyola's interest in \n     the matter, although he previously knew of it and learned of \n     it again later. The Court agreed that Judge Collins could not \n     have recused himself when he lacked knowledge of the \n     disqualifying fact. A ``judge could never be expected to \n     disqualify himself based on some fact that he does not know, \n     even though the fact is one that perhaps he should know or \n     one that people might reasonably suspect that he does know.'' \n     486 U.S. at 860. The Court then went on to hold that ``[n]o \n     one questions that Judge Collins could have disqualified \n     himself and vacated his judgment when he finally realized \n     that Loyola had an interest in the litigation.'' Id. at 861. \n     Doing so might ``promote confidence in the judiciary by \n     avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever \n     possible.'' Id. at 865. Judge Collins ``silence,'' once he \n     recalled Loyola's interest, ``deprived respondent of the \n     basis for making a timely motion for a new trial and also \n     deprived it of an issue on direct appeal.'' Id. at 867. So, \n     too, here.\n       Judge Smith no longer had jurisdiction of the case after \n     October 31, and therefore could not recuse himself or vacate \n     his orders, as the Supreme Court ruled Judge Collins could \n     have done. But once he learned of the bank's exposure, Judge \n     Smith could have taken the lesser step of informing counsel \n     of his family's financial interests in the bank. He should \n     have done this because he should have realized that the \n     following facts, once publicly known, would undermine \n     confidence in the judiciary and create the appearance of \n     impropriety. These facts are:\n       (1) Judge Smith was told on October 27 that the bank may be \n     more than a mere depository:\n       (2) papers before Judge Smith on October 27 showed a \n     substantial discrepancy between what the bank was telling \n     depositors and what the bank was telling Black;\n       (3) the press in Pennsylvania was reporting on the prospect \n     of lawsuits against the bank;\n       (4) the Smiths had a substantial financial interest in the \n     bank:\n       (5) three days prior to October 27, as Judge Smith knew, \n     the Trustee had removed all of the school district funds from \n     the bank and placed it in another institution;\n       (6) on October 27 Judge Smith made a ruling that an \n     objective observer could view as beneficial to Mid-State by \n     keeping frozen monies that might be available to compensate \n     school districts that had accounts in Mid-State;\n       (7) despite the information available to him on October 27, \n     Judge Smith made no effort to conduct a further inquiry of \n     counsel into the possible financial exposure of Mid-State or \n     reveal his family's investment in Mid-State.\n       The upshot of this is that even if we assume that as of \n     October 31 Judge Smith thought of Mid-State as merely a \n     depository whose personnel might be witnesses, nonetheless, \n     in retrospect, Judge Smith should have realized from the \n     facts itemized above that his conduct threatened confidence \n     in the impartiality of the courts and that he had to take \n     steps to correct that, Liljeberg, quoting the lower court's \n     opinion, states: ``The goal of Section 455(a) is to avoid \n     even the appearance of partiality. If it would appear to a \n     reasonable person that a judge has knowledge of facts that \n     would give him an interest in the litigation then an \n     appearance of partiality is created even though no actual \n     partiality exists because the judge does not recall the \n     facts, because the judge actually has no interest in the case \n     or because the Judge is pure in heart and incorruptible. The \n     judge's forgetfulness, however, is not the sort of \n     objectively ascertainable fact that can avoid the appearance \n     of partiality. Under section 455(a), therefore, recusal is \n     required even when a judge lacks actual knowledge of the \n     facts indicating his interest or bias in the case if a \n     reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would \n     expect that the judge would have actual knowledge.'' Id. at \n     860 (internal citations omitted). See also In re School \n     Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d at 784, quoting some of the \n     same language from Liljeberg. It is hard to fathom Judge \n     Smith's silence after October 31 even if one accepts his \n     explanations for his conduct until that time.\n\n\n                         united states v. black\n\n       This brings me to United States v. Black, the criminal case \n     against Mr. Black, assigned to Judge Smith in 1999, when Mid-\n     State's financial exposure was apparent. Judge Smith kept the \n     case for five months, until a motion to recuse him was made \n     and granted. Again judge Smith cited his wife's employment as \n     the basis for granting the motion. I don't understand why, if \n     an ``abundance of caution'' caused Judge Smith to recuse \n     himself sua sponte in SEC v. Black because of the prospect of \n     testimony from bank personnel, or because the bank might be a \n     source of documents, he did not recuse in United States v. \n     Black immediately. Be that as it may, for other reasons \n     Judge Smith should never have accepted United States v. \n     Black. First, Third Circuit precedent directly on point \n     prohibited Judge Smith from accepting the case. ``We adopt \n     the view that a judge who owns a substantial interest in \n     the victim of a crime must disqualify himself or herself \n     in the subsequent criminal proceeding because the strict \n     overarching standard imposed by Sec. 455(a) requires that \n     the appearance of impartiality be maintained.'' United \n     States v. Nobel, 696 F.2d at 231, 235 (3rd Circuit 1982). \n     This is a holding of the case and cannot be more explicit. \n     The court went on to conclude that on the particular facts \n     disqualification had been waived under Sec. 455(e). But \n     the court would not have had to consider waiver unless it \n     had first found that the judge, as an investor in the \n     defrauded institution (``INA''), was disqualified from \n     sitting in judgment of the man accused of defrauding that \n     institution.\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\n       The facts here are even stronger than the facts in Nobel. \n     Nobel also held that Sec. 455(a) would have required \n     disqualification of the trial judge even though ``by the time \n     of the criminal trial a settlement had been effected which \n     called for defendant to repay INA for substantially all of \n     the funds which defendant received as a result of the \n     fraud.'' Id. at 234. Since INA had recovered its lost money \n     in Nobel, no ruling in that case could have affected the size \n     of the investing judge's loss. Not so here. Mid-State was \n     either the victim of Black's misconduct or civilly liable for \n     facilitating it (or perhaps both). In either event, unlike \n     INA, it stood to lose or have to pay a lot of money (as in \n     the end it did) in part as a result of Black's acts. \n     Obviously, it was in the bank's interest to minimize the \n     amount it would lose or have to pay, and in furtherance of \n     that goal it would want to shift as much blame to Black as \n     possible. It was in the interest of the Smiths as Mid-State \n     investors to achieve the same objectives. It should have been \n     apparent that these objectives might be furthered by rulings \n     in Black's criminal case and by limiting any monetary \n     sanction against Black, as next discussed. Judge Smith's \n     defense (in answer to your question 20) that Nobel is \n     inapposite because Mid-State was not a ``victim'' in the same \n     way that INA was a victim entirely misses the purpose of the \n     disqualification statute and the reasoning of Nobel.\n       Judge Smith should have realized that decisions he might \n     make in Mr. Black's criminal case could affect the civil \n     actions then pending against Mid-State. This could happen in \n     at least two ways. First, Judge Smith would be called upon in \n     Black to make evidentiary rulings that could lead to the \n     revelation, or to the concealment, of information that might \n     affect the course of the civil litigation against Mid-State. \n     Second, I understand that in the event of a conviction, Black \n     would have been subject to monetary sanctions. Obviously, the \n     more money Black had to pay as a criminal sanction, the less \n     money he would have available to compensate the school \n     districts allegedly harmed by Mid-State and Black. \n     Consequently, Mid-State would have an interest in Black \n     retaining as much money as possible so that his wealth could \n     be used to offset depositor losses. If somehow Judge Smith \n     did not appreciate that his family's Mid-State investments \n     required recusal, he should have revealed this information to \n     counsel so they, and the defendant, could decide whether to \n     act on it.\n       In sum, assuming that Judge Smith did not know of Mid-\n     State's financial exposure on October 27, 1997, and did not \n     therefore recognize a need to recuse himself in SEC v. Black, \n     still there was sufficient information before him to warrant \n     both further inquiry and revelation of his family's \n     investments in Mid-State. Inquiry and revelation at this \n     point would have resolved the issue and made disqualification \n     immediately necessary. As stated above, a federal judge does \n     have a duty to be forthcoming with facts that could support a \n     request for recusal. Once Mid-State's financial exposure \n     became apparent, as early as press reports of the first \n     lawsuit on November 1, Judge Smith's continued silence is \n     inexplicable. His order of October 27 was being challenged \n     and his family's financial investment would have provided the \n     challengers with strong arguments to vacate it, perhaps more \n     quickly. Just as Judge Collins in Liljeberg should have \n     immediately revealed his reawakened knowledge of Loyola's \n     interest in a litigation before him, Judge Smith should have \n     revealed his family's financial interest in the bank \n     immediately on learning that the bank had financial exposure \n     in the events underlying SEC v. Black.\n       For the reasons given above, Judge Smith should never have \n     accepted United States v. Black. Rulings in that case have \n     affected the amounts of money Mid-State would eventually have \n     to pay and therefore the value of the Smiths' investment. \n     Even if they could not, Circuit precedent required his \n     recusal.\n       I hope I have answered your questions. Please don't \n     hesitate to ask if I can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen Gillers,\n     Vice Dean.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Hofstra University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                      Hempstead, NY, May 21, 2002.\n     Re nomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith.\n\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold. This letter is in response to your \n     letter to me of May 9, 2002, requesting my opinion on ethical \n     issues that have arisen in connection with the nomination of \n     United States District Judge D. Brooks Smith to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. These issues \n     related to (A) Membership in the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun \n     Club; (B) Attendance at Judicial Education Seminars; and (C) \n     Judicial Disqualification Requirements.\n     (A) Membership in the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club\n       I had originally concluded that Judge Smith's membership in \n     the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club was not a ground for \n     denying him a judgeship on the Court of Appeals. In reaching \n     that conclusion, I was relying in significant part on the \n     opinion expressed in the letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch of \n     April 23, 2002 by Professor Ronald D. Rotunda, for whom I \n     have considerable respect. Subsequent research has convinced \n     me, however, that Professor Routunda's analysis in this \n     instance is seriously flawed, that his conclusion is \n     clearly wrong, and that Judge Smith's membership in the \n     Club is a serious violation of his ethical \n     responsibilities as a judge.\n       I was troubled from the outset, of course, that Judge \n     Smith's membership in the Rod and Gun Club violates the plain \n     meaning of Canon 2C of the Code of Conduct for United States \n     Judges. That provision forbids a judge to hold membership in \n     an organization that ``practices invidious discrimination on \n     the basis of . . . sex. . . .'' Since the bylaws of the Rod \n     and Gun Club arbitrarily restrict membership to men, and \n     since Judge Smith held membership in the Club for eleven \n     years while he was a federal judge, his violation of Canon 2C \n     appears to be obvious.\n       Nevertheless, two aspects of Professor Rotunda's letter \n     persuaded me that this plain-meaning reading was not the \n     final word. First, I accepted Professor Rotunda's assertion \n     that the Club is a ``purely social'' organization with no \n     formal business or professional activities. In this regard, \n     Professor Rotunda may well have been misled by Judge Smith \n     himself, who has repeatedly mischaracterized the Club to the \n     Judiciary Committee as a ``purely social group'' that does \n     not conduct any business or professional activities. In any \n     event, I now understand that the crucial factual premise is \n     false, because professional meetings are in fact held at the \n     Rod and Gun Club.\n       Of equal importance to my original judgment is the fact \n     that I accepted Professor Rotunda's statement regarding \n     Sec. 2.14(b) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, \n     Compendium of Selected Opinions (2002). In Professor \n     Rotunda's words, that section holds that: ``[T]he Masonic \n     Order, which limits full membership to males does not \n     practice `invidious' sex discrimination because it does `not \n     provide business or professional opportunities to members.'' \n     Frankly, I have difficult with the notion that important \n     business and professional contacts are not made at a club \n     where business and professional men interact and bond with \n     each other and with important political figures and judges. \n     Moreover, I was troubled that this exception for the Masons--\n     as stated Professor Rotunda--would effectively swallow up the \n     rule against discrimination on grounds of sex. Nevertheless, \n     for purposes of forming an opinion about Judge Smith's \n     compliance with the Code of Judicial Conduct, I accepted \n     Professor Rotunda's representation that such a distinction \n     has been made in the Compendium of Opinions.\n       However, the full summary of the opinion regarding the \n     Masons in Sec. 2.14(b) of the Compendium is not based simply \n     on the premise that the organization does not provide \n     business or professional opportunities to members (which is a \n     factual premise that, in any event, is inapplicable to the \n     Rod and Gun Club). Rather, the summary refers only once to \n     the absence of business or professional opportunities, but \n     refers twice to the religious purposes of the Masons. \n     Compare, then, the actual summary set forth in Sec. 2.14(b) \n     with Professor Rotunda's rendering of that summary, which is \n     quoted supra: ``Masonic Order, represented to be fraternal \n     organization devoted to charitable work with religious focus \n     and not providing business or professional opportunities to \n     members, is not consider to be an organization practicing \n     invidious discrimination although women are not permitted to \n     be full-fledged members. Organization is considered to be \n     dedicated to the preservation of religious and cultural \n     values of legitimate common interest to members. Commentary \n     to Canon 2C.'' Because of this reiteration in Sec. 2.14(b) of \n     the Masons as being ``devoted'' and ``dedicated'' to the \n     preservation of religious values through charitable work, the \n     exception for the Masons does not swallow up the proscription \n     of Canon 2C against discrimination on grounds of sex. \n     Instead, the Masons' exception becomes a limited one that \n     respects the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of \n     religion.\n       Contrary to Professor Rotunda's abridged version of \n     Sec. 2.14(b), therefore, the full text of Sec. 2.14(b) does \n     not support the conclusion that the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun \n     Club's discrimination against women is permissible. \n     Accordingly, Judge Smith was clearly in violation of Canon 2C \n     for most of the eleven years that ``dragged on'' while Judge \n     Smith was on the bench and remained a member.\n       Finally, with respect to the specific questions that you \n     raised on this issue in your letter to me:\n       1. Judge Smith is incorrect in asserting that revisions to \n     Canon 2 of the Code of conduct exempt clubs like Spruce Creek \n     from the ban on membership in discriminatory organizations. \n     Indeed, that assertion is fanciful, on a plain-meaning \n     reading of Canon 2C: ``A judge should not hold membership in \n     any organization that practices invidious discrimination on \n     the basis of . . .  sex . . .'' Moreover, the exceptions in \n     the Comment reinforce the conclusion that the Rod and Gun \n     Club falls within this plain language. For example, the \n     Comment exempts an organization that is ``dedicated to the \n     preservation of religious, ethnic or cultural values of \n     legitimate common interest to its members [like the Masons], \n     or that is in fact and effect an intimate, purely private \n     organization whose membership limitations could not be \n     constitutionally prohibited.'' Obviously, neither clause in \n     that exception describes the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club.\n       2. Judge Smith violated ethical standards by remaining a \n     member of the Spruce Creek\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n     Rod and Gun Club for eleven years--or, at least, for most of \n     those years--while serving as a federal district judge. The \n     1998 Code reiterates the language of the 1992 Code in \n     allowing a judge a maximum of two years to make immediate and \n     continuous efforts to change the club's policy before \n     resigning. Since Judge Smith claims to have made such efforts \n     beginning in 1988, he should have resigned at least by 1992, \n     when he knew that four years of efforts had already been \n     unavailing.\n       3. If Judge Smith somehow believed after 1992 that he could \n     ethically remain a member of the Club (a conclusion that is \n     difficult to credit) he should at least have consulted with \n     the Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct before continuing \n     his membership. Apart from that, having given his word to the \n     Judiciary Committee that he would resign from the Club if it \n     did not change its discriminatory bylaw, Judge Smith should \n     have informed the Committee of his intention to break his \n     word and his reasons for doing so.\n     (B) Attendance at Judicial Education Seminars\n       In answer to your specific question, Judge Smith is not \n     correct in asserting that under existing ethical standards, \n     he was not required to inquire into the identity of corporate \n     financial supporters of an organization like the Law and \n     Economics Center at George Mason University.\n       As noted in the Comment to Canon 2A, the appearance of \n     impropriety depends on the appearance to a reasonable person \n     who has ``knowledge of all the relevant facts that a \n     reasonable inquiry would disclose.'' Thus, if a reasonable \n     inquiry would reveal the source of the funding, the source of \n     the funding is relevant to determining whether there is an \n     appearance of impropriety and, thereby, whether the judge has \n     committed a violation of the standard. In order to conform \n     his conduct to the rule, therefore, the judge must at least \n     make the same reasonable inquiry that the hypothetical \n     reasonable person would be making into the source of the \n     funds for the seminar.\n       It is important to address here Professor Rotunda's \n     disparaging comments on the appearance of impropriety as a \n     standard in judges' and lawyers' ethics. Professor Rotunda is \n     correct in saying that some authorities have rejected the \n     appearance of impropriety as a standard. That has come about, \n     however, for reasons that have nothing to do with the merits \n     of the standard. Moreover, the views of those authorities \n     could not overrule either the Due Process Clause of the \n     Constitution or the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.\n       In fact, the appearance of impropriety is central in \n     judges' and lawyers' ethics, and, specially, in the Code of \n     Conduct for United States Judges. Moreover, a fundamental \n     principle of constitutional due process of law is that ``any \n     tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversial not \n     only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance \n     of bias.'' That is, ``to perform its high function in the \n     best way, justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.''\n       As recently as 1998, the Judicial Conference of the United \n     States reiterated its commitment to avoiding the appearance \n     of impropriety on the part of judges. As stated in the \n     Comment to Canon 2A:\n       ``Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by \n     irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must \n     avoid all impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. A \n     judge must expect to be the subject of constant public \n     scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions that \n     might be viewed as burdensome of the ordinary citizen and \n     should do so freely and willingly. The prohibition against \n     behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety \n     applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a \n     judge. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited \n     acts, the proscription is necessarily cast in general terms \n     that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not \n     specifically mentioned in the Code.'' Then, directly \n     addressing Professor Rotunda's complaint that the appearance \n     of impropriety is ``too vague to be a standard,'' the Comment \n     explains precisely what is meant by the standard of an \n     appearance of impropriety: ``Actual improprieties under this \n     standard include violations of law, court rules or other \n     specific provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of \n     impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable \n     minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances that \n     a reasonable inquiry would disclose, a perception that the \n     judge's ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with \n     integrity, impartiality, and competence is impaired.''\n       Thus, the Code tells us, that an appearance of impropriety \n     is one that would cause a reasonable person, with knowledge \n     of all the relevant circumstances that a reasonable inquiry \n     would disclose, to believe that the judge has violated a \n     specific provision of the Code, or has violated the law, or \n     has violated court rules, in such a way that impairs the \n     judge's impartiality.\n       Consistent with that definition, the appearance of \n     impropriety with regard to the judicial seminars is the \n     appearance that a party is buying special access to the \n     judge, both by financing an expert to express ex parte \n     opinions to the judge, and by making a gift to the judge to \n     induce the judge to pay special attention to the expert's ex \n     parte opinion. Thus, judge Smith's conduct violates Canons 2, \n     2B, and 6, and appears to violate Canon 3A(4), as explained \n     below.\n       As a general matter, there is nothing in the Code of \n     Conduct for United States Judges that would forbid a judge \n     from attending a privately-sponsored judicial seminar. Also \n     as a general matter, there is no limitation--nor should there \n     be--on the ways in which judges engage in continuing legal \n     education.\n       However, a specific rule of critical importance in Canon \n     3A(4), which forbids a judge to consider ``ex parte \n     communications on the merits * * * of a pending or impeding \n     proceedings.'' This rule goes so far as to forbid a judge to \n     receive the ex parte advice even of a ``disinterested \n     expert'' on the law applicable to a proceeding before the \n     judge, unless the judge gives nothing to the parties of the \n     person consulted and the substance of the advice, and affords \n     the parties reasonable opportunity to respond.\n       Also relevant is Canon 6, which provides that a judge may \n     not receive reimbursement of expenses to judicial seminars \n     ``if the source of such payment * * * give[s] the appearance \n     of influencing the judge in the judge's judicial duties or \n     otherwise give[s] the appearance of impropriety.''.\n       I understand that Judge Smith has attended seminars in \n     which experts addressed legal issues that appeared to be the \n     same as the issues that were presented in matters that were \n     then before him. In addition, it is entirely possible that \n     one or more of the speakers discussed those issues in \n     informal contacts with the judge at those seminars.\n       Your letter refers, for example, to Gerber v. Medtronic, \n     Inc. This was a products liability case that Judge Smith was \n     adjudicating when he attended a seminar at Hilton Head. At \n     the seminar, experts discussed ``Risk, Injury, and \n     Liability.'' In the Center's words, this seminar \n     ``demonstrates the superiority of a legal system that assigns \n     liability to those best able to avoid injury over a system \n     that seeks only to spread losses by assigning them to the \n     `deepest pockets.''' Also, one of the lecturers at the \n     seminar published a paper the same year arguing for federal \n     preemption of state tort claims involving pharmaceuticals \n     subject to federal regulation.\n       Upon returning home, Judge Smith granted summary judgment \n     in favor of Medtronic--the party that had provided financial \n     support to the Law and Economics Center, which had sponsored \n     the seminar. The ground for Judge Smith's decision was \n     federal preemption of the state tort claims.\n       On those facts, there is an appearance that Judge Smith \n     violated Canon 3A(4) by receiving ex parte communications on \n     issues then before him in the Medtronic case.\n       Under the language of Canon 3A(4), of course, it is \n     irrelevant whether the seminars were funded by a party \n     appearing before the judge. However, the fact that a party \n     before the judge was providing financial support for a \n     seminar at an expensive resort, the fact that the judge \n     stayed at the resort without cost, and the fact that the \n     expert's ex parte presentation was also financed in part by \n     the party, would all heighten the appearance of impropriety. \n     Specifically, the appearance is that the party is buying \n     special access to the judge, both by making a gift to the \n     judge and by financing an ex parte communication by an \n     expert.\n       In addition, Judge Smith's attendance at the seminar \n     violated Canon 6 because of the source of the reimbursement \n     of the judge's expenses ``give[s] the appearance of \n     influencing the judge in the judge's judicial duties or \n     otherwise give[s] the appearance of impropriety.''\n     (C) Judicial disqualification requirements\n       Your final question to me is whether there is anything in \n     Judge Smith's answers to your written questions that changes \n     the opinion in my letter to the Committee of March 14, 2002 \n     (which I adopt here by reference).\n       The answer is no. Judge Smith's written answers like his \n     testimony before the Committee, consist of obfuscation and \n     disingenuousness. In addition, those answers confirm the \n     conclusion stated in my earlier letter that Judge Smith has \n     committed repeated and egregious violations of judicial \n     ethics; that to this day he has failed to inform himself of \n     his obligations under the Federal Judicial Disqualification \n     Statute; and that he has been disingenuous before this \n     Committee in defending his unethical conduct.\n       For example, in answer to your Question 7a, Judge Smith \n     says: ``Starting on October 27th, I began to develop concerns \n     that Mid-State's involvement in SEC v. Black might, in the \n     future, require it to play a more prominent evidentiary role \n     in the litigation. I may have told the Trustee and his lawyer \n     that I would consider recusing myself based on the potential \n     for a future appearance of impropriety...'' In those two \n     sentences, Judge Smith displays either an ignorance of the \n     nature of conflict of interest law or a desire to confuse the \n     issue with meaningless verbiage (``the potential for a future \n     appearance of impropriety'').\n       First, all conflicts of interest are concerned with \n     potentials--that is, with the risk of substantive ethical \n     violations that might arise in the future. As explained by \n     the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, ``conflict of \n     interest'' refers to whether there is a ``substantial risk'' \n     that a substantive violation of one's ethical obligations \n     will arise in the future. (With regard to a judge, this would \n     refer, e.g., to the risk that the judge's impartiality might \n     come to be impaired in the course of the litigation.) To be \n     ``substantial,'' the risk must be ``more than a mere \n     possibility.'' However, it need not be\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\n     ``immediate, actual, and apparent.'' On the contrary, as \n     explained in the comment to Restatement Sec. 121, a risk \n     can be substantial, within the meaning of the rule, even \n     if it is ``potential or contingent,'' and despite the fact \n     that it is neither ``certain or even probable'' that it \n     will occur. The ultimate test is that there be a \n     ``significant and plausible'' risk of adverse effect on \n     one's ethical responsibilities.\n       When Judge Smith said, therefore, that on October 27th he \n     ``began to develop concerns that Mid-State's involvement in \n     SEC v. Black might, in the future, require it to play a more \n     prominent evidentiary role in the litigation,'' he was \n     acknowledging that he had a conflict of interest that \n     required him immediately to recuse himself. That is, he was \n     acknowledging that there was a ``significant and plausible \n     risk''--even if it was not ``certain or even probable''--that \n     he would find himself adjudicating a case in which he had a \n     substantial financial interest.\n       Moreover, Judge Smith reiterates that ``Mid-State Bank was \n     not a party to the litigation before me.'' As a Federal Judge \n     for fourteen years, Judge Smith should be familiar with the \n     leading Supreme Court case of Liljeberg v. Health Services \n     Acquisition Corp. He should know, therefore, that it is \n     immaterial whether the Bank had been a party. In Liljeberg, \n     for example, Loyola University was not a party and, indeed, \n     the judge had forgotten that Loyola had any possible interest \n     in the outcome of the case. Nevertheless, simply because the \n     judge had been a trustee of Loyola, the Supreme Court vacated \n     the judgment under the Federal Disqualification Statute (28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 455).\n       For all of the reasons in my earlier letter and in this \n     one, therefore, I continue to believe that Judge D. Brooks \n     Smith should not be honored with advancement to a \n     distinguished Federal Circuit Court.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                           Monroe H.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on a subject related to the \ndebate that we concluded yesterday--at least for the time-being--and \nthat subject is pharmaceutical research and development.\n  Yesterday, the Senate was unable to reach consensus on the \nappropriate structure and scope of the much-needed Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. This was unfortunate for millions of senior \ncitizens across America, including thousands of Utahns.\n  It is my hope that after the August recess it will be possible for \nthe Senate to match the success of the House of Representatives and \npass a Medicare drug bill. I know that we sponsors of the tripartisan \nproposal will not give up. Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Grassley, Snowe, \nand I will redouble our efforts to build support for our plan.\n  It was also unfortunate yesterday that the Senate adopted S. 812, the \nGreater Access to Pharmaceuticals Act.\n  This is the legislation that was originally introduced by Senators \nMcCain and Schumer and virtually re-written in the HELP Committee in \nthe form of an amendment sponsored by Senators Edwards and Collins.\n  Let me be clear. I am supportive of reasonable changes to the Drug \nPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, commonly referred to \nas Waxman-Hatch, or Hatch-Waxman.\n  I do not oppose amending the Act. However, I do oppose the way in \nwhich it was amended, both in the HELP Committee and here on the floor.\n  I have spoken at some length about the deficiencies of this bill--\nthat appeared only the day before the mark-up on July 10th, and was \nrocketed straight to the Senate floor the next week. While it was \npending for over 2 weeks, it is accurate to say that the central matter \nunder consideration was the Medicare drug benefit issues and that there \nwas relatively little focus on the specifics of the underlying bill.\n  Despite the lopsided vote yesterday, I have explained why I thought, \nand still think, that it would have been preferable to hold hearings on \nthis potentially important but largely un-vetted bill.\n  As ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nhave made known my objections to the manner in which the HELP Committee \nhas acted to usurp the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. When \nall is said and done, S. 812 is fundamentally an antitrust bill colored \nby civil justice reform and patent law considerations.\n  We all know that S. 812 became the floor vehicle for the Medicare \ndrug debate for one major reason the Democratic leadership recognized \nthat if the regular order were observed and a mark-up were held in the \nFinance Committee, it was almost certain that the tripartisan bill \nwould have been reported to the floor.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that have just secured final \npassage of the conference report to accompany the omnibus bipartisan \ntrade package. This bipartisan bill--perhaps the most important \neconomic legislation of this Congress and a bill that will have lasting \nimpact for years to come--came out of the Finance Committee.\n  I think most would agree that the Finance Committee has a long track \nrecord of reaching bipartisan consensus on major issues facing our \ncountry.\n  Perhaps if the Democratic leadership had given the Finance Committee \nthe opportunity to do its job, the great success of the trade \nlegislation would have been duplicated with respect to the Medicare \ndrug benefit.\n  Instead, we come to the August recess without a Senate Medicare drug \nbenefit bill to conference with the House.\n  We also come to August, almost as punishment for failing on the \nMedicare drug benefit issue, with the flawed HELP Committee substitute \nto S. 812 now adopted by the full Senate.\n  We could have held hearings on the actual language of the substitute.\n  We could have taken time to study the facts and recommendations of \nthe major Federal Trade Commission report of the very provisions of law \nthat S. 812 amends.\n  We could have learned why the Patent and Trademark Office opposes the \nlanguage of the bill.\n  We could have learned what the Food and Drug Administration and \nDepartment of Justice, and the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative had to say about the bill.\n  But we did not.\n  Instead of taking the time for a careful evaluation of a potentially \nimportant change in the law, for the sake of\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nshort-term political tactics in an election year, we brought this bill \nto the floor in a poisonous atmosphere designed in part to vilify one \nsegment of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n  While S. 812 completely revised most of the McCain-Schumer language \nand made several significant steps in the right direction, there are \nsignificant problems in several of the new features that so \nmysteriously found their way into the bill on the day before the mark-\nup.\n  Since I have done so in some detail previously, I will not catalog \nthese problems again today.\n  And even though I still oppose various aspects of key provisions of \nthe bill that passed the Senate in the denouement of the Medicare \ndebate yesterday, I want to congratulate Senators McCain, Schumer, \nKennedy, Edwards, and Collins for the substantial vote yesterday.\n  Nevertheless, I hope that our colleagues in the House will study the \nSenate legislation, and consult with experts in the Administration, \nincluding the FTC, PTO, DOJ, FDA, and USTR, and other affected parties \nas they decide how best to address the matters taken up by the still \nbarely three weeks' old language of the HELP Committee substitute to S. \n812.\n  Again, let me reiterate that I do not oppose legislation in this \narea. I concur with the majority of the HELP Committee and the Senate \nthat changes need to be made. They just need to be made in a more \nmeasured fashion, taking into account the latest recommendations of the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  I plan to continue to participate in this debate as action moves to \nthe House. I will work with the House, the administration, and others \nwith a stake in the outcome of this legislation.\n  Frankly, my first impression is that the FTC report provides some \ncritical information and thoughtful recommendations for legislation. I \nwas, of course, pleased that the FTC's first major recommendation--\nallowing only one 30-month stay for all patents listed with FDA at the \ntime that each particular generic drug application is filed with the \nagency--was precisely what I have advocated.\n  The Senate-adopted version of S. 812 goes way beyond this policy. \nWhy?\n  I am also supportive of the FTC's second, and final, major \nrecommendation, to require that any potentially anti-competitive brand \nname-generic agreements be submitted for FTC review. This is consistent \nwith the suggestions I made to Chairman Leahy in connection with his \nbill, the Drug Competition Act, S. 754.\n  I am still studying the three minor FTC recommendations that aim to \npromote price competition and hinder the type of collusive arrangements \nthat on a few but very unfortunate occasions have grown out of the 180-\nday marketing exclusivity provisions of the law.\n  Taken together these three recommendations appear to promote a very \naggressive version of the use-it-or-lose-it policy I have advocated. \nNot that I pretend to understand the very complicated exclusivity, \nforfeiture, and transfer provisions of section 5 of the Edwards-Collins \nAmendment--and a review of the transcript of the mark-up suggests that \nI am not alone in my confusion--the HELP Committee adopted quasi-\nrolling exclusivity policy triggered only by an appellate court \ndecision appears to be significantly at odds with where the FTC and I \ncome out on this issue.\n  It is very unfortunate that the rushed timing brought about by the \ntactically convenient decision to mesh S. 812 with the volatile \npolitics of Medicare acted to minimize the value of this over-a-year-\nin-the-making, but still only 2 days' old, FTC study. As was \ndemonstrated over the past two-and-a-half weeks, the charged atmosphere \nof election year Medicare debates on the Senate floor is not conducive \nto fine-tuning of complex and nuanced matters of antitrust and patent \nlaw.\n  As co-author, with my House colleague, Henry Waxman, of the statute \nthat S. 812 seeks to amend--the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984--I have a longstanding interest in legislation \naffecting pharmaceutical research and development and the continued \ngrowth of the generic drug sector.\n  A key principle of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act is balance between the \ninterests of developing the next generation of new medicines and making \navailable generic copies of existing drugs. For reasons I have spelled \nout over the last two weeks, I am unable to conclude that this \nprinciple of balance has been observed in the bill the Senate adopted \nyesterday.\n  No law as complex of the 1984 Act is so perfect that it cannot be \nimproved as it measures up to the tests of time and changing \nconditions. In my view, there have been several unintended and \nunanticipated consequences of the 1984 law and other changes in the \npharmaceutical sector that bear attention by Congress.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes today to outline several issues \nbeyond the 30-month stay and the 180-day marketing exclusivity rule \nthat, along with the manner in which the drafters attempt to codify \nFDA's current bioequivalence standards, have dominated the recent \nHatch-Waxman reform debate.\n\n  On any number of occasions, I have heard proponents of S. 812 cite as \ntheir rationale for this legislation the need to restore the old \nbalance and original intent of the Waxman-Hatch Act.\n  I am afraid that--not only does the legislation fall short on the \nbalance test but this misdirected attempt to look backward to the \nintent of 1984 may result in missing important opportunities to \nfacilitate the future of drug discovery and increasing patient access \nto these new medicines.\n  If you do not ask the right question, you will get the wrong answer.\n  I wish to share my perspective on how the science of drug discovery \nand the pharmaceutical marketplace are changing.\n  Historians will record the recently-completed mapping of the human \ngenome as a major achievement in the history of science.\n  Each day, progress is made on new avenues of biomedical research. For \nexample, developments proceed apace in the field of nanotechnology--the \nprecise manipulation of molecules at a sub-molecular level. Similarly, \nthere is great excitement related to proteomics--the study of the \nstructure and function of proteins and the interaction among proteins. \nWe know that genes regulate proteins and, as our understanding of human \ngenes becomes more complete, we will spend more and more time and \neffort on learning about the relationship between genes and proteins \nand how proteins carry out these assigned roles.\n  As has been debated on this floor earlier this year and will \nundoubtedly be debated again this fall, there is great interest in the \npromising field of stem cell research. While there are a host of \nethical issues that need to be addressed in this area, many leading \nscientists tell us that stem cell research may one day virtually \nrevolutionize the practice of medicine. The nascent field of embryonic \nstem cell research may succeed in bringing forth the knowledge that \nwill yield new diagnostics and treatments for a host of currently \nincurable diseases.\n  We know that many, including more than 40 Nobel Laureates and \nvirtually all leading science organizations, have concluded that the \nhighly promising, emerging science of regenerative medicine will be \nadvanced by the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer as a method \nto develop stem cells.\n  I mention this to comment on how our almost exponential growth in \nbiomedical knowledge is affecting the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Looking at all these developments compels me to make the following \nobservation:\n  When we adopted the 1984 Hatch-Waxman law, we were in an era of small \nmolecule medicine and large patient population blockbuster drugs. Times \nhave changed.\n  It appears that we are rapidly entering an era of large molecule \nmedicine and small patient population drugs. Some believe that we may \nbe entering an age of literally single patient, person-specific drugs \nand genetic therapies.\n  We are already in something of a transition away from old-fashioned \nchemical-based drug products to futuristic biologicals. This will not \noccur overnight and there will always be a place for old-style drugs in \nthe therapeutic armamentarium. Experts remind us that this new wave of \ntherapeutic protein molecules are more\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\ncomplex than the type of drugs developed in the past. To cite but one \nexample, the molecular weight of Prozac is 345 daltons, compared with \nthe biologic, EPO, which is 30,400 daltons and about 10 times the size \nof many common old-line drugs.\n  Over the next decade and into the future, a great deal of inventive \nenergy will be concentrated on developing biological products.\n  The list of 66 approved medications using cloned recombinant DNA will \nalmost certainly expand. The future of the pharmaceutical industry may \none day be dominated by biological products.\n  As we enter this new era of drug discovery, certain policy questions \nshould be considered by Congress:\n  Are our intellectual property laws relating to pharmaceuticals \nadequate to promote the large molecule, small patient population \nmedicine?\n  For example, currently under Waxman-Hatch, process patents are not \neligible to receive any patent term restoration. Why should this be the \ncase? If targeted patient populations get smaller and smaller and the \nproduction process patents become relatively more important than \ncomposition of matter patents, should we make process patents eligible \nfor Waxman-Hatch partial patent term restoration?\n  Is it possible that one day in the future there will be more drugs \nintended for patient populations under the 200,000 patient limit \nestablished by the Orphan Drug Act or even patient-specific biological \ncocktails and gene or protein therapies? If so, would it be appropriate \nto re-think and re-design any of our intellectual property laws?\n  Unfortunately, S. 812 as passed by the Senate appears to give less \nvalue to patents and treats them more as targets for litigation than \nvaluable insights to be respected.\n  Another key question is whether Hatch-Waxman, as a general matter, \nadequately values pharmaceutical intellectual property relative to \nother fields of discovery?\n  The American Inventors Protection Act which passed with a broad \nbipartisan consensus in 1999 permits all patents to be restored up to \n17 years of patent life if there is undue administrative delay at the \nPTO. The 1984-adopted Hatch-Waxman law caps patent term restoration for \ndrug patents due to FDA delay at 14 years. Moreover, most patent \napplications are reviewed by PTO in one and one-half to two years, so \nthat the effective patent life for most products is actually 18 to 18.5 \nyears.\n  When all is said and done, most patents run appreciably longer than \npatents related to drugs due to the 14-year Waxman-Hatch cap. We must \nask why time lost at PTO should be treated differently than time lost \nat FDA? Why should the proverbial better mousetrap be treated better \nunder the patent code than a life-saving drug?\n  Similarly, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for five years of marketing \nexclusivity for all new chemical entity drugs, independent of patent \nprotection. In contrast, it is my understanding that most European \nnation's and Japan have adopted a 10-year data exclusivity rule. Why \nnot consider harmonizing and move to the European standard for this \nimportant information which, but for Hatch-Waxman, would be considered \nproprietary information?\n  I want to commend Senator Lieberman, with whom I am working, for his \nadvocacy of an aggressive set of intellectual property incentives in \nhis bioterrorism legislation, S. 1764, that are designed to stimulate \nthe private sector to direct its inventive energies and financial \nresources to develop the necessary measures to counter biological, \nchemical, or nuclear terrorism. I will continue to work with Senator \nLieberman as he refines his legislation, which among other provisions, \nprovides for day-for-day-patent term restoration for time lost at FDA.\n  The Senator from Connecticut understands the value of intellectual \nproperty incentives in facilitating biomedical research. We should all \nlook closely at this approach in the area of bioterrorism and consider \napplying these principles to other important areas of medical research.\n  Another major issue will be whether the current lack of Waxman-Hatch \nauthorization for the review and approval of generic biologicals is \nsound public policy?\n  Although the Senate failed to adopt a Medicare drug benefit this \nweek, I remain hopeful and committed to working toward the day when we \nwill get the job done for America's seniors.\n  Part of the impetus behind the McCain-Schumer bill and other efforts \nfor Hatch-Waxman reform is to help seniors reduce the sometimes \nstaggering out-of-pocket costs of their prescription drugs.\n  Given the enormous costs associated with providing only limited \npharmaceutical coverage under Medicare, that for catastrophic expenses \nlast year estimated by CBO to cost $368 billion over 10 years it is \nabsolutely essential for policymakers to explore enacting regulatory \npathways for biological products to enter the market once patents have \nexpired.\n  As we learned in the 1980s when \nCongress first passed, than unceremoniously repealed, a law which \nincluded Medicare drug coverage, the cost-estimates of providing this \nbenefit will only go in one direction: ever higher and higher, and \nupward and upward.\n  According to CBO's March 2002 estimates, those seniors who will spend \ngreater than $5,000 in annual prescription drug costs amount to 10 \npercent of all Medicare beneficiaries. Astonishingly, they account for \n38 percent of total prescription drug spending by Medicare \nbeneficiaries today.\n  By 2012, CBO estimates that these numbers will skyrocket. Fully 80 \npercent of all spending for drugs by Medicare beneficiaries will go to \nthose 38 percent of the total Medicare beneficiaries with greater than \n$5,000 in annual prescription drug spending. This will represent the \nlion's share of total projected Medicare beneficiary prescription drug \nspending of $278 billion just ten years from now.\n  We know that biological products are likely to be more expensive than \nold-line drug products. Sooner or later, we must face up to the generic \nbiologics challenge. We literally cannot afford to continue avoiding \nthis issue.\n  Now that the HELP Committee has finished, for the time being at \nleast, its foray into antitrust policy, patent law, and civil justice \nreform, perhaps it could find the time to hold hearings on matters that \nare actually within the committee's jurisdiction, such as the legal, \nscientific, and policy issues related to the FDA review of generic \nbiologics.\n\n  As far as I am concerned, the sooner we change the law, the better. \nAs more and more biologics come onto the market, we will face \ntransitional products issues and carve out requests that will greatly \ncomplicate the legislative process. I speak from experience--I lived \nthrough the so-called pipeline issues in 1984 and it was not pretty.\n  Congress simply cannot, and should not, attempt to enact and sustain \nover time a Medicare drug benefit unless we seriously explore what \nsteps must be taken to end an FDA regulatory system that acts as a \nsecondary patent for biological products. Patient safety must never be \njeopardized. The task will not be easy.\n  In this regard I must cite an article by Lisa Raines, published in \nThe Journal of Biolaw & Business in 2001 entitled, ``Bad Medicine: Why \nthe Generic Drug Regulatory Paradigm is Inapplicable to Biotechnology \nProducts.'' Lisa was a special friend to all of us interested in \nbiotechnology. She had experience both in the public sector--at the old \nCongressional Office of Technology Assessment--and in the private \nsector--with the Biotechnology Industry Organization and Genzyme. One \nof the many tragedies of September 11 was that Lisa was among the \npassengers on the plane that was crashed into the Pentagon. We all miss \nher indomitable spirit and friendship.\n  Let me stipulate, as the article points out, that it will be \ndifficult to manufacture generic equivalents of biologicals. However, I \ndo not think it is an impossible task. As we attack this problem we \nwill need to adopt one of the mottos of the Marine Corps: the difficult \nwe do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer.\n  I think it would be wise to charge an expert organization such as the \nUnited States Pharmacopeia to convene a group of experts, in alliance \nwith the FDA, to begin to identify the technical issues that need to be \naddressed in order to bring about bioequivalent generic biologicals, \nincluding clinical trials if necessary.\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\n  Some will argue that generic biologics cannot be manufactured, but \nunless we try to invent a fast track approval process for biologics, I \ndo not see how we will ever know how to overcome the technical \nobstacles.\n  It seems to me that one of the highest priorities of the next \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs will be to make certain that the \nleadership of FDA's Center for Biologics is committed, in partnership \nwith the private sector and academic researchers, to identifying the \nissues and attempting to find solutions to the many issues that need to \nbe resolved in order to make generic biologics.\n  I want to acknowledge that Senator Rockefeller has introduced a \nlegislative proposal in this area although I have problems with his \nstudy and automatic pilot features.\n  The last overarching issue that I will raise today is how the \nstructure and strength of the research-based segment of the American \npharmaceutical industry has changed since 1984.\n  On the one hand, we have seen substantial growth in the biotechnology \nindustry. There are now some 1,400 U.S. biotech firms, although only 41 \nof these biotech companies have any revenues from FDA-approved \nproducts.\n  On the other hand, I think that Congress should consider whether \nthere are any appropriate actions we can, or should, take today to make \nsure that America retains a vibrant research-based large-firm \npharmaceutical sector. I have nothing against the several new \nconsolidated multinational drug firms but we must never allow our \nnational leadership in biomedical research to erode. I suggest my \ncolleagues review the transcript of the March Commerce Committee \nhearing on the McCain-Schumer legislation and examine the thoughts of \nSenator Wyden related to the financial health and status of the product \npipeline of the large drug firms.\n  Senator Wyden, with his long ties to consumer groups like the Gray \nPanthers, is certainly no patsy of the drug industry. But the Senator \nfrom Oregon clearly understands that while we politicians always want \nto focus on how to help distribute the golden eggs--the new medicines--\nto our constituents, we also need to pay attention to the health of the \ngoose. It is true that the pharmaceutical industry has had a great run \nof success since about 1994 when the Clinton health care plan was \nrejected. But today's dry pipelines presage problems tomorrow.\n  The fact is that the drug discovery business is a high risk, high \nreward endeavor and Congress can do real, and perhaps irreversible \nharm, to some firms if we choose the wrong intellectual property \npolicies. We need to discuss if there are appropriate ways to increase \nour nation's biomedical research capacity, such as the set of proposals \nset forth in the Lieberman bill.\n  We should not be so quick to vilify the research-based pharmaceutical \nindustry as was done repeatedly for the last three weeks. We know what \nhappened. Political and tactical considerations led some to believe \nthere needed to be a villain in this Medicare debate. In a sense, \nhistory repeated itself as some took a page right out of the Clinton \nAdministration play book.\n  Here is how the book, The System, authored by David Broder and Haynes \nJohnson, two highly respected journalists, described the tactics of the \nClinton White House in trying to pass its too grand health care reform \nplan in 1993 and 1994:\n\n       . . . Clinton's political advisers focused mainly on the \n     message that for ``the plain folks it's greed--greedy \n     hospitals, greedy doctors, greedy insurance companies. It was \n     an us-versus-them-issue, which Clinton was extremely good at \n     exploiting.''\n       Clinton's political consultants--Carville, Begala, \n     Grunwald, Greenberg--all thought ``there had to be villains'' \n     . . . at that point, the insurance companies and the \n     pharmaceutical companies became the enemy.\n\n  Unfortunately, that strategy reappeared over the last few weeks and \nwe lost an opportunity to debate in a more reasoned fashion the complex \nset of issues and delicate balance required in pioneer-generic issues \nthat I have just described. Nor did we do any great justice in delving \nbeyond the surface and into the substance of the issues addressed in S. \n812.\n  I have made it clear that my vision and preference for Waxman-Hatch \nreform is to help facilitate a constructive dialogue among interested \nparties. We all could benefit by a fair exchange of viewpoints on a \nbroad range of innovator/generic firm issues, including the matters I \nhave just outlined.\n  The issues that are addressed in the HELP Committee Substitute to S. \n812 are important issues. So are the notice provisions contained in \nSenator Leahy's bill, S. 754.\n  Unfortunately, the politics of Medicare prevented the debate over S. \n812 from unfolding in a manner that encouraged a thoughtful discussion \nof even these narrower set of issues, let alone the initiation of a \npublic dialogue of the broader--and perhaps more significant in the \nlong run--Hatch-Waxman reform issues that I have just described.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to set forth these ideas for the \nfuture consideration of my colleagues and other interested parties.\n  I look forward to debating these issues in the future and to working \nwith the House and other interested parties to further perfect the \nSenate-passed version of S. 812.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7878-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE EFFORTS OF STUDENTS AT MONTELLO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a group of students from Montello, WI, who have reached out \nto show their support and appreciation for the U.S. Navy sailors on \nduty in the North Arabian Sea. In support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom, 168 students from the Montello Middle School and High School \nhave dedicated tremendous time and effort to showing their support for \nour sailors on board the USS Seattle and the USS Detroit. Their \nappreciation for the work our sailors and military personnel are doing \noverseas should be an inspiration to every American.\n  This group of students, led by their teacher Catherine Ellenbecker, \nsent 35 boxes of snacks and cookies to the crew aboard these ships. \nThey also collected 18,892 golf balls for the sailors and were given a \ndonation of 100 golf clubs by B Golf in Appleton, WI.\n  By sending these gifts, the students greatly improved the morale of \nthose on board. As one Navy Captain wrote, ``Your gifts and many good \nwishes have helped to bring home a little closer today.'' A total of \n116 students continue to correspond with the USS Detroit and 52 other \nstudents have pen pals on the USS Seattle through both emails and \nletters.\n  I applaud these students for their thoughtfulness, their diligence, \nand above all for their support of our men and women in uniform. These \nstudents recognize that we are safe here at home thanks to the \nhardworking men and women of the U.S. military. It gives me great pride \nto know that students from my home state of Wisconsin have done so much \nto support these sailors. I commend the students from Montello Middle \nSchool and High School for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7878-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7878-S7879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      IN MEMORIAM: MARI-RAE SOPPER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate the memory of one of my \nconstituents, Mari-Rae Sopper, who lost her life on September 11, 2001. \nMs. Sopper was a 35-year-old lawyer and gymnastics coach when the \nflight she was on, American Airlines Flight 77, was hijacked by \nterrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into the Pentagon, \nkilling everyone on board.\n  Ms. Sopper was a native of Inverness, Illinois and attended William \nFremd High School in Palatine, Illinois. At the age of 15 she set the \ngoal of becoming a champion gymnast. She succeeded, becoming all-\nAmerican in four events, the school's Athlete of the Year and the \nState's Outstanding Senior Gymnast of the Year.\n  Larry Petrillo, her high school gymnastics coach, remembers her as \nbrash and committed. ``One thing she taught me is, you never settle for \nless than you are capable of. We should never accept limits. We should \nalways fight the good fight. She was a staunch supporter of gymnastics \nand what's right,'' he recalls.\n  Upon graduating from Iowa State University with a degree in exercise \nscience, Ms. Sopper earned a master's degree in athletics \nadministration\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\nfrom the University of North Texas and a law degree from the University \nof Denver. Ms. Sopper was an accomplished dancer and choreographer and \ncontinued to coach at gymnastics clubs.\n  Ms. Sopper practiced law as a Lieutenant in the Navy's JAG Corps, \nfocusing on defense and appellate defense. She had left the Navy JAG \nCorps and was an associate with the law firm Schmeltzer, Aptaker & \nSheperd, P.C. when she found her dream job: to coach the women's \ngymnastics team at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n  It was a one year appointment and Ms. Sopper was looking forward to \nthe challenge. Her mother, Marion Kminek, says Mari-Rae was excited \nabout the opportunity. ``I said go for it. Life is too short. It was \nsomething she had always wanted to do and she was so happy and \nexcited,'' recalls Kminek.\n  At the time of her death, Ms. Sopper was moving to Santa Barbara to \nbegin her appointment. Her close friend, Mike Jacki, recalls ``This was \nto be a new adventure for Mari-Rae, and an opportunity to get back into \nthe sport she loved. We have lost a very special person. She was \nprepared to make her dream come true, and in an instant it was gone.''\n  Mari-Rae Sopper is remembered for her loyalty, strong values, \nexcellent work ethic and spirit for life. She is survived by her \nmother, Marion Kminek and stepfather, Frank Kminek, her father Bill \nSopper, sister Tammy and many loving friends.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11th, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day. Some \nwere trapped in the World Trade Center towers. Some were at work in the \nPentagon. And the fates of some were sealed as they boarded planes \nbound for San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n  I offer today this tribute to one of the 51 Californians who perished \non that awful morning. I want to assure the family of Mari-Rae Sopper, \nand the families of all the victims, that their fathers and mothers, \nsons and daughters, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters will not be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7879-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF SISTER ROSA ALVAREZ\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Sister \nRosa Alvarez for her commitment to social service for Delaware's \nimmigrants. She has dedicated her life to opening doors to families \nthat otherwise might have been closed by language and cultural \nbarriers. In doing so, she has become a lifeline for Georgetown's \nHispanic community.\n  In the last decade, Latino immigrants have flooded Georgetown, \ntransforming the ethnic and cultural backdrop of southern Delaware. \nSister Rosa has helped the community overcome language barriers so that \nthey can start healthy families and lead productive lives.\n  Sister Rosa has been present for hundreds of area births. Known as \n``la abuelita,'' or ``little grandmother,'' Sister offers help to \nGeorgetown's mothers and children, particularly those mothers who are \nchildren themselves. Placing heavy emphasis on prenatal care, she helps \nyoung mothers make doctors appointments and provides transportation if \nnecessary, to make sure they get to them. She successfully campaigned \nfor vitamins for the community's pregnant mothers, and actively mentors \nparents who need assistance.\n  Sister Rosa works with La Esperanza, a community center for Sussex \nCounty's Latino population doing fantastic work in its own right, to \nprovide social services for thousands of immigrants faced with \ninaccessible healthcare, domestic violence, reduced education and legal \ncomplications.\n  Working alongside Mark Lally and Marjorie Biles in my Georgetown \noffice, Sister Rosa helps the downstate Hispanic community navigate the \nmaze of paperwork often required to get work visas, Medicaid benefits \nand housing. She helps Spanish-speaking immigrants fill out English \nlanguage forms and devotes time every week to helping families \ntranslate and pay their bills.\n  At some point, all of us need to look back and take stock of where we \nhave been and where we are going. Have we lived our lives in the \nservice to others, or merely for ourselves? At the end of the day, can \nwe say with confidence that we did our best and worked to our fullest \npotential?\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Sister Rosa at La Red, a Hispanic \nhealth center in Sussex County, DE, earlier this year. I was struck by \nher boundless energy and kind heart. She offers people hope. Her \ndedication intensifies the work of others, and pushes us to take an \nintrospective look at the purpose of our own lives.\n  Mahatma Ghandi, one of Sister's idols, said in the 1920s, ``If we are \nto reach real peace in this world, we shall have to begin with the \nchildren.'' Today his sentiments are seen in her actions.\n  At a time when the face of our Nation is in constant flux and the \ncall to service rings louder than ever, it is individuals like Sister \nRosa who leave me feeling hopeful about our country's future. It is she \nwho brought many in the community to my office for assistance, she who \nis empowering community leaders, she who is making a difference with \nher infectious smile.\n  I rise today to honor and thank Sister Rosa for her selfless \ndedication to the betterment of others. She is a remarkable woman and a \ntestament to the community she represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7879-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7879-S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF EAST SIDE CHARTER SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the East \nSide Charter School in Wilmington, DE. Five years after opening their \ndoors to some of the State's most economically and educationally \ndisadvantaged children, they have amassed a record of meeting and \nexceeding expectations. The achievement gap is narrowing in the First \nState, and the East Side Charter School is leading the way.\n  Located in the middle of what is called the projects, in properties \nmanaged by the Wilmington Housing Authority on the east side of \nWilmington, East Side Charter School is home to low-income students in \ngrades K-3 who face unique challenges.\n  Over 80 percent of the students at East Side Charter School live in \npoverty. Most of the children live with only one parent, few of whom \ncompleted any college education. Many live in neighborhoods with high \nincidence of violence and crime, and some are without proper nutrition \nand health care.\n  But at this school, kids can come early and stay late. They have a \nlonger school year. They wear school uniforms. Parents sign something \nakin to a contract of mutual responsibility. Teachers and \nadministrators are given freer reign to innovate and initiate. The \nattendance rate is nearly perfect. Parents are given a better chance to \nhelp children fulfill their potential.\n  At this school the halls are filled with talented faculty, skilled \nsupervisors, and dedicated staff. Principal Will Robinson challenges \nstudents and empowers them to meet those challenges.\n  When the East Side Charter School started 5 years ago, the odds were \nstacked against its success. The school has flourished though, in spite \nof the daunting statistics. One of almost 200 public schools in the \nState of Delaware, from the wealthiest to those struggling the most, \nEast Side Charter School was the only one in the last few years where \nevery student tested met or exceeded our State's standards in math.\n  As Governor of Delaware, and now as Senator, I have shared with \npeople across America the story of East Side's incredible success. I \ntell them about the teachers like Barbara Juraco, who daily demonstrate \nunparalleled commitment and patience, the support staff that's there \nwhen needed, the students who again and again exceed expectations, and \nthe parents and family members who understand they have an obligation \nto be full partners in the education of their children. Together, they \nserve as an inspiration and an example to communities across the \ncountry.\n  Delaware is a small State, but we are building a growing record of \nachievement in public school education. Statewide, scores have again \nincreased in all\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\ngrades and across ethnic lines for reading and math, proving that we \nare closing the achievement gap.\n  Much of what we have accomplished in Delaware, and at the East Side \nCharter School, serves as a model for our Nation.\n  I rise today to offer my full support as future generations of \nstudents and educators at East Side Charter School ready to face the \nchallenges of the 21st century and overcome them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7880-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF LTC JOHN BURKE'S RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of LTC \nJohn Burke upon his retirement from the U.S. Air Force. John is the \nlongest certified C-5 pilot in the history of the U.S. Air Force, and \nhas served his country with distinction for 32 years.\n  Since 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Burke has served as Chief Pilot for \nthe 709th Airlift Squadron at Dover Air Force Base. Assigned to \noverseas mission support, joint service exercises, humanitarian relief, \nPresidential movement and aircrew training, he has been indispensable \nto his squadron's success.\n  In his latest position, Lieutenant Colonel Burke was responsible for \nevaluating procedures and techniques that ensured the safety and \nefficacy of the C-5 in its strategic airlift missions, as well as \nevaluating its pilots.\n  As you may know, the C-5 is the Air Force's largest cargo aircraft, \ncapable of quickly moving large numbers of men, women and materiel to \ntroubled areas around the world.\n  The C-5 will ensure our military readiness for generations to come, \nas will Lieutenant Colonel Burke's legacy of leadership and heroism.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Burke is a well-rounded, seasoned officer with a \nrecord for consistently combining effective leadership and \nprofessionalism. He leads by example--motivating people, making key \ndecisions, producing results and maintaining high morale. He has \namassed an impressive 7,400 flight hours and frequent accolades.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Lieutenant Colonel Burke flew in \nvital missions and earned numerous decorations. In a career that spans \nthree decades, Lieutenant Colonel Burke has served in significant \nmilitary campaigns, such as Nickel Grass, Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Just Cause.\n  On May 30, 1972, barraged by antiaircraft fire flying over Southeast \nAsia, Burke landed in Song Be to deliver much needed fuel and \nammunition to allied troops fighting hostile forces, earning the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. Additionally, he has garnered numerous \nother medals and commendations, including the Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Aerial Achievement Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, \nthe Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon, and Republic of Vietnam \nGallantry Cross.\n  Military service runs in the New York native's blood. Lieutenant \nColonel Burke's father was a World War II Army Air Force navigator and \nbombardier, and his mother was an Army nurse. Joining the U.S. Air \nForce in 1970, Lieutenant Colonel Burke carried on the family tradition \nof military allegiance.\n  LTC John Burke marked his career with consistent, exemplary \nleadership in service to his Nation, earning a reputation for loyalty, \ndedication, integrity, and honesty. Upon his retirement he leaves a \nlegacy of commitment to freedom that generations will follow. I commend \nhim for his remarkable service and wish him the best in his future \nendeavors. He is a patriot in every sense of the word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7880-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7880-S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL GUARD COUNTER DRUG STATE PLANS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nNational Guard and urge my colleagues to support the National Guard \nCounter Drug States Plan Program.\n  The National Guard role is to provide counterdrug and drug demand \nreduction support as requested by local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement agencies and community-based organizations with a \ncounterdrug nexus. The National Guard provides this support in \nconsonance with the Office of National Drug Control Policy and \nDepartment of Defense guidance.\n  The mission of the National Guard Counter Drug Program is to assist \nand strengthen law enforcement and community-based organizations in \nreducing the availability of, and demand for, illegal drugs within the \nState and Nation through professional military support. The principal \nelements of counter-drug military support include highly skilled \npersonnel, specialized technology, facilities, and diverse types of \nmilitary training and skills. Operationally, this translates into port \nsecurity assistance, operating nonintrusive inspection devices, aerial \nand ground reconnaissance, technical support, general support, \ncommunity antidrug coalition support, youth drug awareness programs, \nand use of training facilities.\n  The National Guard offers numerous military-unique skills to the \ncounterdrug mission. These include linguist and translator support, \ninvestigative case and analyst support, communications support, \nengineer support, diver support, marijuana eradication support, \ntransportation support, maintenance and logistical support, cargo and \nmail inspection, training of law enforcement and military personnel, \nsurface reconnaissance, and aerial reconnaissance. In addition, the \nNational Guard provides command, control, communications, computers, \nand information, C4I, integration; logistics planning; tactical and \nstrategic operational and intelligence planning; the ability to support \naround-the-clock operations; liaison skills with civilian authority and \ninteragency cooperation; resource integration; force protection \ntraining; operational security enforcement; communications security \nenforcement; and risk management skills.\n  We must fully fund the National Guard Counter Drug States Plans \nProgram. The National Guard's success in interdicting drugs and other \ncontraband contributes to the security of the Nation as a whole. Using \nmy home State as an example, Florida has valid support requests from \nlaw enforcement and community-based organizations that would require \napproximately 250 personnel. Under the constraints of the estimated \nfiscal year 2003 budget, the National Guard was able to field 111 \npersonnel, resulting in unfunded requests for 139 personnel and an \nunfunded requirement of 99 personnel based on an optimal program size \nof 210 personnel. In fiscal year 2002, the State of Florida fielded 148 \npersonnel, and unfunded personnel requests totaled 102.\n  I am also a great believer in a balanced counterdrug program, both \ninterdiction and demand reduction. The National Guard does some of the \nfinest demand reduction work in the country. Young people look up to \nthese citizen-soldiers and listen to what they say.\n  Counterdrug personnel assigned to perform drug demand reduction \nactivities utilize numerous military skills including command, control \nand communication skills, tactical and strategic planning, liaison \nskills and training design and implementation skills. These assist \ncommunities with work plans, realistic time lines and assigned \nresponsibilities. This support is essential for many community-based \norganizations in order to mobilize and sustain their efforts.\n  Additionally, the military value system and discipline instilled in \nall counterdrug personnel creates a significant demand to serve as role \nmodels and mentors supporting a wide array of prevention activities. \nCommunity based prevention organizations rely on National Guard \npersonnel to incorporate this unique military orientation into \nactivities such as youth camps, ropes challenge courses, high adventure \ntraining, high school drug education, Drug Education for Youth, \nmentoring, and other prevention and skill training activities.\n  The National Guard also provides unique facilities and equipment such \nas armories, training sites, obstacle courses, aircraft and wheeled \nvehicles in support of community prevention strategies. These \nfacilities and equipment are often the only resources available to \nconduct youth camps, coalitions meetings or experiential learning \ninitiatives. The leadership skills and military values embedded within \nour youth hopefully provide a morale foundation for future generations, \nas well as conveying to many thousands of youth the value of military \nservice.\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\n  The National Guard Counter Drug States Plan Program benefits not only \nthe States, but also the Department of Defense. The primary benefit is \nincreased combat readiness, as well as significant Guard experience in \nMilitary Operations Other than War, MOOTW, within the continental \nUnited States and abroad. Service in the counterdrug program also \nprovides members with joint experience and inter-service cooperation \nskills for immediate response to national emergencies. The National \nGuard, in many communities, is the only real connection the public has \nto our armed services. The visibility of uniformed National Guardsmen \nprovides a deterrence to the smuggling of drugs, arms, explosives, \nweapons, aliens, and other contraband, as well as direct support for \ninterdiction operations.\n  I can not say enough good things about what the National Guard does \nfor the State of Florida and the Nation. I am grateful that it appears \nwe have avoided personnel reductions for fiscal year 2003, which we \nstruggled through in fiscal year 2002, but I am concerned that we may \nhave a funding shortfall and personnel reductions in fiscal year 2004. \nI urge my colleagues to review the great merits of the National Guard \nCounter Drug State Plans Program, given the National Guard's integral \nrole in both the National Drug Control Strategy and Homeland Defense \nStrategy. Please help us fully fund and deploy the National Guard for \nthe protection of our United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7881-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WELCOMING BOETTGER BABY\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Scott and \nSally live in Hailey, Idaho, and are active in natural resources and \nenvironmental issues in the state. Scott serves as the Executive \nDirectory of the Wood River Land Trust, and Sally serves as the \nDirector of Development of The Nature Conservancy in Idaho.

As the father of five myself, I know that Scott \nand Sally are in for a most remarkable, frustrating, rewarding, and \nexciting experience of their lives. Emily will make certain of that. \nOur best wishes go out to the Boettger family on this most auspicious \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7881-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN MEMORIAM OF BRIAN HONAN, COUNCILLOR, BOSTON CITY COUNCIL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Tuesday evening the Boston City \nCouncil lost one of its most capable and well-liked members, Councillor \nBrian Honan. I rise today to join with his family, constituents and \nstaff in mourning the loss of this universally loved man. His brief \ntime with us proved that politics can make a difference in people's \nlives, that the values of a small neighborhood can help guide a city, \nand that integrity and humility can transcend disagreements and carve \nout common ground.\n  You don't have to search far to see what Brian stood for. There are \ntwo structures in the Allston neighborhood of Boston that stand as the \npillars of his dedication and commitment he brought to public service. \nThe West End Boys and Girls House sits on the opposite side of Ringer \nPark from Mary and Patrick Honan's home on Gordon Street, and together \nthese two buildings symbolize the values of family and community that \nguided Brian through the public life he led and loved.\n  Prior to being elected to the Boston City Council in 1995, Brian \nserved as a Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney for six years \nunder District Attorney Ralph Martin. Brian coordinated the prosecution \nof 15,000 cases a year in the Roxbury District and through his \ndedication and tenacity rose to be a supervisor in both the Roxbury and \nDorchester District Courts. Motivated by a fierce instinct to bring \nviolent criminals to justice, Brian created fast-track prosecutions for \ndomestic violence and gun-related crimes and helped bring swift justice \nto those who put our families and communities in danger.\n  Once sworn-in to the Boston City Council in 1996, Brian served with \ndistinction as Chair of the City Council's Committee on Banking & \nCommunity Investment and the Committee on Residency. Through these \ncommittees, Councillor Honan co-sponsored an order to provide relief \nfrom costly prescription drug costs for Boston's seniors and helped \nincrease housing and commercial opportunities by increasing much-needed \ncapital improvement funds. Brian also fought for the Living Wage \nAmendment, sponsored legislation to preserve affordable housing for \nseniors, and co-sponsored the Domestic Partnership legislation.\n  It is on the streets and in the homes of Allston-Brighton where \nBrian's most lasting achievements can be seen. After becoming a member \nof the West End House when it first opened its Allston Street location \nin 1971, Brian stood with his older brother Kevin as its most \npassionate advocates and defenders. As a councillor, he helped Allston-\nBrighton build a shining new library in Allston and a brand new Oak \nSquare YMCA facility in Brighton, which will stand as two enduring \nsymbols of the dedication he brought to elected office. As a leader on \nsuch initiatives as the Allston-Brighton Area Planning Action Council \nand the Allston-Brighton Healthy Boston Coalition, Brian demonstrated \nhis enduring commitment to helping children, seniors and families have \nan enjoyable and productive life.\n  From the classrooms of St. Patrick's High School to Boston's \ncourtrooms, Brian demonstrated a quiet strength that makes his \npremature departure all the more painful. Together with my constituents \nacross Boston, I treasure the time we shared with him. I join with his \nfamily and friends in mourning his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7881-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7881-S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK 2002\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I recognize the National Health \nCenter Week that will be celebrated from August 18, to 24, 2002. Health \ncenters provide services to over ten million people living in under-\nserved areas throughout the United States, with about 50 percent of the \nusers being from rural areas such as South Dakota. It gives me great \npride to have been selected for the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers' ``2002 Community Super Hero'' award which was presented \nto me earlier this year.\n  Community health centers have a long-standing history of providing \nquality primary health care services to medically under-served \npopulations. Providing care to one of every 12 rural Americans, health \ncenters provide medical attention to those who would otherwise lack \naccess to health care. For less than one dollar per day, these health \ncenters provide care to both individuals and families. Today, there are \n23 community health centers serving 31,0000 individuals across my State \nand I am working, along with the President and my colleagues in \nCongress, to greatly increase the number nationwide. I am pleased, as a \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to have recently voted \nto increase funding by $190 million for a total of $1.53 billion for \nthe Nation's community health centers next year. This funding level \nrepresents a $76 million increase over the President's Fiscal Year 2003 \nbudget request.\n  A unique aspect of community health centers allows them to \nindividualize their center to met the specific needs of a particular \ncommunity. By partnering with community organizations, schools and \nbusinesses, health centers are able to best meet the health care needs \nof individuals in each respective community.\n  Let me also pay special recognition to John Mengenhausen, Chief \nExecutive Officer of Horizon Health Care in\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nHoward, South Dakota and the National Association of Community Health \nCare Center's Board Chair, Scot Graff, Executive Director of the \nCommunity Health Care Association in South Dakota, and all of the staff \nat the association for the fine work they do on behalf of South Dakota. \nFurthermore, I want to commend all of the dedicated health care \nprofessionals in the health centers throughout South Dakota who work \nday in and day out devoting their lives to delivering critical health \ncare to those most in need.\n  Once again, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the National \nHealth care Center Week on behalf of the South Dakota Community Health \ncare Association and the many thousands of South Dakotans who may \ncontinue to benefit through this important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHILDREN, YOUTH AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, ``Children, Youth and Gun \nViolence,'' a report released last month by the David and Lucille \nPackard Foundation, questions the effectiveness of programs to train \nchildren and young people to stay away from guns, or behave responsibly \naround guns. The report states parents should instead focus their \nefforts on keeping guns away from kids, except under supervised \ncircumstances. The problem of kids gaining access to guns is not small. \nAccording to statistics compiled by the Packard Foundation, each year \nin the United States more than 20,000 children under age 20 are killed \nor injured by firearms of which more than 3,000 are killed.\n  These figures emphasize the need to do all we can to keep kids from \ngaining unsupervised access to guns. I cosponsored Senator Durbin's \nChild Access Prevention Act because I believe it is a common sense step \nin this direction. Under this bill, adults who fail to lock up loaded \nfirearms or an unloaded firearm with ammunition could be held liable if \na weapon is taken by a child and used to kill or injure him or herself \nor another person. The bill also increases the penalties for selling a \ngun to a juvenile and creates a gun safety education program that \nincludes parent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement and \ncommunity organizations. I support this bill and hope the Senate will \nact on it.\n  The Packard Foundation study brings to light the importance of common \nsense gun safety legislation. It also offers nine recommendations to \npolicymakers and parents to prevent easy access to guns.

Mr. President, a little more than 5 years \nago, the Commerce Committee held a hearing to test the mettle of a \nnominee to head the Federal Aviation Administration. The nominee came \nto Washington from her long-time home of Massachusetts to serve in the \nFederal Highway Administration, and her years of experience in various \nmodes of transportation--primarily highways and airports--made her a \nstrong candidate for the FAA position.\n  At the time, Jane Garvey sat before us as the first nominee to be \nappointed to a fixed, 5-year term to head the FAA. For years, the \nposition of chief of the FAA had served as a revolving door--with many \nwell-qualified people, but few able or willing to stay. The lack of \ncontinuity left its mark on many projects--the headlines, often from \nCongressional sources or the General Accounting Office, usually read \n``delayed and over budget.'' That changed when Jane Garvey took the \nreins of the FAA on August 4, 1997.\n  We knew that the FAA faced a daunting task in rebuilding and \nmodernizing our air traffic control system\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nand expanding our nation's airports. Over these last 5 years, we have \nwatched and learned as Administrator Garvey testified countless times \nbefore numerous committees about the needs of the agency and her future \nvision of the FAA.\n  The FAA Administrator's job is one of the toughest in government. \nWhen things go right, no one notices; but when things go wrong, \neveryone knows--and that is when the finger-pointing starts. Jane \nGarvey has handled this pressure with tremendous grace and an uncommon \nresolve to improve on the FAA's core commitment to safety.\n  Every day, over 35,000 commercial flights travel across our skies--\nsafely and efficiently. During the last several years, safety-related \ntragedies have been the exception, not the norm. Through Administrator \nGarvey's leadership and the dedicated staff of the FAA, we have come a \nlong way to revamping the FAA's mission, its organization, and its \nfuture.\n  Today, there are major airport expansion construction projects across \nthe country, as we make room for an expected 1 billion annual \npassengers by 2013. Thousands of new pieces of equipment have been \ntried, tested, and installed to increase the reliability and capacity \nof the air traffic control system.\n  Jane Garvey has worked tirelessly with all of us--the various \nsegments of the aviation community and the employees of the FAA--to \nimprove the performance of the FAA. In fact, Government Executive \nmagazine's privately run Federal Performance Project Team gave the FAA \nhigh scores in its 2002 report card for improving in all five \nmanagement areas that it grades. Since its last report card 3 years \nago, Government Executive noted Administrator Garvey's vast improvement \nof human resources management at the agency, and her significant \nprogress in technology upgrades and creating tools for accountability.\n  Administrator Garvey's tenure has been marked by a tremendous \nimprovement in labor relations at the FAA. Her commitment to the 49,000 \nemployees of the FAA is well recognized, and has contributed \nsignificantly to the productivity and achievement of the agency as a \nwhole. She has established a better working relationship with the \nnation's 20,000 air traffic controllers than at any point over the past \n20 years. Indeed, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers \nAssociation recently identified her as the ``finest administrator in \nthe history of the FAA.''\n  Since Jane Garvey took over at the FAA in 1997, I have had the \nopportunity to see her in action, and it has been a pleasure to work \nwith her on a number of issues of importance to West Virginia and the \nnation. Her ``can-do'' spirit is infectious and has resulted in an \nagency that strives to improve on past performances and does not \nblindly accept shortcomings as inevitable. Through her tireless support \nof many of the important initiatives that we have worked on together, \nshe has proven to be not just a good administrator, but a good friend.\n  Five years seems like along time in Washington, but perhaps it is too \nshort, for we will miss the strength and character of Jane Garvey. Our \ncountry owes her a great debt of gratitude for profound dedication to \nour aviation system.\n  Finally, I would like to submit for the record some excerpts from a \nspeech Administrator Garvey recently delivered before the Aero Club of \nWashington. Her remarks offer valuable perspective and direction for \nall of us who work in and care about aviation policy.\n\n       Today, you could say that our nation's economic engines run \n     on jet fuel. The economic impact of aviation is so big it's \n     almost beyond measure. Revenues generated by airports like \n     Chicago, O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Hartsfield Atlanta \n     run in the billions. U.S. aerospace industries have become \n     America's leading exporter in the manufacturing sector. And \n     as we were reminded so painfully after September 11, tourist \n     travel, which depends on the airlines, accounts for one out \n     of seven jobs in America, and is among the top three \n     employers in 29 states.\n       In this era of globalization, technologies like cable \n     modems and cell phones make vital connections--still, they're \n     virtual connections. If you really want to reach the rest of \n     the world, you've got to board a plane. Simply put, there is \n     no globalization without aviation. That's why, on any given \n     day, as many as 1.9 million Americans take to the skies on \n     one of 33,000 commercial flights. Internationally, each year, \n     that number is as high as 1.6 billion--more than one-fourth \n     of the people on this planet.\n       We chart our progress by numbers like these--billions of \n     passengers, billions in revenue, millions of tons of cargo, \n     minutes (at most!) of delay. But, of course, it's not just \n     numbers that count. It's people. It's the men, women and \n     children who board our planes every day--to attend a \n     daughter's wedding; to leave for college for the first time; \n     to attend an important meeting on the other side of the \n     world; or to visit a new grandchild just a short flight from \n     home.\n       As I said in 1997, our first and most important priority \n     was to make the world's safest skies even safer, in the face \n     of dynamic industry growth, expanding demand, and public \n     concerns. And we had to modernize the nation's air space \n     system in a timely and cost effective way. From my first days \n     in office, these have been my goals. Just as important, they \n     have been yours as well. I believed then--and believe even \n     more strongly today, after the experience of these past five \n     years--that the only way to meet these challenges is to face \n     them together, government and industry, pilots and air \n     traffic controllers, labor and management the FAA and \n     Congress.\n       Collaboration isn't just a management style; consensus \n     isn't just something to strive for. In aviation, they are \n     essential elements in any real plan for progress. As the \n     pilot Lane Wallace has written: ``In one sense we are all \n     alone, whether in an airplane or on the ground, and we have \n     final responsibility for whatever path we take through life \n     or the sky . . . [But] we understand that while we may fly \n     solo, we are also all connected, and we need each other in \n     order to survive.''\n       That's true not only for pilots, but also for controllers, \n     technicians, mechanics, flight attendants--and the FAA \n     Administrator. We've stopped defining ourselves by our \n     competing interests and started applying ourselves to our \n     common goals. Those goals haven't changed: we're focused, as \n     ever, on safety, efficiency, and adding capacity. But the way \n     we pursue our goals has been evolving. We now pursue them as \n     a community. We acknowledge--even embrace--our \n     interdependence. And that, in my view, has made all the \n     difference these past five years.\n       It's certainly made a difference in the accident rate. \n     Working together, we reduced the accident rate for U.S. \n     airlines by 29 percent over our baseline last year. We did so \n     by agreeing on an unprecedented strategic plan for safety--\n     Safer Skies. We now base our priorities on what the data, not \n     the headlines, say. Through new partnerships like ASAP, the \n     Aviation Safety Action Program, and by sharing data, we can \n     identify early warning signs, intervene in targeted ways, and \n     track the effectiveness of our efforts. I'm proud that we've \n     met every annual target in the accident rate, and I'm \n     confident that by 2007, we'll reach our greater goal: \n     reducing the commercial accident rate by 80 percent.\n       Over the past five years, we have met many other \n     imperatives of modernization with the same determination. \n     Since 1997, we've completed more than 7,100 projects, \n     installing new facilities, systems, and equipment across the \n     U.S. and integrating them into the National Airspace System. \n     We've done more than 10,000 upgrades of ATC hardware and \n     software. Today, you can visit every one of our centers in \n     America and won't find a single piece of hardware that's been \n     around longer than I've been in this job (it only feels like \n     a long time).\n       With the FAA's commitment to RNP--which takes advantage of \n     the aircraft's capabilities--we're taking crucial steps in \n     our transition from a ground-based to a satellite-based \n     system, and toward safely handling more aircraft in less \n     airspace.\n       I think the way we achieved all this is not less remarkable \n     that what we've achieved. You know, it seems sort of obvious \n     that when you're designing new technological tools, you ought \n     to consult the people--controllers, technicians, pilots--who \n     are going to use them. For too long, that just wasn't the \n     case. When new equipment arrived at the loading dock, it was \n     a little too much like Christmas Day--no one knew what was \n     inside the box; the instructions were near impossible to \n     follow; and batteries were not included.\n       Today, everyone knows what to expect--and how to use it. \n     When we develop new products and programs, we do it not only \n     with the users in mind, but at the drawing board.\n       With all this new hardware and software, delays due to \n     equipment are down 70 percent from this time last year. A \n     Eurocontrol report shows that the productivity of U.S. \n     controllers is about twice as great as in Europe--and that \n     our air traffic management is about twice as efficient. It's \n     true: you just don't hear about outrages anymore. Instead, \n     you hear about more direct routes, lower fuel consumption, \n     and--let us not forget--better service for the men, women, \n     and children who entrust us with their air travel. Of course, \n     they're less concerned with who's using what technology than \n     with getting to their destination safely, swiftly, and \n     affordably. These new efforts help them to do so.\n       It is this clear progress in air traffic management that is \n     so critical for aviation's recovery from the one-two punch of \n     the terrorist attacks and last year's recession. After an \n     inevitable decline--in traffic, yields, revenue--we expect to \n     see traffic returning to pre-recession levels next year.\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\n       Those one billion annual passengers we've been projecting \n     may not be in the departure lounge just yet, but they're on \n     the way. Demand will continue its historic rise--and we're \n     determined to meet it. Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta \n     talks frequently about closing the gap between demand for air \n     travel and the capacity of our infrastructure. Whether or not \n     we build it, they will come. And as Phil Condit reminded us \n     in recent speech. ``Economic growth follows infrastructure.''\n       That's why the government and the aviation community \n     reached agreement last year on the Operational Evolution \n     Plan, which, as you know, is the centerpiece of the \n     FAA's efforts to build and expand infrastructure over the \n     next decade. The OEP includes new runways, new \n     technologies, and new procedures. It's not a wish list; \n     it's a set of marching orders--clearly setting out the \n     responsibilities of the FAA, airlines, and airports. These \n     ideas are meant for action. And we're already seeing what \n     action can achieve.\n       Look at Detroit. Detroit's new runway opened last December. \n     Overnight, the number of flights per hour that Detroit Metro \n     can handle jumped from 146 to 182 in good weather--a 25 \n     percent increase. We've targeted our efforts toward the worst \n     bottlenecks in the system. The controllers among you have \n     told me that conflict probe, now in use at four en route \n     centers, is the biggest improvement in the en route \n     environment they've seen in their entire careers. It cuts \n     costs even as it cuts emissions.\n       With results like this, I am more confident than ever that \n     we are going to meet our goal: increasing capacity by up to \n     30 percent over the next ten years. We are already looking at \n     how we can accelerate initiatives and reach for more \n     capacity.\n       The critical question--which we are already tackling with \n     industry--is, ``What's next? ''\n       All of this progress flows directly from one source: our \n     spirit of community. It is incredible to behold. I have seen \n     it in so many ways on so many occasions during my five years \n     in office. And in all that time, the spirit of community was \n     never stronger than on September 11. Among the countless acts \n     of heroism on that terrible day, history will record the way \n     the aviation community pulled together, in the worst of \n     circumstances, to bring the planes down quickly and safely--\n     and bring the system back up smoothly in the weeks that \n     followed.\n       We have realized more and more the potential of flight. We \n     have mitigated more of its risks. But in many ways, we've \n     only begun.\n       Moving forward, our mission must be to build on this \n     foundation--and create a legacy worthy of our children. The \n     next Administrator will face many challenges--some I've just \n     discussed, and surely many new ones. One of the greatest will \n     be the challenge of staying focused on modernization and \n     safety, in the face of new security pressures.\n       For obvious reasons, security concerns will continue to \n     command the headlines. They demand our attention and deserve \n     our vigilance.\n       The FAA's mission is just as important as ever. Not only \n     the new administrator, but also all of us, must keep our \n     focus on that. The industry faces an additional challenge in \n     providing a higher and higher level of service to its \n     customers. I do not want to leave office without saying how \n     grateful I am to Presidents Bush and Clinton, and Secretaries \n     Mineta and Slate, for entrusting me with this awesome \n     responsibility. And I am grateful to you for helping me, to \n     the best of my abilities, to fulfill it.\n       I took office on the cusp of a new century; and depart with \n     those new horizons, and the new possibilities we foresaw, a \n     little closer in reach. It is you who made it so; you who \n     created this moment of opportunity; you who will carry us \n     forward. Every time I visit a control facility or an airport, \n     or talk to a pilot, or see the launch of a new technology, I \n     am impressed anew by your dedication and professionalism. I \n     am uplifted by your commitment to our mission.\n       I know my successor will count on your insights and \n     energies just as much as I have. Because if one thing is \n     clear to me as I leave office, it is that our roles, like our \n     lives, are interdependent; our goals are interconnected. \n     Modernization, for example, is dependent on the financial \n     health of the industry. Safety depends not only on new \n     technology but also on the century-old concern of labor \n     relations. Efficiency in the air has a lot to do with \n     security provisions on the ground. And so on. None of us is \n     flying solo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF GENERAL JOHN A.

Mr. President, as a Senator from Wyoming and \nChairman of the Senate Air Force Caucus, one aspect of my public \nservice that I truly enjoy is the opportunity to work with remarkable \npeople who are more like family than coworkers and colleagues. On \nCapitol Hill, we all know each other and we all feel each other's \nsorrows and share in each other's joys and triumphs.\n  This is one of those occasions that brings both a touch of joy and \nsadness as we say congratulations and thank you at the same time that \nwe bid farewell to someone who has devoted his life to the service of \nhis country in the military and on the Hill, where he has made many \nfriends among the staffs of our offices.\n  We were fortunate that General Shaud served as the Executive Director \nof the Air Force Association. Before his acceptance of that post, he \nhad amassed quite an impressive military career that began when he was \ncommissioned into the United States Air Force in 1956.\n  In his 50-year career General Shaud has served in the field and at \nU.S. Air Force headquarters in Washington. His later Air Force \nassignments included Chief of Staff for Personnel for the U.S. Air \nForce, Commander of the Air Training Command at Randolph Air Force \nBase, and Chief of Staff of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. \nHe led and inspired those under his command and excelled while gaining \ngreater responsibilities.\n  I would be remiss if I did not point out that during his military \ncareer General Shaud was able to complete the requirements for a Master \nof Science degree, which he received from George Washington \nUniversity--my alma mater. He also has a doctorate from Ohio State \nUniversity and has served on the faculty of Air Command and Staff \nCollege.\n  Over the years, General Shaud has amassed more than 5,600 flying \nhours and piloted several dozen different aircraft. He was awarded the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross and several other awards and citations \nfor his outstanding service and leadership.\n  For General Shaud, his retirement from the U.S. Air Force was just \nthe end of one career and the beginning of another. General Shaud moved \non to take on the responsibilities of the Air Force Aid Society and \nthen later, the Air Force Association, from which he will now be \nretiring. Through it all, he has continued to impress with his \nleadership, creativity, personality, and ingenuity. He has been a role \nmodel for many and he will no doubt continue to inspire those with whom \nhe comes into contact.\n  I would also point out that without him, Congressman Cliff Stearns \nand I would have had a far more difficult time in our work to establish \nthe Air Force Caucus.\n  Now it is time for General Shaud to move on to another adventure in \nhis life. I do not know what he will be doing, but I know he will be \nchanging direction and heading off to face other challenges in the \nyears to come.\n  Good luck, General Shaud, and God bless. May you have many years of \nan enjoyable retirement and the good health to enjoy each day to the \nfullest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7884-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7884-S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF ALTON ARA HOVNANIAN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

And I would put \nbefore this Chamber today that this is a shared loss felt within these \nSenate walls not only because this kind of suffering is too great for \nany family to bear alone, but that the untimely death of this young man \nrepresents the loss of the optimistic spirit and positive energy of a \nyoung American mind.\n  Not preoccupied with self, often characteristic of this age, Alton \nHovnanian had an interest in and concern for others, a deep interest \nand concern for the workings of the U.S. Government, and perhaps \nsurprisingly, for those of us in this room. As a child of only 14, he \nwas largely unknown to us, but Alton Hovnanian was a bright, good \ncitizen of my State and this country who I am sure many of my \ncolleagues would have been delighted and inspired to know. Alton was \ncertainly interested in us and knew many of our names, our expertise, \nour committees and concerns. Isn't this an honor for us to now know\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\nthat a 14-year-old New Jersey boy sat before his family room television \nset in Monmouth County and chose to turn the channel, not to a game \nshow or sitcom, but to C-Span, the History Channel, and CNN in order to \nlearn yet more about us and the work we do. How many young men and \nyoung women, boys and girls are there today, tuning in, attentive, and \neager to learn more about this Nation's leadership and work? Unknown to \nus, Alton Hovnanian was watching and I am honored by his attention. If \nany of us wonder why it is we get up in the morning, remember this: \nthere are 14-year-olds like Alton watching us, and they care. How \npowerfully inspiring it is for us to remember the reach of the work \nafforded by our office.\n  Alton Hovnanian was not a head of state or a captain of industry, \nthough he seemed certainly well on his way, as the achievements in his \nyoung life were many. Indeed, Alton set the standard in his age group. \nWith a lifelong love of boating and the water, especially the New \nJersey coastline near his home, Alton earned the rights and privileges \nof a full captain license and the highest scuba diving accreditation. \nHe was the recognized leader in community service outreach efforts at \nthe Rumson Country Day School and was voted the ``Most Likely to \nSucceed'' by his peers at that excellent institution at its middle \nschool graduation just weeks ago. Having traveled extensively with his \nfamily throughout much of the world, Alton was comfortable in many \ndifferent nations and maintained an active curiosity about other \ncountries, cultures, traditions and cuisine. He brought home, however, \nan ironclad insistence that things be right here at home, with concern \nfor the comfort and care of our less fortunate citizens, and in the \nproper order of things within this Nation.\n  Alton Hovnanian represented the best of young America. He wanted the \nbest for this Nation and for those around him. He was a loving son, a \ngood citizen, a student of history and government and a responsible \nleader among his peers. He has honored all of us with his life.\n  May we always remember him as his father would, ``Good sailor, brave \ncaptain, dear friend, let your gentle spirit fill our sails.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7885-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BIG QUARTERLY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, each year on the last Sunday in \nAugust, a commemorative festival is held in Wilmington, DE. Known as \nthe Big Quarterly, or the August Quarterly, the festival celebrates the \nheritage of the independent black church movement, and the continuing \nimportance of the movement's cultural, political and social, as well as \nreligious, influence.\n  For us in Delaware, as for our Nation as a whole, the history is both \nproud and painful. The first fully independent black church was founded \nin Wilmington in 1813; originally called the Union Church of Africans, \nit is now known as the African Union Methodist Protestant, AUMP, \nChurch. It was founded by a former slave, Peter Spencer, and was built \non land purchased with the help of Delaware's Quaker community, which \nnotably included the station-master of the Underground Railroad, Thomas \nGarrett.\n  Affectionately known as ``Father,'' and formally as Bishop, Peter \nSpencer believed in the ``twin'' forces of education and religion to \nempower and to liberate African-Americans. The movement toward \nreligious freedom was closely linked with the anti-slavery campaign, \njust as predominantly black churches in more recent times have provided \nleadership in the civil-rights movement and in the ongoing work toward \nequality of opportunity.\n  The Big Quarterly, also initiated in 1813, commemorates the founding \nof the Mother AUMP Church, and honors Peter Spencer's visionary \nleadership. The festival combines worship with a cultural celebration \nand a sprit of reunion, of renewing ties with family, friends and with \na history of activism that continues to inspire us all.\n  The history and spirit represented by the Big Quarterly are important \nto our identity and character as a community and as a nation. It is an \nevent that both reminds us of what has been overcome, and challenges us \nto complete the journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7885-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRY QUADRACCI\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a Wisconsinite \nwho died tragically this week, but whose life and work will be long \nremembered.\n  Harry Quadracci was many things: an entrepreneur, an innovator, a \ncommunity leader, a committed philanthropist, and a dedicated husband \nand father. Harry lived an extraordinary and exemplary life. The \nfounder and president of Quad/Graphics, Harry started from scratch, \nbuilding a printing business which has become a dominant force in the \nindustry and the largest privately held business of its kind in North \nAmerica. He brought thousands of jobs to Wisconsin and was renowned as \nan outstanding employer.\n  As a community leader, Harry leaves a tremendous legacy to the \nMilwaukee area and to the entire State of Wisconsin. He and his wife \nBetty Quadracci pledged $10 million toward the beautiful new addition \nto the Milwaukee Art Museum. They also gave generously to many other \ncauses, including the Milwaukee Repertory Theater and the restoration \nof St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee.\n  Harry Quadracci's passing is a great loss to all those who knew him \nand all those whose lives were touched by his many good works. I am \ndeeply saddened by his passing, but I know that his leadership and \ngenerosity have left a lasting mark on our State. He will be remembered \nfor many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7885-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7885-S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO BG JAMES D. HITTLE, USMC (RET.)\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to BG \nJames D. Hittle, USMC (retired) who was buried at Arlington Cemetery on \nJuly 24, 2002.\n  I was privileged to serve with this distinguished military office and \npublic servant in the Navy Secretariat during the Vietnam war years. \nHis main responsibilities were naval manpower and reserve affairs, but \nhis wisdom was sought not only by me as the Under Secretary of the Navy \nbust also by Secretary of the Navy John Chafee and Secretary of Defense \nMelvin Laird. He remained my friend and valued adviser throughout his \nlife.\n  I ask that the tribute to a great American General Don Hittle which \nwas delivered at his funeral by General Paul X. Kelly, USMC (retired), \nthe 28th Commandant of the Marine Corps be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n     A Tribute to Brigadier General James D. Hittle, USMC (Retired)\n\n       Brigadier General James Donald Hittle--devout Christian--\n     great American--Marine officer--gentleman and gentle man--\n     loving husband--caring father--always a friend in need!\n       Commissioned a Marine Second Lieutenant in 1937, Don Hittle \n     was a ``plank owner'' when Major General Holland Smith \n     activated the 1st Marine Division for World War II--was D-4 \n     for the 3d Marine Division under Major General Graves Erskine \n     on Guam and at Iwo Jima--and after the war commanded 2d \n     Battalion, 7th Marines, in the Occupation of North China.\n       After serving his Corps for 23 years, Don Hittle's future \n     life could easily qualify him as a quintessential \n     ``Renaissance Man.''\n       He was Director of National Security and Foreign Affairs \n     for the Veterans of Foreign Wars; syndicated columnist for \n     Copley News Service; commentator for Mutual Broadcasting \n     System; Special Counsel for both the Senate and House Armed \n     Service Committees; a founder and Director of the D.C. \n     National Bank; Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower \n     and Reserve Affairs; Senior Vice President for Pan American \n     Airways; consultant to the President of the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation; advisor to several Secretaries of the \n     Navy and Commandants of the Marine Corps--and the list goes \n     on and on and on.\n       Colonel Don Hittle came into my life during the summer of \n     1956, when Major General Jim Riseley dragged me kicking and \n     screaming from a cushy tour in what was then the Territory of \n     Hawaii to the labyrinthian corridors of Headquarters Marine \n     Corps. As many of those here today will recall, this was the \n     long, hot summer of Ribbon Creek, and Don Hittle was \n     Legislative Assistant to Randolph McCall Pate, our 21st \n     Commandant. I was a young, eager, starry-eyed Captain, very \n     naive in the arcane world at the Seat of Government--but, I \n     was soon to learn. My first lesson was a negative one--that a \n     junior officer should never ask the Legislative Assistant to \n     the Commandant for a description of his duties and \n     responsibilities. With that said, I did notice that every \n     time Colonel Hittle came charging into General Riseley's \n     office he closed the door behind him. While I readily \n     admit to not being a ``rocket scientist,'' I did surmise \n     that there were some ``big time'' discussions underway. \n     But, as the saying goes: ``Nothing succeeds quite like \n     success.'' I was soon to learn that\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\n     by working closely with the Congress, where Members and \n     their staffs knew him, respected him, and trusted him, Don \n     Hittle had effectively minimized the repercussions from \n     Ribbon Creek. One senior member from the House of \n     Representatives was heard to say: ``Don Hittle is the best \n     damned Legislative Assistant the Marine Corps has ever \n     had.''\n       One could go on for hours, perhaps days, about Don's myriad \n     contributions to his Country and his Corps. As an example, I \n     could tell you how he more than any other saved the Army Navy \n     Club from extinction. Senator John Warner, who is here with \n     us today, could tell you that when he was Secretary of the \n     Navy he never had a more imaginative and dedicated Assistant \n     Secretary. Joe Bartlett, the former House Reading Clerk and a \n     retired Marine Corps General, could tell you how Don Hittle \n     was responsible for the creation of the dynamic Congressional \n     Marine Club. Incidentally, Jim Lawrence, who is also with us \n     today, once said of this organization: ``Congress created the \n     Marine Corps--Congress has sustained the Marine Corps--\n     Congress has mandated the mission of the Marine Corps--\n     through this organization we are now bonded to each other \n     forever.''\n       In the end, however, all of his many other contributions to \n     his Country and to his beloved Corps pale by comparison to \n     what he accomplished as a member of the renowned ``Chowder \n     Society'', that elite group of brilliant Marine officers who, \n     in the aftermath of World War II when the very life of our \n     Corps was threatened, insured that our existence, our roles, \n     and our missions were written into law. Don's critical role \n     in the survival of his Corps was best described by General \n     Merrill Twining when he inscribed his book, No Bended Knee, \n     ``To: Don Hittle, Who saved our Corps.'' There can be no \n     doubt that our Corps we have today, with three active \n     divisions and wings written into law, owes an enormous debt \n     of gratitude to Brigadier General James D. Hittle, USMC \n     (Retired).\n       Isn't it ironic to remember that fifty-five years ago \n     certain groups, whose objectives were inimical to the \n     survival of our Corps, were attempting to relegate us into \n     insignificance. Today, with a lion's share of the credit for \n     making it possible going to Don Hittle, we have just heard \n     that Jim Jones, our 32d Commandant, is soon to be the Supreme \n     Allied Commander in Europe. Our congratulations go to Jim--\n     his Corps is very proud--Don Hittle is very proud!\n       Several years after my retirement, Don asked me to join him \n     for lunch at his Army Navy Club. His purpose was to ask if I \n     would give his eulogy. I was honored beyond belief, but did \n     not look forward to the day when it would become a reality.\n       Before closing, let me share with you a story that Joe \n     Bartlett told me last week.\n       Jinny and Joe are members of a Bible class at their church. \n     As a gesture of their love and caring for those who are \n     terminally ill, the class prepares an audio tape for their \n     listening. On one side they include the patient's favorite \n     hymns, and, on the other, a medley of their favorite tunes. \n     During Don's last days with us--a time when he was under \n     heavy sedation--Joe swears that Don's body stiffened to \n     attention every time the Marines Hymn was played.\n       In closing, let me remind you that Don lived by two simple \n     words--words which have given inspiration to our Corps for \n     over 200 years--Semper Fidelis--always faithful.\n       Don Hittle was always:\n       Semper Fidelis to his God.\n       Semper Fidelis to his Country.\n       Semper Fidelis to his Family.\n       Semper Fidelis to his Corps.\n       And, Semper Fidelis to his fellow man.\n       In Don's memory, then, let us share these meaningful words \n     with each other as we leave this holy place--and let us pray \n     that one day we can live in a world where all of its citizens \n     are Semper Fidelis to each other. Don Hittle would like \n     that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7886-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECLAMATION OF LA SIERRA PARK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate a \nvery special and important story about a few hometown heroes who \nchanged the face of an entire neighborhood.\n  La Sierra Park is in the heart of the La Sierra neighborhood in \nRiverside, CA. Two years ago, gangs came to frequent the park, \ntransforming this small treasure into a place of crime and fear. \nPlayful interaction among children was replaced with drug dealing. \nResidents were robbed and could not use the park unless they paid gang \nmembers an entrance fee. However, when a woman was raped in the park in \nlate 2000, local residents decided to fight back.\n  Marisol Ruiz and Araceli Moore, co-founders of Friends of Myra Linn, \nled a growing number of neighbors in the effort to take back the park. \nThey passed out flyers, held Neighborhood Watch meetings and attended \nCity Hall meetings. They did everything they could to gather support.\n  This project turned into ``Operation Safe Park.'' City workers got \nvolunteers to help transform the park back into the treasure it once \nwas. Volunteers augmented police patrols at the park, increased \nlighting and trimmed the foliage so criminals had nowhere to hide. \nSoon, residents were enjoying a soccer game and school dance \nperformance held at the park. It is clear that the park was back in the \nhands of the community.\n  The story of ``Operation Safe Park'' shows what a neighborhood can do \nwhen it comes together for community improvement. I applaud Marisol \nRuiz, Araceli Moore and all those who worked so hard to make a \ndifference in this neighborhood. In taking back this park, these people \nmade their neighborhood a safer and better place for now and for future \ngenerations. Their exemplary dedication and commitment serve as an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7886-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRIAN HONAN\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Tuesday, Boston lost one of its \ngreatest public servants, City Councilor Brian Honan. Brian was raised \nin a family that held public service in the highest regard. He learned \nearly in life the value of community and the strength of working \ntogether on a common goal. In his brief life, Brian touched so many \npeople in countless ways. The true measure of Brian's contribution to \nBoston and Massachusetts may never be known, but the life he lived and \nthe love he gave will live on in the hearts of his friends, his family \nand the city of Boston for years to come.\n  In his years of service to his community, in the District Attorney's \nOffice or as a City Councilor from Allston and Brighton, Brian never \nforgot his principles and ideals, never forgot those he served and the \ncity he loved so well, and never forgot the need to fight for those who \nare unable to fight for themselves. There is no greater example of \nwillingness to serve his fellow man than the life and legacy of Brian \nHonan.\n  A bright light in the Boston community was lost to us all on Tuesday \nbut the strength and power of that light lives on in Brian's legacy, \nand is a powerful reminder to us all about what public service is all \nabout.

She has played an invaluable role in harmonizing the various \ngoals shared by Pakistan and the United States, goals ranging from \nadvancing the international war on terror to de-escalating tensions in \nSouth Asia. Moreover, Ambassador Lodhi has- by both her words and her \npersonal example- helped bridge the chasm of misunderstanding between \nthe United States and the Islamic world.\n  Ambassador Lodhi's mission has been to serve the people and nation of \nPakistan, and she has fulfilled that mission superbly. But at this \ncritical juncture, Ambassador Lodhi has also been a great asset in \nfurthering the common interests not only of Pakistan and United States, \nbut of many voices of moderation, tolerance and progressive thinking \nall across the Muslim world. Her presence here in Washington will be \nsorely missed, and we wish her all the best on her return \nhome.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7886-4", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7886-S7887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KING BISCUIT TIME\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, ever since it hit the airwaves \none lunchtime fifty-six years ago this November, ``King Biscuit Time'' \nhas profoundly influenced the development and popularity of the blues. \nAs the oldest and longest-running blues program on the radio, it helped \npromote the careers of bluesmen who pioneered this musical style and \nlater brought it from street corners and juke joints in the South to an \ninternational audience. And today,\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nKFFA and Helena are even ``must see'' stops for Japanese and European \ntourists who want to learn about the cultural roots of the blues.\n  ``First things first,'' recalls Sonny ``Sunshine'' Payne, the \nprogram's host for over eleven thousand broadcasts; King Biscuit Time \nstarted when guitarist Robert Junior Lockwood and harmonica player \nSonny Boy Williamson were told they would have to get a sponsor to get \non the air.'' That was 1941, when Payne was a teenager cleaning 78 \nrpm's and running errands at KFFA. ``They came to the station one day \nand I showed them in to station manager Sam Anderson . . . he sent them \nover to the Interstate Grocery Company and its owner Max Moore who had \na flour called ``King Biscuit Flour . . .''\n  Lockwood and Williamson became the show's original King Biscuit \nEntertainers who advertised flour and corn meal in Helena and the \nsurrounding Delta region; and after a lucky break, Sonny Payne took \nover as program host when the announcer lost his script while on the \nair. The program was a smash hit, thanks mostly to the playing and on-\nair presence of harp player Williamson. He became so popular that the \nsponsor named its product ``Sonny Boy Corn Meal'' and he was, and still \nis, pictured, smiling and with his harmonica, on a burlap sack of his \nown brand of meal.\n  Williamson was a musical pioneer in his own right. He was one of the \nfirst to make the harmonica the centerpiece in a blues band. His unique \nphrasings, compared by many to the human voice, influenced countless \nharp players.\n  His partner, Robert Junior Lockwood, stepson of the legendary Robert \nJohnson, also influenced the blues style. A fan of big band jazz, he \nincorporated jazzier elements into the blues, often playing the guitar \nwith his fingers.\n  As years passed, the duo expanded into a full band, including piano \nplayer ``Pine Top'' Perkins, Houston Stackhouse and ``Peck'' Curtis, \nand musicians who played on the show also advertised local appearances \nthat gave them more work.\n  With the success of ``King Biscuit Time,'' Helena soon became a \ncenter for the blues. It was a key stopping off point for black \nmusicians on the trip north to the barrooms and clubs of Chicago's \nSouth and West sides. Already, in the thirties, the town had seen the \nlikes of pianist Memphis Slim and Helena native Roosevelt Sykes, as \nwell as guitarists Howlin' Wolf, Honeyboy Edwards, and Elmore James. \nAnd when the program went on the air, it helped shape the early careers \nof many an aspiring musician. ``Little Walter'' Jacobs and Jimmy \nRogers, who later played with Muddy Waters, came to live and learn in \nHelena in the mid-1940's. Muddy Waters also brought his band to Helena \nto play on KFFA and in bars in the area. Teenager Ike Turner first \nheard the blues on KFFA around that time, and King Biscuit pianist \n``Pine Top'' Perkins gave him lessons in his trademark boogie woogie \nstyle.\n  The program also influenced other stations to put the blues on the \nradio. Its initial popularity convinced advertisers that the blues had \ncommercial potential. ``It was a major breakthrough,'' explains \nfolklorist Bill Ferris, director of the Center for the Study of \nSouthern Culture at Ole Miss; ``King Biscuit Time was a discovery of an \naudience and a market . . . that hitherto radio had not really \nunderstood.'' Across the Mississippi River from Helena, radio station \nWROX put the South's first black deejay, Early Wright, on the air \nspinning blues and gospel records in 1947. Upriver in Memphis, station \nWDIA the next year became the first southern station with an all-black \nstaff, including a young musician named Riley ``B. B.'' King, who got \nan early break as a deejay. And, in Nashville in the late forties, \nstation WLAC reached nearly half the country with its late-night blues \nand R shows. All of these programs and stations owe an enormous debt \nto ``King Biscuit Time.''\n  And today, the legacy of the show continues, with blues programs \nheard on radio stations across the U.S., the recordings of the many \n``King Biscuit Entertainers,'' and the yearly King Biscuit festival in \nHelena celebrating the city's cultural heritage and significant role in \ndeveloping and promoting the blues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7887-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR JIM COSTA FOR TWENTY-FOUR \n                        YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE.\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I ask that excerpts from the \nFresno Bee Editorial from July 24, 2002 be printed in the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, July 24, 2002]\n\n                          Calling it a Career\n\n\nJim Costa's valuable service in the state Legislature coming to an end.\n\n       Democrat Jim Costa will make his political curtain call \n     next month at a testimonial dinner that is expected to draw \n     some of California's most powerful politicians. It will be a \n     fitting send-off recognizing a 24-year legislative career \n     that began with youthful exuberance and is ending with a \n     record of accomplishments that you'd expect from a seasoned \n     veteran.\n       The dinner on Aug. 25 at the Fresno Convention Center will \n     bring together four of the state's five living governors, \n     along with San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, the former \n     speaker of the Assembly. Costa has worked with all of them, \n     gaining their respect even when they were at political odds. \n     Dinner proceeds will benefit the Kenneth L. Maddy Institute \n     at California State University, Fresno.\n       Costa understands better than most politicians the \n     independent nature of Valley's voters. First in the Assembly \n     and then in the state Senate, he balanced the political \n     interests of the region as well as any legislator. He has \n     championed the needs of agriculture and has fought to improve \n     the Valley's business climate. He also battled to improve the \n     plight of the region's many impoverished communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7887-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7887-S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE RETIREMENT OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF LARRY SMITH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the \ndistinguished career of Riverside County Sheriff Larry Smith, who will \nretire later this year. Sheriff Smith is also the immediate past \npresident of the California State Sheriff's Association. The people of \nRiverside County, his colleagues and admirers will celebrate his career \non August 9.\n  During Sheriff Smith's extraordinary 36-year record of service to law \nenforcement, he has held numerous positions and has achieved many \nimportant accomplishments. He served as Riverside County's Search and \nRescue Coordinator and commanded the Department's SWAT team before \nworking as chief deputy sheriff. Thanks to Sheriff Smith's leadership \nand vision during his tenure as chief deputy sheriff, the Riverside \nCounty Corrections system is one of the largest in the United States.\n  Sheriff Smith was elected to serve as Riverside County Sheriff in \n1994 and was reelected to serve a second term in 1998. During Sheriff \nSmith's tenure, Riverside County saw a dramatic decrease in crime. \nSheriff Smith was instrumental in the creation of the Ben Clark Public \nSafety Training Center. He collaborated with federal, state and local \nlegislators to establish the facility, which provides valuable training \nfor law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics. As I have \nseen for myself, it is truly a model for public safety training centers \nthroughout the nation.\n  In addition to his tremendous commitment to his career, Sheriff Smith \nis an exemplary community leader. He has been active in the American \nHeart Association, the United Way of the Inland Empire and the Debbie \nChisholm\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nMemorial Foundation, an organization dedicated to improving the quality \nof life for terminally ill children.\n  I am proud to add my words of commendation to the praise and \nrecognition Sheriff Smith has received throughout his respected career. \nI extend to him my sincere congratulations for his countless \ncontributions to the force and to the broader community. Riverside \nCounty is a safer and better place because of his fine leadership. \nAlthough Sheriff Smith will be greatly missed, his work continues to \nbenefit Riverside County. I wish him a wonderful retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORIAM: MARGARET WAHLSTROM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mrs. Wahlstrom was \n78 years old when the flight she was on, American Airlines Flight 11, \nwas hijacked by terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into the \nWorld Trade Center, killing everyone on board.\n  Mrs. Wahlstrom and her daughter, Carolyn Beug, were traveling \ntogether on that tragic day. They were returning to their homes after \nhaving settled Mrs. Beug's twin daughters at the Rhode Island School of \nDesign. This American family lost two dearly beloved women on September \n11. ``The one thing those terrorists cannot destroy is love. They \ncannot destroy the love we have in this family, and the love people \nhave for each other,'' says Margaret Wahlstrom, daughter-in-law of Mrs. \nWahlstrom.\n  Mary Alice Wahlstrom was traveling throughout Europe as a young \nsocialite until she met, and fell in love with, Norman Wahlstrom, \nSenior. He was a World War II hero and like most Air Force families, \nthey moved many times. They raised five children together, finally \nsettling in Utah, where Mary Alice became a loan officer.\n  Mrs. Wahlstrom shared a zest for life with those around her. She is \nremembered as a vibrant, exuberant woman. One neighbor called her, \n``dynamic, with a wonderful outlook on life.'' She loved to laugh. Mrs. \nWahlstrom exercised daily, played the piano and volunteered as an usher \nat Temple Square. She enjoyed reading, traveling, debating current \nevents and going to the movies. ``She was a ball of fire. She was 78 \nwhen she died, but she could have lived another 25 years. I have no \ndoubt about it,'' says her son Scott Wahlstrom.\n  During the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Olympic Games, her son, \nNorman Wahlstrom, Jr., carried the Olympic torch in Ogden, Utah, in \nhonor of his mother. ``As with every boy that ever lived, my mother was \na shining example of hope and promise. She had a wonderful, perpetual \nsmile and contagious laugh,'' says Wahlstrom.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n150th Anniversary of the City of Visalia and Tulare County, California. \nThe City and the County are celebrating their official anniversaries \ntogether on September 7, 2002 at historical Mooney Grove Park.\n  The City of Visalia and the County of Tulare were both organized in \n1852. The State of California was two years old.\n  Visalia started as a small, creekside settlement and has grown into \nthe dynamic community it is today. Commonly referred to as ``Jewel of \nthe Valley'' and ``Gateway to the Sierra,'' Visalia is now home to more \nthan 92,000 residents. It is renowned for its great Valley Oaks that \ngrace its neighborhoods, reminders of the natural heritage of which its \nresidents are so proud.\n  Tulare County, anchored on the east by spectacular Sierra Nevada \npeaks, Giant Sequoia groves and fertile plains, which make it the \nnumber one agricultural county in the world, is also one of the largest \ncounties in the great San Joaquin Valley. It is home to Sequoia and \nKings National Park and the Giant Sequoia National Monument. Its \nresidents range from its Native Americans to dozens of nationalities \nfrom all corners of the globe, making its communities diverse and proud \nof their shared heritage.\n  Both the City of Visalia and County of Tulare have thrived since \ntheir early beginnings. I have had the distinct pleasure of visiting \nboth the city and the county over the years. Both are truly valuable \nassets to the State of California.\n  I am honored to serve the people of Visalia and Tulare County and \nwish them all a wonderful sesquicentennial anniversary celebration. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in wishing the City of Visalia and \nTulare County many more years of prosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7888-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7888-S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORIAM: CAROLYN BEUG\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

They were returning to their homes after \nhaving settled Mrs. Beug's twin daughters at the Rhode Island School of \nDesign. This American family lost two dearly beloved women on September \n11th.

They cannot destroy the love we have \nin this family, and the love people have for each other,'' says \nMargaret Wahlstrom, Carolyn Beug's sister-in-law.\n  Mrs. Beug, the daughter of an Air Force colonel, was a citizen of the \nworld. She grew up in many places, including Pennsylvania, South Korea \nand Utah. Carolyn Beug was a successful accountant, CFO, and real \nestate developer. She was a music industry executive, music video \nproducer and director. Mrs. Beug helped establish a center for \nunderprivileged children in Los Angeles and won the 1992 MTV Video of \nthe Year award for directing a video by the rock group Van Halen. She \nwas the wife of John Beug and mother of Lauren, Lindsay and Nicky. In \n1998, Mrs. Beug left the music industry to write a book and to devote \nmore time to her family.\n  When her daughters joined the Santa Monica High School Track Team, \nMrs. Beug became actively involved as the team mother. She was \naffectionately known as ``Momma Bunny'' and she attended every meet, \ncheering on the team and purchasing new shoes, uniforms and sweats when \nneeded. At the end of every season, she hosted the team banquet at the \nBeug family home. ``She always called the kids on the team ``my little \nbunnies,'' recalls her husband, John.\n  ``Such an electric and peripatetic personality leaves an impression \nwherever she goes, whether that's a corporate boardroom, a movie \nstudio, a children's shelter, a high school stadium, or a home on a \nquiet tree lined street. The impressions she left, a bright smile, a \nheartfelt belly laugh, a nugget of wisdom, an odd take on a song, a \nwhispered secret, a motherly embrace are permanent,'' adds John Beug.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11th, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate the memory of one of my \nconstituents, Christopher Cairo Newton, who lost his life on September \n11, 2001. Mr. Newton was 38 years old when the plane he was on, \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77, was hijacked by terrorists. As we all \nknow, that plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing everyone on board.\n  Mr. Newton's life was filled with many wonderful and impressive \naccomplishments. He was a successful businessman and world traveler who \nloved the performing arts and music, the game of golf, and any home \nimprovement project he could find. He became an Eagle Scout at 14, \ngraduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with high marks and earned his \nCPA. After completing his MBA at UCLA's Anderson School, he was named \nPresident and CEO of Work/Life Benefits.\n  Close family friend Steven Falk said there was nothing in the world \nthat Christopher cared more about than his children. Christopher, his \nwife Amy and two children Michael and Sarah had recently moved from \nSouthern California to the Virginia suburbs outside of Washington, DC. \nHe was in the process of relocating company headquarters to Virginia, a \nmove that would put the company closer to key customers and allow \nChristopher to spend more time with his family. Christopher loved to \nattend school functions, coach his son's little league team, or just \nhave a quiet dinner at home with his wife and children.\n  Mr. Newton was also close to his parents and siblings. His father \nMichael said ``He was very bright. An avid golfer, a great skier, a \nchampion Scrabble player. He never gave us a moment's trouble in his \nlife.'' His brother Stephen says that ``Chris taught me to be patient \nand hopeful and to always play by the rules.''\n  It is clear that Mr. Newton was serious, intense and committed to his \nresponsibilities. Yet he was always able to laugh at himself. A quote \nfrom a friend says it best. ``He was confident with no airs, loving \nwith no expectations, giving with no greed, funny with no offense.''\n  Christopher is survived by his wife Amy, their two children Michael \nand Sarah, his parents Michael and Barbara Newton, sister Ann-\nElisabeth, brother Stephen, an aunt, cousins, nieces, a nephew and a \nclose circle of friends.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day.

For the past 16 years, John has \nguided Rushmore Bank and Trust in new and innovative directions. John \nhas also helped guide the entire banking profession in South Dakota by \nserving as a past president of the South Dakota Bankers Association. \nJohn came to South Dakota in the same year I was first elected to \nCongress. During my years in Congress and now as the Chairman of the \nSenate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, I have relied on \nJohn's vast experience and knowledge of the banking industry to help \nguide my decisions on important policy matters.\n  In addition to his professional dedication, John is a true leader in \nthe Rapid City community and has earned the respect and friendship of \nso many of us fortunate to spend time with him.

Mr. President, last week I had the honor of \nswearing in the American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation president. I am \nproud to announce that Kasdin Miller of Montgomery, Alabama, was \nelected president by the other participants in this fine program. Three \nof the last six presidents of Girls Nation have come from my home State \nof Alabama. Girls Nation celebrated its 56th year this year, and 96 \nteenage girls from 48 states participated. These teenagers were \nselected through their participation in the American Legion Auxiliary's \nGirls State program. I would also note that Alabama Girls State \ncelebrated its 60th anniversary this year, making its program one of \nthe oldest in the country.\n  The Girls State and Girls Nation programs of electing senators and \ncreating state legislatures and local governments is an extraordinary \nlearning process. Participants in Girls State and Girls Nation, and \ntheir counterparts in Boys State and Boys Nation, gain first-hand \nexperience in how our laws are made. Each summer, some 20,000 \nenthusiastic young women participate in Girls State sessions across the \nnation, where they study local, county, and state government processes. \nThese young people are our leaders of tomorrow, and I salute them for \ntheir interest in government. Former participants in Girls State \ninclude three current members of the U.S. House of Representatives-\nBarbara Cubin of Wyoming, Connie Morella of Maryland, and Jennifer Dunn \nof Washington. Perhaps one day we may see Kasdin and other Girls Nation \nparticipants on the floor of the Senate and House.\n  Kasdin, a rising senior at the Montgomery Academy, also had the high \nhonor of being elected Governor of the Alabama YMCA Youth in Government \nprogram. I enjoyed meeting her when she came to Washington as Alabama's \nYouth Governor in June. She has been a leader on her school's debate \nteam and earned a spot in the national tournament this year. She excels \nin the classroom as well. Kasdin is an intelligent young lady who has a \nbright future, and she is to be commended for her achievements. Indeed, \nI congratulate all of the participants in both Girls Nation and Boys \nNation for their accomplishments and encourage them to continue to \nprepare themselves to be America's future leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7889-4", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7889-S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    APPRECIATION FOR A JOB WELL DONE\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \npay tribute to Astronauts Colonel Carl E. Walz and Captain Daniel W. \nBursch for their significant contributions and record-setting \naccomplishments as part of the International Space Station's Expedition \n4 Crew.\n  Astronauts Walz, Bursch, and Expedition Commander and Russian \ncosmonaut Yuri Ivanovich Onufrienko departed from Kennedy Space Flight \nCenter on December 5, 2001, for what became a 6\\1/2\\ month stay aboard \nthe International Space Station. The crew of three spent 196 days in \nspace, with Carl Walz and Dan Bursch establishing a new U.S. space \nflight endurance record. The previous U.S. record belonged to Astronaut \nShannon Lucid, who spent 188 continuous days in space aboard the \nRussian Mir Space Station. With four previous flights and his \nExpedition 4 mission, Astronaut Walz also established a new U.S. record \nfor the most days in space, with a total of 231 days, surpassing Dr. \nShannon Lucid's record of 223 days.\n  We look to our Nation's space program to improve life here on Earth \nand explore the unknown. We also look toward the future, to the time \nwhen we will extend life beyond the bounds of Earth. On February 20, \n2002, while aboard the International Space Station, the Expedition 4 \ncrew spoke with Ohio's former Senator and NASA pioneer, John Glenn, who \nwas the first American to orbit the Earth 40 years ago.\n  We have come a long way in the U.S. space program, and our future \ndiscoveries are limited only by our imagination and commitment. We must \ngive special recognition to our Astronauts whose personal and \nprofessional commitment to live and work in space continues to break \nbarriers and thresholds.\n  While on the International Space Station, in addition to maintaining, \noperating and performing research experiments, the Expedition 4 crew \ninstalled the S-zero truss segment. The S-zero truss forms the backbone \nof the Station which will eventually hold the four solar array \n``wings'' of the U.S. segment. The crew tested the new Quest Airlock \nand performed the first spacewalk from it without the Space Shuttle \npresent. The crew also was the first to use the Space Station Robotic \nArm as a ``cherry picker,'' maneuvering space walkers ``flying'' on the \nend of the arm during spacewalks.\n  After an extended, U.S. record-setting stay on the International \nSpace Station, the crew returned to Earth with Shuttle Endeavor, \nlanding at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002.\n  Astronaut Carl E. Walz, a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, was born in \nCleveland, OH. He and his wife, the former Pamela J. Glady, have two \nchildren. Walz has received numerous Distinguished Service medals, \nincluding the Defense Superior Service Medal, three NASA Space Flight \nMedals, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal.\n  Astronaut Daniel W. Bursch, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and \na Captain in the U.S. Navy, considers Vestal, NY to be his hometown. He \nand his wife, the former Roni J. Patterson, have four children. Captain \nBursch also has received recognition for distinguished service, \nincluding the Defense Superior Service Medal and NASA Space Flight \nMedals. Bursch has over 3,100 flight hours in more than 35 different \naircraft and has logged a noteworthy 227 days in space.\n  On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I thank \nastronauts Carl Walz and Dan Bursch for their courage, commitment and \ncontributions in service to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7890-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE EFFORTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA'S \nCOMMUNITY FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO CONTAIN THE GRIZZLY GULCH AND LITTLE ELK \n                              CREEK FIRES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to recognize the heroic \nefforts of over 60 South Dakota community fire departments and the \nState of South Dakota's Wildland Fire Suppression Division in \nresponding to recent forest fires in the Black Hills. Their work was \nheroic, professional, and saved several Black Hills communities from \ncomplete devastation.\n  On Saturday, June 29, 2002, a forest fire broke out in Grizzly Gulch, \nsouth of the town of Lead, SD, and near the town of Deadwood. Steep, \nrugged hills and unstable terrain crisscross the Black Hills impeding \nefforts to control the early stages of a forest fire. By Saturday \nevening, fire had crept within a few hundred yards of the historic city \nof Deadwood and in some instances flames literally touched the sides of \nhouses. Ninety-degree temperatures, high winds, and low humidity levels \nfueled the fires run up ridges and engulfed thousands of acres in a \nmatter of hours. If it had not been for the quick reaction and \nprofessionalism of the South Dakota Wildland Suppression Office and the \nmen and women who established a fire line between Deadwood, the city \ncould have witnessed a catastrophic fire.\n  Within a few hours Joe Lowe, the Grizzly Gulch Incident Commander, \nhad marshaled over 250 personnel, including several hand crews, 7 heavy \nair tankers, and pieces of heavy earth-moving equipment to keep the \nfire from approaching Deadwood. By the Fourth of July the number of \npersonnel fighting the fire swelled to over 670 with an influx of U.S. \nForest Service crews under the authority of Paul Hefner, fire commander \nfor the Grizzly Gulch blaze. As fire crews battled flareups and \nconstructed fire lines to control the fire, high winds kept crews alert \nfor what firefighters refer to as slop-over, flames jumping the line \nand burning out ahead of the fire line.\n  South Dakotans responded. Volunteer firefighters from 60 community \nfire departments from as far away as Sioux Falls descended on the \nregion. After the fires were contained, Deadwood sponsored a night of \nfestivities to thank the hundreds of firefighters who battled the \nGrizzly Gulch fire and saved the town of Deadwood. The town's round of \napplause and appreciation spoke for the entire State's gratitude for \nthe bravery of our community firefighters.\n  At the fire's peak, over 900 firefighters fought the Grizzly Gulch \nfire, putting themselves in harm's way to save the towns of Lead and \nDeadwood. Through their selfless action, the community and State \nfirefighters of South Dakota reaffirmed that during a crisis South \nDakotans speak with one voice. I would like to add my voice and say \nthank you to the men and women who served us so proudly last \nmonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7890-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7890-S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VADAM THOMAS R. WILSON, USN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to a great sailor, patriot, husband and \nfather, VADM Thomas Ray Wilson. By the time we return from our August \nrecess, this great sailor will have officially retired from active \nservice on August 30, 2002, having faithfully and loyally served his \ncountry around the globe for over 33 years. Admiral Wilson ends his \nactive service having served at the pinnacle of military intelligence \nas the 13th Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n  Born in Columbus, OH, Admiral Wilson is a 1968 graduate of Ohio State \nUniversity. He joined the Navy at the height of the Vietnam conflict, \nand received his commission as an ensign in March 1969, following \ncompletion of Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, RI.\n  Throughout his extraordinary military career Admiral Wilson \ndistinguished himself as a candid innovator, a patient, creative \nteacher; and a great leader. His early assignments included watch \nofficer and analytical and command briefing positions in the Taiwan \nDefense Command in Tapei, Taiwan, and in the Defense Intelligence \nAgency. Subsequent duties ashore and afloat included assignment on the \nUSS Kitty Hawk; as the operational intelligence officer with the \nIceland Anti-submarine Warfare Group; duty with Carrier Air Wing Three \nembarked in USS Saratoga; and force intelligence officer for Commander, \nPatrol Wings Atlantic in Brunswick, ME.\n  Recogizing his potential to serve the Navy and the Nation in \npositions of\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\ngreat responsibility, the Navy selected Admiral Wilson to serve as \nCommander, Task Group 168.3 in Naples, Italy, where, under his \nleadership, this unit earned the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. \nAfter this successful tour, Admiral Wilson moved on to Yokuska, Japan, \nwhere he served as the Fleet Intelligence Officer and Assistant Chief \nof Staff for Intelligence, U.S. Seventh Fleet, embarked in U.S.C. Blue \nRidge.\n  After returning to the United States, Admiral Wilson served in a \nvariety of senior positions in Washington, DC, and the Norfolk, VA \narea, including Director of Fleet Intelligence, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, \nand as Director of Intelligence, J2, U.S. Atlantic Command, where he \nwas deeply involved in the planning and execution of operations to re-\nestablish freedom and democracy in Haiti in 1994.\n  Admiral Wilson has served in the most senior military intelligence \npositions in our Government since 1994, including Vice Director for \nIntelligence, J2 on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon; as the Associate \nDirector of Central Intelligence for Military Support within the \nCentral Intelligence Agency; and, as the Director for Intelligence, J2 \non the Joint Staff in the Pentagon. In these positions Admiral Wilson \nwas intimately involved in the planning and execution of virtually all \nU.S. military operations around the world in the past 8 years. In the \nprocess, he has gained the personal respect and confidence of two \nPresidents, three Secretaries of Defense, four Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and countless Members of Congress. As Admiral Vern \nClark, Chief of Naval Operations, who was Director of the Joint Staff \nwhen Admiral Wilson was the J2, noted at Admiral Wilson's retirement \nceremony recently, ``When Tom Wilson spoke, we listened.'' In \nconversations I have had with colleagues in the Senate and with \nnumerous Defense officials who interacted with Admiral Wilson, there \nwas uniform consensus--his analysis was thorough, his judgment was \nclear and his instincts were flawless.\n  In July 1999, Admiral Wilson moved on to his last and most \nchallenging active duty post as the 13th Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency and, symbolically, the chief of military \nintelligence for all of our Armed Forces. His 3-year tenure at the \nDefense Intelligence Agency was marked by the same innovativeness, \ncommitment to excellence and selfless service to Nation that \ncharacterized his entire military career. He reshaped the Agency to \nensure that it was meeting the 21st century demands of our senior \nmilitary and civilian leaders and that it was postured to respond to \nthe rapidly evolving challenges our Nation will face in the years \nahead.\n  Admiral Wilson's outstanding leadership qualities were never more \napparent than during the Defense Intelligence Agency's most difficult \nhour--the September 11 attack on the Pentagon. His crisis management \nabilities were critical in the hours that followed--both in accounting \nfor members of the Agency, and in positioning the Agency to provide \ncritical threat data in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The \nDefense Intelligence Agency lost seven members in the Pentagon attack, \nwith five others seriously injured. Admiral Wilson's personal contact \nwith each family who lost a loved one, and with the five surviving \nmembers in the days and weeks that followed was most appreciated and \nhighlighted the selfless concern for others this remarkable sailor has \nalways demonstrated. His concern for family members and his outreach to \nthe workforce were critical to holding the Agency together as it worked \nits way through the aftermath of the attack. His leadership was \nabsolutely key to ensuring warfighters and policymakers obtained the \nbest possible support as the Nation began to respond. The success of \nour forces in the global war against terrorism is a testament to the \nquality of effort given by the Defense Intelligence Agency under the \nable leadership of ADM Tom Wilson.\n  Throughout his career, Admiral Wilson has displayed unmatched \ndedication to providing the highest quality intelligence support to the \nwarfighter and senior defense officials. His leadership has helped \ntransform the military intelligence community into a joint, \ninteroperable, technologically advanced federation that is postured to \nsupport the challenges of today and tomorrow. His personal commitment \nto the intelligence community, to the Navy, and to our Nation is of the \nhighest, most commendable order.\n  I wish to extend my gratitude and appreciation to VADM Tom Wilson and \nhis wife of 33 years, Ann, for their friendship, their sacrifice, and \nfor the remarkable service they have provided to our Nation, our Navy, \nand to the countless young people whose lives they have touched in such \na remarkably selfless and positive way. On behalf of a grateful Nation, \nI want to sincerely thank Tom and Ann Wilson for serving so faithfully \nand so well. As they end their active service with the Navy, I wish \nthem success and happiness in retirement and future endeavors. As a \nfellow sailor, I wish them fair winds and following seas--\nGodspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7891-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7891-S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVE GERZINA\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a patriot \nand a technical expert, Dave Gerzina, who is retiring from civilian \nservice to the Navy on August 3, 2002.\n  Dave was born in Youngstown, OH and was raised in the Miami, FL area \nfrom the age of eight. He attended Florida Atlantic University and \nreceived a Bachelor of Science in Ocean Engineering. In 1970, Dave \nbegan working for the Navy at the David Taylor Model Basin in Bethesda, \nMD and has worked continuously for the Navy at three different \nlocations over the past 32 years.\n  Dave's first assignment was working for the Hydro-Mechanics Division \nin analyzing maneuvering and seakeeping of naval vessels. He worked \nthere for over 5 years when he transferred to the System Development \nDivision in Panama City, FL.\n  While in Panama City, Dave served extensively in the development and \ntesting of the Landing Craft Air Cushioned vehicle, LCAC. He provided \nin-valuable engineering and technical expertise for the duration of the \ndevelopment program, seeing it to a successful completion during his \neight-year stint at the facility.\n  Dave transferred to the Naval Surface Warfare Center's Acoustic \nResearch Detachment at Bayview, Idaho in January 1984. He has worked \nfor the Acoustics Department in numerous roles during his 18 continuous \nyears of service at this facility.\n  Dave initially held the title of Technical Operations Manager, and \noversaw all testing and operations performed at the ARD. He was later \npromoted to the Buoyant Vehicle Operations Manager, where he managed \nthe development and testing of many flow-noise features for Los Angeles \nClass submarine sonar self-noise improvements. In addition, he re-\ndesigned and improved the Detachment's test ranges, and conducted \noperations in support of the very successful Seawolf Class self-noise \nprogram.\n  He was also instrumental in developing the capability to perform \nfull-scale Towed Array testing in Idaho, which saved months and \nthousands of dollars over at sea testing, culminating in the \nprocurement of a Navy research vessel.\n  Dave achieved his greatest career success during the 1988-1995 period \nwhen he was responsible for overseeing the installation of the Navy's \nunique, world class Intermediate Scale Measurement System (ISMS) at \nLake Pend Oreille. As Project Manager he was responsible for obtaining \nenvironmental approval to develop the system, interfacing with the \nnumerous organizations, engineers, scientists and contractors to plan \nand then install the intricate system and associated facilities, and \nfinally, the testing to characterize and verify the site. Since \ncompletion of the installation in 1995, Dave has assumed the role of \nTest Program Manager and has been responsible for the conduct of \nnumerous successful ISMS tests as well as the responsibility of \nmaintaining the system.\n  Dave has improved the ISMS Program's capabilities and reputation into \nthe Navy's premier test site for performing structural, target strength \nand radiated testing of large-scale submarine models. The underwater \nrange portion has been referred to as the most complex underwater \nstructure in the world.\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n  Dave and his wife of 32 years, Robin, have three adult children and \ntwo beloved Dalmations. Dave has been an accomplished bass fisherman \nand elk hunter since his youth, competing in numerous tournaments. He \nis also an accomplished sailor and plans to take several ocean trips in \na Catamaran after retirement. He hopes to apply his carpentry skills to \nfinish and sell his current house, then settle down in Florida for the \nwinters and spring, returning each year to a small cabin in Idaho for \nthe summers and autumns. Finally, Dave is seriously considering \nobtaining a law degree in his future spare time.\n  Dave Gerzina has been a significant contributor to our nation's \nresearch capabilities, as well as numerous performance improvements to \nquieting operational and future vessels and submarines. I want to wish \nDave and Robin good luck, fair winds and following seas in their next \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7892-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAJOR GENERAL JOE G. TAYLOR, JR.\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great Army \nofficer, and a great soldier. This month, Major General Joe G. Taylor, \nJr. will depart the Pentagon to assume new duties as the Commanding \nGeneral, U.S. Army Security Assistance Command in Alexandria, VA. For \nover two years, he has served as first the Deputy then the Chief of \nArmy Legislative Liaison where he has proven himself to be a trusted \nadvisor to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff.\n  During his tour as the Chief of Army Legislative Liaison, he guided \nthe Army's relationship with Congress, wielding a deft and skillful \ntouch during a period of tremendous change. Throughout this period, Joe \nTaylor ably assisted the Army's senior leadership in dealings with \nMembers of Congress and their staffs in helping them to understand the \nneeds of the Army as it faces the challenges of a new century. His \nleadership resulted in cohesive legislative strategies, responsiveness \nto constituent inquires, well-prepared Army leaders and a coherent Army \nmessage to Congress.\n  Joe Taylor's career has reflected a deep commitment to our Nation, \nwhich has been characterized by dedicated selfless service, love for \nsoldiers and a commitment to excellence. Major General Taylor's \nperformance over twenty-seven years of service has personified those \ntraits of courage, competency and integrity that our Nation has come to \nexpect from its Army officers. The Pentagon and the Army Secretariat's \nloss will be the Army Security Assistance Commands gain, as Major \nGeneral Taylor continues to serve his country and the Army. On behalf \nof the United States Senate and the people of this great Nation, I \noffer our heartfelt appreciation for a job well done over the past two \nyears and best wishes for continued success, to a great soldier and \nfriend of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7892-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NAMING JULY AS NATIONAL AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, yesterday my friend and colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I introduced a resolution of \nwhich every American should be proud. Our country has seen wars, \nrecessions, conflict, prosperity and unification. In order to honor our \ncollective past, this resolution would establish July as American \nHistory Month. July, the month of our country's declaration of \nindependence--a time when Americans put aside differences of opinion \nand signed one of the most important documents in our country's \nhistory--is an ideal time for us to reflect on our Nation's history and \neducate our children about America's past.\n  Studies have shown that Americans lack a passable knowledge of our \nhistory. We, as Americans, should learn from and understand this \nhistory. I believe we must encourage Americans of all ages and \nethnicities to learn the history and heritage of the United States. \nStudies have shown that our next generation of leaders may lack the \nknowledge and understanding of what made our country great. In fact, \none survey showed that only 23 percent of college seniors could \nidentify correctly James Madison as the ``Father of the Constitution,'' \nand 26 percent of those same students mistakenly thought that the \nArticles of Confederation established the division of power between the \nstates and the Federal Government. To help overcome this lack of \nknowledge, our resolution would encourage teachers and parents to take \neducational adventures to historic sites where the students may gain a \nworking and memorable understanding of American history.\n  I always have been in strong support of teaching American history and \npreserving our historic sites. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have \nsponsored legislation, like the Fallen Timbers bill, the National \nUnderground Railroad Freedom Center Act, the National Aviation Heritage \nArea Act, and a resolution to honor the Buffalo Soldiers. Ohio has been \nhome to seven presidents, which led me to introduce the Presidential \nSites Improvement Act. I was also able to secure funds to help \nrestoration of the Grant boyhood home in Georgetown, Ohio. All of these \nefforts will help provide opportunities for children and adults to \nlearn about our nation's past.\n  I believe that individuals who have a strong knowledge of American \nhistory also possess a deeper appreciation of the need for historic \npreservation of properties, buildings, and artifacts. There are many \ngreat historical sites and museums around Washington and the nation--\nsites like the Smithsonian Museums, National Archives, Presidential \nbirthplaces, Civil War battlefields, and national monuments. I \nencourage parents to spend time with their families and take family \nvisits to these great sites.\n  I am proud to say that Congress also has affirmed its commitment to \nthe teaching of American history by appropriating $100 million to \nteaching American history in the Leave No Child Behind Act of 2001. \nSuch a financial commitment sends a serious message that Congress \nbelieves in the importance of American history. And, with the passage \nof our resolution, we can only strengthen that message.\n  In expressing the significance of American history, I defer to the \nwords of Marcus Tullius Cicero, the great Roman orator: ``We study \nhistory not to be clever in another time, but to be wise always.'' I \nencourage my colleagues to support the vital preservation of our \nhistory and our historical sites. Our future and wisdom, as Cicero so \naptly suggests, depend on our knowledge and grasp on the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7892-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7892-S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEW HAMPSHIRE'S REMARKABLE WOMEN IN 2002\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Laurel's career in education began with a simple guide-\nbook she wrote for a church-sponsored Relief Society. Since then, \nLaurel has taught at the University of Maryland and, most recently, at \nHarvard University as a professor and director of American History \nStudies. Laurel has also maintained a degree of success from her \nwriting including, ``Good Wives, Images and Reality in the Lives of \nWomen in Northern New England,'' her newest, ``The Age of Homespun: \nObjects and Stories in the Making of an American Myth,'' and ``A \nMidwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballad,'' for which she won the \nPulitzer Prize for History in 1991.\n  Maryann Mroczka was recognized for her extraordinary work in the \nfield of media. Maryann has moved from New Hampshire Public Television \nto transforming the University of New Hampshire's video department to \nbeing sought after by WMUR-TV. Along the way, Maryann has won numerous \nawards including two Emmy's and three Medals from New York \nInternational Film Festivals. Maryann currently maintains her busy \nschedule in television as well as a new family at home.\n  Cathy Bedor was recognized for her accomplishments in the area of \nhospitality. After Cathy, her husband, and three other local families \npurchased The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort, Cathy's skills in \nhospitality began to shine as they spent the next two years restoring \nand preserving the Historic Landmark. The hotel is now open year-round \nfor the first time in its history and Cathy had been there every step \nof the way. Cathy is truly an expert in her field serving on many \nboards in the state including the New England Innkeepers Association, \nthe White Mountains Attraction Association, and the New Hampshire \nHistorical Society.\n  Judy Sabanek was recognized for her accomplishments as President and \nCEO. Judy and her husband began Keepsake Quilting as a mail order \nbusiness and they are now co-owners of what has turned into one of the \nlargest quilting catalog businesses in the nation. Recently the couple \nhad to open a retail store in Center Harbor because of the enormous \nnumber of people wanting to come and see the fabrics. The company, and \nits now 100 employees, had just been acquired by an investment firm. \nThis may give Judy and her husband more time to spend with their two-\nyear old Portuguese Water Dog mascot, Cisco.\n  Natalie Woodroofe was recognized for her work in the field of \nEntrepreneurship. Natalie has spent her life as an advocate and role \nmodel for women and children in the North County and has received a \nnumber of awards for her work in this area. Natalie is the visionary \nand backbone to WREN, the Women's rural Entrepreneurial Network, the \nlargest and fastest growing non-profit in the State of New Hampshire. \nHer organization offers a number of workshops that teach women skills \nfrom technology training to networking. Natalie describes her work as, \n``Economic development, personal passions, giving back, connecting with \nothers, making a silk purse from pig's ears, hope and magic.''\n  Joan Goshgarian was recognized for her contributions to the field of \nart. Joan began as a teacher of art and soon developed an art therapy \nprogram for institutionalized adolescents who were developmentally and \nphysically challenged. In 1985, Joan became founder and executive \ndirector of the New Hampshire Business Committee for the Arts.

Joan \nis also on many boards around the state including the Granite State \nAssociation of Non-Profits and the Commission on Charitable Giving.\n  Anne Zachos was recognized for her excellence in the area of \nphilanthropy. Anne learned the importance of giving to the community \nfrom her parents when she was a child. When Anne was able to become \ninvolved she started with volunteer work for her children's schools, \nchurch, the Girl Scouts, and the League of Women Voters. Since then, \nAnne has been involved in more community work than is able to be \nhonored. Anne has had significant involvement with the New Hampshire \nCharitable Foundation, as a board member for the Manchester Regional \nCommunity Foundation and for ``Arts Build Communities.''

Floyd ``Jim'' Thompson, the longest-held prisoner \n     of war in American history, died July 16 in Key West, Fla. At \n     age 69, his heart finally gave out, ending one of the most \n     remarkable lives among heroes of the Vietnam War. Thompson's \n     death came 34 years after fellow POWs thought they saw him \n     die in Bao Cao, the nickname of a cruel prison camp in North \n     Vietnam. It was also 25 years after Thompson saw every dream \n     that had kept him alive in Vietnam shattered in the aftermath \n     of our longest war, a conflict vastly different from the war \n     against terror in Afghanistan. ``I am a soldier. Period,'' \n     Thompson would say if asked about the political correctness \n     of the Vietnam War. End of argument, and an icy stare.\n       Through nine years of torture, starvation, and unimaginable \n     deprivation, Thompson showed us the resiliency of the human \n     spirit. He refused to die, and until death had a willfulness \n     that inspired awe. He survived on dreams of returning home to \n     a loving wife, four adoring children, and a grateful nation. \n     When none of that squared with reality, years of bitterness \n     followed.\n       The avalanche of challenges at home, Thompson believed, did \n     not diminish his heroics or steadfast resistance before the \n     enemy. Those who saw his strength agree that what he endured, \n     and how, won't be forgotten. By the spring of 1968, Thompson \n     had been held in jungle cages and dank prison cells more than \n     four years, all of it in solitary confinement. The experience \n     turned a 170-pound Special Forces officer into a ``skeleton \n     with hair,'' said one POW, describing Thompson at first \n     sight. His appearance literally frightened other Americans, \n     most of them soldiers captured in the Tet offensive. Warrant \n     Officer Michael O'Connor/glimpsed Thompson through a crack \n     between wall and cell door. He was inches away, leaning \n     against his own cell bars.\n       ``This guy is dead, I thought,'' O'Connor told me for Glory \n     Denied, my book about the Thompson saga. ``As part of some \n     cruel joke, I thought they had stuck a corpse up against the \n     door. Then I realized he was moving.'' Dick Ziegler, a \n     captured helicopter pilot, heard Thompson say he had been \n     shot down in March 1964. Ziegler did a quick calculation, and \n     began to cry. ``Eyes sunk way back in his head, cheekbones \n     sticking out. . . . He scared me to death. I understood then \n     what was waiting for me,'' Ziegler said. As the days passed, \n     O'Connor heard Thompson scratching every morning against the \n     other side of this cell wall.\n       ``One day I asked him what he was doing. `Standing up,' he \n     said. Standing up! It took him half an hour. . . . Every day \n     I heard him standing up.'' Months later, during a routine \n     indoctrination session for POWs, Thompson collapsed into a \n     violent convulsion. That amazing heart was in seizure, \n     probably from starvation, doctors later surmised.\n       ``A couple of us were told to carry him back to his cell,'' \n     O'Connor recalled. ``We didn't see him move.'' Guards came \n     later and took Thompson away. The other POWs figured he was \n     dying if not already dead.\n       Before leaving Vietnam in 1973, they learned he survived \n     and his mystique grew, particularly among soldiers. His five \n     years of solitary ended April 1, 1969, when he was tossed \n     into a cell with three other Americans, including Lew Meyer, \n     a Navy civilian firefighter. Meyer and Thompson began an \n     astonishing daily exercise regime, leading to escape, \n     Thompson's fifth attempt, in the fall of 1971. The pair \n     avoided recapture in North Vietnam for two days. For his \n     courage and leadership in this incident, the first observed \n     by other POWs, Thompson would receive the Silver Star.\n       At home, within a year of losing her husband, Alyce \n     Thompson saw her support structure collapsing. She decided to \n     move her four children into the home of a retired soldier, \n     and pose as his wife. She instructed the Army to withhold \n     Thompson's name from POW lists. For years, the Army complied. \n     By the time Thompson was freed, in March 1973, Navy Lt. Cmdr. \n     Everett Alvarez had returned and been celebrated as the \n     longest-held POW. Thompson became a back-page story except in \n     his hometown newspaper.\n       At first, he didn't care. He was struggling to fulfill \n     dreams of family and career. He and Alyce tried to save their \n     marriage, with devastating consequences for the children. \n     Thompson himself wasn't well-armed for that task, battling \n     alcoholism, depression, and a deep sense of betrayal that \n     never eased.\n       After losing his family, Thompson fought to save his \n     career. Again, alcohol interfered, aggravating a nine-year \n     professional gap with officer peers. Thompson never blamed \n     the Army or the war for his troubles. He suffered a massive \n     stroke in 1981, which forced him to retire. Disabled, he \n     moved to Key West and shut himself off from family and \n     friends. His identity as a former POW, as longest-held, made \n     life worthwhile. He had flag poles installed in front of his \n     condominium complex so one could fly the POW-MIA flag. A \n     bronze plaque mounted nearby refers to Thompson, the resident \n     hero. Bolted to the fender of his new black Cadillac are two \n     large U.S. flags, fit for a motorcade. His license plate \n     reads ``POW.''\n       Thompson left instructions to be cremated and, without \n     ceremony, that his ashes be spread at sea--unless, at time of \n     death, he had been awarded the Medal of Honor. In that case, \n     with his sacrifices properly recognized, he wanted to be \n     buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n       Whether Jim Thompson deserves the nation's highest military \n     honor, others will decide. Surely, for what he gave, he \n     deserved more than he got.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7894-2", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7894-3", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7894-4", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the first time:\n\n       S.J.

A House Concurrent Resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to legislation to \n     repeal the Rescission Act of 1946 and the Second Supplemental \n     Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act of 1964, and to restore \n     Filipino World War II Veterans' to full United States \n     Veterans' status and benefit; to the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 34\n\n       Whereas, on July 26, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt \n     called back to active duty Lieutenant General Douglas \n     MacArthur, who was then serving as military adviser to the \n     Commonwealth government in the Philippines. President \n     Roosevelt appointed General MacArthur to command the newly \n     formed United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE); \n     and\n       Whereas, General MacArthur mobilized the entire Philippine \n     Commonwealth Army, consisting of approximately 212,000 \n     soldiers, into the USAFFE and reinforced approximately 10,000 \n     American soldiers, including the 10,000-strong Philippine \n     Scouts (who were the Filipino regulars in the American army) \n     and the 6,000-strong Philippine Constabulary, under the \n     command of American military forces; and\n       Whereas, with the destruction of the United States fleet at \n     Pearl Harbor and the United States Air Force at Clark Field, \n     and with the withdrawal of United States naval forces to \n     Java, the USAFFE lost its naval and air support in the first \n     few days of the war in the Pacific; and\n       Whereas, within days, Japanese troops landed in Aparri and \n     Vigan, in Legazpi and Davao, in Lingayen, Atimonan, and \n     Mauban, while their planes bombed military objectives and \n     government centers. Within a few weeks, the American and \n     Filipino forces defending Luzon were in full retreat to the \n     stronghold where General MacArthur proposed to make a last \n     stand--the peninsula of Bataan and the island fortress of \n     Corregidor; and\n       Whereas, in the ensuing months, Japanese Imperial Forces in \n     the Philippines focused all their military might against the \n     USAFFE in Bataan and Corregidor; and\n       Whereas, on February 20, 1942, President Manuel Quezon and \n     Vice President Sergio Osmena of the Philippine Commonwealth \n     left Corregidor for the United States to form a government in \n     exile. On March 11, 1942, General MacArthur left Corregidor \n     for Australia to take over the defense of the southern \n     Pacific area. It was upon his arrival in Melbourne that he \n     issued his famous pledge, ``I shall return''; and\n       Whereas, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the East Indies \n     (Indonesia) fell before the fierce Japanese advance in the \n     week following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The soldiers in \n     the Philippines, under the command of Lieutenant General \n     Jonathan Wainright, fought on. Their valiant struggle, the \n     only Allied resistance in East Asia during the winter and \n     spring of 1942, slowed down the enemy and gave Australia more \n     time to strengthen its defenses; and\n       Whereas, thousands of Japanese infantrymen, supported by \n     artillery barrages and tank fire power, pounded the Filipino-\n     American lines. Overhead, Japan's air corps soared and bombed \n     the foxholes, hospitals, and ammunition dumps of Bataan. From \n     the sea the enemy warships poured lethal shells on the \n     defenders' positions. Bataan was doomed. The defenders, \n     weakened by hunger, disease, and fatigue, fought fiercely and \n     many died as heroes; and\n       Whereas, Bataan fell on April 9, 1942. Corregidor's Voice \n     of Freedom radio station announced, ``Bataan has fallen, but \n     the spirit that made it stand--a beacon to all the liberty-\n     loving peoples of the world--cannot fall''. As many as 36,000 \n     Filipino and American soldiers were captured by the \n     victorious Japanese. Forced to set out on the infamous \n     ``Death March'' to San Fernando, tens of thousands died from \n     hunger, thirst, disease, and exhaustion. Survivors were \n     crammed into boxcars and shipped to imprisonment in Capas; \n     and\n       Whereas, General Wainwright and the 12,000 Filipino and \n     American soldiers manning the rocky fortress of Corregidor \n     continued to fight, but after the fall of Bataan, the end was \n     in sight for them as well. On May 6, 1942, Major General \n     William Sharp was ordered to be stop future useless sacrifice \n     of human life in the Fortified Islands, and to surrender \n     all troops under his command in the Visayan Islands and \n     Mindanao. Corregidor fell almost five months to the day \n     after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Organized military \n     resistance to the invasion of the Philippines ended that \n     day; and\n       Whereas, many Filipino officers and men refused to heed the \n     order to surrender. They fled to the hills with their arms \n     and, with the help of the civilian population, waged a \n     relentless guerrillas war against the invaders. The \n     guerrillas, almost without arms at the beginning, hungry, and \n     unclothed, gave battle to the enemy from every nook and \n     corner of the land. For three seemingly interminable years \n     and despite unbelievable hardships, they carried the torch of \n     freedom; and\n       Whereas, it was against the backdrop of Bataan, Corregidor, \n     and other theaters of battle, where alien soldiers under the \n     United States flag fought bravely and fiercely, that the \n     United States Congress amended the naturalization provisions \n     of the Nationality Act of 1940; and\n       Whereas, in 1942, Congress reestablished the policy it had \n     set forth during the first World War by providing for the \n     naturalization of aliens honorably serving in the armed \n     forces of the United States during the war. As part of the \n     second War Powers Act, Congress waived the requirement of \n     residence, literacy, and education for alien soldiers. The \n     law allowed any alien who was inducted or who enlisted into \n     the United States Army, Navy, or Air Force during World War \n     II to become a United States citizen; and\n       Whereas, even while the war was raging, alien soldiers in \n     England, Iceland, and North Africa, who served in American \n     military forces, could be naturalized as United States \n     citizens. This naturalization was made possible because \n     beginning in January 1943, naturalization officers were \n     dispatched to foreign countries where they accepted \n     applications, performed naturalization ceremonies, and swore \n     into American citizenship thousands of alien soldiers; and\n       Whereas, while the Philippines was under Japanese \n     occupation, approximately 7,000 Filipino soldiers were \n     naturalized outside the Philippines. The great majority of \n     Filipino soldiers in the country, however, were not even \n     aware of these liberal naturalization benefits. The United \n     States withdrew its naturalization officer from the \n     Philippines for nine months and then allowed the law to lapse \n     in 1946, so few Filipino veterans were able to exercise their \n     rights in a timely manner--rights that had been supposedly \n     earned on the battlefield for a lifetime; and\n       Whereas, although the Immigration Act of 1990 rectified \n     this foreclosure of rights by permitting Filipino veterans of \n     World War II to apply for naturalization and to receive \n     benefits after May 1, 1991, it did not remedy the betrayal of \n     Filipino veterans orchestrated forty-five years earlier by a \n     cost-conscious country through the Rescission Act of 1946 and \n     the Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act \n     (1946), which declared that the service performed by many \n     Filipino veterans was not ``active service'' and denied them \n     their veterans benefits after the fact; and\n       Whereas, while Filipino-American veterans who served \n     honorably in an active-duty status under the command of the \n     USAFFE or within the Philippine Army, the Philippine Scouts, \n     or recognized guerrilla units, between September 1, 1939, and \n     December 31, 1946, braved the same dangers and were entitled \n     to apply for naturalization, only those persons who served in \n     the armed forces of the United States or joined the \n     Philippine Scouts before October 6, 1945, currently are \n     entitled to the full-range of veterans benefits; and\n       Whereas, it should be the right of every Filipino-American \n     veteran of World War II, who served honorably in an active-\n     duty status under the Philippine Scouts, or recognized \n     guerrilla units, to receive the full-range of veterans \n     benefits, including a non-service disability burial allowance \n     and pension, treatment for nonservice connected disabilities \n     at Veterans Hospitals in the United States, home loan \n     guarantees, burial in a national or state veterans cemetery \n     and headstones, contract national service life insurance and \n     educational assistance for spouses and surviving spouses; and\n       Whereas, those who served in the armed forces of the United \n     States or Philippine Scouts that enlisted prior to October 6, \n     1945, are eligible for full veterans' benefits, but others \n     can only receive partial benefits. Those with limited \n     benefits include veterans of the Philippine Scouts \n     enlisted after October 6, 1945, Commonwealth Army of the \n     Philippines enlisted between July 26, 1941 and June 30, \n     1946, and recognized guerrillas with service between April \n     20, 1942 and June 30, 1946. For these groups, monetary \n     benefits are received in pesos in an amount equivalent to \n     only half of the dollar value, regardless of whether the \n     recipient resides in the Philippines or the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, Philippine veterans with military service with the \n     Special Philippine Scouts who enlisted between October 6, \n     1945 and June 30, 1947, under Public Law 190, 79th Congress \n     (``New Scouts'') are not entitled to full\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n     Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. They are only \n     entitled to service-connected disability benefits. This is \n     payable to a veteran if he is presently suffering from a \n     disability which the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     determined to be the result of a disease or injury incurred \n     in or aggravated during military service. The disability must \n     have been rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs as ten \n     per cent or more disabling to be compensable. (No \n     compensation may be paid for a service-connected disability \n     rated less than ten per cent disabling.) Medical treatment is \n     provided only for their service-connected disabilities; and\n       Whereas, Philippine veterans with military service in the \n     Commonwealth Army of the Philippines and recognized guerrilla \n     units are entitled to service-connected disability benefits \n     only if they are presently suffering from a disability which \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs determines to be the \n     result of disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during \n     military service. The disability must have been rated by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs as ten per cent or more to be \n     compensable. No compensation may be paid for a service-\n     connected disability rated less than ten per cent disabling. \n     Benefits are payable in Philippine pesos. Medical treatment \n     is provided only for their service-connected disabilities; \n     and\n       Whereas, there is no greater duty for a nation of free men \n     and women than the care of former soldiers and their \n     dependents, no greater honor for a former soldier than to be \n     laid to rest next to the soldier's comrades-in-arms, no \n     greater act of respect that a grateful country can show a \n     former soldier than to inter the soldier's remains on \n     hallowed ground, and no greater tribute that future \n     generations of freedom-loving Americans can visit upon a \n     former soldier than to remember those sacrifices may be the \n     soldier on the battlefield; and\n       Whereas, in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, upon \n     the establishment of the Veterans Administration (now the \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs), this country \n     has a sacred duty ``to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle, and for his widow and his orphan''; and awarding the \n     full-range of veterans benefits to former soldiers is the \n     very least that a grateful nation can do for those persons \n     who placed themselves in harm's way to protect the United \n     States from its enemies; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2002, the Senate concurring, that Congress and the President \n     of the United States are requested to support legislation to \n     repeal the Rescission Act of 1946 and the Second Supplemental \n     Surplus Appropriation Rescission Act (1946), and to restore \n     Filipino World War II veterans' to full United States \n     veterans' status and benefits; and be it further\n       Resolved that Hawaii's congressional delegation is again \n     requested to continue its support for legislation and other \n     action to ensure that Filipino-American veterans who served \n     honorably in an active-duty status under the command of the \n     USAFFE or within the Philippine Army, the Philippine Scouts, \n     or recognized guerrilla units, between September 1, 1939, and \n     December 31, 1946, are granted the full range of veterans \n     benefits that they were promised, that they are entitled to \n     and that is provided to other veterans recognized by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs; and be it further\n       Resolved that certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the members \n     of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the Adjutant \n     General.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-275.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to supporting the \n     acquisition of Kahuku Ranch for the expansion of the Hawaii \n     Volcanoes National Park and of Killae Village for expansion \n     of Pu Uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                          House Resolution 15\n\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island \n     consists of 217,000 acres and is one of only two national \n     parks in this State; and\n       Whereas, The Volcanoes National Park attracts about \n     1,500,000 visitors each year who enjoy the natural beauty of \n     the lava fields, native forests, and ocean cliffs; and\n       Whereas, a large parcel of land lying to the south and west \n     of the Volcanoes National Park known as Kahuku Ranch \n     consisting of 117,000 acres has come up for sale; and\n       Whereas, the Kahuku parcel contains outstanding geological, \n     biological, cultural, scenic, and recreational value, and is \n     the sole habitat for at least four threatened and endangered \n     bird species endemic to Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service since 1945 has \n     recognized that the property contained nationally significant \n     resources and in fact, in its 1975 Master Plan, the National \n     Park Service identified the property as a ``potential \n     addition to improve the geological, ecological, and scenic \n     integrity of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park''; and\n       Whereas, the 181-acre Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park was established in 1961 to save a sacred \n     place of refuge that for centuries offered sanctuary to any \n     who reached its walls; and\n       Whereas, adjacent to Pu`uhonua O Honaunau are the remains \n     of Ki`ilae, an ancient Hawaiian settlement dating back to the \n     late 12th or early 13th centuries, and which remained active \n     until about 1930, making it one of the last traditional \n     Hawaiian villages to be abandoned; and\n       Whereas, significant portions of this ancient Hawaiian \n     village remain outside of national park boundaries; and\n       Whereas, including these lands within the boundaries of \n     Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park has been a goal \n     of park management for more than three decades; and\n       Whereas, the park's 1972 Master Plan identified Ki`ilae \n     Village as a proposed boundary extension and in 1992, a \n     Boundary Expansion Study completed for the park called for \n     adding the ``balance of Ki`ilae Village''; and\n       Whereas, within the Ki`ilae lands the National Park Service \n     is seeking to acquire, more than 800 archeological sites, \n     structures, and features have been identified, including at \n     least twenty-five caves and ten heaiu, more than twenty \n     platforms, twenty-six enclosures, over forty burial features, \n     residential compounds, a holua slide, canoe landing sites, a \n     water well, numerous walls, and a wide range of agricultural \n     features; and\n       Whereas, in June 2001, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka \n     introduced a bill to authorize the addition of the Ki`ilae \n     Village lands to Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National Historical \n     Park and in October 2001, this bill passed the United States \n     Senate and it is anticipated that the authorization bill will \n     pass the House of Representatives as well; and\n       Whereas, these acquisitions offer an opportunity rarely \n     imagined because they would give the National Park Service an \n     excellent chance to expand and protect native plants and \n     archaeological sites from destruction; and\n       Whereas, these opportunities can benefit current and future \n     generations of residents and tourists, because expansion of \n     Volcanoes National Park and Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National \n     Historical Park will preserve more open space, add to the \n     natural environment, protect affected native species, and \n     preserve cultural and historical sites; and\n       Whereas, in January 2001, the National Park Service held a \n     series of public meetings to receive comments from the public \n     regarding possible purchase of Kahuku Ranch and Ki`ilae \n     Village, and the nearly 400 people in attendance at the \n     meetings expressed overwhelming support and endorsement; now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     First Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2002, that this body supports the acquisition by the United \n     States National Park Service of Kahuku Ranch for expansion of \n     the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and of Ki`ilae Village for \n     expansion of Pu`uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved that certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the Director of the National Park Service, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to the members of \n     Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-278. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to the \n     establishment of a sister-state relationship between the \n     State of Hawaii and the Municipality of Tianjin in the \n     People's Republic of China; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                          House Resolution 117\n\n       Whereas, Tianjin, a city in northeastern China, is one of \n     four municipalities under the direct control of the central \n     government of the People's Republic of China, and in 2001 had \n     a population slightly over 10,000,000; and\n       Whereas, the city is made up of 13 districts, five \n     counties, 126 villages, 93 towns, and 133 street communities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the history of Tianjin begins with the opening of \n     the Sui Dynasty's Big Canal (581-617 AD). Beginning in the \n     mid-Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), Tianjin became the nexus for \n     the transport of foodstuffs and silk between south and north \n     China. During the Ming Dynasty (1404 AD), the city figured \n     prominently as a military center. In 1860, its importance as \n     a business and communications center began to grow; and\n       Whereas, Tianjin is known as the Bright Diamond of Bohai \n     Gulf and is the gateway to China's capital of Beijing. \n     Tianjin is one of China's biggest business and industrial \n     port cities and, in north China, is the biggest port city. \n     Tianjin now ranks second in importance and size in terms of \n     industry, business, finance, and trade in the north. Its \n     industrial production and trade volume is second only to \n     Shanghai in the south; and\n       Whereas, the city's traditional industries include mining, \n     metallurgy, machine-building, chemicals, power production, \n     textiles, construction materials, paper-making, foodstuffs, \n     shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, petroleum \n     exploitation and processing, tractor production, fertilizer \n     and pesticide production, and watch, television, and camera \n     manufacturing; and\n       Whereas, in 1994, Tianjin's economic goal was to double its \n     gross national product by the year 2003. With its 1997 gross \n     national product reaching RMB 124 billion yuan (about RMB \n     8.26 yuan to US$ 1), Tianjin is poised to reach that goal. By \n     the end of 1998, 12,065 foreign-owned companies were \n     established in Tianjin that invested a total of RMB 21.017 \n     billion yuan (about US$ 2.5 billion). About RMB 9.291 billion \n     yuan (about US$ 1.1 billion) of that amount was used for \n     development of Tianjin; and\n       Whereas, in the past, business and other forms of \n     industrial enterprises were primarily state-owned throughout \n     China. However, under on-going nationwide reform, the \n     proportion of businesses that are state-owned is being \n     reduced. In Tianjin, the percentage of state-owned \n     enterprises in 1997 was 35.7 percent versus 16.6 percent for \n     collective ownership, and 47.7 percent for other forms, \n     including private ownership. In the retail sector, the \n     respective proportions were 23.7 percent, 17.3 percent, and \n     59 percent, respectively; and\n       Whereas, Tianjin has a broad science and technology base \n     upon which to build, for example, it is home to 161 \n     independent research institutions (117 local and 44 \n     national). Aside from its several universities and colleges, \n     Tianjin has six national-level laboratories and 27 national \n     and ministerial-level technological test centers and has \n     plans to increase its science and technology educational \n     goals; and\n       Whereas, in 1984, the State Council issued a directive to \n     establish the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area \n     (TEDA), situated some 35 miles from Tianjin. Recently, some \n     3,140 foreign-invested companies have located to TEDA with a \n     total investment of over US$ 11 billion; and\n       Whereas, at present, TEDA has developed four pillar \n     industries: electronics and communications, automobile \n     manufacturing and mechanization, food and beverages, and \n     biopharmacy, and is promoting four new industries: \n     information software, bioengineering, new energies, and \n     environmental protection; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, TEDA began offering a technology \n     incubator to help small and medium-sized enterprises with \n     funding, tax breaks, personnel, etc. Within the TEDA high-\n     tech park, Tianjin offers preferential treatment in the form \n     of funding, land fees, taxes, and facilities (such as water, \n     gas, and heating). Residential and other services, \n     shopping, and educational and recreation facilities are \n     either already in place or are being planned; and\n       Whereas, for the eleven months ending November 2001, total \n     exports from TEDA was US$ 3.53 billion, of which foreign-\n     funded enterprises accounted for US$ 3.49 billion while total \n     foreign investment in TEDA amounted to US$ 2.3 billion; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii has been, since its early days, the \n     destination of many Chinese immigrants who have helped to \n     develop the State and its economy; and\n       Whereas, compared to the rest of the country, Hawaii is \n     advantageously situated in the Pacific to better establish \n     and maintain cultural, educational, and economic \n     relationships with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     especially the People's Republic of China; and\n       Whereas, the new century we have embarked upon has been \n     described by some as the ``century of Asia'' or the ``China's \n     century''; and\n       Whereas, like Tianjin, Hawaii is also striving to diversify \n     its economy by expanding into environmentally clean high-\n     technology industries including medical services and \n     research; and\n       Whereas, the State also emphasizes the importance of higher \n     education in order to create a solid foundation and workforce \n     to serve as the basis from which to launch initiatives in \n     high-technology development; and\n       Whereas, both Hawaii and Tianjin share many common goals \n     and values as both work towards achieving their economic and \n     educational objectives in the new century, and the people of \n     the State of Hawaii desire to form a mutually beneficial \n     relationship between the State of Hawaii and the municipality \n     of Tianjin to share our knowledge and\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n     experiences in order to better assist each other in reaching \n     our goals; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     First Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2002, that Governor Benjamin Cayetano, of the State of \n     Hawaii, or his designee, be authorized and is requested to \n     take all necessary actions to establish a sister-state \n     affiliation with the municipality of Tianjin of the People's \n     Republic of China; and be it further\n       Resolved that the Governor or his designee is requested to \n     keep the Legislature of the State of Hawaii fully informed of \n     the process in establishing the relationship, and involved in \n     its formalization to the extent practicable; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved that the municipality of Tianjin be afforded the \n     privileges and honors that Hawaii extends to its sister-\n     states and provinces; and be it further\n       Resolved that certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to President of the United States, the Governor \n     of the State of Hawaii, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, Hawaii's coangressional delegation, and the \n     President of the People's Republic of China and the Mayor of \n     the municipality of Tianjin through the Los Angeles Consulate \n     General of the People's Republic of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROCKEFELLER, from the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute and \n     an amendment to the title:\n       S. 2043: A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to \n     extend by five years the period for the provision by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs of noninstitutional extended \n     care services and required nursing home care, and for other \n     purposes.

A bill to promote the development of health care \ncooperatives that will help businesses to pool the health care \npurchasing power of employers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation to help businesses form group-purchasing \ncooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, to reduce health care rates, \nand to improve quality for their employees' health care.\n  High health care costs are burdening businesses and employees across \nthe Nation. These costs are digging into profits and preventing access \nto affordable health care. Too many patients feel trapped by the \nsystem, with decisions about their health dictated by costs rather than \nby what they need.\n  This year has been the third year in a row of double-digit increases \nin health care costs. Companies will likely face average increases of \n12 to 15 percent in 2003, on top of the 12.7 percent increase this \nyear.\n  For some employers in Wisconsin, costs will rise much more sharply. A \nrecent study found health care cost for businesses in southeastern \nWisconsin were 55 percent higher than the Midwest average. While \nnationwide, the average health care premium for a family currently \ncosts about $588 per month, in Wisconsin an average family pays $812 \nper month.\n  We must curb these rapidly-increasing health care premiums. I \nstrongly support initiatives to ensure that everyone has access to \nhealth care. It is crucial that we support successful local initiatives \nto reduce health care premiums and to improve the quality of employees; \nhealth care.\n  By using group purchasing to obtain rate discounts, some employers \nhave been able to reduce the cost of health care premiums for their \nemployees. According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthere are more than 90 employer-led coalitions across the United States \nthat collectively purchase health care. Through these pools, businesses \nare able to proactively challenge high costs and inefficient delivery \nof health care and share information on quality. These coalitions \nrepresent over 7,000 employers and approximately 34 million employees \nnation-wide.\n  Improving the quality of health care will also lower the cost of \ncare. By investing in the delivery of quality health car, we will be \nable to lower long term health care costs. Effective care, such as \nquality preventive services, can reduce overall health care \nexpenditures. Health purchasing coalitions help promote these services \nand act as an employer forum for networking and education on health \ncare cost containment strategies. They can help foster a dialogue with \nhealth care providers, insurers, and local HMOs.\n  Health care markets are local. Problems with cost, quality, and \naccess to healthcare are felt most intensely in the local markets. \nHealth care coalitions can function best when they are formed and \nimplemented locally.\n  Local employers of large and small businesses have formed health care \ncoalitions to track health care trends, create a demand for quality and \nsafety, and encourage group purchasing.\n  In Wisconsin, there have been various successful initiatives that \nhave formed health care purchasing cooperatives to improve quality of \ncare and to reduce cost. For example, the Employer Health Care Alliance \nCooperative, an employer-owned and employer-directed not-for-profit \ncooperative, has developed a network of health care providers in Dane \nCounty and 12 surrounding counties on behalf of its 170 member \nemployers. Through this pooling effort, employers are able to obtain \naffordable, high-quality health care for their 110,000 employees and \ndependents.\n  This legislation seeks to build on successful local initiatives, such \nas The Alliance, that help businesses to join together to increase \naccess to affordable and high-quality health care.\n  The Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act would authorize \ngrants to a group of businesses so that they could form group-\npurchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, reduce health care \nrates, and improve quality.\n  This legislation offers two separate grant programs to help different \ntypes of businesses pool their resources and bargaining power. Both \nprograms would aid businesses to form cooperatives. The first program \nwould help large businesses that sponsor their own health plans, while \nthe second program would help small businesses that purchase their \nhealth insurance.\n  My bill would enable larger businesses to form cost-effective \ncooperatives that could offer quality health care through several ways. \nFirst, they could obtain health services through pooled purchasing from \nphysicians, hospitals, home health agencies, and\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nothers. By pooling their experience and interests, employers involved \nin a coalition could better attack the essential issues, such as rising \nhealth insurance rates and the lack of comparable health care quality \ndata. They would be able to share information regarding the quality of \nthese services and to partner with these health care providers to meet \nthe needs of their employees.\n  For smaller businesses that purchase their health insurance, the \nformation of cooperatives would allow them to buy health insurance at \nlower prices through pooled purchasing. Also, the communication within \nthese cooperatives would provide employees of small businesses with \nbetter information about the health care options that are available to \nthem. Finally, coalitions would serve to promote quality improvements \nby facilitating partnerships between their group and the health care \nproviders.\n  By working together, the group could develop better quality insurance \nplans and negotiate better rates.\n  Past health purchasing pool initiatives have focused only on cost and \nhave tried to be all things for all people. My legislation creates an \nincentive to join the pool by giving grants to a group of similar \nbusinesses to form group-purchasing cooperatives. The pool are also \ngiven flexibility to find innovative ways to lower costs, such as \nenhancing benefits, for example, more preventive care, and improving \nquality. Finally, the cooperative structure is a proven model, which \ncreates an incentive for businesses to remain in the pool because they \nwill be invested in the organization.\n  We must reform health care in America and give employers and \nemployees more options. This legislation, by providing for the \nformation of cost-effective coalitions that will also improve the \nquality of care, contributes to this essential reform process. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this proposal to improve the \nquality and ease the costs of health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2837. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nbusinesses to qualify as renewal community businesses if such \nbusinesses employ residents of certain other renewal communities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to make \na small change to the Renewal Community program that will make a big \ndifference for the people of my State. This legislation will spur job \ngrowth and economic development in many impoverished areas that have \nbeen designated as renewal communities.\n  Renewal communities were authorized under the Community Renewal Tax \nRelief Act of 2000. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has \ndesignated 40 urban and rural areas around the country as renewal \ncommunities that are eligible to share in an estimated $17 billion in \ntax incentives to stimulate job growth, promote economic development, \nand create affordable housing. The purpose of the Act is to help bring \nneeded investment to areas with demonstrated economic distress. The \npoverty rate in renewal communities is at least 20 percent, and the \nunemployment rate is one-and-a-half times the national level. The \nhouseholds in the renewal communities have incomes that are 80 percent \nbelow the median income of households in their local jurisdictions.\n  Businesses in renewal communities are eligible to receive wage \ncredits, tax deductions, and capital gains exclusions for hiring \nworkers living in the renewal communities. In order for businesses to \nqualify for participation in the program they must meet certain \ncriteria. For example, at least fifty percent of the total gross income \nof a business must come from operations within the renewal community \nand a substantial part of its tangible property must lie within the \nrenewal community. Furthermore, at least thirty-five percent of its \nemployees must be residents of the renewal community and the employees' \nservices must be performed in the renewal community.\n  The Renewal Community program is targeted to help small businesses in \npoor communities. Through the tax benefits provided, the small and \nfamily-owned businesses are able to maintain their operations and \ncontinue supplying goods and services to their neighborhoods. These \nbusinesses are the true essence of the entrepreneurial spirit and are \nthe engines of economic growth and development. The Renewal Community \nprogram also encourages the start of new businesses. Louisiana has \nreally benefited from this program. It has been a catalyst in boosting \nlocal economics and cutting unemployment.\n  Louisiana has four renewal communities. Some of them border one \nanother. Under the rules of the program, however, a business cannot \ntake advantage of the tax incentives if they hire someone who lives \noutside the renewal community, even if that person lives in the renewal \ncommunity next door. In rural areas, this rule poses a problem for \npeople living in one renewal community who often find jobs with \ncompanies in an adjacent renewal community.\n  A good example of what I am talking about is in the northern part of \nLouisiana, home of the North Louisiana Renewal Community and the \nOuachita Renewal Community. The City of Monroe is located at the heart \nof the Ouachita Renewal Community. Monroe serves as the hub for \nNortheast Louisiana. All around Monroe and the Ouachita Renewal \nCommunity there are parishes which all fall in the North Louisiana \nRenewal Community, Morehouse Parish to the north, Richland Parish to \nthe east, Caldwell Parish to the south, and Lincoln Parish to the west. \nWe know that many companies in the Ouachita Renewal Community would \nqualify for the tax benefits if they could count any employees they \nhired from the adjacent North Louisiana Renewal Community toward \nmeeting the thirty-five percent requirement. My legislation will allow \nthe employers in one renewal community to hire employees from an \nadjacent or nearby renewal community areas and still receive the tax \nbenefits granted through the Act.\n  The goal of the Renewal Community Program is to provide a vehicle for \nchange in poverty stricken areas. It makes sense that we take steps to \nadd flexibility to the program. Employees with a particular skill set \nmay be better suited to work at companies located in an adjacent \nrenewal community. My legislation provides employers and employees with \nthe opportunity to take full advantage of the Renewal Community \nprogram.\n  This legislation is an opportunity for continued assistance to low \nincome people and economically distressed areas of our country. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2838. A bill to provide for the conveyance of Forest Service \nfacilities and lands comprising the Five Mile Regional Learning Center \nin the State of California to the Clovis Unified School District, to \nauthorize a new special use permit regarding the continued use of \nunconveyed lands comprising the Center, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation \ntoday to transfer 27 acres of land from the Stanislaus National Forest \nto the Clovis Unified School District.\n  This bill allows the school district to continue operating the \nCalifornia Five Mile Regional Learning Center and, more importantly, \nraise the necessary funds to renovate the facilities.\n  Since 1989, Clovis Unified School District has leased the Five Mile \nRegional Learning Center from the Forest Service to offer programs to \nstudents living in the Central Valley. And each year, thousands of \neager children come to the Center to take classes that emphasize \nnatural resource conservation. During this past academic year, for \ninstance, more than 14,000 students benefitted from classes ranging \nfrom forest management to aviary studies to team building.\n  In addition to classes, students have the option of attending summer \nbasketball camps offered in the Center's gymnasium and participating in \nindividual activities given on the Center's adjacent 93 acres. To date, \nthe district has invested $14 million of local funds to provide these \nopportunities.\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years, the Regional Learning Center \nhas fallen into a state of disrepair. The buildings that occupy the 27 \nacres are over 40 years old, but have never undergone\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nmajor renovations to modernize and improve them. As a result, the \nCenter has a laundry list of items in need of repair: from cracked \nasphalt and leaky roofs to unreliable electrical wiring. And while \nClovis Unified School District officials have done a fine job of \noperating the Center and are willing to invest in renovations, the \nForest Service can not permit the district to spend local funds to \nrenovate these federally owned buildings.\n  This bill enables the Forest Service to convey the acreage that the \nbuildings occupy to the school district allowing the district to make \nthe necessary repairs. Clovis Unified has already committed to \ninvesting $5 million over 5 years to make the renovations, in addition \nto the district's $1.2 million of annual contributions spent on routine \nmaintenance and operating costs. These investments will be used to \nexpand and enhance the Center's environmental educational curriculum. I \nbelieve that given the budget constraints that schools nationwide are \nfacing that this commitment speaks to the quality of these programs and \nto the need to keep the Center in operation.\n  The Forest Service has already acknowledged that this transfer would \nbe in the best interest of both the Forest Service and the general \npublic. At the Forest Service's request, reversionary language was \nadded to this bill to ensure that the gederal government would retain \nownership of the land should the school district decide to no longer \noperate the facilities.\n  Without this important legislation, in a few years time, the \nCalifornia Five Mile Regional Learning Center will be uninhabitable and \nanother educational resource that benefits our children will close its \ndoors. I believe that this bill is the perfect example of what can \nhappen when local, state, and federal governments work together to get \nsomething done. It is this type of partnership that Congress should \nsupport in our efforts to diversify and improve educational \nopportunities for students and encourage multi-use activities on \nfederal land. In this case, I believe everyone wins and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``California Five Mile \n     Regional Learning Center Transfer Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE AND SPECIAL USE AGREEMENT, FIVE MILE \n                   REGIONAL LEARNING CENTER, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall convey \n     to the Clovis Unified School District of California all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a \n     parcel of National Forest System land consisting of 27.10 \n     acres located within the southwest \\1/4\\ of section 2, \n     township 2 north, range 15 east, Mount Diablo base and \n     meridian, California, which has been utilized as the Five \n     Mile Regional Learning Center by the school district since \n     1989 pursuant to a special use permit (Holder No. 2010-02) to \n     provide natural resource conservation education to California \n     youth. The conveyance shall include all structures, \n     improvements, and personal property shown on original map \n     #700602 and inventory dated February 1, 1989.\n       (b) Special Use Agreement.--As soon as practicable after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     enter into negotiations with the Clovis Unified School \n     District to enter into a new special use permit for the \n     approximately 100 acres of National Forest System land that, \n     as of the date of the enactment of this Act, is being used by \n     the school district pursuant to the permit described in \n     subsection (a), but is not included in the conveyance under \n     such subsection.\n       (c) Reversion.--In the event that the Clovis Unified School \n     District discontinues its operation of the Five Mile Regional \n     Learning Center, title to the real property conveyed under \n     subsection (a) shall revert back to the United States.\n       (d) Costs and Mineral Rights.--The conveyance under \n     subsection (a) shall be for a nominal cost. Notwithstanding \n     such subsection, the conveyance does not include the transfer \n     of mineral rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2839. A bill to enhance the protection of privacy of children who \nuse school or library computers employing Internet content management \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in December 2000, New York Times \nreporter, John Schwartz, wrote ``When Congress passed a new bill last \nweek requiring virtually every school and library in the nation to \ninstall technology to protect minors from adult materials online, it \ncreated a business opportunity for companies that sell Internet \nfiltering systems. . . . some of the filtering companies' business \nplans include tracking students' Web wanderings and selling the data to \nmarket research firms.'' While I support the use of filtering \ntechnology in schools and libraries that will be visited by our \nchildren, this statement alarmed me.\n  A month later, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department \nof Defense was buying information about our school children's Internet \nhabits from a filtering company without the knowledge of their parents \nor the school officials. The Defense Department contracted directly \nwith the filtering company. As one of our most vulnerable populations, \nI believe it is Congress's duty to act in a manner to ensure families \nknowledge of the information that is collected about our children and \nto restrict the collection of personal information on children. The \nfact that this arrangement could occur without anyone with direct \nresponsibility for the children having knowledge of it is a serious \noversight. We need a solution, and to that end, I am introducing the \nChildren's Electronic Access Safety Enhancement, or CEASE Act.\n  This legislation is a commonsense approach to dealing with this \nproblem in order to ensure our children are protected. The first \nsection of the bill requires an Internet filtering government \ncontractor to disclose its treatment of collected information to the \nschool or library with which it is contracting. Additionally, if \nchanges to these policies are made, the filtering company must inform \nthe school or library of these changes. If adequate notice is not \nprovided, the entity has the option to cancel the contract. Armed with \nsuch information about the company's practices, the school or library \nofficials can make an informed decision of whether it wishes to \ncontract with a particular company.\n  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, which passed \nCongress and was signed into law in 1998, prohibits the collection of \npersonal information about children on commercial websites. In the \nsecond section of my legislation, a similar COPPA prohibition would \nextend to Internet content management services at schools and \nlibraries. If personal information is collected on a child, the \nprovider is required to inform the school or library and the Federal \nTrade Commission and to indicate how it will treat this information so \nthat it will not be disclosed or distributed. When children go to \nschools and libraries, these environments are supposed to be safe. \nParents and guardians should not have to worry about how their \nchildren's personal information may be compromised, especially by a \ncompany that markets itself to protect children and in some cases \nfacilitate learning. I believe my legislation will help put to rest \nsuch concerns.\n  Protecting the privacy of children has been widely supported, as it \nshould be. When Congress was debating COPPA in 1998, the bill received \nbroad support. At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in September \n1998, Arthur Sackler, representing the Direct Marketing Association, \nDMA stated, ``Although DMA usually supports self-regulation of \nelectronic commerce, we believe it may be appropriate to consider \ntargeted legislation in this area.'' Kathyrn Montgomery from the Center \nfor Media Education stated, ``Children are not little adults. . . . \nBecause many young children do not fully understand the concept of \nprivacy, they can be quite eager and willing to offer up information \nabout themselves and their families when asked. Children also tend to \nbe particularly trusting of computers, and thus more open to \ninteracting with them.''\n\n  An April 2002 FTC report on the implementation of COPPA draws the \nconclusion that Web sites have generally been able to comply with \nCOPPA. That is why I have every hope and expectation that the CEASE Act \ncan also be implemented.\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\n  Given the fact that we have evidence of some Internet content \nmanagement companies already sharing information with outside entities, \nthe CEASE Act is timely. If an Internet content management company \nbelieves it is a good business plan to share information, even in \naggregate, with outside parties, these companies should not be adverse \nto disclosing this practice with a potential client. And, I believe \nthat a number of communities may not wish to allow these practices at \nall because they believe that, as Alex Molnar, a professor at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, stated, ``Providing demographic \ninformation about students to special interests, even in aggregate \nform, is a potential violation of the privacy of children and their \nfamilies.'' Communities with such beliefs should be able to act upon \nthem in the best interest of their children, and my legislation \nrequires the disclosure that will help make this a reality.\n  There is no arguing that the Internet is, and will continue to be, an \nimportant part of the learning process. Personally, I support wiring \nthe schools and libraries in this Nation as rapidly as possible because \nI understand the educational and job opportunities the Internet can \nbring. However, especially for our children, we need to ensure there \nare safeguards.

A bill to adjust the indexing of multifamily mortgage \nlimits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nFHA Multifamily Housing Loan Limit Improvement Act, to expand the \nsupply of affordable housing by increasing the Federal Housing \nAdministration's multifamily housing loan limit to account for \ninflation.\n  Providing access to decent, safe, affordable housing for individuals \nand families remains an enormous challenge for our Nation. Throughout \nthe country, rising construction costs have resulted in shortage of \naffordably priced rental units. In fact, the shortage of affordable \nhousing should be considered nothing short of a crisis. After all, \nhousing is among the most basic of human needs, and it is critically \nimportant for all American communities.\n  The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, was established as part of a \nnational commitment to providing affordable housing, particularly for \nthose most in need. Overall, the FHA, through its various initiatives, \nhas been successful in providing increased access to housing. But as \nthe crisis of affordable housing has grown, so has the need for \nCongress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to \npromote increased production of affordable housing.\n  That is why I am pleased to join with Senators Carper, Ensign and \nSchumer in introducing this legislation to increase the production and \navailability of affordable housing for American families. The bill \nwould improve upon legislation I introduced last year, ``The FHA \nMultifamily Housing Loan Limit Adjustment Act,'' which Congress \napproved last year as part of the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. That \nlegislation increased by twenty-five percent the statutory limits for \nmultifamily project development loans that are insurable by the FHA. \nThe change reflected the increased costs associated with the production \nof multifamily units since 1992, the last time those limits were \nrevised upwards.\n  In other words, it had taken Congress ten years to modify the \nunderlying statute to account for rising prices and simply maintain the \neffectiveness of the program. That is too long. The legislation we are \nintroducing today would ensure that it does not take another decade or \nlonger to assist those who need affordable housing.\n  This bill is simple, it ensures that the insurable FHA loan limit \namounts, as adjusted under ``The FHA Multifamily Loan Adjustment Act,'' \nwould keep pace with economic growth by indexing them each year to the \nAnnual Construction Cost Index, issued annually by the Census Bureau.\n  This bill also promotes the production of affordable housing in \nanother important way, by promoting the development of affordable \nhousing in high-cost cities like Newark, NJ, New York, Philadelphia and \nSan Francisco. Currently in those communities, the cost of living is so \nhigh that the FHA insurance program is rendered largely ineffective.\n  This bill improves the FHA multifamily program by adjusting its \nstatutory limits to promote increased housing production in high-cost, \nprimarily urban, communities.\n  There is a very real need for Congress to address the shortage of \naffordable housing. A report released last year by the Center for \nHousing Policy, ``Housing America's Working Families,'' documented the \nseverity of this need. The report found that more than fourteen million \npeople faced severe housing needs because of the lack of affordable \nhousing. That number may well be higher now.\n  This bill will provide the proper incentive for public/private \ninvestment in affordable housing in communities throughout America and \nspur new production of cooperative housing projects, rental housing for \nthe elderly, new construction or substantial rehabilitation of \napartments by for- and non-profit entities, condominium developments \nand refinancing of rental properties.\n  In short, this bill is good housing policy. That is why the National \nAssociation of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors and \nthe Mortgage Bankers Association endorse the legislation, along with \nother housing and community advocates.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2841\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleagues from New Jersey, Nevada, and New York to \nintroduce legislation to index the Federal Housing Administration's, \nFHA, multifamily loan limits.\n  Last year, Senator Corzine and I introduced similar legislation that \nraised the FHA multifamily loan limits, which had not been increased \nsince 1992 despite a 23 percent increase in the Annual Construction \nCost Index. Senators Mikulski and Bond included this increase in last \nyear's VA-HUD appropriations legislation. I am pleased that these \nlimits were increased last year, however, an important piece of the \noriginal legislation was left undone. While the FHA loan limits were \nincreased, they were not indexed. Construction costs will continue to \nrise, and the multifamily loan limits should be indexed, just like the \nFHA single-family loan limits.\n  Affordable housing continues to be a problem in this country. Over \nthe July recess, I held a series of housing summits in Delaware to hear \nfrom Delawareans about the lack of affordable housing. In each county, \nI heard that working families in Delaware are having difficulty finding \naffordable housing. This shortage of affordable housing also comes at a \ntime of limited federal resources. Thus, we have to find the best use \nof each dollar at our disposal, as well as the most effective use of \nexisting Federal programs to stimulate new housing production and \nsubstantial rehabilitation. This bill modifies a current federal \nprogram, FHA multifamily insurance, to make that program more \neffective.\n  In the next Congress, I hope to be able to address the affordable \nhousing problem in a more comprehensive manner. In the meantime, I \nbelieve Congress can take some incremental steps to address the \nshortage of affordable housing.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senators Corzine, Ensign, and Schumer and \nme to increase these multifamily loan limits so that more working \nfamilies will have access to affordable housing.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend, \nthe Senator from New Jersey, to introduce a bill that will help solve \nthe affordable housing crisis that is facing this Nation.\n  There is a dramatic shortage of rental housing that is affordable to \nlow and moderate income working families. FHA multifamily insurance \nprograms are designed to stimulate the construction, rehabilitation and \npreservation of properties by insuring lenders against loss in \nfinancing first mortgages. The programs assist both the private and the \npublic sectors towards the goal of providing affordable housing to \nthose that otherwise may not be able to afford it.\n  Last year, in a remarkable step, Congress granted a 25 percent \nincrease in the FHA multifamily loan limits. The new loan limits are \none great remedy to the affordable housing crisis facing our nation, \nbut this alone does not do enough.\n  Unfortunately, without additional legislation, the loan limits will \nagain be outpaced by inflation and today's growing construction costs.\n  The legislation that we are introducing solves this problem by \nindexing the multifamily loan limits to the annual construction costs \nindex of the Bureau of the Census. This will allow loan limits to \nincrease automatically, as costs increase. Without such a fix, the FHA \nmultifamily loan program will again be limited in its ability to \nstimulate the development of affordable housing.\n  This legislation will help halt the growing shortage of affordable \nrental housing faced by millions of Americans and give builders and \nlenders the confidence that they will be able to use the programs in \ntheir communities every year, even as construction and land costs rise \nover time.\n  Additionally, this legislation raises the loan limits in high-cost \nareas. This will allow several major urban markets to take advantage of \nthe new FHA multifamily insurance programs, and to provide much needed \nnew affordable housing to low and moderate income families.\n  I believe this legislation is an important step in our ongoing battle \nto ensure that each American has access to affordable housing. I would \nlike to once again thank the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, for \nhis hard work on this bill, and for recognizing the significant effect \nthis legislation will have for many low and moderate income families by \ndramatically increasing their access to affordable housing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 2842. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to authorize \nappropriations for demonstration\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\nprojects to provide supportive services to older individuals who reside \nin naturally occurring retirement communities; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, we are all familiar with our changing \ndemographics. Those once a part of the baby boom are now well on their \nway to creating a senior boom. By the year 2020, one in six Americans \nwill be age 65 or over. By 2040, the number of seniors aged 85 and \nolder will more than triple from about 4 million to 14 million. This \nboom will create a dramatic increase in the demand for services for \nseniors especially long-term care.\n  Long-term care is more than just health care. It includes any \nservices that seniors need to maintain their quality of life, such as \ntransportation, nutrition, or other supports that help seniors live \nindependently.\n  Long-term care can mean help with buying groceries, paying bills each \nmonth, getting dressed in the morning, getting a ride to the doctor's \noffice, or taking medicine at the appropriate time. We need to make \nsure our society is ready to provide these kinds of services for \nseniors, and we need to make sure that we give seniors options. We need \nto be creative in what we offer.\n  Last year I learned about an innovative option for providing long-\nterm care services for seniors. The concept is based on naturally \noccurring retirement communities, NORCs. A naturally occurring \nretirement community develops in a community or neighborhood where \nresidents remain for years and age as neighbors. A NORC may be a large \napartment building or a street of single family homes. According to \nAARP, about 27 percent of seniors currently live in NORCs. NORCs \nrepresent a new model for giving seniors the support services they \nneed. We can bring services directly to seniors, and we can help \nenhance their quality of life and allow them to age in place.\n  This is important because most seniors prefer living in their own \nhomes. To address the need for long-term care services, I secured $1.2 \nmillion last year to establish a NORC project in downtown St. Louis. To \nget this project underway, first there will be assessment of residents' \nneeds. The funds will then be used to meet these individual needs. \nResidents will receive such services as individual case management, \nfamily education, wellness services, and other needed supports.\n  The St. Louis program is only the first step. This unique model could \nbe used to deliver support services to seniors in communities across \nthe country. That is why I am pleased to introduce the Senior Self-\nSufficiency Act. This legislation would lay the foundation for a new \nway of helping seniors stay in their own homes and in their own \ncommunities. The Senior Self-Sufficiency Act would create ten \ndemonstration projects in naturally occurring retirement communities \nacross the country. Each would last 4 years. The grant would be used to \nprovide comprehensive support services to seniors.\n  The services offered would be created to meet the individual needs of \nthe residents and to help them maintain their independence. Funds would \nalso be used to make housing improvements that would allow seniors to \nlive in their own neighborhoods longer. For example, they could install \nsafety bars in bathrooms or replace stairs with wheelchair ramps. Two \nof the ten projects would be located in rural areas where access to \nservices is often harder or more distant. We will learn from the \nresearch how best to expand the program to all areas of the country.\n  If given the choice, most people would prefer to grow older in their \nown homes, surrounded by friends and family. This is exactly what this \nlegislation will allow seniors to do. By making support services \navailable to seniors in their own homes, we can extend the time they \nlive independently, and we can improve their quality of life. We can \nprovide services at lower cost, and we can start preparing now for the \nfuture needs of our population.\n  I am pleased to announce that the Senior Self-Sufficiency Act has the \nsupport of the Missouri Department of Health and the Jewish Federation \nof St. Louis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. We need to begin now to plan for the future senior \nboom. The Senior Self-Sufficiency Act is a step in the right direction, \nmaking it possible for seniors to remain in their home longer and to \nretain their independence. That is a goal worth pursuing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                     Missouri Department of Health\n\n\n                                          and Senior Services,\n\n                                Jefferson City, MO, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Jean Carnahan,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: The Missouri Department of Health \n     and Senior Services is charged with the mission of enhancing \n     the quality of life for all Missourians by protecting and \n     promoting the community's health and well-being of citizens \n     of all ages. In following that mission, we are pleased to \n     offer our support of your proposed legislation known as the \n     Senior Self-Sufficiency Act.\n       This legislation, which would authorize demonstration \n     projects in naturally occurring retirement communities, would \n     help show the effectiveness of providing comprehensive \n     supportive services to older individuals who reside in their \n     homes to enhance their quality of life and reduce the need \n     for institutionalization. Missouri has long supported the \n     concept of ``options in care'' to include comprehensive home \n     and community based services and supports. This legislation \n     would help focus and define the concept and value of \n     communities, to include the significance of retaining seniors \n     within their natural occurring communities. The comprehensive \n     nature of the services to be offered under this concept, such \n     as health services, nutrition services, transportation, home \n     and personal care, socialization, continuing adult education, \n     information and referral, and any other services to enhance \n     quality of life will greatly increase a person's ability to \n     remain in their home and community.\n       I can assure you the Department of Health and Senior \n     Services is eager to assist with the implementation of this \n     concept. Your proposed legislation is paramount in supporting \n     our mission to protect and promote our community's health, \n     and well-being of citizens of all ages. Please feel free to \n     contact Jerry Simon, Interim Department Deputy Director, at \n     (573) 751-8535, if we can offer any additional information or \n     support to this important concept.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Ronald W.

Jean Carnahan,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: I am writing regarding the \n     legislation you will be introducing to amend the Older \n     Americans act of 1965 authorizing appropriations for \n     demonstration projects to provide services to older \n     individuals residing in NORCs. As you are aware, the St. \n     Louis community has a large senior citizen population \n     compared with other communities of similar size. It is \n     essential that we find ways to help our older adults remain \n     health, productive, and independent for as long as possible \n     in order to enhance their quality of life.\n       Your bill, the Senior Self-Sufficiency Act, authorizing ten \n     demonstration projects to provide comprehensive supportive \n     services to residents of naturally occurring retirement \n     communities will ensure that best practices are developed \n     and/or replicated nationwide. It is an innovative and \n     exciting opportunity to study aging-in-place populations and \n     postpone or avoid institutionalization for these populations.\n       I strongly support this legislation and appreciate your \n     tireless efforts on behalf of older adults.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Barry Rosenberg,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n                                S. 2842\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate a rule that requires manufacturers of certain consumer \nproducts to establish and maintain a system for providing notification \nof recalls of such products to consumers who first purchase such a \nproduct; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to come to the floor \ntoday and introduce a bill that I believe will make it easier for \nparents to learn about dangerous products that may harm their children, \nand remove these products from their homes.\n  Every year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 are \nharmed by defective or hazardous products. As my colleagues know, each \nyear the Consumer Products Safety Commission recalls hundreds of \nproducts which have been found to pose a danger to consumers. \nUnfortunately, many times parents do not get the word about these \nrecalls, because companies often do not have a way of getting in touch \nwith their customers. This is particularly significant when you are \ntalking about children's products. The manufacturers of these products \nrarely have records of who their customers are; often all they can do \nis publicize the recall as best they can. It is for this reason, that I \nam introducing the Product Safety Notification and Recall Effectiveness \nAct of 2002.\n  This legislation would require the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission to establish a rule to require manufacturers to establish \nand maintain a system for notifying consumers of the recall of certain \nproducts that may cause harm to children. The database could be \nassembled through the use of shortened product registration cards, \nInternet registration, or other alternate means of encouraging \nconsumers to provide vital contact information.\n  As an example for my colleagues, I just want to touch on one method \nthat this bill would encourage companies to use. We've all seen the \nregistration cards that come with many products. It is these cards that \nprovide companies with much of the information on their customers, and \ncould be used to help spread the word about a recall. Unfortunately, \nmany consumers just throw these cards away without even sending them \nin. In fact, by some estimates 90 percent of these cards are thrown \naway. Why? Well, one reason is because the cards ask for personal and \nmarketing information that many people do not want to give out. So they \nthrow the card away.\n  But if you shorten the card, to just ask for the basic information, \nname, address, and phone number, people are much more likely to return \nthem. This is particularly true if the card specifies the information \nwill not be used for marketing purposes. These cards are an idea that \nAnn Brown, former chairman of the CPSC and now Chairman of the non-\nprofit group SAFE, a Safer America for Everyone Foundation, has been \nadvocating for years. And studies done with companies like Mattel and \nBrandStamp have shown that these methods really do increase the number \nof consumers who respond.\n  So, I come to the floor today to say that this is something we need \nto do, and we need to do it as quickly as possible. This is a very \nimportant bill for our citizens. I am hopeful that we can get a hearing \non this legislation very soon.\n  Before I close, I just want to commend Ann Brown and the folks at \nSAFE for all of their hard work on product recall. I introduced this \nlegislation in the Senate today, but Ann is the one who has been \npushing this issue for years, since she served on the CPSC. I am proud \nto work with her on this and want to thank her for her monumental \nefforts to bring this to the forefront. I also want to acknowledge my \ncolleagues, Congressman Jim Moran and Congressman James McGovern, who \nintroduced this bill in the House of Representatives. And, of course, I \nlook forward to working with the CPSC on this bill. I know they had \nsome problems with this bill initially, and I am hopeful we have \naddressed most of these concerns.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues to support this much-needed \nlegislation. By passing this bill, we can give parents the information \nthey need to protect their children. When a child is hurt or killed by \na defective product that has already been recalled, there simply is no \nexcuse. This legislation would go a long way towards ensuring that this \nkind of tragedy never happens again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2843\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts \n     approximately 300 recalls of hazardous, dangerous, and \n     defective consumer products each year.\n       (2) In developing comprehensive corrective action plans \n     with recalling companies, the\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n     Consumer Product Safety Commission staff greatly relies upon \n     the media and retailers to alert consumers to the dangers of \n     unsafe consumer products, because the manufacturers do not \n     generally possess contact information regarding the \n     purchasing consumers. Based upon information received from \n     companies maintaining customer registration lists, such \n     contact information is known for generally less than 7 \n     percent of the total consumer products produced and \n     distributed.\n       (3) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n     that most consumers do not return purchaser identification \n     cards because of requests for marketing and personal \n     information on the cards, and the likelihood of receiving \n     unsolicited marketing materials.\n       (4) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has \n     conducted research demonstrating that direct consumer contact \n     is one of the most effective ways of motivating consumer \n     response to a consumer product recall.\n       (5) Companies that maintain consumer product purchase data, \n     such as product registration cards, warranty cards, and \n     rebate cards, are able to effectively notify consumers of a \n     consumer product recall.\n       (6) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n     that a consumer product safety owner card, without marketing \n     questions or requests for personal information, that \n     accompanied products such as small household appliances and \n     juvenile products would increase consumer participation and \n     information necessary for direct notification in consumer \n     product recalls.\n       (7) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has, \n     since March 1993, required similar simplified, marketing-free \n     product registration cards on child safety seats used in \n     motor vehicles.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the \n     number of deaths and injuries from defective and hazardous \n     consumer products through improved recall effectiveness, by--\n       (1) requiring the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n     promulgate a rule to require manufacturers of juvenile \n     products, small household appliances, and certain other \n     consumer products, to include a simplified product safety \n     owner card with those consumer products at the time of \n     original purchase by consumers, or develop effective \n     electronic registration of the first purchasers of such \n     products, to develop a customer database for the purpose of \n     notifying consumers about recalls of those products; and\n       (2) encouraging manufacturers, private labelers, retailers, \n     and others to use creativity and innovation to create and \n     maintain effective methods of notifying consumers in the \n     event of a consumer product recall.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Terms defined in consumer product safety act.--The \n     definitions set forth in section 3 of the Consumer Product \n     Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052) shall apply to this Act.\n       (2) Covered consumer product.--The term ``covered consumer \n     product'' means--\n       (A) a juvenile product;\n       (B) a small household appliance; and\n       (C) such other consumer product as the Commission considers \n     appropriate for achieving the purpose of this Act.\n       (3) Juvenile product.--The term ``juvenile product''--\n       (A) means a consumer product intended for use, or that may \n     be reasonably expected to be used, by children under the age \n     of 5 years; and\n       (B) includes--\n       (i) full-size cribs and nonfull-size cribs;\n       (ii) toddler beds;\n       (iii) high chairs, booster chairs, and hook-on chairs;\n       (iv) bath seats;\n       (v) gates and other enclosures for confining a child;\n       (vi) playpens;\n       (vii) stationary activity centers;\n       (viii) strollers;\n       (ix) walkers;\n       (x) swings;\n       (xi) child carriers; and\n       (xii) bassinets and cradles.\n       (4) Product safety owner card.--The term ``product safety \n     owner card'' means a standardized product identification card \n     supplied with a consumer product by the manufacturer of the \n     product, at the time of original purchase by the first \n     purchaser of such product for purposes other than resale, \n     that only requests that the consumer of such product provide \n     to the manufacturer a minimal level of personal information \n     needed to enable the manufacturer to contact the consumer in \n     the event of a recall of the product.\n       (5) Small household appliance.--The term ``small household \n     appliance'' means a consumer product that is a toaster, \n     toaster oven, blender, food processor, coffee maker, or other \n     similar small appliance as provided for in the rule \n     promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, perhaps the most effective way to \nimprove the education of America's children is to ensure that they \nbegin their education in an uncrowded classroom led by a qualified \nteacher. This body recognized that fact when we overwhelmingly passed \nthe ``No Child Left Behind Act'' last year, mandating the hiring of \nqualified teachers by every school in every district.\n  Unfortunately, without our help, America's poor and rural schools may \nnot be able to attract the qualified teachers this legislation mandates \nand our children deserve. Isolated and impoverished, competing against \nhigher paying and well-funded school districts for scarce classroom \ntalent, they are already facing a desperate shortage of qualified \nteachers. As pressure to hire increases, that shortage will become a \ncrisis, and children already at a disadvantage in relation to their \nmore affluent and less isolated peers will be the ones who suffer most.\n  Today, I propose a bill that will help bring dedicated and qualified \nteaching professionals to West Virginia's and America's poor and rural \nschools, and help give their students the opportunity to learn and \nflourish that every child deserves. The Incentives To Educate American \nChildren Act, or ``I Teach'' Act, will provide teachers a refundable \ntax credit every year they practice their profession in the public \nschools where they are needed most. And it will give every public \nschool teacher, whichever school they choose, a refundable tax credit \nfor earning certification by the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards. Together, these two tax credits will give \neconomically depressed areas a better ability to recruit and retain \nskilled teachers.\n  One-fourth of America's children attend public schools in rural \nareas, and of the 250 poorest counties in the United States, 244 are \nrural. West Virginia has rural schools scattered through 36 of its 55 \ncounties, and these schools face real challenges in recruiting and \nretaining teachers, as well as dealing with other issues related to \ntheir rural location.\n  Attracting teachers to these schools is difficult in large part due \nto the vast gap between what rural districts are able to offer and the \nsalaries paid by more affluent school districts, as wide as $20,000 a \nyear, according to one study. Poor urban schools must overcome similar \ndifficulties. It is often a challenge for these schools to attract and \nkeep qualified teachers. Yet, according to the 2001 No Child Left \nBehind Act, every school must have\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\nqualified teachers by the end of the 2005-2006 school year.\n  My ``I Teach'' Act will reward teachers willing to work in rural or \nhigh poverty schools with an annual $1,000 refundable tax credit. If \nthe teacher obtains certification by the National Board for \nProfessional Teaching Standards, they will receive an additional annual \n$1,000 refundable tax credit.\n  Every teacher willing to work in underserved schools will earn a tax \ncredit. Every teacher who gets certified will earn a tax credit. \nTeachers who work in rural or poor schools and get certified will earn \nboth. Schools who desperately need help attracting teachers will get a \nboost. And children educated in poor and rural schools will benefit \nmost.\n  In my State of West Virginia, as in over 30 other States, there is \nalready a State fiscal incentive for teachers who earn National Board \ncertification. My legislation builds upon the West Virginia program; \ntogether, they add up to a powerful tax incentive for teachers to \nremain in the classroom and to use their skills where they are most \nneeded.\n  I have spent a great deal of time in West Virginia classrooms this \nyear, and it has become obvious to me that our education agenda suffers \ngreatly from inadequate funding on a number of fronts. In response, I \nhave introduced a series of bills attacking different aspects of the \nproblem.\n  A qualified teacher is a great start, but children also deserve a \nsafe, modern classroom. And so, in addition to the ``I Teach'' Act, I \nhave introduced a measure to encourage investment in school \nconstruction and renovations.\n  I am promoting legislation to develop Math and Science Partnerships \nat the National Science Foundation, to place needed emphasis on these \ncore subjects.\n  And to ensure that every student, including those in rural areas, has \naccess to modern technology and the wealth of educational resources on \nthe web, I remain vigilant in protecting the E-Rate, which provides \n$2.25 billion in annual discounts to connect our schools and libraries \nto the Internet.\n  Education is among our top national priorities, essential for every \nfamily with a child and vital for our economic and national security. I \nsupported the bold goals and higher standards of the 2001 No Child Left \nBehind Act, but they won't be met unless our schools have the teachers \nand resources they need. I am committed to working closely with my \nSenate colleagues this fall to secure as much funding as possible for \nour children's education.\n  No amount of construction or technology can replace a qualified and \nmotivated teacher, however, and making it easier for underserved \nschools to attract the teachers they need remains one of my most \nimportant objectives. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important legislation which takes a great stride toward \nbetter education for every child in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2847. A bill to assist in the conservation of cranes by supporting \nand providing, through projects of persons and organizations with \nexpertise in crane conservation, financial resources for the \nconservation programs of countries the activities of which directly or \nindirectly affect cranes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crane \nConservation Act of 2002. I propose this legislation in the hope that \nCongress will do its part to protect the existence of these birds, \nwhose cultural significance and popular appeal can be seen worldwide. \nThis legislation is important to the people of Wisconsin, as our State \nprovides habitat and refuge to several crane species. But this \nlegislation, which authorizes the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService to distribute funds and grants to crane conservation efforts \nboth domestically and in developing countries, promises to have a \nlarger environmental and cultural impact that will go far beyond the \nboundaries of my home State.\n  In October of 1994, Congress passed and the President signed the \nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The passage of this act provided \nsupport for multinational Rhino and Tiger conservation through the \ncreation of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, or RTCF. \nAdministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the RTCF \ndistributes up to $10 million in grants every year to conservation \ngroups to support projects in developing countries. Since its \nestablishment in 1994, the RTCF has been expanded by Congress to cover \nother species, such as elephants and great apes.\n  Today, with the legislation I am introducing, I am asking Congress to \nadd cranes to this list. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds \nin the world, with ten of the world's fifteen species at risk of \nextinction. Specifically, this legislation would authorize up to $3 \nmillion of funds per year to be distributed in the form of conservation \nproject grants to protect cranes and their habitat. The financial \nresources authorized by this bill can be made available to qualifying \nconservation groups operating in Asia, Africa, and North America. The \nprogram is authorized from Fiscal Year 2003 through Fiscal Year 2007.\n  In keeping with my belief that we should maintain fiscal integrity, \nthis bill proposes that the $15 million in authorized spending over \nfive years for the Crane Conservation Act established in this \nlegislation should be offset by rescinding $18 million in unspent funds \nfrom funds carried over the Department of Energy's Clean Coal \nTechnology Program in the Fiscal Year 2002 Energy and Water \nAppropriations Bill. The Secretary of the Interior would be required to \ntransfer any funds it does not expend under the Crane Conservation Act \nback to the Treasury at the end of Fiscal Year 2007. I do not intend my \nbill to make any particular judgments about the Clean Coal program or \nits effectiveness, but I do think, in general, that programs should \nexpend resources that we appropriate in a timely fashion.\n  I am offering this legislation due to the serious and significant \ndecline that can be expected in crane populations worldwide without \nconservation efforts. The decline of the North American whooping crane, \nthe rarest crane on earth, perfectly illustrates the dangers faced by \nthese birds. In 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire \nworld. This stands in contrast to the almost 400 birds in existence \ntoday. The North American whooping crane's resurgence is attributed to \nthe birds' tenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists \nin the United States and Canada. Today, the only wild flock of North \nAmerican whooping cranes breeds in northwest Canada, and spends its \nwinters in coastal Texas. Two new flocks of cranes are currently being \nreintroduced to the wild, one of which is a migratory flock on the \nWisconsin to Florida flyway.\n  This flock of five birds illustrates that any effort by Congress to \nregulate crane conservation needs to cross both national and \ninternational lines. As this flock of birds makes its journey from \nWisconsin to Florida, the birds rely on the ecosystems of a multitude \nof states in this country. In its journey from the Necedah National \nWildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife \nRefuge in Florida in the fall and eventual return to my home state in \nthe spring, this flock also faces threats from pollution of traditional \nwatering grounds, collision with utility lines, human disturbance, \ndisease, predation, loss of genetic diversity within the population, \nand vulnerability to catastrophes, both natural and man-made. Despite \nthe conservation efforts taken since 1941, this symbol of conservation \nis still very much in danger of extinction.\n  While over the course of the last half-century, North American \nwhooping cranes have begun to make a slow recovery, many species of \ncrane in Africa and Asia have declined, including the sarus crane of \nAsia and the wattled crane of Africa.\n  The sarus crane is a symbol of martial fidelity in many Asian \ncultures, especially Laos, Thailand and Indonesia. Additionally, in \nnorthern India, western Nepal, and Vietnam, these birds are a symbol of \nfertility, lending them as important religious significance. Standing \nat four feet tall, these birds can be found in the wetlands of northern \nIndia and south Asia. These birds require large, open, well watered \nplains or marshes to breed and survive.\n  Due to agricultural expansion, industrial development, river basin \ndevelopment, pollution, warfare, and heavy\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nuse of pesticides, which is found to be highly prevalent in India and \nsoutheast Asia, the sarus crane population has been in decline. \nFurthermore, in many areas, a high human population concentration \ncompounds these factors. On the Mekong River, which runs through \nCambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and China, human population growth \nand planned development projects threaten the sarus crane. Reports from \nIndia, Cambodia, and Thailand have also cited incidences of the trading \nof adult birds and chicks, as well as hunting and egg stealing in the \ndrop-in population of the sarus crane.\n  Only three subspecies of the sarus crane exist today. One resides in \nnorthern India and Nepal, one resides in southeast Asia, and one \nresides in northern Australia. Their population is about 8,000 in the \nmain Indian population, with recent numbers showing a rapid decline. In \nSoutheast Asia, only 1,000 birds remain.\n  The situation of the sarus crane in Asia is mirrored by the situation \nof the wattled crane in Africa. In Africa, the wattled crane is found \nin the southern and eastern regions, with an isolated population in the \nmountains of Ethiopia. Current population estimates range between 6,000 \nto 8,000 and are declining rapidly, due to loss and degradation of \nwetland habitats, as well as intensified agriculture, dam construction, \nand industrialization. In other parts of the range, the creation of \ndams has changed the dynamics of the flood plains, thus further \nendangering these cranes and their habitats. Human disturbance at or \nnear breeding sites also continues to be a major threat. Lack of \noversight and education over the actions of humans, industry, and \nagriculture is leading to reduced preservation for the lands on which \ncranes live, thereby threatening the ability of cranes to survive in \nthese regions.\n  If we do not act now, not only will cranes face extinction, but the \necosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. With the \ndecline of the crane population, the wetlands and marshes they inhabit \ncan potentially be thrown off balance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local \nfarming, education and enforcement projects that can have the greatest \npositive effect on the preservation of both cranes and fragile \nhabitats. This small investment can secure the future of these \nexemplary birds and the beautiful areas in which they live. Therefore, \nI ask my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act of 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Kerry, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 2848. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a clarification of the definition of homebound for purposes \nof determining eligibility for home health services under the medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nCleland, Hutchinson, Kerry, Snowe and Miller in introducing the David \nJayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2002 to modernize \nMedicare's outdated ``homebound'' requirement that has impeded access \nto needed home health services for many of our nation's elderly and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Health care in American has gone full circle. People are spending \nless time in institutions, and recovery and care for patients with \nchronic diseases and conditions has increasingly been taking place in \nthe home. The highly skilled and often technically complex care that \nour home health agencies provide have enabled millions of our most \nvulnerable older and disabled individuals to avoid hospitals and \nnursing homes and stay just where they belong, in the comfort and \nsecurity of their own homes.\n  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered \n``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. \nWhile an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to qualify \nfor benefits, his or her conditions must be such that ``there exists a \nnormal inability to leave home.'' The statute does allow for absences \nfrom the home of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.'' \nUnfortunately, however, it does not define precisely what this means. \nIt leaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many \nabsences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short those absences must \nbe. Interpretations of this definition have therefore varied widely.\n  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an \noverzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned \nelderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries, who are dependent upon \nMedicare home health services and medical equipment for survival, into \nvirtual prisoners in their own home. We have heard disturbing accounts \nof individuals on Medicare who have had their home health benefits \nterminated for leaving their homes to visit a hospitalized spouse or to \nattend a family gathering, including, in one case, to attend the \nfuneral of their own child.\n  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered \n``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. \nWhile an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to quality \nfor benefits, his or her condition must be such that ``there exists a \nnormal inability to leave home.''\n  The statute does allow for absences from the home that are \n``infrequent and of short duration.'' It also gives specific permission \nfor the individual to leave home to attend medical appointments, adult \nday care or religious services. Otherwise, it leaves it to the fiscal \nintermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify as \n``frequent'' and just how short those absences must be. Interpretations \nof this definition have therefore varied widely.\n  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an \noverzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned \nelderly or disabled Medicare recipients, who are dependent upon \nMedicare home health services and medical equipment for survival, into \nvirtual prisoners in their own homes.\n  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, \ndisabled Medicare patients. For example, I recently met with David \nJayne, a 40-year old man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who is confined to \na wheelchair and cannot swallow, speak or even breathe on his own. Mr. \nJayne needs several skilled nursing visits per week to enable him to \nremain independent and out of an inpatient facility. Despite his \ndisability, Mr. Jayne meets frequently with youth and church groups. \nSpeaking through a computerized voice synthesizer, he gives \ninspirational talks about how the human spirit can endure and even \novercome great hardship.\n\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne \nand his activities, including a report about how he had, with the help \nof family and friends, attended a football game to root for the \nUniversity of Georgia Bulldogs. A few days later, at the direction of \nthe fiscal intermediary, his home health agency, which had been sending \na health care worker to his home for two hours, four mornings a week, \nnotified him that he could no longer be considered homebound, and that \nhis benefits were being cut off. While his benefits were subsequently \nreinstated due to the media attention given the case, this experience \nmotivated him to launch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition \nand led him to found the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare \nHomebound Restriction.\n  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, \ndisabled individuals who are on Medicare. The fact is that the current \nrequirement reflects an outmoded view of life for persons who live with \nserious disabilities. The homebound criteria may have made sense thirty \nyears ago, when an elderly or disabled person might expect to live in \nthe confines of their home, perhaps cared for by an extended family. \nThe current definition, however, fails to reflect the technological and \nmedical advances that have been made in supporting individuals with \nsignificant disabilities and mobility challenges. It also fails to \nreflect advances in treatment for seriously ill individuals, like Mr. \nJayne, which allow them brief periods of relative wellness.\n  It also fails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity an \nphysical stamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the \nbody and mind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four \nwalls of a home.\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\n  The David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2002 will \namend the homebound definition to base eligibility for the home health \nbenefit on the patient's functional limitations and clinical condition, \nrather than on an arbitrary limitation on absences from the home. It \nwill provide a specific, limited exception to the homebound rule for \nindividuals who:\n  One, have been certified by a physician has having a permanent and \nsevere condition that will not improve;\n  Two, who need assistance from another person with 3 or more of the 5 \nactivities of daily living and require technological and/or personal \nassistance with the act of leaving home;\n  Three, who have received Medicare home health services during the \nprevious 12 month period; and\n  Four, who are only able to leave home because the services provided \nthrough the home health benefit makes it possible for them to do so.\n  We believe that our legislation is budget neutral because it is \nspecifically limited to individuals who are already eligible for \nMedicare and whose conditions require the assistance of a skilled \nnurse, therapist or home health aide to make it functionally possible \nfor them to leave the home. Our legislation does not expand Medicare \neligibility--it simply gives people who are already eligible for the \nbenefit their freedom.\n  This issue was first brought to my attention by former Senator Robert \nDole, who has long been a vigorous advocate for people with \ndisabilities. Our proposal is also supported by the Consortium of \nCitizens with Disabilities, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, \nthe National Association for Home Care, Advancing Independence: \nModernizing Medicare and Medicaid, AIMM, and the National Coalition to \nAmend the Medicare Homebound Restriction.\n  Moreover, the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of \n2002 is consistent with President Bush's ``New Freedom Initiative'' \nwhich has, as its goal, the removal of barriers that impede \nopportunities for those with disabilities to integrate more fully into \nthe community. By allowing reasonable absences from the home, our \namendment will bring the Medicare home health benefit into the 21st \nCentury, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to getting it \ndone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2849. A bill to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for \nresearch, to provide better coordination of Federal efforts and \ninformation on islet cell transplantation, and to collect the data \nnecessary to move islet cell transplantation from an experimental \nprocedure to a standard therapy; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. Collins. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, in introducing the Pancreatic Islet Cell \nTransplantation Act of 2002 which will help to advance important \nresearch that holds the promise of a cure for the more than one million \nAmericans with Type 1 or juvenile diabetes.\n  As the founder and Co-Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families \nas they await a cure. Diabetes is a devastating, life-long condition \nthat affects people of every age, race and nationality. It is the \nleading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations \nnot related to injury. Moreover, diabetes costs the nation more than \n$105 billion a year, one out of every ten health care dollars, in \nhealth-related expenditures.\n  The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for children and young \nadults with juvenile diabetes. Juvenile diabetes is the second most \ncommon chronic disease affecting children. Moreover, it is one that \nthey never outgrow.\n  In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's immune system \nattacks the pancreas and destroys the islet cells that produce insulin. \nWhile the discovery of insulin was a landmark breakthrough in the \ntreatment of people with diabetes, it is not a cure, and people with \njuvenile diabetes face the constant threat of developing devastating, \nlife-threatening complications as well as a drastic reduction in their \nquality of life.\n  Thankfully, there is good news for people with diabetes. We have seen \nsome tremendous breakthroughs in diabetes research in recent years, and \nI am convinced that diabetes is a disease that can be cured, and will \nbe cured in the near future.\n  We were all encouraged by the development of the ``Edmonton \nProtocol,'' an experimental treatment developed at the University of \nAlberta involving the transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic \nislet cells, which has been hailed as the most important advance in \ndiabetes research since the discovery of insulin in 1921. Of the \napproximately 70 patients who have been treated using variation of the \nEdmonton Protocol over the past two years, all have seen a reversal of \ntheir life-disabling hypoglycemia, and nearly 80 percent have \nmaintained normal glucose levels without insulin shots for more than \ntwo years.\n  Moreover, the side effects associated with this treatment--which uses \nmore islet cells and a less-toxic combination of immunosuppressive \ndrugs than previous, less successful protocols--have been mild, and the \ntherapy has been generally well-tolerated by most patients.\n  Unfortunately, long-term use of toxic immunosuppressive drugs, has \nside-effects that make the current treatment inappropriate for use in \nchildren. Researchers, however, are working hard to find a way to \nreduce the transplant recipient's dependence on these drugs so that the \nprocedure will be appropriate for children in the future, and the \nprotocol has been hailed around the world as a remarkable breakthrough \nand proof that islet transplantation can work. It appears to offer the \nmost immediate chance to achieve a cure for juvenile diabetes, and the \nresearch is moving forward rapidly.\n  New sources of islet cells must be found, however, because, as the \nscience advances and continues to demonstrate promise, the number of \nislet cell transplants that can be performed will be limited by a \nserious shortage of pancreases available for islet cell \ntransplantation. There currently are only 2,000 pancreases donated \nannually, and, of these, only about 500 are available each year for \nislet cell transplants. Moreover, most patients require islet cells \nfrom two pancreases for the procedure to work effectively.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will increase the supply of \npancreases available for these trials and research. Our legislation \nwill direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to grant \ncredit to organ procurement organizations, OPS, for the purposes of \ntheir certification--for pancreases harvested and used for islet cell \ntransplantation and research.\n  Currently, CMS collects performance data from each OPO based upon the \nnumber of organs procured for transplant relative to the population of \nthe OPO's service area. While CMS considers a pancreas to have been \nprocured for transplantation if it is used for a whole organ \ntransplant, the OPO receives no credit towards its certification if the \npancreas is procured and used for islet cell transplantation or \nresearch. Our legislation will therefore give the OPOs an incentive to \nstep up their efforts to increase the supply of pancreases donated for \nthis purpose.\n  In addition, the legislation establishes an inter-agency committee on \nislet cell transplantation comprised of representatives of all of the \nfederal agencies with an active role in supporting this research. The \nmany advisory committees on organ transplantation that currently exist \nare so broad in scope that the issue of islet cell transplantation--\nwhile of great importance to the juvenile diabetes community--does not \nrise to the level of consideration when included with broader issues \nassociated with organ donation, such as organ allocation policy and \nfinancial barriers to transplantation. We believe that a more focused \neffort in the area of islet cell transplantation is clearly warranted \nsince the research is moving forward at such a rapid pace and with such \nremarkable results.\n  And finally, to help us collect the data necessary to move islet cell \ntransplantation from an experimental procedure to a standard therapy \ncovered by insurance, our legislation directs the Institute of Medicine \nto conduct a study on the impact of islet cell transplantation on the \nhealth-related quality of life for individuals with juvenile\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\ndiabetes as well as the cost-effectiveness of the treatment.\n  Islet cell transplantation offers real hope for people with juvenile \ndiabetes. Our legislation, which is strongly supported by the Juvenile \nDiabetes Research Foundation, addresses some of the specific obstacles \nto moving this research forward as rapidly as possible, and I urge all \nof our colleagues to join us in sponsoring it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 2853. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish \nthe Missouri River Monitoring and Research Program, to authorize the \nestablishment of the Missouri River Basin Stakeholder Committee, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator Byron \ndorgan in introducing legislation that will establish a world-class, \nscience-based long-term monitoring program for the Missouri River. As \nAmerica's longest river, fed by the headwaters of thousand, year-old \nglaciers, the Missouri is intertwined into the fabric of the American \nexperience. Fed by dozens of tributaries crisscrossing Montana, North \nand South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas, the Missouri River \nsupports hundreds of river species and provides crucial wildlife \nhabitat for migratory birds and other animals. The Missouri River also \nsustains trophy walleye fishing on South Dakota's main stem reservoirs \nand is the hub for the cultural and economic development of several \ncommunities and Indian Tribes.\n  The Missouri River faces challenges on several fronts: The \nmanipulation of its water levels by the Corps of Engineers, the \ncontinued development of river shoreline, and the invasion of nonnative \nfish and plants. The Missouri River Enhancement and Monitoring Act of \n2002 creates a comprehensive monitoring program to investigate and \nexamine how the multiple uses of the Missouri are impacting water \nquality and the sustainability of fish and wildlife.\n  The legislation authorizes the establishment of a federal research \nprogram through the Biological Resources Division of the USGS, the \nDepartment of the Interior's research engine. The strength of the bill, \nhowever, stems from the participation of the states, Indian Tribes, and \nacademic institutions all who have a stake in the health of the River. \nTo that end, the legislation authorizes the establishment of monitoring \nfield stations throughout the Missouri River basin. The bill also \nincludes a competitive funding process to contract with Indian Tribes \nand basin States for the recovery of threatened species and specific \nhabitat restoration projects. These focused investigations will \nencourage States and Indian Tribes to study the impact of water flows \non fish populations at main stem reservoirs.\n  Earlier this year, water releases from South Dakota reservoirs \ndamaged the spring fish spawn and the ecology of the Missouri River. \nThis bill authorizes funds for State agencies with jurisdiction over \nfish and wildlife habitat to initiate projects that will be able to \ntell us how low water levels at South Dakota reservoirs impact fish \npopulations and recreational opportunities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the South Dakota \nDepartment of Game, Fish, and Parks in support of the Missouri River \nMonitoring Act of 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Department of Game,\n\n\n                                               Fish and Parks,\n\n                                        Pierre, SD, July 23, 2002.\n     Senator Tim Johnson,\n     Hart Senate Office,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: I would like to express my \n     appreciation for all of your efforts on behalf of Missouri \n     River fish and wildlife resources, especially the \n     introduction of the ``Missouri River Monitoring Act of \n     2002.'' The framework for this legislation. ``The Missouri \n     River Environmental Assessment Program (MOREAP), was \n     developed by the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee \n     (MRNRC) during 1996 and 1997 in partnership with the \n     Biological Resources Division of the United States Geological \n     Survey (USGS) and 79 Missouri River scientists and fish and \n     wildlife managers. The MRNRC was established in 1987 by my \n     agency and other main stem state fish and wildlife agencies \n     with statutory responsibilities for management and \n     stewardship of river fish and wildlife resources held in \n     trust for the public. We are accountable to the public for \n     management of those resources.\n       My staff and I have reviewed the proposed legislation and I \n     want you to know that we support your bill. The Missouri \n     River lacks a basin wide biological monitoring program and \n     environmental assessment is desperately needed. The need for \n     collecting comprehensive, long-term natural resource data to \n     understand the effects of future river management decisions \n     cannot be over-stated. This program will generate a system-\n     wide database on Missouri River water quality, habitat, and \n     biota that will provide the scientific foundation for \n     management decisions.\n       The Missouri River is 2,341 miles long and drains one-sixth \n     of the United States. It is one of the most important \n     resources in our country. Harnessing the river's flow and \n     constricting its channel has altered and reduced native fish \n     and wildlife habitat. Recovering declining fish and wildlife \n     resources in this extremely large, diverse and complex river \n     environment, while maintaining the important economic \n     benefits the river and reservoir system provides, will \n     require sound and ongoing scientific data.\n       The time has come to make management changes on the \n     Missouri River and those changes should be based on a \n     thorough understanding of how those changes affect the \n     river's environment. Scientific data will help us understand \n     the complex relationships between river management and fish \n     and wildlife habitat recovery.\n       I thank you once again for your help. This legislation has \n     the strong support of the South Dakota Department Game Fish \n     and Parks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John L. Cooper,\n                                             Department Secretary.\n\n  The time for a monitoring program for the Missouri River has arrived. \nWith the Corps of Engineers poised to revise the Missouri River Master \nWater Control Manual, a monitoring program will establish a baseline \nfor judging the impact of new water flows. Years of scientific analysis \nand research from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service point toward Corps \nmanagement of the river as the reason for diminished riparian habitat \nand a laundry list of threatened fish and bird species. Scientific \nmonitoring must be part of a new Master Manual to examine how the new \nwater flows impact fish and wildlife populations. The Corps has spent \nnearly 13 years and millions of dollars to find a consensus and \nimplement a new, more balanced Master Manual. The Missouri River \nEnhancement and Monitoring Act of 2002 establishes a comprehensive \ndatabase to analyze and examine how fish and wildlife respond to a new \nmanagement plan. A long-term monitoring program will ensure that future \ndecisions over the Missouri River are based on sound science and not \npolitics.\n  As we approach the 200 year anniversary of Lewis and Clark's journey \nup the Missouri River, I call on Congress to pass the Missouri River \nEnhancement and Monitoring Act of 2002 to ensure the health and \nvitality of the River for the enjoyment of future generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nSouth Dakota Senator Tim Johnson today in introducing this Missouri \nRiver Enhancement and Monitoring Act of 2002 and thank him for his \nefforts in working with me on this legislation. This bill will \nestablish a program to conduct research on, and monitor the health of, \nthe Missouri River to help recover threatened and endangered species, \nsuch as the pallid sturgeon and piping plover.\n  This bill will enable those who are active in the Missouri River \nBasin to collect and analyze baseline data, as river operations change, \nso that we can monitor changes in the health of the river and in \nspecies recovery in future years.\n  The program would also provide an analysis of the social and economic \nimpacts along the river. And, it would establish a stakeholder group to \nmake recommendations on the recovery of the Missouri River ecosystem.\n  The bill establishes a cooperative working arrangement between state, \nregional federal, and tribal entities that are active in the Missouri \nRiver Basin. I look forward to working with all of the stakeholders in \nthe Basin to implement this important legislation.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation is supported by a broad \nrange of stakeholders, including the North Dakota State Water \nCommission, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, the North Dakota \nChapter of the Sierra Club, the Three Affiliated\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nTribes, the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee, The Missouri \nRiver Basin Association, the South Dakota Game and Fish Department, \nAmerican Rivers, and Environmental Defense.\n  I am confident that this legislation will enjoy bipartisan support, \nbecause of its significance in helping to monitor and restore the \nhealth of this historic River. Lewis and Clark traveled on this River. \nThis River also contributes to $80 million in recreation, fishing, and \ntourism benefits in the Basin. I look forward to holding hearings on \nthis bill and hope that we will be able to pass it into law in the near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2854. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove disproportionate share medicare payments to hospitals serving \nvulnerable populations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing bipartisan legislation \ntoday with Senators Roberts and Enzi that addresses some inequities in \nthe current Medicare disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, program. \nThe bill incorporates the recommendations by the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, or MedPAC, to address the current inequities in \nthe formula that harm rural hospitals and to better target the money to \nsafety net hospitals.\n  The Medicare DSH program was created with the purpose of assisting \nhospitals that provide a substantial amount of care to low-income \nbeneficiaries, including seniors and disabled citizens served by \nMedicare. To protect access to low-income Medicare beneficiaries, DSH \nfunds are provided to hospitals whose viability is threatened by \nproviding care, including unreimbursed care, to low-income patients.\n  Unfortunately, the current Medicare DSH formula does not adequately \nreflect or target money appropriately to these safety net institutions \nand it also inappropriately sets limits and inequities for rural \nhospitals, which are a life-line to many of our Nation's senior \ncitizens and yet struggle due to such payment inequities in the \nMedicare system.\n  This legislation adopts the recommendations of MedPAC to address \nthese inequities. According to MedPAC from its March 2000 ``Report to \nthe Congress: Medicare Payment Policy''--\n\n       The Commission believes that special policy changes are \n     needed to ameliorate several problems inherent in the \n     existing disproportionate share payment system. The current \n     low-income share measure does not include care to all the \n     poor; most notably, it omits uncompensated care. Instead, the \n     measure relies on the share of resources devoted to treating \n     Medicaid recipients to represent the low-income patient load \n     for the entire nonelderly poor population.\n\n  New Mexico leads the Nation in the percentage of uninsured in its \npopulations, according to the Census Bureau. Consequently, as MedPAC \nhas noted repeatedly, the hospitals in my state lose more money to \nuncompensated care than similarly situated hospitals in other states. \nBecause the Medicare DSH formula fails to account for uncompensated \ncare directly but instead uses Medicaid as a proxy, the hospitals in \nNew Mexico are not fairly compensated by the Medicare DSH formula.\n  To address this problem, MedPAC recommends the formula ``include the \ncosts of all poor patients in calculating low-income shares used to \ndistribute disproportionate share payments. . . .'' The legislation we \nare introducing today would make that important change on behalf of our \nNation's safety net hospitals.\n  In addition, MedPAC notes that the current Medicare DSH program has \n10 different formulas. MedPAC adds, ``In particular, current policy \nfavors hospitals located in urban areas; almost half of urban hospitals \nreceive DSH payments, compared with only one-fifth of rural \nfacilities.''\n  Although BIPA improved the equity of DSH payments by raising the \nminimum low-income share needed to qualify for a payment adjustment for \nrural hospitals to that of urban hospitals, BIPA capped the DSH add-on \npayments a rural hospital can receive at just 5.25 percent, except for \nthose rural hospitals already receiving higher payments due to the sole \ncommunity hospital or rural referral center status. While MedPAC \nestimated the change made about 840 additional rural hospitals, or 40 \npercent of all rural facilities, eligible to receive DSH payments, the \ncap maintains some of the inequities between urban and rural hospitals.\n  Again, according to MedPAC in its June 2001 ``Report to Congress: \nMedicare in Rural America'':\n\n       Rural hospitals were responsible for 12.8 percent of the \n     care provided to Medicaid and uncompensated care patients \n     nationally in 1999. With the DSH payment rules in effect \n     through 2000, only 3.1 percent of payments went to rural \n     facilities; BIPA rules would increase that proportion to 6.9 \n     percent.\n\n  To address this problem, MedPAC also recommends using the ``same \nformula to distribute payments to all hospitals covered by prospective \npayment.''\n  In incorporating the recommendations of MedPAC in this legislation, \nit is estimated the bill would increase rural DSH payments by 5.4 \npercent across the country, including an 8.4 percent increase for rural \nhospitals with less than 50 beds. Our Nation's public hospitals would \nalso benefit greatly, as urban public hospitals and rural government \nfacilities are estimated to receive increases of 3.6 percent and 7.7 \npercent, respectively, under this legislation.\n  This legislation I am introducing with Senators Roberts and Enzi \naddresses some long-standing inequities in the Medicare DSH formula. I \nurge its adoption this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the qualified medicare beneficiary (QMB) and special low-income \nmedicare beneficiary (SLMB) programs within the medicaid program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with \nSenator Rockefeller that will make significant and long-overdue \nimprovements in the programs that provide assistance to low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries. This bill is a companion bill to H.R. 5276, \nwhich was introduced by Representatives John Dingell, Sherrod Brown, \nHenry Waxman, and Pete Stark last week.\n  Medicare provides coverage to all 40 million elderly and disabled \nbeneficiaries, regardless of income, but the cost of uncovered \nservices, premiums, and cost-sharing is a serious burden on those with \nthe lowest incomes.\n  More than 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have incomes below 200 \npercent of poverty, including 47 percent or 102,000 seniors in New \nMexico, at income levels below $17,720 for an individual and $23,880 \nfor a couple. These low-income beneficiaries are nearly twice as likely \nas higher-income beneficiaries to report their health status as fair or \npoor, but are less likely to have private supplemental insurance to \ncover the cost of uncovered services or Medicare cost-sharing. Poor \nbeneficiaries also bear a disproportionate burden in out-of-pocket \nhealth care costs, spending more than a third of their incomes on \nhealth care compared to only 10 percent for higher-income \nbeneficiaries.\n  Medicaid, through what is known as the ``Medicare Savings Programs,'' \nfills in Medicare's gaps for low-income beneficiaries, providing \nsupplemental coverage to 17 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. \nAccording to the Center for Medicare Education, which is funded by the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, the costs for low-income beneficiaries \nenrolled in the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary, or QMB, program drops \nout-of-pocket expenditures from 34 percent to 13 percent for low-income \nbeneficiaries. Moreover, Medicare beneficiaries with full Medicaid \ncoverage have out-of-pocket expenses of about 5 percent of their income \nor $295 a year.\n  This is a significant and important protection for our Nation's most \nfinancially vulnerable seniors and disabled citizens. Unfortunately, \nmillions of beneficiaries, who are eligible for assistance under the \nMedicare Savings Programs, are not enrolled. Again, the Center for \nMedicare Education estimates that only half of the beneficiaries below \npoverty who are eligible for assistance are actually enrolled. Lack of \noutreach, complex and burdensome enrollment procedures, and restrictive \nasset requirements keep millions of seniors from receiving the \nassistance they desperately need.\n  The ``Medicare Beneficiary Improvement Act of 2002'' takes a number \nof steps to address these problems. First, the legislation improves \neligibility requirements for these programs. It raises the income level \nfor eligibility for Medicare Part B premium assistance from 120 to 135 \npercent of poverty. This expansion was originally enacted in 1997 but \nit expires this year. The Congress needs to take action this year to \nmaintain these important protections for the Nation's elderly and \nshould take the additional action to make this provision permanent.\n\n  In addition, the bill also ensures that all seniors who meet \nsupplemental security income, or SSI, criteria are automatically \neligible for assistance. Currently, automatic eligibility is only \nrequired in certain States, meaning that beneficiaries in other states \nmay miss out on critical assistance unless they know enough to apply.\n  The bill also eliminates the restrictive assets test that requires \nseniors to become completely destitute in order to qualify for \nassistance. Most low-income Medicare beneficiaries have limited assets \nto begin with but the asset restrictions are so severe, a beneficiary\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\ncould not keep a fund or more than $1,500 for burial expenses without \nbeing disqualified from assistance. Moreover, own a car and you are \nlikely to be denied financial protections under current law.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, it is estimated that up to \n40 percent of low-income elderly that are otherwise eligible for \nfinancial assistance are denied protections due to the assets test. Any \nsenior citizen making less than $13,290 a year who somehow has managed \nto scrape together $4,000 in a savings account for emergency are not \neligible for financial protections from Medicare's cost sharing \nrequirements. This runs counter to the goal of the Medicare program of \nproviding security to the elderly rather than requiring impoverishment \nof them.\n  Furthermore, the legislation take steps to eliminate barriers to \nenrollment under the program. Again, according to the Center for \nMedicare Education, ``While some states have conducted activities to \nreach and enroll people in the Medicare Savings Programs, there is a \nneed for more outreach activity in states. For example, in 1999, only \n18 states reported that they used a short application form for the \nMedicare Savings Programs, and less than half of the states placed \neligibility workers in settings other than welfare offices.''\n  The bill allows Medicare beneficiaries to apply for assistance at \nlocal social security offices, encourages states to station eligibility \nworkers at these offices, as well as at other sites frequented by \nsenior citizens and individuals with disabilities, and ensures that \nbeneficiaries can apply for the program using a simplified application \nform. In addition, this bill will ensure that once an individual is \nfound eligible for assistance, the individual remains continuously \neligible and does not need to re-apply annually.\n  Another important step the legislation takes for low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries is that it provides 3 months of retroactive for QMBs. All \nother groups of beneficiaries have this protection currently. In \naddition, it prohibits estate recovery for QMBs for the cost of their \ncost-sharing or benefits provided through this program. The fear that \nMedicaid will recoup such costs from a surviving spouse is often a \ndeterrent for many seniors to apply for such assistance.\n  And finally, the legislation funds a demonstration project to improve \ninformation and coordination between federal state, and local entities \nto increase enrollment of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. This \ndemonstration would help agencies identify individuals who are \npotentially eligible for assistance by coordinating various data and \nsharing it with states for the purposes of locating and enrolling these \nindividuals. In addition, the legislation provides grant money for \nadditional innovative outreach and enrollment projects for the Medicare \nSavings Programs.\n  I would like to thank Representative Dingell for his leadership on \nthis issue and am pleased to be introducing the Senate companion bill \nto his legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to improve the requirements regarding advance directives in order \nto ensure that an individual's health care decisions are complied with, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr President, I am extremely pleased to be joined by \nmy colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Wyden, in introducing the \nAdvanced Directives and Compassionate Care Act of 2002.\n  The end of life is a difficult time for individuals and their \nfamilies. A complex web of emotional, legal, medical, and spiritual \ndemands magnify the pain and turmoil already being experienced. Loss of \ncontrol can result in depression and confusion, sometimes even \nhastening death. And, too often, a lifetime's dignity can be stripped \naway in a person's final months, leaving their survivors an inheritance \nof sadness and regret.\n  The Advanced Directives and Compassionate Care Act will help families \nand individuals avoid this bitter legacy, by helping maintain greater \ncontrol of their final months. It gives patients greater information \nand power in determining treatment and hospice options. The legislation \naddresses legal issues that often arise at the end-of-life, and makes \nit more certain that advanced directives, such as ``living wills'' will \nbe followed. It promotes the hospice-based care that most terminally \nill patients prefer. Most important, it gives people a better chance to \nmaintain their dignity in their final hours. I urge that the Senate \ntake up this vital and compassionate legislation this year, and that we \nensure it's passage before we return home this fall.\n  According to a 1999 National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization \nsurvey, Americans are hesitant to talk with their elderly parents about \nhow they would like to be cared for at the end of life. This same study \nshowed that less than twenty-five percent of Americans have put into \nwriting instructions for how we'd like to be cared for personally at \nthe end of our lives. Many health care providers overlook the equally \nimportant issue of providing adequate and appropriate care such as \nrelief of pain, or family support services to those who are at the end \nof life. In addition, there is great variation among State laws with \nrespect to advanced directives.\n  Our legislation takes real and tangible steps toward improving the \npractices and care that affect our citizens when they are facing death \nor the real possibility of death.\n  First, and perhaps most important, the Compassionate Care Act gives \npatients greater power to control their\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nfinal days, by directly addressing the improvement of advanced \ndirectives. In my home state, a 2000 survey showed that three-quarters \nof West Virginians would prefer to die at home, yet nearly 60 percent \nof all deaths occur in a hospital. West Virginia has perhaps the most \nprogressive state laws with regard to living wills and power of \nattorney, yet only one-third of those surveyed have either. These \nfigures are unacceptable--people need to have a greater say in their \nown destiny.\n  Currently, state laws on the execution of advance directives vary \ngreatly. Too often, this means a serious problem when the patient's \nwishes about their medical care are ignored--even when family members \nattest to their validity--because they moved to another state after \ncreating the directive, but before or at the time that care is needed. \nMost of the differences that cause one state not to honor an advance \ndirective created in another state are technical in nature--for \nexample, one state requires two witnesses while another only one. This \nvariance should not deny a person the type of care desired. Only a \nfederal portability statute can address this problem.\n  Under our legislation, an advance directive valid in the state in \nwhich it is executed would be honored in any other state in which it \nmay be presented. In addition, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would be required to gather information and consult with \nexperts about the feasibility and desirability of creating a uniform \nadvance directive for all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and \npossibly others, in the United States, as well as study such issues as \nthe provision of adequate palliative care. A uniform advance directive \nwould enable people to designate the kind of care they wish to receive \nat the end of their lives in a way that is easily recognizable and \nunderstood by everyone.\n  In 1990, this body passed bipartisan legislation entitled the Patient \nSelf-Determination Act. That legislation required hospitals, and other \nhealth care facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms to provide every adult receiving medical care with written \ninformation regarding the patient's involvement with their own \ntreatment decisions. The Compassionate Care Act builds on this Act, and \nthe thinking behind it, to improve the quality of care and the quality \nof life for terminally ill patients.\n  Our bill builds on the Patient Self-Determination Act, improving the \ntype and amount of information available by ensuring that a person \nentering a hospital, nursing home, or other health care facility is \nhelped by a knowledgeable person to create a new advance directive or \ndiscuss an existing one. The patient's own needs, desires, and values \nmust be the basis of decision-making and, whenever possible, the \npatient's family and/or friends should be part of the conversation. \nFurther, the bill requires that if a person has an advance directive it \nbe placed prominently in the medical record where all doctors and \nnurses involved in the patient's care can clearly see it. Finally, \nunder the Compassionate Care Act, a 24-hour, toll-free hotline that \nprovides consumers with information on advance directives, end-of-life \ncare decision-making, and hospice care would be established.\n  Second, our legislation would require the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to develop outcome standards and other measures for \nevaluating the quality of end-of-life care including the \nappropriateness of care and ease of access to high quality care. There \nare currently too few measures or standards available to assess the \nquality of care provided to Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP beneficiaries \nwith terminal conditions. There are also significant variations in \navailable medical care for patients at the end-of-life based on \ngeographic area, ethnic group and alternative models of care.\n  Third, this legislation would authorize demonstration projects to \ndevelop new and innovative approaches to improving end-of-life care and \npain management for Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP beneficiaries. At \nleast one demonstration would focus particularly on pediatric end-of-\nlife care. Priorities include adequate pain management for terminally \nill patients--40-80 percent of terminally ill patients say they do not \nreceive adequate treatment for their pain; treatment of pediatric \nillnesses--28 thousand children die of chronic illness each year, but \nfewer than 10 percent receive hospice care; and treatment of Medicare \nbeneficiaries in hospice care.\n  Finally, to help improve communication between federal agencies and \nexperts in the fields of hospice, end-of-life, and palliative care, the \nlegislation establishes a 15 member End-of-Life Care Advisory Board \nconsisting of end-of-life care providers, consumers, professional and \nresource-based groups, and policy/advocacy organizations. Recently, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services has made a concerted effort \nto improve its involvement in the area of end-of-life care. The \nAdvisory Board is designed to further assist the Secretary and the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the evaluation of and \ndecisions relating to adequate end-of-life care. In addition, it would \nutilize the reports mandated in this bill to create its own evaluation \nof the field and propose recommendations for legislative and \nadministrative actions to improve end-of-life care in America.\n  Mr. President, death is a hard subject to talk about. It's hard to \nthink about--and especially hard to plan for. I know this personally, \nas many of my colleagues may as well, from dealing with the loss of a \nfamily member to a prolonged illness. Too often discussion about end-\nof-life care and adequate pain management focuses around physician \nassisted suicide. The fact is that this quality end-of-life care--\nhelping the dying and their families who want better, more \ncompassionate care--is what we should be talking about, and what our \nlegislation does.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National Hospice and \nPalliative Care Association, Partnership for Caring, The American Bar \nAssociation, Americans for Better Care of the Dying, and the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics. I ask unanimous consent that several of the \nletters of support from these organizations and the full text of the \nlegislation be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2857\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John D. Rockefeller,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: The National Hospice and \n     Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), the nation's largest \n     and oldest organization dedicated to advancing the philosophy \n     and practice of hospice care, appreciates the opportunity to \n     continue to work with you on your proposed draft legislation, \n     ``Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 2002''.\n       We applaud your efforts to address an important health care \n     issue and appreciate your willingness to work with the NHPCO \n     to incorporate changes relative to hospice into the \n     legislation. Specifically, the NHPCO supports your efforts to \n     make advance directives portable among the states, to study \n     end of life care needs of the general population and to \n     authorize Medicare demonstration projects on end of life \n     care.\n       We look forward to working with you on your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Galen Miller,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Partnership for Caring Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2002.\n     Senator John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: On behalf of Partnership for \n     Caring: America's Voices for the Dying I am writing to \n     endorse and support the passage of the ``Compassionate Care \n     and Advance Planning Act of 2002'' Our Board of Directors, \n     staff and membership are grateful for and applaud your \n     continuing leadership and deep commitment to improving care \n     for people nearing the end of their lives.\n       Partnership for Caring is a national, nonprofit \n     organization representing consumers of end-of-life care and \n     their families. Our mission is to encourage individuals to \n     think about and plan for the type of care they would like to \n     receive at the end of their journey and to discuss those \n     plans with their families, friends and physicians. \n     Partnership makes available to the public Advance Directives \n     specific to each state's law and educational materials on \n     many aspects of end-of-life care and conversation. We also \n     provide assistance via our 24 hour, toll-free help line, as \n     well as advocacy to improve palliative and end-of-life care.\n       The health care systems and reimbursement mechanisms in \n     America today are the focus of a great deal of scrutiny, \n     especially the Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP programs. \n     Unfortunately, the critically important health care \n     components of palliative and end-of-life care too often are \n     overlooked. We thank you and the cosponsors of the \n     legislation for raising the visibility of this essential \n     aspect of care and for proposing immediate improvements in \n     our health systems as well as research and demonstration \n     projects that will inform us about better ways to care for \n     people in the last phase of their lives.\n       We are particularly pleased about the proposal to create an \n     End-of-Life Care Advisory Board to work with CMS and HHS. \n     This provision alone will help make certain that any federal \n     government proposals to reform Medicare, Medicaid or S-CHIP \n     will have the informed contributions of experts in the fields \n     of palliative and hospice medicine. Such a Board is vitally \n     important if these programs and other health care laws and \n     regulations are to adequately address the needs of people who \n     are dying. The Board's diversity will help assure that the \n     unique concerns of minorities, children and young adults, \n     various religious and ethnic groups are heard. Consumers and \n     providers of end-of-life care will both have a voice.\n       The inclusion of the S-CHIP program in legislation dealing \n     with end-of-life care deserves special thanks. While no one \n     likes to think about children dying, about 53,000 children \n     die each year. Research on caring for terminally ill \n     pediatric patients is minimal and dying children have been \n     woefully underserved in the areas of pain management and \n     hospice care. Mandating that at least one demonstration \n     project focus on pediatric issues is step in the right \n     direction and will benefit thousands of children whose young \n     lives will end too soon.\n       Medicare beneficiaries have a compelling reason to seek \n     improvements in end-of-life care: everyone who becomes a \n     Medicare beneficiary will die a Medicare beneficiary. Today \n     27% of all Medicare expenditures are spent caring for people \n     in the last year of their lives, frequently on costly, \n     unnecessary procedures in hospitals and nursing homes. \n     Although hospice care currently accounts for only 1.3% of all \n     Medicare expenditures that percentage will grow as the baby-\n     boomers age and seek a qualitatively different end-of-life \n     scenario than the ones many of them watched their parents and \n     grandparents endure. The demonstration projects authorized by \n     your legislation will allow us to learn more about our \n     choices and become better educated consumers of care.\n       As you will know, caring for an elderly parent, a sick \n     spouse, or a dying child, can\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\n     be emotionally, economically, and physically draining under \n     any circumstance. As a consumer based organization, \n     Partnership for Caring knows first hand how much worse it is \n     for those who have never discussed with their loved ones \n     their wishes for end-of-life care, who do not know what \n     resources are available, or who are unaware of palliative and \n     hospice care and how to access these services. Health care \n     providers, too, are often caught having to make decisions or \n     talk to family members without benefit of knowing their \n     patients' wishes or alternative services in their \n     communities. ``The Compassionate Care and Advance Planning \n     Act of 2002'' will help educate the pubic and providers as \n     well as encourage conversations and advance planning. \n     Insuring that each of us can receive the kind of care we \n     would want for ourselves and our loved ones as we near death \n     should be a priority concern as these programs look to the \n     future.\n       Again, our thanks to you and all of the senators who join \n     in supporting this bill. Insuring that each of us can receive \n     the kind of care we want for ourselves and our loved ones as \n     we near death should be a national priority as we look to the \n     future of health care. We at Partnership for Caring will be \n     working with you and our partner organizations to assure \n     passage of the ``Compassionate Care Act'' and, more \n     importantly, to assure better quality care for all our loved \n     ones and for ourselves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Karen Orloff Kaplan,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Bar Association\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2002.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association, I am writing to commend you and your co-sponsors \n     for introducing the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care \n     Act of 2002. This legislation takes several important steps \n     beyond the 1990 Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) which \n     introduced the term ``Advance Directive'' to the American \n     vernacular. The American Bar Association supported the \n     enactment of the PSDA and has continued to encourage greater \n     access to the tools of advance planning, greater uniformity \n     and portability of advance directives, and greater \n     responsiveness to the needs of patients in health care \n     systems at all stages of life, including end-of-life care.\n       The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act takes \n     several modest but vital steps towards these goals. Under its \n     provisions there will be an opportunity to discuss advance \n     directives with an appropriately trained individual upon \n     admission to a health care facility, which will help \n     transform the existing paper-disclosure requirement into a \n     meaningful vehicle for discussion and understanding. This \n     will do much to combat the misperception that advance \n     planning means merely signing a form. Good advance planning \n     is, in essence, good communication, not mere form-drafting.\n       The portability and research mandates concerning advance \n     directives are seriously needed to move public policy beyond \n     the current Balkanization of legal formalities that \n     characterizes current advance-directive law. In addition, the \n     mandate to examine the feasibility and desirability of \n     creating a uniform advance directive will generate much-\n     needed fresh thinking on the strategies that may best \n     encourage advance planning. Sadly, twelve years after the \n     PSDA, the majority of adults still avoid the necessary task \n     of planning for end-of-life decision-making.\n       The National Information Hotline will provide a valuable \n     consumer tool for information about advance directives and \n     end-of-life care options. Finally, the mandates for standards \n     development, evaluation and demonstration projects, as well \n     as coverage provisions, will help fill the inexcusable chasm \n     in current knowledge, regulation, and financing of end-of-\n     life care under Medicare and Medicaid. Historically, end-of-\n     life decision-making and quality of care have been relegated \n     to the shadows of health and long-term care policy. This Act \n     will help the public and policy makers understand the issues \n     and options in the light of day.\n       The ABA strongly supports this legislation. We commend your \n     leadership in seeking to enhance patient autonomy and end-of-\n     life care, and we stand ready to be a resource in these \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Advance \nPlanning and Compassionate Care Act, which is intended to improve the \nway we care for people at the end of their lives.\n  Noted health economist, Uwe Reinhardt, once observed that ``Americans \nare the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' \nAdvancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled \nmore and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when \nmedical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, \npatients and their families should not have to fear that the process of \ndying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care \nthat is inconsistent with their values or wishes.\n  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to re-\nexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at \nthe end of their lives. Clearly, there is more that we can do to \nrelieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide \nopportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's \nconclusion.\n  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not \ncurrently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life \ncare. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on \ncare at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-\ntechnology interventions and ``rescue'' care. While most Americans say \nthey would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent \ndie in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are \nsubjected to high-tech treatments that merely prolong suffering.\n  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study conducted by Dr. Jack \nWennberg, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient \ndies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans \nreceive in their final months varies tremendously in the different \nparts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of \nwhether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more \nto do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or \npreference.\n  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help \nus improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of \ntheir lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes \nto the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate \ndiscussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions \nabout end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that \nevery Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing \nfacility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the \npreparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained \nprofessional within the institution. The legislation also requires that \nif a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a \nprominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and \nnurses can clearly see it.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to study end-of-life issues and also to develop \ndemonstration projects to develop models for end-of-life care for \nMedicare, Medicaid, and State Child Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, \npatients. The Institute of Medicine recently released a report that \nconcluded that we need to improve palliative and end-of-life care for \nchildren with terminal illnesses. According to the report, far too \noften children with fatal or potentially fatal conditions and their \nfamilies fail to receive competent, compassionate, and consistent care \nthat meets their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Our \nlegislation therefore requires that at least one of these \ndemonstrations focus particularly on pediatric end-of-life care.\n  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide \nconsumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-\nlife issues, and medical decisionmaking and also establishes an End-of-\nLife Care Advisory Board to assist the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices in developing outcome standards and measures to evaluate end-\nof-life care programs and projects.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in \nlight of the debate on physician-assisted suicide. The desire for \nassisted suicide is generally driven by concerns about the quality of \ncare for the terminally ill; by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of \ndignity and emotional strain on family members. Such worries would \nrecede and support for assisted suicide would evaporate if better \npalliative care and more effective pain management were widely \navailable.\n  Patients and their families should be able to trust that the care \nthey receive at the end of their lives is not only of high quality, but \nalso that it respects their desires for peace, autonomy, and\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\ndignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act that Senator \nRockefeller and I are introducing today will give us some of the tools \nthat we need to improve care of the dying in this country, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2858. A bill to modify the project for navigation, Union River, \nMaine; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2859. A bill to deauthorize the project for navigation, Northeast \nHarbor, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce two bills for harbors in Maine, \none to deauthorize the Federal Navigation Project in Northeast Harbor, \nand the second to redesignate the Upper Basin of the Union River \nFederal Navigational Channel as an anchorage. The bills, cosponsored by \nSenator Collins, will help strengthen the economic viability of these \ntwo popular Maine harbors.\n  Because of changing harbor usage over the last 45 years, the Town of \nMount Desert has requested that Northeast Harbor be withdrawn from the \nFederal Navigation Project. This removal will allow the town to adapt \nto the high demand for moorings and will allow residents to obtain \nmoorings in a more timely manner. The Harbor has now reached capacity \nfor both moorings and shoreside facilities and has a waiting list of \nover sixty people along with commercial operators who have been waiting \nfor years to obtain a mooring for their commercial vessels.\n  The Harbor was authorized in 1945 and constructed in 1954 as a mixed-\nuse commercial fishing/recreational boating harbor--and it still is \ntoday. It was dredged in the early 1950s to provide more space for \nrecreational boating and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has informed \nthe town that Northeast Harbor would be very low on its dredging \npriority list as it has become primarily a recreational harbor. The \ntown says it realizes that, once it is no longer part of the Federal \nNavigational Project, any further dredging within the harbor would be \ncarried out at town expense.\n  The language will not only allow for more recreational moorages and \ncommercial activities, it will also be an economic boost to Northeast \nHarbor, which is surrounded by Acadia National Park, one of the \nnation's most visited parks--both by land and by water.\n  My second bill supports the City of Ellsworth's efforts to revitalize \nthe Union River navigation channel, harbor, and shoreline. The \nmodification called for in my legislation will redesignate a portion of \nthe Union River as an anchorage area. This redesignation will allow for \na greater number of moorings in the harbor without interfering with \nnavigation and will further improve the City's revitalization efforts \nfor the harbor area.\n  I have worked with the New England Division of the Corps to draft \nthese bills and the language has been approved by Army Corps \nHeadquarters in Washington. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues for their passage, either as stand alone bills or as \nseparate provisions in the Corps reauthorization bill, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2002, that Congress is currently drafting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 2860. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nmodify the rules for redistribution and extended availability of fiscal \nyear 2000 and subsequent fiscal year allotments under the State \nchildren's health insurance program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on France.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will improve \nand protect health insurance for our nation's children. The Children's \nHealth Improvement and Protection Act of 2002, CHIP Act, brings us back \nto the basics of health care--the fundamental philosophy that no child \nshould go without needed health care. I'm pleased to be joined by my \ngood friends Senator Chafee and Senator Kennedy to introduce the \nChildren's Health Insurance Improvement and Protection Act of 2002.\n  Established in 1997 to reduce the number of uninsured children, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program has been an unqualified success. \nLast year, 4.6 million children were enrolled in CHIP and the \npercentage of children without health insurance has declined in recent \nyears. In my state of West Virginia, the CHIP program provides health \ncoverage to over 20,000 children. Health insurance coverage is key to \nassuring children's access to appropriate and adequate health care, \nincluding preventive services. Research demonstrates that uninsured \nchildren are more likely to lack a usual source of care, to go without \nneeded care, and to experience worse health outcomes than children with \ncoverage. Uninsured children who are injured are 30 percent less likely \nthan insured children to receive medical treatment and three times more \nlikely not to get a needed prescription.\n  However, the continued success of the CHIP program is now in serious \njeopardy. The Bush Administration projects that 900,000 children will \nlose their health coverage between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, if \nCongress does not take appropriate action. This is because even as \nstate enrollment and spending rapidly increases, federal CHIP funding \ndropped by more than $1 billion this year and will be reduced in each \nof the next two years. Known as the ``CHIP Dip,'' this reduction has no \nunderlying health policy justification; it was solely the result of the \nbudget compromises we had to make when enacting the balanced budget \ndeal in 1997.\n  As a result, a number of states will have insufficient federal \nfunding to sustain their enrollment and they will have no choice but to \nscale back or limit their CHIP programs. As enrollment is cut, the \nnumber of uninsured children will increase, and as a consequence, sick \nchildren will get sicker. The biggest problem that will result from \nenrollment cuts in the CHIP program are the future health problems of \nadults who as children could have received benefits under CHIP. Yet, \neven as states face this funding shortfall, under federal rules, nearly \n$3 billion in federal CHIP funding is scheduled to expire and revert \nback to the Treasury over the next two years. If Congress does not act, \nin order to maintain our current enrollment levels, West Virginia will \nrun out of CHIP funding in 2005.\n  We cannot allow this to happen. We need a comprehensive and \nreasonable approach to shore up CHIP financing in order to avert the \ndevastating enrollment decline and make sure that our children are \nprotected into the future. This legislation will extend the life of the \nexpiring funds and fully restore CHIP funding to the pre- ``dip'' \nlevels. This legislation will provide West Virginia with $117 million \nover the 2004-2012 period allowing them to strengthen and protect \nchildren's access to health care.\n  I urge Congress to enact this legislation and ensure the continued \nsuccess of the CHIP program and sustain the significant progress CHIP \nhas made in reducing the ranks of uninsured children. Mr. President I \nask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Rockefeller \nin introducing the Children's Health Improvement and Protection Act of \n2002.\n  The Children's Health Improvement and Protection Act of 2002 will \nfinally provide long-term stability to the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. While SCHIP has been extremely successful at \nenrolling and insuring low-income and uninsured children since its \ninception in 1997, the continued success of this program is in \nquestion. In fact, it is estimated that almost a million children will \nlose their SCHIP coverage over the next three years if a legislative \nremedy is not signed into law to prevent this from happening.\n  When SCHIP was created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, states \nwere given their annual SCHIP allotment based on the number of \nuninsured and low-income children in each state. According to the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, these state allotments \nrange from $3.5 million for Vermont to $855 million for California. \nWhile the percentage of children without health insurance has declined \nover the past couple of years due to these allotments, the SCHIP \nallotments for all states are 26 percent lower for Fiscal Years 2002, \n2003, and 2004. Each of these years results in a decline of $1 billion \nfor state SCHIP allotments. This phenomenon is known as the ``CHIP-\nDip.'' There was no hidden policy agenda behind this steady decline in \nfunding; it was based on a lack of federal funding for SCHIP at the \ntime this program was enacted.\n  In addition, BBA gave states only three years to roll-over unexpended \nfunds before these funds are given back to the federal treasury for \nredistribution to other states that have used up their entire \nallotments. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, a \ntotal of $3.2 billion in federal SCHIP funds is scheduled to expire and \nrevert to Treasury over the next two years.\n  These funding inadequacies not only create instability in the \nprogram, but they pose negative consequences for each state over the \nlong-haul due to the uncertainty of federal commitment to SCHIP. The \nlikely result will be that states will either have to cap enrollment in \ntheir SCHIP programs, push children out of their programs, or scale \nback benefits to make up for these budget shortfalls. The end result\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nwill be that children who once had access to health insurance will no \nlonger get the care they need.\n  Our bill will remedy these funding problems. It will do so by fixing \nthe ``CHIP-Dip'' and by extending the life of expiring funds to states \nthat need the assistance to take care of funding shortfalls. This \nlegislation is crucial to my state of Rhode Island. Without this \nlegislative remedy, Rhode Island is set to run out of SCHIP funds by FY \n2004. At 4.5 percent, Rhode Island currently has the lowest uninsured \nrate of any state in the nation for children. This bill will enable \nRhode Island to continue offering health coverage to this vulnerable \npopulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Rockefeller and me in supporting \nthis important legislation. It is a crucial step in ensuring that our \nnation's children will have long-term access to quality health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Children's \nHealth Improvement and Protection Act today, along with my good friends \nSenator Orrin Hatch, Senator Jay Rockefeller, and Senator Lincoln \nChafee. This bill will provide needed funding to keep children enrolled \nin the Children's Health Insurance Program and to allow the program to \ngrow. Without this legislation, hundreds of thousands of children will \nlose their CHIP coverage and rejoin the ranks of the uninsured.\n  Monday is the fifth anniversary of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Senator Hatch and I have worked together on many proposals, \nbut none has had more lasting benefit for millions of American children \nthan our legislation to create CHIP. We first proposed CHIP after we \nbecame acutely aware of the health defects facing children and the need \nto assure that every child got a healthy start in life. Before we \npassed CHIP, 500,000 children with asthma never saw a doctor. Another \n600,000 children with earaches and 600,000 with sore throats never \nreceived medical care.\n  A sick child can't learn. A child who can't hear the teacher can't \nlearn. A child who can't see the doctor when they're sick can't learn. \nThat's why uninsured children are more likely to fall behind or drop \nout of school altogether.\n  We also became aware of the ravages of smoking on health, and that \nthe key to addressing this problem was to discourage children from \nstarting to smoke. In my own state of Massachusetts, there had been a \nvery successful campaign to raise money to expand children's health \ncoverage by raising the cigarette tax. This united anti-tobacco \nactivists and child health advocates.\n  So Senator Hatch and I decided that the winning, fiscally \nresponsible, right health policy approach was to develop a major \nexpansion of children's health insurance and finance it with an \nincrease in the tobacco tax.\n  And what a success CHIP has been. This legislation has touched every \ncommunity in America. Last year, over 4.5 million children received \nhealth insurance through either Children's Health Insurance Program or \nthrough Medicaid expansions under the CHIP program. Last year, 105,000 \nchildren in Massachusetts were covered through these programs, and many \nother states have had similar successes.\n  Despite the clear evidence that health insurance provides children \nwith a healthier start, funding cuts to the CHIP program of more than \n$1 billion this year and each of the next two years puts the gains we \nhave made in insuring children at risk. This ``CHIP dip'' is a result \nof the budget constraints when CHIP was enacted in 1997 as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act. This funding cut comes at the same time enrollment \nin the program is rising and will cause 900,000 children to lose the \nhealth insurance they have today through CHIP.\n  While states are facing a drop in funding that will cause them to \ndrop insured children, almost $3 billion in unspent CHIP funds will be \nlost if we do nothing. CHIP funds must be spent within three years of \nallocation. Because of a mismatch between the time unspent funds were \nreallocated to the states and when the states needed the funds, some \nstates will not be able to use all of their CHIP funds within the \nallocation period.\n  It makes no sense to have funds expire and revert to the Treasury \nwhen we know states will be facing a funding drop that will cause them \nto cut children from their programs. One of this nation's most \nfundamental guarantees should be that every child has the opportunity \nto succeed in life. But that commitment rings hollow if children are \ndoomed to a lifetime of disability and illness because they lack needed \nhealth care in their early years.\n  That is why we are introducing the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This bill will allow states to maintain and expand their CHIP \nprograms. It lets states keep a portion of their unspent funds that \nwould otherwise expire. It also establishes a new caseload \nstabilization pool with funds that would otherwise expire. The pool \nwill direct unspent funds to states that are expected to use up all \ntheir CHIP funds. Finally, the bill provides additional CHIP funding \nfor fiscal years 2003 and 2004 so that CHIP enrollment can be \nmaintained and expanded. This legislation will move us one important \nstep closer to fulfilling the promise that no child in America will be \nleft behind because of inadequate health care coverage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, Senators Rockefeller, Chafee, \nKennedy, and I are introducing legislation to make certain that States \nhave adequate funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, \notherwise known as CHIP.\n  I cosponsor this legislation to reflect my concern that, unless the \nCongress addresses this issue, thousands of children may risk losing \ntheir health insurance coverage. CHIP has proven to be an enormously \npopular program, which has provided much needed health insurance to \nliterally millions of low-income children. It helps the poorest of the \npoor families who are not Medicaid-eligible.\n  We cannot afford to stand back now and watch those efforts be \nundermined because of funding problems that Congress should correct. \nThat is the intent, as I understand it, of the Rockefeller-Chafee bill.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, when CHIP was established in \n1997, Congress committed $20 billion over five years and a total of $40 \nbillion over 10 years for the program. For each fiscal year 1999 \nthrough 2001, Congress allocated $4.3 billion; yet for the fiscal years \n2002 through 2004, Congress allocated $3 billion per year for CHIP \nprograms. This so-called ``CHIP'' dip may reduce funding levels in \nStates that are just beginning to ramp up their programs.\n  I am concerned that while States will have some unspent CHIP moneys \navailable to them, that those funds still might not be enough to \naddress the ``CHIP dip'' and the expanding CHIP population. We need to \ndeal with this issue and we need to deal with the nearly $3 billion in \nfederal CHIP moneys scheduled to revert back to the Treasury in fiscal \nyear 2002 and 2003.\n  My cosponsorship of this legislation reflects my commitment to \naddress these issues, although I recognize that there are a number of \nissues associated with this legislation that will need to be worked \nout. I accept the assurances of my fellow cosponsors that they will \nwork with me to address those issues as the bill moves forward in the \nFinance Committee.\n  Let me also add that I am aware that many of my colleagues have \nadditional policy issues regarding the CHIP program that they feel \nshould be addressed. Know I do. I am particularly concerned by recent \nlegislation, approved by the Finance Committee, which would extend \ncoverage under the CHIP program to pregnant women. Now, I \nwholeheartedly support providing expectant mothers health care \nassistance. But, I believe that before we extend coverage under CHIP to \nany adult, States need to demonstrate that they are covering, to the \ngreatest extend possible, all eligible children.\n  The CHIP program is one of my proudest accomplishments. I want to \ncontinue to maintain the integrity of this program. The only purpose of \nCHIP was to extend access to health insurance to poor kids. As one of \nthe prime authors of the legislation, I can assure my colleagues that \nit was not our intent that the program be expanded to address the \nentire problem of health care for the uninsured a piece at a time. \nCovering the uninsured is a worthy goal and one which we need to \naddress, but that was not the purpose\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\nof CHIP. We were dealing with a special problem: the up to 10 million \nchildren who did not have access to health insurance. We ought not lose \nsight of this. I am confident we can come to an agreement on measures \nto ensure that needy children receive the health care they deserve and \nthus I am pleased to join with my colleagues today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2861. A bill to empower States with authority for most taxing and \nspending for highway programs and mass transit programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President; I introduce The Transportation Empowerment \nAct which will allow states to keep a majority of the federal gas tax \ndollars raised in their state. Similar to legislation introduced by our \nformer colleague Connie Mack, ``The Transportation Empowerment Act'' \nrestores to states and local communities the ability to make their own \ntransportation decisions without the interference of Washington.\n  This proposal is very straightforward. It streamlines the federal-aid \nhighway program into four core areas: Interstate, Federal Lands, Safety \nand Research. The proposed bill provides for continued general fund \nsupport for transit grants and authorizes states to enter into multi \nstate compacts for planning and financing regional transportation \nneeds.\n  The federal tax is kept in place for a four-year transition period, \nbeginning in FY04. After funding the core programs and paying off \noutstanding bills, the balance is returned to the states in a block \ngrant. At the end of the transition period, in FY07, the federal tax is \nreduced to two cents per gallon.\n  I have long believed that the best decisions are those made at the \nlocal level. Unfortunately, many of the transportation choices made by \ncities and states are governed by federal rules and regulations. This \nbill returns to states the responsibility and resources to make their \nown transportation decisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. \n        Biden):\n  S. 2862. A bill to provide for the establishment of a scientific \nbasis for new firefighting technology standards, improve coordination \namong Federal, State, and local fire officials in training for and \nresponding to terrorist attacks and other national emergencies, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nHollings, Cantwell, and Biden in introducing the Firefighting Research \nand Coordination Act. This legislation would provide for the \nestablishment of the scientific basis for new firefighting technology \nstandards; improved coordination between Federal, state, and local fire \nofficials in training and response to a terrorist attack or a national \nemergency; and authorize the National Fire Academy to offer training to \nimprove the ability of firefighters to respond to events such as the \ntragedy of September 11, 2001.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to act upon some of the lessons \nlearned from the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and \naddress other problems faced by the fire services. On September 11, the \nNew York City fire fighters and emergency service personnel acted with \ngreat heroism in selflessly rushing to the World Trade Center and \nsaving the lives of many Americans. Tragically, 343 firefighters and \nEMS technicians paid the ultimate price in the service of their \ncountry. While we strive to prevent any future attack in the United \nStates, it is our duty to ensure that we are adequately prepared for \nany future catastrophic act of terrorism. In addition, we must \nrecognize that many of the preparations we make to improve the response \nto national emergencies will also prepare our firefighters for their \neveryday role in protecting our families and homes.\n  Today's firefighters use a variety of technologies including thermal \nimaging equipment, devices for locating firefighters and victims, and \nstate-of-the-art protective suits to fight fires, clean up chemical or \nhazardous waste spills, and contend with potential terrorist devices. \nThe Federal government's Firefighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement, FIRE, program is authorized for $900 million this year to \nassist local fire departments in purchasing this high-tech equipment. \nIt is important that the American taxpayers' money is used for \neffective new equipment that will protect our local communities.\n  Unfortunately, there are no uniform technical standards for this new \nequipment for combating fires. Without such standards, local fire \ncompanies may purchase equipment that does not satisfy their needs, or \neven purchase faulty equipment. For example, Montgomery County, MD, \nspent $40,000 on ``Level B'' protective suits that they cannot use, \nbecause these suits have ``booties'' that are not compatible with the \nfirefighter's boots. Currently, local fire departments also have \nproblems using each other's fire hoses and air bottles for self-\ncontained breathing apparatuses because of inconsistent equipment \nstandards. It is important that new equipment performs properly and is \ncompatible with older equipment.\n  This bill seeks to address the need for new equipment standards by \nestablishing a scientific basis for voluntary consensus standards. It \nwould authorize the U.S. Fire Administrator to work with the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, the Inter-Agency Board for \nEquipment Standardization and Inter-Operability, and other interested \nparties to establish measurement techniques and testing methodologies \nfor new firefighting equipment. These new techniques and methodologies \nwill act as a scientific basis for the development of voluntary \nconsensus standards. This bill would allow the Federal government to \ncooperate with the private sector in developing the basic uniform \nperformance criteria and technical standards to ensure that \neffectiveness and compatibility of these new technologies.\n  Many issues regarding coordination surfaced on September 11. Titan \nSystems Corporation recently issued an after-action report, on behalf \nof the fire department of Arlington County, VA, which highlighted \nproblems between the coordination of Washington D.C., and Arlington \nCounty fire departments. The report also cited the confusion caused by \na large influx of self-dispatched volunteers, and increased risk faced \nby the ``bonafide responders.'' These conclusions are consistent with \nan article by the current U.S. Fire Administrator, R. David Paulison, \nin the June 1993 issue of Fire Chief magazine, where he described being \noverwhelmed by the number of uncoordinated volunteer efforts that \npoured into Florida after Hurricane Andrew. Additionally, many fire \nofficials and the General Accounting Office have highlighted the \nduplicative nature of many Federal programs and the need for better \ncoordination between federal, state, and local officials.\n  The bill also seeks to address these problems by directing the U.S. \nFire Administrator to work with state and local fire service officials \nto establish nationwide and state mutual aid systems for responding to \nnational emergencies. These mutual aid plans would include collection \nof accurate asset and resource information to ensure that local fire \nservices could work together to deploy equipment and personnel \neffectively during an emergency. This legislation would also establish \nthe U.S. Fire Administrator as the primary point of contact within the \nFederal government for state and local firefighting units, in order to \nensure greater Federal coordination and interface with state and local \nofficials in preparing and responding to terrorist attacks, hurricanes, \nearthquakes, or other national emergencies. In addition, the bill would \ndirect the U.S. Fire Administrator to report on the need for a strategy \nfor deploying volunteers, including the use of a national credentialing \nsystem. Currently, there is a system for credentialing volunteers to \nfight wildfires that has proven effective, and the development of a \nsimilar system may prevent some of the confusion that occurred at the \nWorld Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11.\n  Finally, the bill would improve the training of state and local \nfirefighters. The bill would authorize the National Fire Academy to \noffer courses in building collapse rescue; the use of technology in \nresponse to fires caused by\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\nterrorist attacks and other national emergencies; leadership and \nstrategic skills including integrated management systems operations; \ndeployment of new technology for fighting forest and wild fires; \nfighting fires at ports; and other courses related to tactics and \nstrategies for responding to terrorist incidents and other fire \nservices' needs.\n  This bill would also direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to coordinate \nthe National Fire Academy's training programs with the Attorney \nGeneral, Secretary of Health and Human Services and other Federal \nagencies to prevent the duplication in training programs that has been \nidentified by the General Accounting Office.\n  I am pleased to announce that this legislation is supported by the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council; the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute; the National Fire Protection Association; the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs; the International Association of Fire \nFighters; the International Association of Arson Investigators; and the \nInternational Fire Service Training Association. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure passage of this legislation. I am \naware that some issues, including funding of this legislation, need to \nbe addressed.\n  Last year, we were caught unprepared and paid a terrible price as a \nresult. We must ensure that future firefighters are adequately equipped \nand trained, and are working in coordination to respond to any future \nnational emergencies. Every day firefighters rush into burning \nbuildings to save the lives of their fellow Americans. It is our duty \nto adequately equip and protect them.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I introduced legislation designating the \nyear beginning February 1, 2003, as the Year of the Blues and \nrequesting that the President issue a proclamation calling on the \npeople of the United States to observe the ``Year of the Blues'' with \nappropriate ceremonies, activities, and educational programs. I am \njoined by Senators Cochran, Thompson, and Frist and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  It has been said that ``Blues is more than music; Blues is culture. \nBlues is America.'' As a native of Helena, Arkansas, I could not agree \nmore. Growing up in the Delta, I often listened to the blues during the \nfamous ``King Biscuit Time'' show on my hometown station, KFFA radio. \nThe songs I heard often told stories of both celebration and triumph, \nas well as sorrow and struggle.\n  Although its roots are in the tradition of the primitive songs of the \nold Southern sharecroppers, the blues has left an important cultural \nlegacy in our country and has documented African-American history in \nthe last century. As the blues began to transform in style and content \nthroughout the twentieth century, its evolution paralleled the \nmigration of American life from a rural, agricultural society to an \nurban industrialized nation. The blues has also left an indelible \nimpression on other forms of music with its influence heard in jazz, \nrock and roll, rhythm and blues, country, and even classical music. \nDespite these facts, though, many young people today do not understand \nthe rich heritage of the blues or recognize its impact on our nation \nand our world.\n  That is why I am delighted to introduce this resolution and \nparticipate in the Year of the Blues project. Coordinated by The Blues \nFoundation and Experience Music Project, The Year of the Blues is a \nmulti-faceted entertainment, education, and outreach program recently \nformed to both celebrate and create greater awareness for the blues and \nits place in the history and evolution of music and culture, both in \nthe United States and around the world. The program is anchored by high \nprofile events, and beginning next year, it will feature a wide array \nof participants, projects, and components designed to reach a large \naudience, as well as support blues oriented education and outreach \nprograms, such as Blues in the Schools.\n  This project also takes on a special meaning for me because I am a \n``daughter of the Delta,'' and my hometown of Helena has played a large \nrole in the development of the blues. Today, Helena serves as a \ntemporary blues Mecca each October when the three day King Biscuit \nBlues Festival takes place. And as I noted earlier, it is also the site \nof one of the longest running daily music shows, ``King Biscuit Time,'' \nwhich continues to air every weekday at 12:15 pm on KFFA radio from the \nDelta Cultural Center Visitors' Center. As long as I can remember, \n``King Biscuit Time'' has been an integral part of life and culture in \nthe Delta. Debuting in November 1941, ``King Biscuit Time'' originally \nfeatured famous harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson, guitarist Robert \nJunior Lockwood, and the King Biscuit Entertainers. When recently \nnoting the uniqueness of the show, long-time host ``Sunshine'' Sonny \nPayne recalled that many of the songs played on ``King Biscuit Time'' \noriginated during the live broadcasts, and in some cases, words to the \nsongs were known to change day to day. After becoming involved with \nthis project, I recently came across an article ``Pass the biscuits, \ncause it's King Biscuit Time . . . '' written by freelance writer Lex \nGillespie. I believe this article provides an accurate account of the \ndevelopment of blues in the South, and I ask unanimous consent to \nsubmit it for the Record.\n  So as you can see, the blues has been an important part of my life \nand the life of many others. It's a style of music that is, in its \nessence, truly American. But as we move into a new century and embrace \nnew forms and styles of music, we must not allow today's youth to \nforget the legacy of our past. By teaching the blues, promoting the \nblues, and celebrating the blues, we can ensure that the rich culture \nand heritage of our forefathers will always live on. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Commerce Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The tragic events of September 11th \n     certainly underscored the important need for additional \n     training and advanced technologies for our nation's fire and \n     emergency services. They are equal components in our efforts \n     to prepare our nation for future large-scale emergencies that \n     require rapid deployment of local first responders.\n       In the area of technology, we have witnessed an emergence \n     of new technologies designed to improve our level of \n     readiness to future terrorist events and other large-scale \n     disasters. Some of this technology has the potential to \n     address the immediate needs of our nation's public safety \n     agencies; while other requires additional scrutiny and \n     testing before the fire and emergency services can be assured \n     of its intended performance.\n       We extend our appreciation for your interest in this matter \n     and for introducing the Firefighter Research and Coordination \n     Act. We support this legislation as a crucial step towards \n     developing and deploying advanced technologies our nation's \n     first responders need in this period of heightened risk and \n     security.\n       Working as partners, the United States Fire Administration, \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \n     Interagency Board and other interested parties, including the \n     National Fire Protection Association, can develop a \n     scientific basis for the private sector development of \n     standards for new fire fighting technology. Your legislation \n     will not undermine or duplicate the standards-making process \n     that has served the fire service for over a hundred years, \n     but rather strengthen it in areas of new technologies \n     necessitated by the events of September 11th.\n       We also support the other two sections of your legislation \n     calling for coordination of response to national emergencies \n     and for increased training. Our organizations strongly \n     believe that the United States Fire Administrator should \n     serve as the primary point of contact for state and local \n     firefighting units during national emergencies. We have \n     expressed this message repeatedly, including in the Blue \n     Ribbon Panel report presented to then-FEMA Director James Lee \n     Witt in 1998 and most recently in a white paper, titled \n     ``Protecting Our Nation'' that we presented to Congress last \n     year. To ensure the success of this legislation, it is \n     imperative that Congress appropriate additional dollars to \n     carry-out this new role of the Administrator.\n       As the threats to our nation's security intensify, so must \n     the level of training for our nation's first responders. We \n     must expose our firefighters and rescue personnel to advanced \n     levels of training and technologies so they can safely \n     respond to all acts of terrorism and other major disasters. \n     The final section of your legislation will help us attain \n     this goal.\n       We look forward to working with you in advancing this \n     legislation through Congress. Again, we thank you for your \n     continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n         Congressional Fire Services Institute, International \n           Association of Arson Investigators, International \n           Association\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\n           of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire \n           Fighters, International Fire Service Training \n           Association, National Fire Protection Association, \n           National Volunteer Fire Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n\n                                Washington, DC, July 29, 2002.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Volunteer Fire Council \n     (NVFC) is a non-profit membership association representing \n     the more than 800,000 members of America's volunteer fire, \n     EMS, and rescue services. Organized in 1976, the NVFC serves \n     as the voice of America's volunteer fire personnel in over \n     28,000 departments across the country. On behalf of our \n     membership, I would like to express our full support for the \n     Firefighting Research and Coordination Act.\n       This legislation would allow the U.S. Fire Administrator to \n     develop measurement techniques and testing methodologies to \n     evaluate the compatibility of new firefighting technology. In \n     addition, it would require new equipment purchased under the \n     FIRE Grant program to meet or exceed these standards.\n       The bill would also direct the U.S. Fire Administrator to \n     establish a national plan for training and responding to \n     national emergencies and it would designate the Administrator \n     as the contact point for State and local firefighting units \n     in the event of a national emergency. It would also direct \n     the Administrator to work with state and local fire service \n     officials to establish nationwide and state mutual aid \n     systems for dealing with national emergencies that include \n     threat assessment, and means of collecting asset and resource \n     information for deployment.\n       Finally, the bill authorizes the Superintendent of the \n     National Fire Academy to train fire personnel in building \n     collapse rescue, the use of new technology, tactics and \n     strategies for dealing with terrorist incidents, the use of \n     the national plan for training and responding to emergencies, \n     leadership skills, and new technology tactics for fighting \n     forest fires.\n       Once again, the NVFC commends your efforts to train and \n     equip America's volunteer firefighters and we thank you for \n     the leadership role you have taken on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you in the 107th Congress to pass \n     this important piece of legislation. If you have any \n     questions or comments feel free to contact Craig Sharman, \n     NVFC Government Affairs Representative at (202) 887-5700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Philip C. Sittleburg,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for deregulation of consumer broadband \nservices; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Consumer Broadband \nDeregulation Act of 2002. This legislation takes a comprehensive, \nderegulatory, but measured approach to providing more Americans with \nmore broadband choices. By ensuring that the market, not government, \nregulates the deployment of broadband services, the legislation will \npromote investment and innovation in broadband facilities--and \nconsumers will benefit.\n  The bill would create a new title in the Communications Act of 1934 \nthat would ensure that residential broadband services exist in a \nminimally regulated environment. The new section of the Act would also \nmake certain that providers of broadband services are treated in a \nsimilar fashion without regard to the particular mode of providing \nservice. The bill includes provisions that would take the following \nactions:\n\n       Deregulate the retail provision of residential broadband \n     services; dictate a hands-off approach to the deployment of \n     new facilities by telephone companies while maintaining \n     competitors' access to legacy systems; resist government-\n     mandated open access while providing a safety net to ensure \n     consumers enjoy a competitive broadband services market; \n     ensure that local and state barriers to broadband deployment \n     are removed; facilitate deployment of broadband services to \n     rural and unserved communities by creating an information \n     clearing house in the federal government; maximize wireless \n     technology as a platform for broadband services; ensure \n     access to broadband services by people with disabilities; \n     enhance the enforcement tools\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\n     available to the FCC; and put the federal government in the \n     role of stimulator, rather than regulatory, of broadband \n     services.\n\n  In 1996, Congress passed the first major overhaul of \ntelecommunications policy in 62 years. Supporters of the \nTelecommunications Act argued that it would create increased \ncompetition, provide consumers with a variety of new and innovative \nservices at lower prices, and reduce the need for regulation. My \nprincipal objection to the Act was that it fundamentally regulated, not \nderegulated, the telecommunications industry and would lead inevitably \nto prolonged litigation. It has been six years since the passage of the \nAct, but consumers have yet to benefit. Competition denied by excessive \nregulation is costly to consumers.\n  The latest legislative debate in the communications industry has \nfocused on the availability of high-speed Internet access services, \noften called ``broadband.'' Indeed, Federal Communications Commission \nChairman, Michael Powell, has called broadband, ``the central \ncommunications policy objective in America.''\n  There is stark disagreement about the state of affairs of broadband \nservices in the United States. Depending on who is speaking, there is a \nsupply problem, a demand problem, a combination of the two, or no \nproblem at all. All parties agree, however, that Americans and our \nnational economy will benefit greatly from the widespread use of \nbroadband services. Accelerated broadband deployment reportedly could \nbenefit our nation's economy by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  With such tremendous opportunity comes no shortage of ``solutions.'' \nMany want a national industrial policy to drive broadband deployment--\nthey suggest multi-billion dollar central planning efforts aimed to \ndeliver services to consumers regardless of whether those consumers \nwant or need such services. Others have focused on narrow issues \naffecting only a subset of all providers of broadband services.\n  This legislation takes a different approach. It takes a comprehensive \nlook at the proper role of the government with respect to these new \nservices. It reduces government interference with market forces that \nlead to consumer welfare, and looks for ways that government can \nfacilitate, not dictate or control, the development of broadband \ntechnologies.\n  Mr. President, I am a firm believe in free market principles. In \n1995, I introduced a series of amendments during the floor debate on \nthe Telecommunications Act that would have made the bill truly \nderegulatory. As I said at the time, I believe that ``[i]n free \nmarkets, less government usually means more innovation, more \nentrepreneurial opportunities, more competition, and more benefits to \nconsumers.'' Likewise, in 1998, I introduced the Telecommunications \nCompetition Act that would have allowed competition to flourish and \nbrought true deregulation to the telecommunications market. In 1999, I \nintroduced the Internet Regulatory Freedom Act that would have \neliminated certain regulation of telephone companies' deployment of \nbroadband facilities. And in 1999 and 2000, I was a leading advocate in \nthe Senate for the Internet Tax Freedom Act ensuring a moratorium on \ntaxation of the Internet.\n  I stand by the legislation and amendments I previously introduced and \nbelieve that they represented the right approach at the right time. In \nfact, if I had it my way, I would throw out the 1996 Act and start from \nscratch. I am mindful, however, that broadband has been an issue that \nhas polarized policymakers to the point of legislative paralysis. Now \nis the time for a measured approach that focuses on achieving what can \nbe done to improve the deployment of services to all consumers. I \nbelieve that this legislation is such an approach.\n  The bill has multiple components designed to address all aspects of \nbroadband deployment and usage, and also provides adequate safety nets \nin the event that there proves to be a market failure that is harmful \nto consumers.\n  Broadband services can be provided over multiple platforms including \ntelephone, cable, wireless, satellite, and perhaps one day soon, power \nlines, Each of these platforms is regulated differently based on the \nnature of the service the platform was originally designed to provide. \nThis legislation would move us closer to a harmonization of regulatory \nancestry of a particular platform.\n  First, the bill makes clear that the retail provision of high-speed \nInternet service remains unregulated. The Internet's tremendous growth \nis a testament to the exercise of regulatory restraint.\n  Some have suggested a need for government regulation of consumer \nbroadband service quality. They allege that service deficiencies \ninhibit the development of these new offerings. But we must remember \nthat these are new services, and new services will have problems. This \nlegislation allows for these services to mature. If upon maturity, the \nFCC determines that there is a need to protect consumers from service \nquality shortcomings related to the technical provision of service. \nThen the states can enforce uniform requirements. This provides a \nmeasured approach to service quality--a safety net without a \npresumption of regulation.\n  Next, we must clarify that new services offered by varied providers, \nregardless of mode, will not be subject to the micromanagement of \ngovernment regulation. Recognizing that upgrading networks requires \nsubstantial investment not free of risk, this bill begins this process \nby relaxing the obligations on telephone companies that invest in \nfacilities that will bring better broadband services to more consumers. \nNothing in this legislation, however, will undermine competitors' \nefforts to provide services using the telephone companies' legacy \nfacilities. This approach strikes a balance between the interests of \nthose who have invested capital on the promise of government-managed \ncompetition and those who will invest in the future of broadband \nfacilities on the promise of government restraint and market-driven \ncompetition.\n  The bill also grapples with the government-managed wholesale market \nfor consumer broadband services--the so-called ``open access'' debate. \nMr. President, there is perhaps no more difficult issue addressed in \nthis bill.\n  The Internet has thrived because it is an open platform. The presence \nof numerous ISPs in the narrowband market certainly contributed to the \nvitality of this open network, particularly at the inception of the \nInternet. Those providers have depended on access to customers \nguaranteed by FCC rules. As a result, many have suggested the need for \ngovernment-mandated access to customers served over broadband \nconnections. They raise significant concerns about carriers becoming \nscreeners of content, and anti-competitive threats to web site \noperators if consumers do not have a choice of ISP or are limited in \ntheir ability to access particular web sites.\n\n  However tempting it may be to believe that government mandates will \nproduce desired policy outcomes, such intervention too often comes at \nthe price of market inefficiencies, stifled innovation, and increased \nregulatory costs. Moreover, regulators are often slow to respond to \ndynamic industry changes.\n  The bill would rely on market forces to resolve access issues by \nestablishing the general rule that the FCC may not impose open access \nrequirements on any provider--no matter what platform is used to \nprovide the consumer broadband service. Again, the bill takes a \nmeasured approach by creating a safety net for consumers. Today a \nmultitude of ISPs rely on access mandated by the FCC to serve their \ncustomers. The bill would allow the FCC to continue to enforce these \nobligations during a transition period, but would mandate the sunset of \nsuch requirements unless the FCC determines their continued enforcement \nis necessary to preserve competition for consumers.\n  I firmly believe that market forces will guide the development of a \nwholesale market producing sustainable, not government-managed, \ncompetition. The bill is sufficiently flexible to ensure that consumers \nare protected, whole sending a clear signal to those parties willing to \nmake the significant investment necessary to provide broadband services \nthat the government will not lie in wait only to reward their risk-\ntaking with regulation.\n  I note again, however, that this issue raises challenging and complex \npolicy questions. We should ensure the continued open nature of the \nInternet. To\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\nthe extent that market forces prove incapable of preventing \nrestrictions on consumers' use of the Internet or limitations on \ndevices that consumers wish to attach to their Internet connection, we \nmay need to consider a different approach. I look forward to continue \ndebate on these difficult questions.\n  The potential for government interference with market forces is not \nlimited to federal regulation. State and local governments are also \ncapable of obstructing the deployment of broadband. The bill would \naddress this threat by precluding any state or local regulation from \nprohibiting the ability of any entity to provide consumer broadband \nservice. It would also prevent localities from transforming their \nlegitimate interest in managing their rights of way into an imposition \nof additional, revenue-generating financial burdens on broadband \ndeployment.\n  Consumer broadband services should be accessible to all people, \nregardless of where they live, what they do, or how much they earn. We \nmust be realistic, however, about how quickly this can occur. The bill \nrecognizes the important role that government can play as facilitator \nto accelerate universal deployment by using its resources to allow \ncommunities to share information about successful efforts to attract \nbroadband deployment.\n  Government can facilitate broadband deployment and use in other ways \nas well. Wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and mesh networks hold \ntremendous promise for the delivery of consumer broadband services. \nGiven its role in the management of spectrum, the government can impact \nthe use of these technologies. The bill would require the FCC to \nexamine the best role for government in fully exploiting wireless \ntechnologies as a broadband platform for the benefit of consumers.\n  Although government should limit its role to those circumstances \nwhere market failure is demonstrated, Chairman Powell has suggested \nthat the Commission must be prepared to better enforce its existing \nrules by increasing the Commission's ability to impose penalties on \nparties that act in a manner that is anticompetitive. This bill would \ngiven him the tools to do so.\n  Some claim that there is a demand ``problem'' with broadband that is \ncaused by the dearth of available broadband content. Here, too, \ngovernment can play an important role. Certainly content is one of the \nfactors that will drive consumers to subscribe to high-speed Internet \nservices. Given the prominent role that the federal government plays in \nthe lives of most Americans, it can be a source of substantial \nbroadband content. The bill would ensure that the federal government is \nfully exploiting its ability to provide this content.\n  Finally, I recognize that many will look at the bill and ask about \nbroadband services used by businesses. Why treat those services \ndifferently? It is a fair question. I have stated previously that most \nof the advantages of the Telecommunications Act have accrued not to the \naverage consumer who has seen only higher prices for existing services, \nbut to business customers. It is these business customers that many \ncompetitors have attempted to serve using the facilities of the \nincumbent telephone companies. Moreover, whereas the cable platform is \nthe source of robust, facilities-based competition in the consumer \nmarket, it has not developed to a similar extent in the market for \nbusiness customers. Given these factors, and a desire to take a \nmeasured approach, I have generally limited the scope of this bill to \nthe consumer broadband services market. This focus does not reflect my \nlack of support for a similarly deregulatory approach to the business \nmarket. Indeed, I strongly encourage Chairman Powell to be aggressive \nin using the tools at his disposal to remove regulations wherever \nappropriate in the business broadband services market.\n  Mr. President, technological progress has too often been constrained \nby government policies that seek to control it and dictate its course. \nSuch policies have often had the perverse effect of slowing \ntechnological advancements. The growth of the Internet demonstrates \nwhat happens when governments choose to learn from the mistakes of the \npast in order to build a better and richer future for our citizens. The \nchoice we have made is to adapt our mechanisms for governance to \nfacilitate and encourage technological change--to facilitate rather \nthan to control--to monitor rather than dominate. This bill continues \nthat course.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this deregulatory \nlegislation to help advance broadband in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National \nHistorical Park in the State of South Carolina, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I introduced a bill establishing the \nFort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park. These sites are \npresently managed by the National Park Service as the Fort Sumter \nNational Monument. The bill clarifies the boundaries of the park and \nwill more accurately reflect the resources that are recognized, \nprotected, and interpreted at these sites.\n  Both of these forts were pivotal sites in the history of South \nCarolina and the Nation. Fort Moultrie was the centerpiece of the \nBattle of Sullivan's Island on June 28, 1776, just six days prior to \nthe signing of the Declaration of Independence. The valiant defense of \nthe fort by South Carolina militia units resulted in the first decisive \nvictory over British forces in the Revolutionary War. The fort is named \nafter the commander of those units, Colonel William Moultrie.\n  Colonel Moultrie's forces constructed the first fort out of Palmetto \ntrees and sand. The Palmettos were used because of the lack of proper \nbuilding materials. Though initially thought to be inadequate for \nprotection, the Palmettos repelled salvo after salvo from the British \nnaval forces. Such excellent fortifications allowed Colonel Moultrie's \nmilitia to return fire with devastating results.\n  Fort Moultrie also played a part in the events leading up to the \nCivil War. It was the site of the batteries that bombarded Fort Sumter. \nAfter the war, the fort was to remain an integral part of America's \ncoastal defenses until World War II, when it was used to guard the port \nof Charleston against German U-boats. Indeed, it is the only site in \nthe National Park System that preserves the history of the Nation's \ncoastal defense system from 1776 to 1947. Although its days of conflict \nare over, the fort stands as a reminder that the cost of freedom is \nconstant vigilance and stalwart resolve, even in the face of \noverwhelming odds.\n  Fort Sumter is also an important part of American history. The \nbombardment of the fort on April 12, 1861 was the opening engagement of \nthe Civil War. The evacuation of the fort by its commanding officer, \nMajor Robert Anderson, left the fort in Confederate hands until the \nfall of Charleston in February of 1865. Fort Sumter was also an \nintegral part of the Nation's coastal defense system until the end of \nWorld War II. Fort Sumter is a fine example of the historical \nsignificance of National Park Service work.\n  The passage of this bill will allow for the more efficient \nadministration of the two forts. The present arrangement does not \nadequately reflect the boundaries or management authority for the site. \nFor example, Fort Moultrie was acquired by the Secretary of the \nInterior from the State of South Carolina in 1960, but no boundaries \nwere established for the property, nor were any directives given to the \nNational Park Service for administering the site. This bill will \nestablish the boundaries of the site and provide long-overdue \nmanagement authority for the National Park Service.\n  Hopefully, this bill will facilitate more efficient management of the \nforts and allow many more Americans to learn from these living \nmonuments to America's history. The Department of Interior supports \nthis bill and has urged its enactment. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2865\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Brownback):\n  S. 2866. A bill to provide scholarships for District of Columbia \nelementary and secondary students, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues in the House and \nthe Senate, I applaud the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Zelman v. \nSimmons-Harris. The Court found that a publically funded private school \nchoice program was Constitutional and does not violate the \nestablishment clause of the Constitution. The Court's decision finally \nputs to rest the constitutionality arguments which have long been \nraised by those who oppose providing choice to low-income families.\n  Within hours of the Court decision, Congressman Armey introduced H.R. \n5033, the District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of \n2002. I join my House colleague in introducing the companion bill, here \nin the Senate. Specifically, these bills provide scholarships to some \nof the District's poorest students to enable them to select the public \nor private school of their choice from participating schools in the \nDistrict and the surrounding areas. This program, like the Cleveland \nprogram upheld by the Supreme Court, would allow families to choose \nfrom a wide variety of providers, including religious schools.\n  Both bills are nearly identical to the 1997 D.C. Student Scholarship \nAct. Although that bill had passed both houses of the Congress and more \nthan a thousand D.C. families had expressed interest in the scholarship \nprogram, President Clinton vetoed the bill.\n  Why should we extend the option of private schools to poor families? \nBecause, as is true in many urban areas, thousands of students in the \nDistrict of Columbia are in need of high quality educational options. \nSeventy-two percent of D.C. fourth graders tested below basic \nproficiency in reading and seventy-six percent tested below basic \nproficiency in mathematics. This means that three quarters of 4th \ngraders do not possess elementary reading skills and can not complete \nsimple arithmetic problem. Unfortunately, these statistics do not \nimprove dramatically as children grow older. Even in the older grades, \nthe majority of students are found to be struggling with math and \nreading.\n  Tragically, lagging academic performance isn't the only problem \nplaguing many of the public schools in D.C., there is also the issue of \nsafe, secure classrooms. In 1999, nearly one in five D.C high school \nstudents reported, that at some point in the preceding month, they felt \ntoo unsafe to go to school, while nearly one in every seven students \nadmitted to bringing a weapon to school.\n  Although the creation of charter schools in the District has led to \nsome choice for families lucky enough to get a spot for their child, \nthere are simply not enough charter schools to accommodate the growing \nclamor of D.C. parents to obtain a better education for their children. \nInterestingly enough, the lack of space in charter schools is \ncompounded by the City's refusal to free a handful of the 30 surplus \npublic school buildings--buildings, which in some cases, are just \nsitting there abandoned and unused.\n  D.C. parents have witnessed superintendents come and go, and have \nbeen given the promise of education reform and improvements that never \nmaterialized. Yet, all the while their children remain trapped in \nfailing schools. This is unacceptable to them and should be wholly \nunacceptable to my colleagues. The thousands of families clamoring for \nbetter educational opportunities for their children in our nation's \ncapital need an immediate solution.\n  As Frederick Douglass, quoted by Justice Clarence Thomas in the \nrecent Zelman decision, said, ``Education. . . . means emancipation. It \nmeans light and liberty. It means the uplifting of\n\n[[Page S7937]]\n\nthe soul of the man into the glorious light of truth, the light by \nwhich men can only be made free.''\n  Unfortunately, for many families, that freedom remains unobtainable \nwithin D.C.'s current educational system. I encourage my colleagues to \nseriously consider this important bill. We have allowed too many \nstudents to languish in failing schools. Let's provide a way for real \neducation, and doing so, help make the freedom Douglass refers to a \nreality for some of the district's neediest children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2867. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nincrease competition and transparency among packers that purchase \nlivestock from producers; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as everyone knows, I pushed the packer \nban because I want more competition in the marketplace. While I don't \nthink packers should be in the same business as independent livestock \nproducers, it's not the fact that the packers own the livestock that \nbothers me as much as the fact that the packers' livestock competes for \nshackle space and adversely impacts the price independent producers \nreceive.\n  My support of the packer ban is based in the belief that independent \nproducers should have the opportunity to receive a fair price for their \nlivestock. The last few years have led to widespread consolidation and \nconcentration in the packing industry. Add on the trend toward vertical \nintegration among packers and there is no question why independent \nproducers are losing the opportunity to market their own livestock \nduring profitable cycles in the live meat markets.\n  The past CEO of IBP in 1994 explained that the reason packers own \nlivestock is that when the price is high the packers use their own \nlivestock for the lines and when the price is low the packers buy \nlivestock. This means that independent producers are most likely being \nlimited from participating in the most profitable ranges of the live \nmarket. This is not good for the survival of the independent producer.\n  My new legislative concept would guarantee that independent producers \nhave a share in the marketplace while assisting the mandatory price \nreporting system. The proposal would require that 25 percent of a \npacker's daily kill comes from the spot market. By requiring a 25 \npercent spot market purchase daily, the mandatory price reporting \nsystem which has been criticized due to reporting and accuracy problems \nwould have consistent, reliable numbers being purchased from the spot \nmarket, improving the accuracy and transparency of daily prices. In \naddition, independent livestock producers would be guaranteed a \ncompetitive position due to the packers need to fill the daily 25 \npercent spot/cash market requirement.\n  This isn't the packer ban. The intent of this piece is to improve \nprice transparency and hopefully the accuracy of the daily mandatory \nprice reporting data. I feel strongly that packers should NOT be able \nto own or feed livestock, but this approach is not intended to address \nmy concern with packer ownership.\n  The packs required to comply would be the same packs required to \nreport under the mandatory price reporting system. Those are packs that \nkill either 125,000 head of cattle, 100,000 head of hogs, or 75,000 \nlambs annually, over a 5 year average.\n  Packers are arguing that this will hurt their ability to offer \ncontracts to producers, but the fact of the matter is that the majority \nof livestock contracts pay out on a calculation incorporating mandatory \nprice reporting data. If the mandatory price reporting data is not \naccurate, or open to possible manipulation because of low numbers on \nthe spot market, contracts are not beneficial tools for producers to \nmanage their risk. This legislative proposal will hopefully give \nconfidence to independent livestock producers by improving the accuracy \nand viability of the mandatory price reporting system and secure fair \nprices for contracts based on that data.\n  It's just common sense, when there aren't a lot of cattle and pigs \nbeing purchased on the cash market, it's easier for the mandatory price \nreporting data to be inaccurate or manipulated. The majority of \nlivestock production contracts are based on that data, so if that \ninformation is wrong the contract producers suffer. That's why the Iowa \nPork Producers, Iowa Cattlemen, Iowa Farm Bureau, R-CALF, the \nOrganization for Competitive Markets, and the Center for Rural Affairs \nhave all endorsed this proposal.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will guarantee independent livestock \nproducers market access and a fair price. It will accomplish these \ngoals by making it more difficult for the mandatory price reporting \nsystem to be manipulated because of low numbers being reported by the \npacks.\n  I ask consent the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2867\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nresearch and demonstration program concerning control of salt cedar and \nother nonnative phreatophytes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is of paramount importance to the State of New Mexico. \nSpecifically, this bill will address the mounting pressures brought on \nby the growing demands, on all fronts, of a diminishing water supply.\n  As you may know the water situation in the west can be described at \nthis time, as difficult at best. Annual snow packs were abnormally low \nthis year causing many areas in the west to be plagued by severe \ndrought conditions.\n  The seriousness of the water situation in New Mexico becomes more \nacute every single day. The chance of this drought effecting every New \nMexican in some way is substantial. Wells are running dry, farmers are \nbeing forced to sell livestock, many of our cities are in various \nstages of conservation and many, many acres have been charred by \ncatastrophic wildfires.\n  The drought conditions also have other consequences. For example, the \nlack of stream flow makes it very difficult for New Mexico to meet its \ncompact delivery obligations to the state of Texas.\n  The bill that I am introducing today deals more specifically with the \nissue of in stream water flows. To compound the drought situation, New \nMexico is home to a vast amount of Salt Cedar. Salt Cedar is a water-\nthirsty non-native tree that continually strips massive amounts of \nwater out of New Mexico's two predominant water supplies--the Pecos and \nthe Rio Grande rivers.\n  Estimates show that one mature salt cedar tree can consume as much as \n200 gallons of water per day. In addition to the excessive water \nconsumption, salt cedars increase fire and flood frequency, increase \nriver channelization, decrease water flow and increase water and soil \nsalinity along the river. Studies indicate that eradication of the salt \ncedars could increase river flows. Increasing river flows could help \nalleviate mounting pressure to meet compact delivery obligations--\nespecially on the Pecos.\n  This bill that I am introducing today would authorize the Army Corps \nof Engineers to establish a research and demonstration program to help \nwith the eradication of this non-native species. In addition to \nprojects along the Pecos and the Rio Grande, the bill allows other \nstates with similar problems, including Texas, Colorado, Utah and \nArizona to develop and participate in similar projects as well.\n  The drought and the mounting legal requirements on both the Pecos and \nRio Grande rivers are forcing us toward a severe water crisis. Solving \nsuch water problems has become one of my top priorities for the state.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and my statement be \nprinted in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2868\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SALT CEDAR CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) States are having increasing difficulty meeting their \n     obligations under interstate compacts to deliver water;\n       (2) it is in the best interest of States to minimize the \n     impact of and eradicate invasive species that extort water in \n     the Rio Grande watershed, the Pecos River, and other bodies \n     of water in the Southwest, such as the salt cedar, a noxious \n     and nonnative plant that can use 200 gallons of water a day; \n     and\n       (3) as drought conditions and legal requirements relating \n     to water supply accelerate water shortages, innovative \n     approaches are needed to address the increasing demand for a \n     diminishing water supply.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Control method.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``control method'' means a method \n     of controlling salt cedar (Tamarix) or any other nonnative \n     phreatophyte.\n       (B) Inclusions.--The term ``control method'' includes the \n     use of herbicides, mechanical means, and biocontrols such as \n     goats and insects.\n       (2) Demonstration project.--The term ``demonstration \n     project'' means a demonstration project carried out under \n     this section.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers.\n       (c) Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date on \n     which funds are made available to carry out this section, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       (A) complete a program of research, including a review of \n     past and ongoing research, concerning a control method for \n     use in--\n       (i) the Rio Grande watershed in the State of New Mexico;\n       (ii) the Pecos River in the State of New Mexico;

A bill to facilitate the ability of certain spectrum auction \nwinners to pursue alternative measures required in the public interest \nto meet the needs of wireless telecommunications consumers; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation which I hope \nwill create an equitable solution to the dilemma facing many wireless \ncompanies in America. Unfortunately, due to the uncertain legal status \nof licenses related to that FCC Auction No. 35, several companies have \ncontingent liabilities in the millions or billions of dollars. These \ncontingent liabilities are damaging the companies' ability to acquire \nadditional spectrum to meet the urgent needs of wireless consumers and \nto roll out new and innovative services to consumers. The affected \nproviders are the successful bidders for wireless spectrum that the \nFederal Communications Commission auctioned in Auction No. 35. Some of \nthe spectrum had previously been licensed to companies, including \nNextWave Personal Communications Inc., whose bankruptcy filings and \nsubsequent failure to pay amounts due to the FCC for their licenses led \nto the cancellation of those licenses.\n  The status of NextWave's licenses has been the subject of extended \nlitigation in the Bankruptcy Court, the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. In June 2001, after the FCC had conducted Auction No. 35, the \nD.C. Circuit held that ``the Commission violated the provision of the \nBankruptcy Code that prohibits governmental entities from revoking \ndebtors' licenses solely for failure to pay debts dischargeable in \nbankruptcy,'' effectively nullifying the FCC ability to deliver the \nlicenses to winning bidder. In August 2001, after the issuance of that \ncourt's mandate, the FCC restored the NextWave licenses to active \nstatus. More recently, the Supreme Court granted the FCC's petition for \na writ of certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit's judgment. The Supreme \nCourt will not hear arguments in the case until the fall of 2002 and is \nunlikely to announce a decision until the spring of 2003. If the Court \nreverses the D.C. Circuit's decision, there will be further litigation \non remand in the D.C. Circuit to resolve issues that the court did not \nreach in its first decision. The result is that there is not likely to \nbe a final resolution of the status of the NextWave licenses and the \nFCC therefore will not be in a position to deliver licenses to the \nwinners of Auction No. 35--until three or more years from the time the \nauction was concluded. Although the FCC recently returned most of the \ndown payment funds previously deposited by successful bidders, it \ncontinues to hold without interest substantial sums equal to three \npercent of the total amount of the winning bids. It apparently intends \nto hold those sums indefinitely. Despite the lengthy delay in \ndelivering the licenses, moreover, the FCC takes the position that the \nsuccessful bidders remain obligated, on a mere 10 days' notice, to pay \nthe full amount of their successful bids if and when the FCC at some \nunknown future date establishes its right to deliver those licenses.\n  The situation is grossly unfair to those who bid on these licenses in \ngood faith. Companies calibrate their bids on the understanding, \nimplicit in any commercial arrangement, that delivery of the licenses \nwill occur in a reasonable time following the auction. That expectation \nis especially crucial in the context of spectrum licenses, given the \nrecent volatility we have seen in market prices for spectrum. It is \nparticularly burdensome to such companies for the FCC to hold even a \nportion of their enormous down payments without paying interest for \nsuch extended periods. Even more troubling, the companies' contingent \nobligation to pay on very short notice the remaining $16 billion they \nbid for the licenses at issue adversely affects their capacity to serve \nthe needs of their customers. Such large contingent liabilities impede \nthe companies' ability to take interim steps, such as building out its \nnetwork further or leasing spectrum from others, that may be urgently \nneeded to improve service for its customers. The FCC's failure to \nrespond appropriately to alleviate these serious burdens disserves the \npublic interest.\n  This bill addresses these problems in two ways. It requires the FCC \npromptly to refund to the winning bidders the full remaining amount of \ntheir deposits and down payments. In addition, it gives each winning \nbidder an opportunity to elect, within 15 days after enactment, to \nrelinquish its rights and to be relieved of all further obligations \nunder Auction No. 35. Those who choose to retain their rights and \nobligations under Auction No. 35 will nonetheless be entitled to the \nreturn of their deposits and down payments in the interim. If and when \nthe FCC is in a position to deliver the licenses at issue to those who \nremain obligated, they will be required to pay the full amount of their \nbid in accordance with the FCC's existing regulations. Those who elect \nto terminate their rights and obligations under Auction No. 35 will be \nfree to pursue other opportunities to acquire spectrum and serve \nconsumers.\n  I want to make this next point especially clear, nothing in the \nbill's provisions would affect the FCC's legal position in the Supreme \nCourt with respect to the validity of its original cancellation of the \nNextWave licenses. If the FCC prevails in the Supreme Court, it will \nreestablish its right to allocate the spectrum at issue. It may then \ngrant licenses to Auction No. 35 winning bidders who have declined to \nrelinquish their rights under the bill. It will also be free to conduct \na re-auction of any spectrum won by Auction No. 35 bidders who have in \nthe meantime elected to relinquish their auction rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2870. A bill to amend titles 10 and 14, United States Code, to \nprovide for the use of gold in the metal content of the Medal of Honor; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nbring greater honor and prestige to our most valiant veterans. This \nlegislation, the Congressional Medal of Honor Act, will require the use \nof 90 percent gold in the metal content of the Medal of Honor.\n  You may be surprised to learn that while foreign dignitaries, famous \nsingers, and other civilians receive an approximately $30,000 medal--\nthe Congressional Gold Medal, our most valued veterans receive a $30 \nmedal. The cost difference lies in that the Medal of Honor consists \nprimarily of brass plated slightly with gold. These American heroes \ndeserve better and it's certainly the least we can do to honor their \nservice.\n  The cost of the proposal would be minimal. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the total cost of the bill would be $2 \nmillion for a five-year period during which the new medals would be \ndesigned, produced and stockpiled. Our legislation would allow the \napproximately less than 1,000 living recipients awarded the Medal, or \ntheir next of kin, to receive a replacement Medal.\n  Amelia Earhart once said that ``Courage is the price that life exacts \nfor granting peace.'' In helping us win our peace, we should truly \nhonor our bravest heroes by giving them the Medals they deserve.\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 2872. A bill to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement \nof construction of a hydroelectric project in the State of Illinois; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to reinstate a \nlicense surrendered to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that \nauthorized the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in Carlyle, \nIllinois. In order to facilitate the construction of the hydroelectric \npower plant, the bill also contains a provision that extends the \ndeadline for beginning construction of the plant.\n  Carlyle, IL, is a small community of 3,406 people in Southwestern \nIllinois, fifty miles east of St. Louis. Carlyle is situated on the \nKaskaskia River at the southern tip of Carlyle Lake, which was formed \nin 1967 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of \na dam on the river. Carlyle Lake is 15 miles long and 3\\1/2\\ miles \nwide--the largest man-made lake in Illinois.\n  When the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the dam, it failed to \nbuild a hydroelectric power plant to capitalize on the energy available \nfrom water flowing through the dam. A hydroelectric power facility in \nCarlyle would produce 4,000 kilowatts of power and provide a renewable \nenergy source for surrounding communities. Furthermore, the \nenvironmental impact of adding a hydroelectric facility would be \nminimal, and such a facility, located at a site near the existing dam, \nwould not produce harmful emissions.\n  In 1997, Southwestern Electric Cooperative obtained a license from \nthe FERC to begin work on a hydroelectric project in Carlyle. In 2000, \nSouthwestern Electric Cooperative surrendered their license because \nthey were unable to begin the project in the required time period. The \nCity of Carlyle is interested in constructing the hydroelectric power \nplant and is seeking to obtain Southwestern Electric Cooperative's \nlicense.\n  The bill I am introducing today is required for the construction of \nthe facility. Legislation is necessary to authorize FERC to reinstate \nSouthwestern Electric Cooperative's surrendered license. Because there \nis not enough time remaining on the license to conduct studies, produce \na design for the facility, and begin construction of the project, the \nbill includes a provision that allows FERC to extend the applicable \ndeadline.\n  This legislation is an easy and environmentally safe approach to \nmeeting the energy needs of Southwestern Illinois. Please join me in \nsupporting this measure to provide a clean alternative energy source \nfor this part of the Midwest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I introduced an extremely important \nbill, the Pension Guarantee Improvement Act of 2002. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in pressing for its swift consideration and \npassage.\n  For over a quarter of a century, the federal government has run an \ninsurance system for private ``defined benefit'' pension plans. The \nagency that administers this system, the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation, PBGC, has worked hard to live up to its statutory \nobligations to protect benefits in the event that the plan sponsor goes \nbankrupt and is forced to terminate the plan.\n  In my home state of Minnesota, I have worked closely with former LTV \nworkers whose plans have been taken over to facilitate a dialogue with \nthe PBGC. I am very grateful to Joe Grant, Steven Kandarian, Michael \nRae and all the other PBGC staff who have provided invaluable \nassistance to my office and my constituents over the past few moths. I \nhave been greatly impressed with their responsiveness, dedication and \nhard work.\n  Yet the experiences of the LTV workers in Minnesota--and other \nmanufacturing workers around the country I suspect--have exposed some \nserious though limited gaps in the guarantees that PBGC is permitted to \nprovide.\n  These guarantees are predicated on a certain set of assumptions \nregarding retirement that unfortunately do not hold true for all \nworkers. For example, the vast majority of all workers that retire at \nage 65 having earned a defined benefit pension are guaranteed their \nfull earned pension, regardless of whether or not the sponsoring \ncompany is still in business. In most white-collar jobs this \narrangement works well; the nature of the employment permits most \nemployees to continue in their jobs through age 65 and the terms of \ntheir private pension plans are generally set up for retirement at that \nage.\n  In labor-intensive industries such as steel and other manufacturing \nsectors, however,workers have never been expected to endure as many \nyears of active employment as their white-collar counterparts. Again, \nthe expectations of workers as they enter these industries are well-\nknown. Employees are generally promised a secure retirement in exchange \nfor their 25-30 years of service and they work for decades under the \nassumption that that promise will be kept.\n  What has happened to many of the former LTV employees in Minnesota is \ntheir hard-earned benefits have been unexpectedly--and in a few cases, \ndramatically--reduced as a result of their company being forced into \nbankruptcy. This is because their plan was taken over by the PBGC which \nis not allowed to provide as comprehensive a guarantee to these workers \nas they can offer to their white-collar counterparts.\n  The shorter working lives of steelworkers and others who labor in our \nrapidly-shrinking manufacturing sector effectively means that they will \noften not receive the full measure of their earned benefit if their \ncompany happens to go bankrupt before they reach age 65. The reductions \nin benefits that many of these workers suffer occur regardless of how \nhard they worked, how productive an employee they were--anything that \nthey have any control over.\n  These losses are inflicted on these workers because they labored in \nthe manufacturing sector and because they happened to be employed by a \ncompany that was forced into bankruptcy. There is no other reason. \nGiven that we insure defined benefit plans, I see no reason why we \nshould have one standard of coverage for white-collar workers and \nanother, lesser guarantee for manufacturing workers. If a worker has \nfully earned the pension that they were originally promised I see no \nreason why we should pull the rug out from under them just because \ntheir company happens to go under.\n  Mr. President, we must strengthen the guarantees that the PBGC is \nrequired to provide in order to protect this small subset of all \nworkers from unfair and unreasonable cuts in their earned benefits--\ncuts that all too often come at a tremendously difficult time in their \nlives when health or geographic location may prevent them from finding \nalternative employment. In my state of Minnesota, I saw first-hand how \nLTV workers in their 50s, who had qualified for a full retirement \nbenefit under the terms of their original plan, had to struggle to \nsurvive the loss of their health insurance, and\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nsome substantial reduction in their earned benefits as a result of PBGC \ntakeover of their plan.\n  This legislation is designed to provide some relief to those workers \nwho often suffer unexpected benefit reductions as a result of a PBGC \ntakeover. Let me be quite clear that the affected workers represent \nonly a very small fraction of all those covered by PBGC. The CBO has \nissued a preliminary score for this proposal that puts its cost at $110 \nmillion over the next ten years. Colleagues, this very modest proposal \nwould allow PBGC to provide guarantees to these workers that more \nclosely reflect what they earned under the terms of the plan that they \nhad signed onto. It would help bring the level of guarantees provided \nto manufacturing-sector workers closer to that provided to their white-\ncollar counterparts.\n  This bill involves three changes to the rules that determine how much \nof an earned benefit is guaranteed by the PBGC.\n  First, it would increase the maximum benefit guarantee level for \nsingle employer plans by adjusting an indexed formula that would boost \nthe monthly maximum payable for retired workers of all ages by some 13 \npercent. This would translate into an increase of approximately $150-\n200/month for retirees over the age of 50 whose benefits are often \nreduced by the current maximum payable limitation.\n  Second, this bill directs the PBGC to cover supplemental benefits \nsuch as social security ``bridge'' payments as basic pension benefits. \nAgain, this benefit is often earned by workers in steel and other \nlabor-intensive industries and is specially provided to tide them over \nuntil they become eligible for Social Security.\n  Finally, this proposal would index the $20/year option on the 5-yr \nphase-in rule for recent benefit increases--which would put it at $95 \nusing the same 4.773 social security index multiplier as is used to \ncalculate the maximum payable. The current $20/year figure was part of \nthe original 1975 ERISA statute and was intended to represent normal \nbenefit increase. It has become essentially meaningless because it has \nnever been increased. This would allow workers who received a \n``normal'' benefit increase within the last 5 years to receive the \nentire raise instead of a percentage of it.\n  Mr. President, defined benefits plans and the manufacturing sector \nhave both suffered serious declines in recent years. At the very least \nwe owe it to these hard-working men and women to improve their access \nto meaningful pensions guarantees should their company be forced out of \nbusiness. This bill would make a huge difference to people who need it \nthe most--and do so without in any way threatening the solvency of the \nPBGC. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this modest yet \nmeaningful relief for these workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2876. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to promote secure and healthy families under the temporary \nassistance to needy families program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President since the 1996 welfare reform, our nation \nhas experienced one of the longest economic booms in history, but \nfamilies are still struggling to make ends meet, and children are still \nliving in poverty.\n  Now, with the recession, working families are facing even more \nbarriers on the path toward self-sufficiency, and states are struggling \nto maintain their existing programs. In my own state of Washington, \nwe've seen the results of the recession: good jobs are more difficult \nto find, welfare rolls are up, and state budget cuts have taken a chunk \nout of childcare and other critical supports for our most disadvantaged \nfamilies. It is with this in mind that I introduce Senate bill S. 2876, \nthe Secure and Healthy Families Act of 2002.\n  The Secure and Healthy Families Act will help build on the successes \nof welfare reform. This bill gives us an important opportunity to \nreaffirm that we value America's families and that we will protect our \nchildren. This bill takes what we know from our own experiences as \nparents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents and what research has proven \nto be effective to help us move toward the goal of building healthy \nfamilies. It does not impose inflexible top-down strategies. Instead, \nit allows states to support work and engage families on assistance. It \nwill help build secure and healthy families in a number of ways.\n  First, this legislation will create the Promoting Healthy Families \nFund that enables the Secretary of HHS to fund state activities to \npromote and support secure families. For example, the fund would \nsupport state and local efforts to provide family counseling, income \nenhancement programs for working poor families--like the successful \nMinnesota Family Investment Program, or teen pregnancy prevention \nprograms that help young people avoid the poverty that often comes with \nthese unplanned pregnancies.\n  Second, this act will ensure states recognize that secure and healthy \nfamilies come in all shapes and sizes. The federal government has long \nled the way in opposing discrimination, and this bill will continue \nthat critical role.\n  Next, this bill puts in place several provisions to help the parents \nbuild a better future for themselves and their children. The bill \nencourages teen parents to remain in school by not counting the time \nthat they are in school against their five-year lifetime limit. Under \nthis legislation, a teen mother would also be given the chance to get \non her feet, get settled in school, and find a safe place for her and \nher baby to live without losing assistance.\n  Mr. President, in families where children are chronically ill or \ndisabled, parents are confronted with special challenges. Most cannot \nfind appropriate affordable care, and cannot leave sick and vulnerable \nchildren alone. They run from the doctor's office and emergency rooms--\ntrying to keep their jobs while dealing with the sudden and frequent \nlife-threatening health problems that these children face. This bill \nwould offer support for these families by recognizing that full time \ncare of a chronically sick or disabled child is hard work, and by \ngiving parents the opportunity to meet their children's special needs.\n  The bill also strengthens support for those families who are victims \nof domestic or sexual violence. We know that as many as 70 percent of \nwelfare recipients are or have been victims of domestic violence. This \nbills sends a clear message to states that they must protect there \nvulnerable families in several ways including: having comprehensive \nstandards and procedures to address domestic and sexual violence, \ntraining caseworkers so that they are sensitive to the unique needs of \nvictims of domestic violence, and informing survivors of domestic and \nfamily violence of the existing protections to ensure their privacy and \nsafety.\n  Most states are approaching domestic violence prevention and \nassistance in interesting and innovative ways. The bill will provide \nfunding for a national study of best practices on the ways states are \naddressing domestic violence. In addition, states will be able to \ncontinue to provide services to domestic and family violence survivors \nwithout worrying about federal exemption caps. The bill will allow \nthese survivors to receive the services they need when they are making \nthe transition out of dangerous situations to safe and successful \nlives.\n  Finally, the bill would support relatives who take in underprivileged \nchildren. A growing number of children, 2.16 million in 2000, are being \ncared for solely by grandparents and other relatives. Although some of \nthese children are involved with the child welfare system, many more of \nthese children are able to remain outside of the system because their \nrelatives are able to care for them.\n  Last week a young man named Eustaquito Beltran came to my office to \ntalk to me about the importance of supporting foster children. He told \nme that he had lived in more than one hundred homes since he was a \ntoddler. The results for children like him are heartbreaking. Fewer \nthan half graduate from high school, and many become homeless after \nthey turn 18.\n  Prior to being abandoned by or taken away from their parents, most of \nthese children live in poverty with families devastated by substance \nabuse, mental health disorders, poor education, unemployment, violence, \nlack of parenting skills, and involvement with the criminal justice \nsystem. A 1990 study\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nfound that the incidence of emotional, behavioral, and developmental \nproblems among children in foster care was three to six times greater \nthan the incidence of these problems among children not in care.\n  If care by a relative can help children like Eustaquito avoid the \nfoster care system, then we should be grateful for the assistance that \nrelative is offering. Instead, relatives who care for children with \nsupport form TANF are often trapped in a Catch-22. If a grandmother \ntakes in her grandchild, but needs support herself and receives TANF \nassistance, federal time limits and work requirements apply. It doesn't \nmake sense to require this grandmother, who may have worked for years \nand finally reached retirement, to return to work in order to help her \ngrandchild stay out of the foster care system.\n  My bill would exempt kinship care families from federal time limits \nand work requirements to help ensure ongoing support for these \nchildren. This will allow relative caregivers to provide the additional \nsupervision and care that children who have been abused and neglected \noften need.\n  Mr. President, the strength of our nation lies in how we care for our \nmost vulnerable. Coming together to support victims of domestic \nviolence, children abandoned by their parents, and teen mothers can \nmake it clear that welfare reform is about helping all Americans \nsucceed, not about punishing the needy.\n  The Senate must focus our crucial federal welfare dollars on programs \nand practices that create a bridge to self-sufficiency and productivity \nwhile keeping families secure and healthy. I am committed to \nstrengthening the safety net our families depend on so that parents \nhave the skills they need to find work and succeed once they are in the \nworkplace. This bill will ensure that children grow up in secure and \nhealthy families. It is a critical step in our work to leave no child \nbehind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2877. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nthat stock options of public companies are granted to rank and file \nemployees as well as officers and directors, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of stock \noption reforms, and propose legislation that will make stock options, a \npowerful tool in the democratization of capitalism, even more effective \nas an incentive to spur innovation and create wealth.\n  The waves of corporate abuse that our economy has suffered over the \npast ten months have been devastating to so many employees, \nshareholders, and families across America. The investments that people \nhave counted upon to safeguard their retirement, send their children to \ncollege, buy a home, start a business-trillions of dollars have gone up \nin smoke, turned to ash while, for a few executives, those misfortunes \nturned to cash.\n  That's maddening, as a result, the most productive economy in the \nworld-in the history of the world-has been scarred. The American \ncorporation, a great institution of democratic capitalism in which the \npublic owns the company, has been stained. Potentially empowering \ninnovations that enable individual investment, like the 401-k account, \nhave been skewered.\n  Today, I want to talk about another fundamentally decent idea that \nhas been dragged into the quicksand of corporate corruption: stock \noptions. We've discovered over the last ten months that too many \ncompanies and executives have been misusing and abusing them. In far \ntoo many cases, options have been turned into mere feed in the \ncorporate trough by the greed of corporate executives.\n  Stock options are a hammer. They can be used well or used poorly. \nWe've seen corporate executives use this hammer to weaken the \nfoundations of their companies, build rickety and top-heavy structures \nready to collapse, and build themselves nice, secure shelters from the \ndamage. That's unconscionable.\n  The bill I propose today will correct this abuse by ensuring that the \ntool of stock options is put in the hands of more and more employees so \nit can be used as it was initially intended-to construct wealth, to \nbuild fortunes, to strengthen companies, and to incentivize the long-\nterm soundness and stability of a company.\n  The way to fix this problem is not, as some have suggested, to \nrequire stock option expensing at the time an option is granted. That \nwould, in fact, make the problem worse. It would disincentive the \ndissemination of options in the first place-and in the end, those at \nthe top of the corporate food chain will still take care of themselves. \nNo, the way to fix this problem is to ensure that stock options are \nmore broadly shared by more and more employees of American \ncorporations-that they truly are the democratizing tool that they can \nbe.\n  Our challenge is to fix the flaws that have been exposed without \nhurting stock options themselves. In the name of addressing this \nserious crisis in corporate accountability, let's not make the mistake \nof pushing through unwise reforms that threaten to further confuse \ninvestors and endanger the engines of entrepreneurship that make \nAmerica's economy, for all its faults and flaws, the envy of history \nand of the world. It would be a terrible shame if we threw out the \nstock options baby with the corporate corruption bathwater.\n  That's the spirit of my legislation: to mend, not end, stock option \ndistribution.\n  My legislation focuses on three critical reform issues regarding \nstock options, distribution, shareholder approval, and disposition by \nsenior executives. I believe that my proposed reforms will ensure that \nstock options serve their highest purpose: that we give shareholders \nmore control to ensure that stock options are issued consistent with \ntheir interests, while we do away with the perverse incentive for \nsenior executives to cash in and bail out of their companies.\n  The bill does not address the elephant in the room-the issue of \nwhether or not companies should be required to account for stock \noptions. That is because I remain firmly convinced that would fail to \naddress the fundamental problems we face-and would, in fact, create new \nproblems with which we will have to grapple.\n  If the Congress were to require expensing of stock options, we can be \nsure that the fat cats would still get their milk. Top corporate \nexecutives would still take care of themselves. But the middle-income \nemployees, who represent the vast majority of Americans who benefit \nfrom stock options, would have no option but to accept no options.\n  Requiring the expensing of options will not give shareholders a \ngreater say in approving stock option plans or ensuring that they are \nfocused on effective incentives for growth. The reforms I propose today \nwill. And requiring the expensing of options will not address the \nincentives that executives may have to manipulate earnings immediately \nprior to selling shares acquired through a stock option plan. The \nreforms I propose today will.\n  The reform issues addressed in my bill are ones that are well suited \nfor Congress because they are policy matters, not accounting rules.\n  I have little doubt that FASB will again take up the stock option \naccounting issue. When it does, I think it will find, again, that \nexpensing options at the time they are granted is not possible. This is \nthe unsung issue with stock option accounting.\n  There is no doubt that stock options are a form of compensation, but \nthis happens when they are exercised, not when they are granted. \nOptions that go ``underwater'', when the stock price drops, never \nbecome compensation and the options are worthless. We only know if \noptions are compensation when they are exercised and only then do we \nknow how much compensation has been received.\n  This is the issue I have raised about expensing, not whether they are \ncompensation, but when they become compensation and when the amount of \nthe compensation can be measured. I said in 1994 and I say it again \ntoday, I do not believe at the time an option is granted that we know \nif or how much it is worth as compensation.\n  I doubt if the champions of expensing can point to a single case \nwhere a company's disclosure of stock option costs at grant, now \nincluded in footnotes to the company's P statement, proved\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nto be accurate. The Enron footnotes estimated stock option costs that \nproved to wildly inflated and inaccurate because they did not \nanticipate the decline in Enron's stock price. In this bear market, I \nwould think that every company's footnote estimates have proven to be \nwildly inflated and inaccurate.\n  I doubt if the champions of expensing can cite a single stock broker \nor analyst who uses the Black-Scholes estimating method to pick stocks.\n  I do not believe that these champions would be willing to put their \nown money behind a stock based on the Black-Scholes estimates. Anyone \nwho finds a reliable way to estimate the price of a stock three to ten \nyears in the future is bound to be rich, and will certainly win the \nNobel Prize for Economics.\n  These are issues that FASB will review and it is not an appropriate \nsubject for this or any other legislation. This legislation focuses on \nreforms that address abuses. Expensing of stock options, whatever its \nmerits as an accounting standard, do not address any of the key reform \nissues addressed in this legislation. Expensing is quite irrelevant to \nthese reforms; it's a sideshow and a diversion. It's a false surrogate \nfor reform.\n  I have long championed broad-based stock option plans and I believe \nthey are a great spur to productivity and competitiveness. A study by \ntwo Rutgers University professors found that over a three-year post-\nplan period, companies that grant options to most or all employees show \na 17 percent improvement in productivity over what would have been \nexpected had they not set up such a plan. The return on assets of these \ncompanies went up 2.3 percent per year over what would have been \nexpected, while their stock performance is either better or about the \nsame than comparable companies, depending on how performance is \nmeasured. These were companies that granted options broadly, which \nunfortunately is still not the norm.\n  On June 29, 1993, I introduced the ``Equity Expansion Act,'' S. 1175, \nto provide a tax incentive in favor broad-based stock option plans, \noptions I referred to as ``performance'' stock options. The incentives \nwere available only for options where ``immediately after the grant of \nthe option, employees who are not highly compensated employees hold * * \n* share options which permit the acquisition of at least 50 percent of \nall shares which may be acquired * * *:\n  In my statement about this bill I stated that the bill could ``spur \nthe competitiveness and profitability of American companies by \nexpanding the number of employees in all industries who will have the \nopportunity to receive part of their remuneration in the form of stock \noptions.'' I argued that that bill was appealing because it ``America's \nbest companies learned long ago that the key to success in the world's \ntoughest markets is a dedicated work force that shares the common goals \nfor their company.'' The bill required shareholders to approve the \nplans and the employees were required to hold the shares for at least \ntwo years. I noted that ``much of the criticism of stock options \nrevolves around horror stories about a small number of extravagantly \ncompensated executives.''\n  My 1993 bill provided incentives for broad-based plans. It proposed a \nspecial capital gains incentive for the stock option shares. At the \ntime, there was no capital gains preference; it had been repealed in \n1986. Since then, of course, the capital gains preference has been \nrestored. At that time, and at all times since then, companies can \ndeduct the ``spread'' on an option at the time the option is exercised. \nThe ``spread'' is the difference between the grant price and the market \nprice, the discount.\n  There is a trend in favor of broad-based stock option plans. The \nNational Center for Employee Ownership estimates that 7-10 million \nemployees now hold stock options. The number of people who hold options \nhas grown dramatically since 1992, when only about one million people \nheld options. Stock options are a way to provide productivity \nincentives to many middle-class employees.\n  Despite the trend in favor of broad-based stock option plans, I am \nnot satisfied with the status quo. In companies with broad-based plans, \nNCOE finds that 34 percent of the options go to senior management, the \naverage grant value for senior executives was more than $500,000 \ncompared to only about $8,000 for hourly employees and $35,000 for \ntechnical employees. In non-broad-based plans, of course, the \ndistribution is even more skewed to senior management. The NCOE \nestimates that ``While the growth of broad-based options has been an \nimportant economic trend, our data nonetheless indicate that even in \nplans that do share options widely, executives still get an average of \n65 percent to 70 percent of the total options granted.''\n  Similarly, estimates by the National Association Stock Plan \nProfessionals finds in a 2000 survey that 26 percent of the plans only \ngrant options to senior and middle management, and 43 percent to all \nemployees. For high tech companies, the percentage of these top-heavy \nplans is only 4 percent, and 73 percent of the plans provide options to \nall of the employees. For non-high tech companies, the percentage of \nthese top-heavy plans is 36 percent, and 29 percent of the plans \nprovide options to all of the employees. So the prevalence of top-heavy \nplans seems to be concentrated in the non-high tech companies.\n  If options are justified as incentives for company performance and as \na way of giving employees a stake in the company performance, which I \nbelieve they are, then this is not fair and not appropriate. This is \nwhy we need to go beyond enacting an incentive in favor of broad-based \nplans. As the NCOE has stated, ``Options for ordinary employees can \nwork out to a new car, college tuition, a down payment on a house, a \ngreat vacation, and maybe even a more secure retirement. Options for \nexecutives can amount to enough money to fund a small nation. The \noption packages some executives have received would amount to tens of \nthousands of dollars per employee in their company.'' This imbalance is \nnot good public policy.\n\n  In addition, if it turns out that companies are forced to expense \ntheir options at the time of grant, many of us fear that the first \noptions that would be cut are those for middle-income and rank and file \nemployees. We fear that the senior executives and their allies on the \nBoard would take care of themselves, and drop or not enact broad-based \nplans. The legislation I propose here would help to ensure that this \nwill not happen.\n  The bill I introduce today takes a direct and forceful approach and \nprovides that this tax deduction is limited to the spread on options \nthat are granted on a broad-basis to the employees of the firm. The \nintent and thrust of the bill is the same as the one I introduced in \n1993, and the definitions are the same. The approach is more direct and \nforceful.\n  The bill, called the ``Rank and File Stock Option Act'', states that \nthe ordinary and necessary business expense deduction attributed to the \nspread on the exercise of stock options (deducting the ``spread'' \nbetween the strike and exercise price) is limited on a pro rata basis \nto the extent stock option grants for the taxpayer are not broad-based. \nSo, when the three-year average of the stock option grants is broad-\nbased, as defined in the bill, there is no limitation on the deduction. \nIn terms of a pro-rata reduction, the deduction would be limited by the \nsame percentage to which the percentage of highly compensated employees \noptions exceeded the broad-based standard.\n  This test goes to the number of options granted, not the exercise \nprice or any other weighting or valuation. No deduction is allowed if \nthe options granted to senior management are different in form and \nsuperior to those granted to rank and file employees, which will help \nensure that there are no efforts to evade the purpose of this \nlegislation.\n  The stock option grants are deemed to be broad-based when, \nimmediately after the grant of the options, employees who are not \nhighly compensated employees hold share options that permit the \nacquisition of at least 50 percent of all shares that may be acquired \npursuant to all stock options outstanding (whether or not exercisable) \nas of such time. The bill does not require that stock option grants be \nmade to literally every employee, but as a practical matter such grants \nto every employee may be necessary to meet\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nthe test. Requiring that all employees receive some options involves \ncomplex issues about part-time employees and new employees. The 50 \npercent test is tough enough to ensure that the options are broad-\nbased.\n  The definition of a ``highly compensated employee'' includes all \nemployees who earn $90,000 or more and are among the firm's top 20 \npercent highest paid employees. This is similar to the current test \napplied to prevent ``discrimination'' in 401K plans.\n  In addition, under the legislation no deduction is allowed if more \nthan 5 percent of the total number of options is granted to any one \nindividual. And no deduction is allowed if more than 15 percent of the \nstock option grants go to the top 10 officers and directors of the \nfirm.\n  The legislation applies only to public companies. The Treasury \nDepartment shall issue regulations to implement this provision. The \neffective date is for stock grants after December 31 of this year. \nDuring the remainder of the year, corporations granting stock options \nmust disclose grants in filings to the SEC within 3 days.\n  To be clear, the legislation does not prevent a company from adopting \na stock option plan that does not meet the terms of this legislation. \nIt simply denies them a tax deduction on the spread when they do so. \nThis should ensure that broad-based stock option plans become the norm \nand that senior executives do not hoard the options for themselves to \nthe detriment of their companies and shareholders.\n  There is ample precedent for the limitation on deductions. Deductions \nare only permitted for ``ordinary and necessary'' business expenses and \nCongress has frequently intervened to define what this means. There is \nno right for corporations, or any other taxpayer, to avoid taxes on any \nand all expenses that they choose to incur.\n  There is also ample precedent for limiting the deduction for non-\nbroad based stock option plans. We have similar limitations in the law \ndefining contributions for 401K plans, the compensation in closely held \ncorporations is regulated to prevent abuse, and we have limits on \nexcessive compensation paid to executives of non-profit entitles.\n  To make sure that an employer's 401(k) plan does not unfairly favor \nits higher-paid workers, there are also rules governing highly-\ncompensated employees or HCEs. The term highly-compensated employees \nmay include a person who was a 5 percent owner at any time during the \ncurrent or prior year or an employee who earned more than $90,000. An \nemployee whose salary ranked in the top 20 percent of payroll for the \nprior year might also be considered an HCE. Generally, to make sure a \n401(k) plan is compliant, each year the plan must pass a non-\ndiscrimination test.\n  These tests generally compare the amounts contributed by and on \nbehalf of highly compensated employees to those contributed by and on \nbehalf of the non-highly compensated employees. As long as the \ndifference between the percentages of these two groups is within the \nInternal Revenue Code's guidelines, the plan retains its tax-qualified \nstatus. If the plan does not pass the tests, the plan must take \ncorrective action or lose its tax-favored status.\n  With regard to closely held corporations, the deduction for ordinary \nand necessary expenses is limited to ``reasonable'' compensation for \nservices performed by the shareholders/employees. A corporation paying \nexcessive compensation to a shareholder-employee is required to \nreclassify the excess as a dividend (provided there are \nadequate corporate earnings and profits). This has unfavorable tax \nconsequences, since dividends are not deductible. In addition to an \nemployee's salary, employer-provided benefits should be considered in \ndetermining whether an employee's compensation is reasonable. This \nincludes pension and welfare benefits, as well as fringe benefits such \nas the use of a company car.\n\n  Finally, the 1993 Taxpayer's Bill of Rights enacted Section 4958 \nwhich imposes an excise tax on transactions that provide excessive \neconomic benefits to top executives of non-profit charitable groups. \nThe Internal Revenue Service finalized regulations implementing this \nlaw on January 10, 2001. The regulations define what constitutes \nexcessive compensation and benefits.\n  The limitation on the deduction proposed in my legislation serves a \nconstructive public policy purpose. The only purpose of the limitation \non deduction we find in S. 1940, the lead bill on expensing of stock \noptions, is to coerce companies into expensing their options at grant. \nIf the companies do not expense options at grant, as S. 1940 prefers \nthat they do despite FASB's current rule that this is not necessary, \nthen they lose their tax deduction. If this legislation is effective, \nand companies are forced to expense their options at grant, the likely \nresult is that fewer options will be granted, especially to rank and \nfile employees, although not for top executives. My legislation is \ndirected at protecting the stock options of rank and file employees.\n  In addition to ensuring that stock options are broad-based and \nperformance oriented and not just allocated to the top executives, we \nneed to make sure that shareholders are involved in the decision to \nimplement these stock option plans.\n  The legislation provides that not later than one year after the date \nof enactment of this Act, the Commission shall finalize rules pursuant \nto the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to ensure that shareholder \napproval is required for stock option plans and grants, stock purchase \nplans, and other arrangements by public companies by which any person \nmay acquire an equity interest in the company in exchange for \nconsideration that is less than the fair market value of the equity \ninterest at the time of the exchange.\n  This approval would apply to any stock option plan, not just a stock \noption plan that meets the terms for a broad-based plan.\n  In securing this approval, prior to submission of such plans to \nshareholders for approval, the company must give its shareholders \ndetailed information about the stock option plans and grants, including \n(a) the economic rationale and interest of shareholders in the plan or \ngrant; (b) a detailed description of the anticipated distribution of \nthe plan or grant among directors, officers, and employees and the \nrationale such distribution; (c) the total number of options reserved \nor intended for grants to each director and officer, and to different \nclasses of employees; (d) the maximum potential future earnings per \nshare dilution of investors' shareholdings assuming the exercise of all \nin-the-money options with no adjustment for the use of the Treasury \nstock method, as stock price varies; (e) the terms under which stock \noption grants may be cancelled or reissued; and (f) the number, \nweighted average exercise prices, and vesting schedule of all options \npreviously approved or outstanding.\n  The Commission shall ensure that all disclosures required by this \nSection shall increase the reliability and accuracy of information \nprovided to shareholders and investors.\n  Such shareholder approval requirement may exempt stock option grants \nto individual employees under terms and conditions specified by the \nCommission. Such exemptions shall be available only where the grant is \n(1) made to an individual who is not a director or officer of the \ncompany at the time the grant is approved; (2) necessary, based on \nbusiness judgment; (3) represents a deminimus potential dilution of \nfuture earnings per share of investors' shareholdings; and (4) made on \nterms disclosed to shareholders of the grant that is made in the next \nfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Such approval requirement may exempt stock option plans and grants of \nany registrant that qualifies as a small business issuer under \napplicable securities laws and regulations or to such additional small \nissuers as the Commission determines would be unduly burdened by such \nrequirements as compared to the benefit to shareholders. The Commission \nis authorized to phase in the applicability of this rule both as to the \napplicability and to its effective date so that it can determine the \nsize of issuer to which this rule will apply and the extent to which \nthe rule should apply to plans that exclude officers and directors.\n  The bill also focuses on the issue of the incentives stock options \ngive to executives as they manage a company.\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nQuestions have been raised about whether the options are partly \nresponsible for the deception and fraud that has occurred at Enron and \nother companies. The charge is that the options gave these executives \nan irresistible rationale to deceive shareholders and investors to pump \nup the stock price and increase the value of the options. Charges have \nbeen made that these manipulations were timed to occur immediately \nbefore options were exercised and shares were sold.\n  While there is intuitive appeal to this argument, it is difficult to \nestablish the role of stock options in these acts of deceptions, fraud \nand manipulation. The concerns are sufficient, however, that we need to \nturn to the Securities and Exchange Commission to evaluate them and \ndetermine what restrictions might be imposed on the sale of stock \nacquired through stock options. The bill directs the SEC to conduct an \nanalysis and make regulatory and legislative recommendations on the \nneed for new stock holding period requirements for senior executives. \nThe Commission is directed to make recommendations regarding minimum \nholding periods after exercise of options to purchase stock and maximum \npercentage of stock purchased through options that may be sold. These \nrecommendations would include transactions involving sales to company, \nsales on public markets, and derivative sales.\n  We need the expertise of the Commission on this complicated issue. It \nwould probably not be reasonable to bar executives from selling any \nshares during their employment with the firm. Executives may need the \nproceeds of these sales to finance the college education of their \nchildren and many other completely legitimate reasons. The Commission \nis in a better position to evaluate the incentives, the opportunities \nfor fraud, and other key factual and policy questions.\n  Stock options have been under attack. We need to focus on how to \nprevent abuse of stock options, not just abandon these incentives. They \nare a uniquely American idea, they provide a way to increase \nproductivity and broaden the winner's circle. As with any economic \nincentive, they can be abused and we need to focus on these abuses. By \nreforming stock options, we can ensure that these incentives will be \neven more effective.\n  I believe that the reforms I have proposed will address the abuses we \nhave seen. It is unfortunate that the accounting for stock options has \nbecome a surrogate for any and all issues regarding stock options. I \ncontinue to believe that accounting for stock options as an expense at \nthe time they are granted is not appropriate or possible. But \nirrespective of the outcome of this debate, the reforms I have proposed \nhere address the real issues, the real abuses, and the real \nopportunities to ensure that stock options continue to provide a \npowerful incentive in favor of economic growth and democratic \ncapitalism.\n  I ask unanimous consent than the following outline of the legislation \nand the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Rank and File Stock Option Act\n\n       Legislation focuses on three critical reform issues \n     regarding stock options--distribution, shareholder approval, \n     and disposition by senior executives.\n       Requiring expensing of stock options at the time they are \n     granted is likely to discourage the use of stock options, but \n     it will not prevent senior executives from hoarding options--\n     it will probably encourage it. It will not give shareholders \n     a greater say in approving stock option plans and ensuring \n     that they are focused on effective incentives for growth. And \n     expensing will not address the incentives that executives may \n     have to manipulate earnings immediately prior to selling \n     shares acquired through a stock option plan.\n       A. Broad-based Options. This provision of the bill is based \n     on the structure and elements of a bill introduced by Senator \n     Lieberman on June 29, 1993, the ``Equity Expansion Act,'' S. \n     1175.\n       This bill limits the ordinary and necessary business \n     expense deduction attributed to the spread on the exercise of \n     stock options to the extent stock option grants for the \n     taxpayer are not broad-based.\n       The stock option grants are deemed to be broad-based when, \n     immediately after the grant of the options, employees who are \n     not highly compensated employees hold share options that \n     permit the acquisition of at least 50 percent of all shares \n     that may be acquired pursuant to all stock options \n     outstanding (whether or not exercisable) as of such time. The \n     bill does not require that stock option grants be made to \n     literally every employee, but as a practical matter such \n     grants to every employee may be necessary to meet the test. \n     Requiring that all employees receive some options involves \n     complex issues about part-time employees and new employees. \n     The 50% test is tough enough to ensure that the options are \n     broad-based.\n       The definition of a highly compensated employee includes \n     all employees who earn $90,000 or more and are among the \n     firm's top 20 percent highest paid employees. This is similar \n     to the current test applied to prevent ``discrimination'' in \n     401K plans.\n       B. Shareholder Approval. The bill provides that not later \n     than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Commission shall finalize rules pursuant to the Securities \n     and Exchange Act of 1934 to ensure that shareholder approval \n     is required for stock option plans and grants, stock purchase \n     plans, and other arrangements by public companies by which \n     any person may acquire an equity interest in the company in \n     exchange for consideration that is less than the fair market \n     value of the equity interest at the time of the exchange.\n       C. Holding Period For Executives. Finally, the bill \n     requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct an \n     analysis and make regulatory and legislative recommendations \n     on the need for new stock holding period requirements for \n     senior executives to reduce incentives for earnings \n     manipulations.\n\n                                S. 2877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate Fort Bayard Historic District in the \nState of New Mexico as a National Historic Landmark, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to designate \nFort Bayard in New Mexico as a national historic landmark. I am excited \nto offer this bill because I believe that the history of the fort \ndeserves Federal recognition. Fort Bayard is significant not only for \nthe role it played as a military post in fostering early settlement in \nthe region, but for its role as a nationally important tuberculosis \nsanatorium and hospital. During the 99 years spanning its establishment \nin 1866 through its closing as a Veterans Administration hospital in \n1965, Fort Bayard served as the most prominent evidence of the Federal \ngovernment's role in Southwestern New Mexico. Fort Bayard has recently \nbeen listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition \nof the historical significance of the site.\n  From 1866 to 1899, Fort Bayard functioned as an Army post while its \nsoldiers, many of them African-American, or Buffalo Soldiers, protected \nsettlers working in nearby mining district. These Buffalo Soldiers were \na mainstay of the Army during the late Apache wars and fought \nheroically in numerous skirmishes. Like many soldiers who served at \nFort Bayard, some of the Buffalo Soldiers remained in the area \nfollowing their discharge. Lines of headstones noting the names of men \nand their various Buffalo Soldier units remain in the older section of \nwhat is now the National Cemetery. In 1992, these soldiers were \nrecognized for their bravery when a Buffalo Soldier Memorial statue was \ndedicated at the center of the Fort Bayard parade ground. It gradually \nbecame apparent that the Army's extensive frontier fort system was no \nlonger necessary. By 1890, it was clear that the era of the western \nfrontier, at least from the Army's perspective, had ended. Fort Bayard \nwas scheduled for closure in 1899.\n  Even as the last detachment of the 9th U.S. Cavalry prepared to \ndepart the discontinued post, new Federal occupants were arriving at \nFort Bayard. On August 28, 1899, the War Department authorized the \nsurgeon-general to establish a general hospital for use as a military \nsanatorium. This would be the first sanatorium dedicated to the \ntreatment of officers and enlisted men of the Army suffering form \npulmonary tuberculosis. At 6,100 ft. and with a dry, sunny climate, the \nfort lay within what proponents of climatological therapy termed the \n``zone of immunity.'' By 1919, the cumulative effect of over 15 years \nof construction and improvement projects was the creation of a small, \nnearly self-sufficient community.\n  In 1920, the War Department closed the sanatorium and the United \nStates Public Health Service assumed control of the facility. A second \nphase occurred in 1922 when a new agency, the Veterans' Bureau, was \ncreated within the Treasury Department and charged with operating \nhospitals throughout the country whose clientele were veterans \nrequiring medical services. As a result, in the summer of 1922 the \nUnited States General Hospital at Fort Bayard was transferred to the \nVeterans' Bureau and became known as United States Veterans' Hospital \nNo. 55. Its mission of treating those afflicted with tuberculosis, \nhowever, remained the same.\n  By 1965, there was no longer a need for a tuberculosis facility \nlocated at a high elevation in a dry climate, and the Veterans' \nAdministration decided to close the hospital in that year. However, in \npart because of the concerns of the local communities that depended \nupon the hospital, the State of New Mexico assumed responsibility for \nthe facility and 484 acres of the former military reservation. Since \nthen, the State has used it for geriatric, as well as drug and alcohol \nrehabilitation and orthopedic programs. Because of the extensive \ncemetery dating to the fort and sanatorium eras at Fort Bayard, the \nState of New Mexico transferred 16 acres in 1975 for the creation of \nthe Fort Bayard National Cemetery, administered by the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  For these and many other reasons, believe it is clear that Fort \nBayard is historically significant and merits recognition as a national \nhistoric landmark. Fort Bayard illuminates a rich and complex story \nthat is important to the entire nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2883. A bill to allow States to design a program to increase \nparental choice in special education, to fully fund the Federal share \nof part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to help \nStates reduce paperwork requirements under part B of such Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce The Choice IDEA Act, which \nwould reform the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. The \nfederal government began dealing with special education in the 1970's, \nand on the whole what has come to be known as IDEA had proven to be a \nremarkable success. Before federal legislation, many times a child with \na disability received little or no education. And if the child did \nreceive an education, it was often sub-standard. IDEA has undoubtedly \nbeen a success, and you will find no stronger champion of educating the \ndisabled than I. However, the success of IDEA should not blind us to \nthe problems it, in its current form, causes.\n  These problems come up every time I meet with educators and education \nadministrators from my state. When we sit down and discuss what we in \nthe federal government can do for them, the discussion invariably turns \nto IDEA. These educators and school personnel want two things: full \nfunding of the federal government's share of IDEA, like we promised \nback in the 1970's, and a reduction in paperwork. I have also talked to \nnumerous parents about their experiences with IDEA. While many are \nhappy with the current system, there are also many who are dissatisfied \nand who want more control and more choice over how their children are \neducated.\n  Some of the stories I hear are truly incredible and illustrate the \nserious need for IDEA reform. For example, there is a school district \nin North Idaho--in a county which has had very high unemployment and \nbelow average per-capita income since the early 1990's--which has well \nabove the national average of children in special education. This \ndistrict is doing a great job educating those children, but the high \ncosts associated with doing so, and the time it takes to complete the \nreams of paperwork that must be filled out for every child, are severe \ndrains on that district. I've also heard from a school superintendent \nin Idaho who is going through a particularly sticky due process hearing \nand who laments that the paperwork required by this hearing is costly, \nunnecessary, and takes away teachers' time from the\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nclassroom. Parents have also contacted me with their stories of how \nschool districts have mistreated them and how they can only find the \nproper program for their special child at a private school. The Choice \nIDEA Act would help out these parents, teachers, and school \nadministrators by fully funding IDEA by Fiscal Year 2010, giving \nparents significantly more control over how their children are \neducated, and by reducing the onerous burden of paperwork that hampers \nthe special education process.\n  The centerpiece of the bill is a proposal to allow states to set up a \nspecial education system based on parental choice. States that want to \nreform would draw up a list of disability categories and how much it \ncosts to educate and accommodate a child who has that disability. The \nstates would also draw up a menu outlining the educational services \neach pubic school in the state offers to children with those \ndisabilities, and how much those services costs. These services must \nequal the quality of the services they offer today, and the states' \nprograms would be approved by the Department of Education. If the \nDepartment of Education approves a state's plan, parents of special \neducation children in that state would get a voucher for each child to \nchoose from schools' menus to meet the needs of their children. Or, if \nparents did not find satisfactory services from the public schools, \nthey could take their vouchers to any private school that could meet \ntheir children's needs.\n  As you can see, parents would have the ultimate control over how \ntheir child is educated. Since parents would have the option of taking \ntheir voucher and leaving a school if their child was not being \neducated properly, the due process requirements under IDEA would not be \nnecessary and the school personnel would have their paperwork burden \ndramatically reduced. Parents and school personnel could work together \nto find a proper diagnosis for a student who had a disability and to \nfind the right ways to educate this child, instead of being forced into \nan adversarial relationship as they are today.\n  It is important to point out, though, that this bill has no mandate \non states that they must design the system outlined above. My bill \nwould strengthen states' rights by allowing states one more option in \ndealing with special education. If states want to design such a special \neducation system, they should have the freedom to do so. As welfare \nreform has shown us, states are often more innovative than the federal \ngovernment in solving problems. This bill would give them one more tool \nto deal with the problems that are associated with IDEA.\n  Another important provision of this bill is that it would set up a \ngrant program (up to $1 million) within the Department of Education to \nhelp school districts which have 15 percent or more of their students \nin special education hire para-professionals to help deal with the \npaperwork.\n  The Choice IDEA Act is not intended to be the final say on IDEA \nreform. I agree with many of the Presidential Commission's suggestions \nfor IDEA reauthorization and hope to see them enacted into law; \nhowever, this reauthorization should include a provision giving states \nthe option of pursuing their own reforms within the structure outlined \nabove. When the Senate begins debating IDEA reauthorization, it is my \nhope that my bill will be considered and the Senate will reform IDEA so \nthat the concept of ``no child is left behind'' truly includes every \nchild.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2884. A bill to improve transit service to rural areas, including \nfor elderly and disabled; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I introduce a bill to help rural America. \nNow I am always trying to help Montana, but this bill will help every \nstate. Today I introduce the MEGA RED TRANS Act. Maximum Economic \nGrowth for America Through Investment in Rural, Elderly and Disabled \nTransit.\n  Quite simply, there are transit needs not being met nationwide. This \nbill addresses those needs.\n  This is the second bill in a series that I am introducing to \nhighlight my proposals on reauthorization of TEA 21--the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century.\n  Last month I introduced the MEGA TRUST Act--Maximum Growth for \nAmerica Through the Highway Trust Fund. Today its MEGA RED TRANS.\n  The Maximum Economic Growth for America Through Investment in Rural, \nElderly and Disabled Transit Act or MEGA RED TRANS Act would ensure, \nthat as Federal transit programs are reauthorized, increased funding is \nprovided to meet the needs of the elderly and disabled and of rural and \nsmall urban areas.\n  There is no question that our nation's large metropolitan areas have \nsubstantial transit needs that will receive attention as transit \nreauthorization legislation is developed. But the transit needs of \nrural and smaller areas, and of our elderly and disabled citizens, also \nrequire additional attention and funding.\n  The bill would provide that additional funding in a way that does not \nimpact other portions of the transit program. For example, while the \nbill would at least double every State's funding for the elderly and \ndisabled transit program by FY 2004, nothing in the bill would reduce \nfunding for any portion of the transit program or for any State.\n  To the contrary, the bill would help strengthen the transit program \nas a whole by providing that the mass Transit Account of the Highway \nTrust Fund is credited with the interest on its balance. This is a key \nprovision in the MEGA TRUST Act and is also included here in the MEGA \nRED TRANS Act.\n  Specifically, the bill would set modest minimum annual \napportionments, by State, for the elderly and disabled transit program, \nthe rural transit program, and for urbanized areas with a population of \nless than 200,000.\n  It would ensure that each state gets a minimum of $11 million for \nthese three programs.\n  For my state of Montana that is double what we get for those programs \ncurrently. For some other states it is more than four times what they \nreceive.\n  The bill would also establish a $30 million program for essential bus \nservice, to help connect citizens in rural communities to the rest of \nthe world by facilitating transportation between rural areas and \nairports and passenger rail stations.\n  I am very aware of the role that public transit plays in the lives of \nrural citizens and the elderly and disabled. When most people hear the \nword ``transit'' they think of a light rail system. But in rural areas \ntransit translates to buses and vanpools. Take Elaine Miller for \nexample.\n  Elaine is 73 years old and lives in Missoula, MT. She depends upon \nthe city's Mountain Line public transit system for virtually all of her \ntransportation needs. ``It's my car!'' she says.\n  Twelve years ago, Elaine suffered a stroke and decided that it was \nsimply too dangerous to drive anymore. Today she takes transit to the \ndoctor and to shop. She gets her prescriptions and meets family and \nfriends, all using public transit.\n  As a regular rider, however, Elaine also understands the current \nlimitations of transit in Missoula. ``Our bus service here needs to \noffer more service, particularly on the weekends and the evenings. I'd \nlike to be able to take the bus to church,'' she says.\n  The frequency of bus service in Missoula, too, can often be an issue \nfor Elaine. Last week, for example, she was left waiting more than two \nhours at a local store for the next bus to take her home.\n  ``We seniors know how important the bus is to our quality of life. We \nreally need more bus service. Without the bus, I know that myself and \nothers would just have to stay home,'' says Elaine.\n  For Elaine, increased Federal investment in public transit in Montana \nwould mean increased bus service in Missoula. Weekend service and \nincreased frequency on current routes, she believes, are a great need.\n  I'd like to discuss another example of how rural transit and transit \nfor the elderly and disabled is crucial to Montana. And I am sure we \ncould easily find similar examples in every state.\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\n  Let's talk about Kathy Collins of Helena, MT.\n  Kathy moved to Helena in 1982 from Butte, MT, an area with no \naccessible transportation. In Helena, she discovered the Dial-A-Ride \nsystem, where lift-equipped vehicles could easily transport her in her \nwheelchair.\n  ``It was terrific. I could get to work on time. And I could even get \nhome on time!'' lauds Collins.\n  While she owns a minivan that she can drive to the middle school \nwhere she teaches, she is thankful to have a transportation option in \ninclement weather.\n  ``Transit gets me to and from work in the winter time. I couldn't do \nit without them,'' she says, ``And for people who don't work, it's a \ngodsend. They can't afford a taxi.''\n  While the Dial-A-Ride system provides Collins with dependable \nemployment transportation on weekdays, she would like to see operations \nexpanded to evenings and weekends.\n  ``The service is essential. You need to give people access. You need \nto give people control over their lives. You need to give people the \nmobility that the rest of the country enjoys. Just because we live in \nthe boondocks doesn't mean we don't need to go anywhere.'' she says.\n  I couldn't agree with her more. The MEGA RED TRANS Act will help \nthese people and millions of others around the country. Considering the \nenormous impact the MEGA RED TRANS Act will have on the country, it is \nactually a very modest proposal.\n  The bill would not set funding levels for the transit program as a \nwhole, or for large transit systems.\n  Moreover, the call for increases in the elderly and disabled, rural, \nand small urban area programs are not made in a static setting, but in \nthe context of reauthorization.\n  In reauthorization the overall transit program undoubtedly will grow \nby more than the modest increases required by the provisions of this \nbill. So, nothing in the bill would preclude growth in other aspects of \nthe transit program.\n  In sum, the bill stands for the proposition that, as the transit \nprogram is likely to continue to grow, no less than the funding \nincreases proposed in this bill should be provided in order to better \nmeet the needs of rural and small urban area transit systems and the \ntransit needs of the elderly and disabled.\n  I would like to thank Senators Crapo, Thomas, Johnson, Enzi, Conrad, \nBingaman and Craig for joining me on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I'd also like to thank both the members and staff of the American Bus \nAssociation, The Community Transportation Association and the \nAmalgamated Transit Union, for their assistance with this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and to work to include it \nin the highway and transit reauthorization, next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2885. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require \nadditional disclosures relating to exchange rates in transfers \ninvolving international transactions; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, along with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Akaka, I am introducing The Wire Transfer Fairness \nand Disclosure Act, legislation that will protect consumers who send \ncash remittances through international money wire transfer companies by \nproviding greater disclosure of the fees, including hidden costs, \ncharged for those services.\n  Every year, thirty million Americans send their friends and relatives \n$40 billion in cash remittances through wire transfers. The majority of \nthese transfers are remittances sent to their native countries by \nimmigrants to the United States. For these individuals, many of whom \nare in low-to-minimum wage jobs, sending this money only increases \ntheir own personal financial burdens--but they do so to aid their \nfamilies and their loved ones.\n  Unfortunately, these immigrants increasingly find themselves being \npreyed upon by the practices of some money wire transfer providers who \nnot only charge consumers an upfront charge for the transfer service, \nbut also hit them on the back end with hidden costs. Many of these \ncharges are extracted when the dollars sent by the consumer are \nconverted to the foreign currency value that is supposed to be paid out \nto the friend of the family member.\n  This exploitation is especially pervasive in Latin American and \nCaribbean countries. In fact, as many as 10 million Hispanic immigrants \nin the U.S. send remittances to their family and friends back home. \nCumulatively, these individuals send $23 billion annually to some of \nour hemisphere's poorest economies. This money is used to pay for such \nbasic needs such as food, medicine, and schooling.\n  In most Latin American and Caribbean countries, remittances far \nexceed U.S. development assistance. In the case of Nicaragua, Haiti, \nJamaica, Ecuador and El Salvador, cash remittances account for more \nthan 10 percent of national GDP.\n  These large cash flows have proven to be a powerful incentive for \ngreed in the case of some wire transfer companies. Customers wiring \nmoney to Latin America and elsewhere in the world lose billions of \ndollars annually to undisclosed ``currency conversion fees.'' In fact, \nmany large companies aggressively target immigrant communities, often \nadvertising ``low fee'' or ``no fee'' rates for international \ntransfers. But these misleading ads do not always clearly disclose the \nfees charged when the currency is exchanged.\n  While large wire service companies typically obtain foreign \ncurrencies at bulk rates, they charge a significant currency conversion \nfee to their U.S. customers. For example, customers wiring money to \nMexico are charged an exchange rate that routinely varies from the \nbenchmark by as much as 15 percent. These hidden fees create staggering \nprofits, allowing companies to reap billions of dollars on top of the \nstated fees they charge for the wire transfer services.\n  While this practice may not be illegal, it is wrong, and it must be \nstopped. The Wire Transfer Fairness and Disclosure Act requires \nfinancial institutions or money-transmitting businesses that initiate \ninternational money transfers to disclose all fees charged in an \ninternational wire transfer.\n  The legislation also requires these companies to provide consumers \nwith important disclosures regarding the exchange rate used in \nconnection with the transaction; the exchange rate prevailing at a \nmajor financial center in the foreign country whose currency is \ninvolved in the transaction; or the official exchange rate, if any, of \nthe government or central bank of that foreign country.\n  The bill would additionally require disclosure to the consumer who \ninitiates the transaction of any fees or commissions charged by \ntransfer service providers in connection with any transaction and the \nexact amount of foreign currency to be received by the recipient in the \nforeign country, which shall be disclosed to the consumer before the \ntransaction is consummated and printed on the receipt given to \ncustomer.\n  This legislation does more than merely provide better information to \nconsumers--it should also help them financially. Consumers will see \nincreased competition among wire transfer companies because they are \nbetter-informed and more knowledgeable. That competition will result in \nlower fees for the wire transfer services that will free up a greater \nportion of these cash remittances to go to the friends and families \nthat they were originally intended for.\n  In short, this is sound public policy that empowers those who do \ntheir part to help America's economy move forward.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I cosponsor the Wire Transfer Fairness and \nDisclosure Act of 2002, introduced by my colleague, Senator Corzine. I \nthank Senator Corzine and Representative Luis Gutierrez for their \nleadership on this issue. I also want to express my appreciation to the \nChairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for conducting a \nhearing on the issue of remittances.\n  Immigrants nationwide often send a portion of their hard-earned wages \nto\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\nrelatives and their communities abroad. Remittances can be used to \nimprove the standard of living of recipients by increasing access to \nhealth care and education.\n  Unfortunately, people who send remittances are often unaware of the \nfees and exchange rates used in the transaction that reduce the amount \nof money received by their family members. In many cases, fees for \nsending remittances can be ten to twenty percent of the value of the \ntransaction. In addition to the fees, the exchange rate used in the \ntransaction can be significantly lower than the market rate. The \nexchange rate used in the transaction is typically not disclosed to \ncustomers.\n  Consumers cannot afford to be uneducated regarding financial service \noptions and fees placed on their transactions. This legislation is \nneeded to provide the necessary information to consumers so that they \nmay make informed decisions about sending money. The Wire Transfer \nFairness and Disclosure Act would ensure that each customer is fully \ninformed of all of the fees and the exchange rates used in the \ntransaction.\n  If consumers are provided additional information about the \ntransaction costs involved with sending money, they may be more likely \nto utilize banks and credit unions which often can provide lower cost \nremittances. If unbanked immigrants use the remittance services offered \nby banks and credit unions, they may be more likely to open up an \naccount. Many immigrants are unbanked and lack a relationship with a \nmainstream financial services provider. The unbanked are more likely to \nuse check-cashing services which charge an average fee of over nine \npercent. They are also more likely to utilize the services provided by \npay-day and predatory lenders. The unbanked miss the opportunities for \nsaving and borrowing at mainstream financial institutions.\n  This legislation is particularly important to my home State of \nHawaii. Hawaii is home to significant numbers of recent immigrants from \nmany nations, including the Philippines. The Philippines is one of the \nlargest destinations for remittances from the United States. The gross \nvalue of remittances to the Philippines is $3.7 billion and a large \nportion of that amount comes from people in Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this much \nneeded legislation and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wire Transfer Fairness and \n     Disclosure Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nthe religious free exercise and free speech rights of churches and \nother houses of worship to engage in an insubstantial amount of \npolitical activities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, along with my colleagues \nSenators Tim Hutchinson and Jesse Helms, to introduce the Houses of \nWorship Political Speech Protection Act.\n  This bill, introduced by my friend Congressman Walter B. Jones of \nNorth Carolina, H.R. 2357, enjoys broad support on the House side with \n128 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit a church to \nparticipate or intervene in a political campaign and maintain its tax-\nexempt status as long as such participation is not a substantial parts \nof its activities.\n  The bill replaces the absolute ban on political intervention with the \n``no substantial part of the activities'' test currently used in the \nlobbying context. This bill would give clergy the freedom to speak out \non moral and political issues of our day and to fully educate their \ncongregation on where the candidates stand on the issues without the \nthreat of losing their tax exempt status.\n  Senator Lyndon Johnson inserted the ban on political speech in 1954 \nas a floor amendment in order to hamstring certain anticommunist \norganizations that were opposing him in the Democratic Party. No \nhearings took place nor was any congressional record developed in order \nto explain the reasons for the ban. There is no indication that Senator \nJohnson intended to target churches.\n  Before 1954, pastors and members of many churches spoke freely about \ncandidates and political issues. The slavery abolitionist organizations \nand the\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\ncivil rights movement are great examples of church inspired political \nsuccess.\n  Had the current law been enforced earlier in American history, \nWilliam Lloyd Garrison could not have spoken out against slavery, nor \ncould Martin Luther King, Jr. have spoken out against segregation.\n  Currently, the ban on political speech has a dramatic chilling effect \non the ability of houses of worship to speak out on moral and political \nissues, since under Section 501(C)(3), houses of worship may not engage \nin even a single activity that might be regarded as participating in, \nor intervening in a campaign on behalf of or in opposition to a \ncandidate for public office.\n  Thus ultimately restricts the clergy's freedom of speech by \nthreatening to revoke the church's tax-exempt status if they dare to \nspeak out on moral and political questions of our day.\n  Additionally, the bill seeks to shift the burden of proof from houses \nof worship to the IRS. Rather than require the house of worship to \nprove that its activities are not political at all, this bill will \nforce the IRS to prove that its activities are in fact substantially \npolitical.\n  Nothing in this bill ``makes'' a church speak on political issues; it \nmerely gives them the freedom to do so if they choose to.\n  Since so many of the issues that are debated in the halls of Congress \nhave a moral or religious aspect to them, those who ask for help from a \nhigher power should not be absent from the political process.\n  America is a religious nation. Religion affects every aspect of our \nculture, and yes, even our government. The views of our church-going \nmembers and their clergy are vital to a well-rounded debate on the \nimportant issues of our day.\n  This substantial portion of the American people who consider \nthemselves religious and practice that religion should not be shut out \nof the process.\n  I hope more of my colleagues will join us and cosponsor this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2887. A bill to provide for the sharing of homeland security \ninformation by Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies with \nState and local entities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Homeland Security \nInformation Sharing Act, a bill to increase state and local access to \nsecurity information that could save American lives. The House has \nalready passed similar legislation bill sponsored by Representatives \nHarman and Chambliss, and it is my understanding that the \nAdministration supports this legislation as well.\n  The bill I introduce today will not solve our intelligence problems--\nwe have a long road ahead of us before we can accomplish that. But this \nlegislation will send a clear signal to our federal agencies that \ninformation gathered at the federal level must be shared with states \nand localities if we are to triumph in the battle against terrorism.\n  State and local law enforcement are first-line defenders of our \nhomeland security. Too often, though, state and local officials do not \nreceive information necessary for them to protect us. If, for instance, \nthere were a terrorist threat against the Golden Gate Bridge in San \nFrancisco, we would want a cooperative effort between the Federal \ngovernment and local officials.\n  This bill would:\n  Direct the President to establish procedures for federal agencies to \nshare homeland security information with state and local officials, and \nfor all government officials to be able to communicate with each other. \nLocal officials should quickly have access to relevant intelligence \nnecessary to prevent or respond to attacks in their communities.\n  Direct the President to address concerns about too much dissemination \nof classified or sensitive information, by setting procedures to \nprotect this material. This could include requiring background checks \nof local officials who seek access to classified information, or \nperhaps even non disclosure agreements so that secret information stays \nsecret.\n  Direct the President to ensure that our current information sharing \nsystems and computers are capable of sharing relevant homeland security \ninformation with each other and with state and local systems.\n  Mr. President, we can improve information sharing without re-\ninventing the wheel. The legislation applies technology already used to \nshare information with our NATO allies and with Interpol. The \ninformation can be shared through existing networks, such as the \nNational Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, the Regional \nInformation Sharing Systems, and the Terrorist Threat Warning System. \nThese systems already reach law enforcement offices throughout America.\n  Better information sharing will result in better homeland security. \nAs a Congress, we are already working on making intelligence gathering \nand dissemination work better within the federal government. We must \nnot forget to improve communications with state and local law \nenforcement as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I hope that we \ncan pass it quickly in September. It is non-controversial, and would \nhelp send a clear signal that information gathering and dissemination \nmay be our best defense against terror.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2888. A bill to direct the Administrator of General Services to \nconvey to Fresno County, California, the existing Federal courthouse in \nthat country; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduced a bill that will convey the \nB.F. Sisk Federal Building in Fresno, California to the County of \nFresno, when the new federal courthouse is completed and occupied.\n  Fresno County is a rapidly growing county in the heart of \nCalifornia's Great Central Valley. The County of Fresno's Superior \nCourt has a serious need for new court space that will grow in the \nyears ahead. The Sisk Building contains courtrooms and related space \nthat will help the people of Fresno County meet those needs. The Sisk's \nbuilding existing security measures are a perfect fit for Fresno \nCounty's justice system.\n  This legislation is a common sense measure that will allow \nappropriate utilization of the Sisk Building, while contributing to the \nongoing revitalization of downtown Fresno. I am proud that it is yet \nanother opportunity for the federal government to improve the lives of \nFresno County's people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 2889. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a refundable credit against income tax for the purchase of \nprivate health insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, there are 39 million uninsured people \nin America, and that number is predicted to grow to 50 million by 2010. \nSurprisingly, 80 percent of the uninsured are members of working \nfamilies, who work hard everyday but simply cannot afford the rising \ncost of health care.\n  According to a recent survey by Hewitt Associates, the average \ninsurance premium will increase more than 20 percent in 2003. This is a \nsharp increase from earlier forecasts. Such an increase is in addition \nto the double digit increase in premiums anticipated this year.\n  I am pleased today to introduce the Securing Access Value and \nEquality in Health Care Act, or SAVE Act. This bill will provide every \nAmerican with a pre-payable, fully refundable tax credit toward the \npurchase of health insurance.\n  The tax credit will be $1,000 for individuals, $2,000 for married \ncouples, and $500 per dependent, up to $3,000 per family. An additional \n50 percent will be added for any additional premiums to assist those \nwith higher costs. By being pre-payable, the credit will be available \nto individuals at the time of purchase, instead of when they receive \ntheir annual tax return.\n  A study by Professor Mark Pauly at the Wharton School at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania showed that a credit like that contained in \nthe SAVE Act would remove 20 million Americans from the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  The SAVE Act will provide direct assistance to millions of Americans, \nand\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\nover 498,000 uninsured Arkansans, in affording health insurance. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2890. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ngrant programs to provide for education and outreach on newborn \nscreening and coordinated followup care once newborn screening has been \nconducted, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator Mike \nDeWine, to introduce legislation to protect the most vulnerable members \nof our society: newborn infants. About 2 months ago, many families \nacross the country celebrated Father's Day. As a first-time dad of a \n10-month-old baby girl, I now know the joy of being able to experience \nthat holiday and every other pleasure that comes along with being a \nfather. What I also now share with parents everywhere is a constant \nsense of worry about whether our kids are doing well, are feeling well, \nand are safe. Nothing is of greater importance than the health and \nwell-being of our children.\n  Thanks to incredible advances in medical technology, it is now \npossible to test newborns for at least 30 genetic and metabolic \ndisorders. Many of these disorders, if undetected, would lead to severe \ndisability or death. However, babies that are properly diagnosed and \ntreated can go on to live healthy lives. In the most direct sense, \nnewborn screening saves lives.\n  Frighteningly, the disorders that newborn screening tests for can \ncome without warning. For most of these disorders, there is no medical \nhistory of the condition in the family, no way to predict the health of \na baby based on the health of the parents. Although the disorders that \nare tested for are quite rate, there is a chance that any one newborn \nwill be affected. In that sense, this is an issue that has a direct \nimpact on the lives of every family.\n  Fortunately, screening has become common practice in every state. \nEach year, over four million infants have blood taken from their heel \nto detect these disorders that could threaten their life and long-term \nhealth. As a result, about one in 4,000 babies is diagnosed with one of \nthese disorders. That means that newborn screening could save \napproximately 1,000 lives each year. That is 1,000 tragedies that can \npossibly be averted--families left with the joy of a new infant rather \nthan absolute heartbreak.\n  That is the good news. However, there is so much more to be done. \nMore than 2,000 babies born are estimated to be born every year in the \nUnited States with potentially detectable disorders that go undetected \nbecause they are not screened. These infants and their families face \nthe prospect of disability or death from a preventable disorder. Let me \nrepeat that--disability or death from a preventable disorder. The \nsurvival of a newborn may very well come down to the state in which it \nis born. Only two states, including my home state of Connecticut thanks \nto recent legislation, will test for all 30 disorders. The vast \nmajority test for eight or fewer.\n  I recently chaired a hearing on this issue during which I related a \nstory that illustrates the impact of newborn screening, or the lack of \nnewborn screening, in a very personal sense. Jonathan Sweeney is a \nthree-year-old from Brookfield, CT. At the time of his birth, the state \nonly tested for eight disorders. He was considered a healthy baby, \nalthough he was a poor sleeper and needed to be fed quite frequently. \nOne morning in December of 2000, Jonathan's mother, Pamela, found \nJonathan with his eyes wide open but completely unresponsive. He was \nnot breathing and appeared to be having a seizure. Jonathan was rushed \nto the hospital where, fortunately, his life was saved. He was later \ndiagnosed with L-CHAD, a disorder that prevents Jonathan's body from \nturning fat into energy.\n\n  Despite this harrowing tale, Jonathan and his family are extremely \nfortunate. Jonathan is alive, and his disorder can be treated with a \nspecial diet. He has experienced developmental delays that most likely \ncould have been avoided had he been tested and treated for L-CHAD at \nbirth. This raises a question. Why was he not tested? Why do 47 states \nstill not test for L-CHAD?\n  The primary reason for this unfortunate reality is the lack of \nconsensus on the federal level about what should be screened for, and \nhow a screening program should be developed. Twenty of the thirty \ndisorders can only be detected using a costly piece of equipment called \na tandem mass spectrometer. Currently, only nine states have this \nresource. Many health care professionals are unaware of the possibility \nof screening for disorders beyond what their state requires. Parents, \nand I include myself, are even less well-informed. My daughter Grace \nwas born in Virginia, where they screen for nine disorders. I was \nextremely relieved when all of those tests came out negative. However, \nat that time I did not know that this screening was not as complete as \nit could have been. My ignorance had nothing to do with my love for my \ndaughter or my capability as a parent. The fact is that the majority of \nparents do not realize that this screening occurs at all, nor are they \nfamiliar with the disorders that are being screened for. For that \nreason, one of the most important first steps that we can take to \nprotect our children is to educate parents and health care \nprofessionals.\n  In the Children's Health Act of 2000, I supported the creation of an \nadvisory committee on newborn screening within the Department of Health \nand Human Services. The purpose of this committee would be to develop \nnational recommendations on screening, hopefully eliminating the \ndisparities between states that currently exist. The Children's Health \nAct also included a provision to provide funding to states to expand \ntheir technological resources for newborn screening. Unfortunately, \nfunds were not appropriated for either of these provisions. We are told \nthat $25 million in appropriations is needed for this crucial \ninitiative and we need to fight for these dollars as we develop the \nFY03 budget.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today, the Newborn Screening \nSaves Lives Act of 2002, seeks to address the shocking lack of \ninformation available to health care professionals and parents about \nnewborn screening. Every parent should have the knowledge necessary to \nprotect their child. The tragedy of a newborn's death is only \ncompounded by the frustration of learning that the death was \npreventable. This bill authorizes $10 million in fiscal year 2003 and \nsuch sums as are necessary through fiscal year 2007 to HRSA for grants \nto provide education and training to health care professionals, state \nlaboratory personnel, families and consumer advocates.\n  Our legislation will also provide states with the resources to \ndevelop programs of follow-up care for those children diagnosed by a \ndisorder detected through newborn screening. While these families are \nthe fortunate ones, in many cases they are still faced with the \nprospect of extended and complex treatment or major lifestyle changes. \nWe need to remember that care does not stop at diagnosis. For that \nreason, this bill authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 2003 and such \nsums as are necessary through FY 2007 to HRSA for grants to develop a \ncoordinated system of follow-up care for newborns and their families \nafter screening and diagnosis.\n  Finally, the bill directs HRSA to assess existing resources for \neducation, training, and follow-up care in the states, ensure \ncoordination, and minimize duplication; and also directs the Secretary \nto provide an evaluation report to Congress two and a half years after \nthe grants are first awarded and then after five years to assess impact \nand effectiveness and make recommendations about future efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative and look \nforward to working together to accomplish its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Harkin and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2891. A bill to create a 4-year pilot program that makes small, \nnon-profit child care businesses eligible for SBA 504 loans; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have shortage of childcare in this \ncountry, and it is a problem for our families, a\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nproblem for our businesses, and a problem for our economy. The Census \nBureau estimates that there are approximately 24 million school age \nchildren with parents who are in the workforce or pursuing education, \nand the numbers are growing. There has been a 43 percent increase in \ndual-earner families and single parent families over the last half a \ncentury. As parents leave the home for work and education, the need for \nquality childcare in America continues to increase.\n  As Chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I think we \ncan foster the establishment and expansion of existing child care \nbusinesses through the Small Business Administration. Today with \nSenators Harkin and Landrieu, I am introducing, the Child Care Lending \nPilot Act, a bill to create a four-year pilot that allows small, non-\nprofit child care businesses to access financing through SBA's 504 \nloans.\n  Non-profit child care small businesses already have access to \nfinancing through the SBA's microloan program, which many of us made \npossible through legislation in 1997. Microloans help with working \ncapital and the purchase of some equipment, but there is also a need to \nhelp finance the purchase of buildings, expand existing facilities to \nmeet child care demand, or improve facilities. It is appropriate to \nprovide financing through the 504 program because it was created to \nspur economic development and rebuild communities, and child care is \ncritical to businesses and their employees. Financing through 504 could \nspur the establishment and growth of child care businesses because the \nprogram requires the borrower to put down only between 10 and 20 \npercent of the loan, making the investment more affordable.\n  As anyone with children knows, quality childcare comes at a very high \ncost to a family, and it is especially burdensome to low-income \nfamilies. The Children's Defense Fund estimates that childcare for a 4-\nyear-old in a childcare center averages $4,000 to $6,000 per year in \ncities and states around the nation. In all but one state, the average \nannual cost of childcare in urban area childcare centers is more than \nthe average annual cost of public college tuition.\n  These high costs make access to child care all but non-existent for \nlow-income families. While some states have made efforts to provide \ngrants and loans to assist childcare businesses, more must be done to \nincrease the supply of childcare and improve the quality of programs \nfor low-income families. According to the Child Care Bureau, state and \nfederal funds are so insufficient that only one out of 10 children in \nlow-income working families who are eligible for assistance under \nfederal law receives it.\n  For parts of the country, when affordable child care is available, it \nis provided through non-profit child care businesses. I formed a task \nforce in my home State of Massachusetts to study the state of child \ncare, and of the many important findings, we discovered that more than \n60 percent of the child care providers are non-profit and that there is \na real need to help them finance the purchase of buildings or expand \ntheir existing space. Child care in general is not a high earning \nindustry, and the owners don't have spare money lying around. Asking \ncenters to charge less or cut back on employees is not the way to make \nchildcare more affordable for families and does not serve the children \nwell. An adequate staff is needed to make sure children receive proper \nsupervision and support. Furthermore, if centers are asked to lower \ntheir operating costs in order to lower costs to families, the safety \nand quality of the childcare provided would be in jeopardy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so non-profit \nchildcare providers can access funds to start new centers or expand and \nimprove upon existing centers.\n  Allowing non-profit childcare centers to receive SBA loans will be \nthe first step toward improving the availability of childcare in the \nUnited States. Non-profit childcare centers provide the same quality of \ncare as the for-profit centers, and non-profit centers often serve our \nnation's most needy communities. I hope that my colleagues will \nrecognize the vital role that early education plays in the development \nof fine minds and productive citizens and realize that in this great \nnation, childcare should be available to all families in all income \nbrackets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and several letters \nof support be printed in the Record. These letters demonstrate that \nthis is a good investment that is good for our country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: Please accept this letter as my full \n     support of the bill, soon to be introduced, proposing a Pilot \n     Program, operating through the Small Business \n     Administration's 504 Loan Program, that would allow Day Care \n     facilities designated as non-profits to be eligible for the \n     program.\n       I believe the demand for such a product is strong, and is \n     fiscally sound. My reasons are as follows:\n       1. Day Care Centers must carry a non-profit designation in \n     order to accept children to the center from low-income \n     families.\n       2. These business benefit low-income neighborhoods and \n     enterprise zones by purchasing property, improving the \n     physical appearance of the community and providing safe \n     facilities for the children. The ability to utilize the SBA-\n     504 program would enable these businesses to decrease lease/\n     payment expense and hence, help more children.\n       3. These families are in the most need for quality day care \n     facilities in their community, since many use mass transit to \n     get to work.\n       4. Small businesses have provided most of the job growth in \n     this country in the last ten years. By enabling these Day \n     Care Centers to operate efficiently and provide quality \n     facilities, we will be helping small business gain and \n     maintain employees.\n       5. Designation as a non-profit business does not equate to \n     an inability to pay loans, or other business expenses.\n       OMNIBANK, a 50-year-old community bank in Houston, Texas, \n     has experienced a consistent demand for loans to Day Care \n     Centers. Most loan requests from these entities are for the \n     purpose of acquiring or expanding property (real-estate) or \n     acquiring transportation equipment. An example of a specific, \n     recent request follows:\n       The Executive Director and Owner of Teeter Totter Day Care \n     Center approached OMNIBANK about a loan to purchase the \n     building used to house the Center. The owner an African-\n     American woman, was experienced in this business. Cash flow \n     to service the debt was sufficient and appropriate under \n     prudent lending guidelines. The only deterrent from making a \n     conventional loan was the amount available for down payment. \n     Twenty percent or more is usually required.\n       Under the SBA-504 Program, a ten percent down payment is \n     allowed and standard procedure for multi-use buildings. \n     Additionally, it offers a fixed rate on the SBA portion of \n     the loan. Most small businesses do not have access to fixed \n     rate mortgages, due to the size of the loan requests, which \n     enhances to attractives of the SBA 504 Program even further.\n       As we were preparing the request package, we realized that \n     a non-profit did not qualify. The owner would personally \n     guarantee the loan, and even agreed to form a for profit \n     corporation to hold the property, because the underlying \n     tenant was non-profit it would not work. The owner could not \n     change Teeter Totter into a for profit corporation without \n     jeopardizing its subsidies for low-income children.\n       OMNIBANK and the day care center are located in Houston's \n     fifth ward, most of which is classified as low to moderate \n     income. Its population is primarily low-income African \n     Americans and Hispanics. The project was viewed by the Bank \n     as a good loan from a business perspective, with many \n     additional benefits to the community at large.\n       Ultimately, after appealing to SBA for a exception, and \n     spending a great deal of time on the project, the loan was \n     not completed. This delayed a good project from improving \n     many aspects of an already underscored community, due to a \n     simple tax classification.\n       As stated earlier, OMNIBANK receives consistent requests \n     from day care centers, most of which are non-profit. I \n     believe that a Pilot Program as proposed, will prove that \n     these are viable and valuable businesses.

Cripe,\n     President and Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Neighborhood Business Builders,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 10, 2002.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Senator Kerry, I am writing on behalf of \n     Neighborhood Business Builders and the Jewish Vocational \n     Service of Boston in support of legislation to expand \n     availability of SBA 504 loans to non-profit child care \n     centers.\n       I am currently the Director of Loan Funds at Neighborhood \n     Business Builders, which is an economic development program \n     and US SBA Intermediary Microlender. I have been lending and \n     consulting to small businesses for the past year after \n     fifteen years in the private sector as founder of three \n     different companies in Boston and Los Angeles. I have an MPA \n     from the Kennedy School at Harvard University.\n       I am on Senator Kerry's Child Care and Small Business \n     Advisory Committee, and am Co-chair of the Sub Committee on \n     Family Child Care.\n       I support legislative change to the 504 loan program \n     because our committee has uncovered a need for government \n     support of non-profit child care centers. The basic reason \n     for this is that, while we recognize a demand for child care \n     in every part of the country, we do not consider that the \n     market fails to profitably supply child care in every part of \n     the country.\n       For-profit entities are able to access the capital they \n     need by (1) Demonstrating demand for the service provided and \n     (2) Demonstrating ability to serve market rate debt with \n     acceptable risk. Non-profit centers emerge when (1) \n     Demonstrated demand for the service is evident but (2) The \n     market will not support the true cost of the service \n     provided. These non-profit centers are unable to access \n     traditional forms of capital because they cannot demonstrate \n     an ability to service debt at an acceptable risk.\n       The SBA 504 loan program would help mitigate the risk to \n     lenders who will then be able to provide the necessary \n     capital for the service that we know is in demand. The tax \n     status of a child care center should be irrelevant, since the \n     501(C)3 status is only granted when there is evidence of a \n     public good being provided.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Eric Korsh,\n     Director of Loan Funds, Neighborhood Business Builders.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Western Massachusetts\n\n\n                                         Enterprise Fund Inc.,\n\n                                    Greenfield, MA, July 12, 2002.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing in strong support of the \n     legislation to expand the use of the SBA 504 program to \n     include the financing of non-profit children centers.\n       As a member of Senator Kerry's Childcare Advisory Committee \n     and the Executive Director of the Western Massachusetts \n     Enterprise Fund (which makes loans to non-profits), I have \n     seen a clear need for both more flexible and lower cost \n     financing.\n       The SBA 504 program meets both those needs. By providing up \n     to 40 percent financing, the SBA 504 program can help \n     children centers more easily leverage bank financing. \n     Additionally, the program offers highly competitive interest \n     rates.\n       Finally, allowing the SBA to make loans to non-profit \n     childcare centers is not new to the agency. The SBA is \n     already making working capital loans to non-profit childcare \n     centers through its Microenterprise Loan Fund Program.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christopher Sikes,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                The Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n\n                Executive Office of Health and Human Services,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 11, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry:\n       The Massachusetts Office of Child Care Services (OCCS) \n     fully supports expansion of the SBA 504 loan program to \n     include non-profit child care programs. OCCS is the state's \n     licensing agency responsible for setting and enforcing strong \n     health, safety and education standards for child care \n     programs throughout the Commonwealth. OCCS is also the lead \n     state agency responsible for the administration and purchase \n     of all human services child care subsidies across the state. \n     As a result, this agency is greatly invested in the viability \n     of these child care programs and in increasing the capacity \n     of child care services to benefit more families in the \n     Commonwealth.\n       Currently there are approximately 17,000 licensed child \n     care facilities in the Commonwealth which can provide \n     services to over 200,000 children. Many of these facilities \n     are non-profit programs \\1\\ that serve low-income families \n     that are receiving child care subsidies to help them become \n     or remain employed, and families that are or were receiving \n     TANF. The availability and accessibility of child care is one \n     of the main reasons that families can continue to \n     successfully transition from welfare to work. There are \n     currently approximately 18,000 children on the waiting list \n     for a child care subsidy. The reauthorization of TANF may \n     further increase the number of families seeking subsidized \n     child care and Massachusetts must be ready to provide quality \n     care. Accordingly, current and future non-profit programs \n     will greatly benefit from the expansion of the SBA 504 loan \n     program, as will the families that they serve.\n       OCCS is a member of the Advisory Committee on Child Care \n     and Small Business and fully supports the Committee's mission \n     of uniting the small business and child care communities to \n     help providers maximize their income while providing quality \n     child care. Expansion of the SBA 504 loan program will \n     undoubtedly help expand the availability and accessibility of \n     quality child\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n     care. Thank you for your support of this important \n     legislation. If I can be of further assistance please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ardith Wieworka,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            South Eastern Economic\n\n\n                                      Development Corporation,\n\n                                       Taunton, MA, July 10, 2002.\n     Re: Non Profit Child Care Center Eligibility Under the SBA \n         504 Program\n\n     Chairman John Kerry,\n     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As a member of the Advisory Committee \n     on Child Care and Small Business as well as Vice President at \n     South Eastern Economic Development (SEED) Corporation, I am \n     writing in support of the idea of expanding the SBA 504 \n     program to allow for non profit child care centers to be \n     eligible for financing under the program. SEED Corporation is \n     a Certified Development Company certified and accredited to \n     administer the SBA 504 program throughout southeastern \n     Massachusetts. Over the past 2 years, SEED has been the \n     number one SBA 504 lender in the State. SEED is also an \n     approved SBA Microenterprise Intermediary and we have enjoyed \n     and made use of the ability to provide micro loans to non-\n     profit child care businesses since the microenterprise \n     intermediary legislation made the special provision for non \n     profit child care providers to be eligible for SBA micro loan \n     funds. My primary responsibilities at SEED include \n     origination, underwriting and closing SBA 504 loans as well \n     as the oversight and development of SEED's micro loan and \n     business assistance activities.\n       Over the past five years, SEED has assisted over 10 FOR-\n     PROFIT child care businesses to obtain SBA 504 financing for \n     their start-up or expansion projects. However, we have also \n     had to turn away an equal number of non-profit child care \n     centers that were seeking similar assistance due to the fact \n     that non profit entities are not eligible under the SBA 504 \n     program.\n       As we have learned from discussions and analysis within the \n     Advisory Committee on Child Care and Small Business, access \n     to long term, fixed market or below-market rate financing is \n     essential to any child care center. The slim margins that \n     characterize this industry limit any child care center's \n     ability to grow. The SBA 504 program offers the type of fixed \n     rate financing that not only assists the business to keep its \n     occupancy costs under control but also serves to stabilize \n     its operations over the long term. The program also provides \n     an incentive to a bank to provide fixed asset financing to a \n     business that might not otherwise be able to afford a \n     conventional commercial mortgage. The non-profit child care \n     centers provide the same quality of care as the for-profit \n     centers. Preventing non-profit child care center from making \n     use of the SBA 504 program when their for profit competitiors \n     are able to do results in discrimination against the children \n     they serve, and, in general, the majority of child care \n     centers operating in our state's neediest areas are non-\n     profit.\n       For these reasons, I would like to support your efforts to \n     expand the SBA 504 program enabling non-profit child care \n     centers to be eligible for fixed asset financing under the \n     504 program. Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Heather Danton,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   ACCION USA,\n\n                                         Boston, MA, June 8, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry:\n       My name is Erika Eurkus, and as a member of your Advisory \n     Committee on Child Care and Small Business, I writing to \n     voice my support of expanding the SBA 504 loan program to \n     include nonprofit child care centers.\n       I am the greater Boston program director for ACCION USA, a \n     nonprofit ``micro'' lender whose mission is to make access to \n     credit a permanent resource to low- and moderate-income small \n     business owners in the United States--helping to narrow the \n     income gap and provide economic opportunity to small business \n     owners throughout the country. Many of the struggling \n     entrepreneurs we serve are the owners of small, family-based \n     day care centers.\n       At ACCION, I regularly come into contact with women and men \n     whose dream is to operate a successful child care center--to \n     provide a service to the community while making a better life \n     from something they love to do. Often, what keeps these \n     hardworking entrepreneurs from fully realizing that dream is \n     a lack of working capital to begin and grow their businesses. \n     Microlenders like ACCION are the only place they can turn for \n     the crucial capital they need for their businesses. Mauro \n     Leija, an ACCION client in San Antonio, Texas, has tried--and \n     failed--to secure capital from commercial banks. ``The loan \n     officer at the bank said, `Be realistic--you'll never get a \n     loan. You have no college diploma, no capital, no history \n     with any bank,' '' Mauro remembers. This lack of economic \n     opportunity is too often the reality for countless child care \n     providers--most of whom earn an average of $3 per hour for \n     their services.\n       With increased access to capital through the expansion of \n     the SBA 504 loan program, small, nonprofit day care centers \n     can continue to provide their valuable services to the \n     community--and build a better life for their own families at \n     the same time. Suzanne Morris of Springfield, Massachusetts, \n     a longtime ACCION USA borrower, already illustrates the \n     potential successes that an expanded SBA 504--and an \n     opportunity for capital--will bring to day care owners across \n     the country. After years of hard work and several small loans \n     from ACCION, Suzanne has moved her day care out of the home \n     and has expanded her staff to include seven members of the \n     community. The business supports her family of four. She also \n     gives back by training other local home-based day care \n     providers in federal nutrition guidelines.\n       It is my hope that we can all witness more successes like \n     those of Suzanne by opening the door to funding for small day \n     care providers. Please include nonprofit child care centers \n     in the scope of SBA 504.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Erika Eurkus,\n     Greater Boston Program Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Guild of St. Agnes,\n\n\n                                          Child Care Programs,\n\n                                      Worcester, MA, July 3, 2002.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry, It has come to my attention that your \n     committee is working on legislation that would expand the SBA \n     504 loan program to non-profit child care centers.\n       As the Executive Director of the Guild of St. Agnes Child \n     Care Agency and a member of The Advisory Committee on Child \n     Care and Small Business, I wholeheartedly support this \n     legislation. The Guild of St. Agnes is a non-profit child \n     care agency providing child care in Worcester, MA and its \n     surrounding towns. Presently we care for 1200 children aged \n     four weeks to twelve years in child care centers, family care \n     provider's home and public schools. Of our seven centers, we \n     currently own one.\n       Four of our centers are in old, worn-down buildings, \n     causing us difficulty in recruiting new clients. As we look \n     towards the future, the Guild of St. Agnes has set a goal of \n     replacing these centers with new buildings. In order to \n     accomplish this goal, we need to look for creative funding \n     sources to support our capital campaign. The SBA 504 loan \n     program would allow us to invest 10% of our own funds for \n     capital expenses, borrow 50% from the government and secure a \n     bank loan for 40%. Not only is this loan program attractive \n     to banking institutions, it allows child care agencies like \n     the Guild of St. Agnes to continue to grow during these \n     economically challenging times.\n       I urge you to support the SBA 504 loan program legislation. \n     The future of non-profit child care agencies such as the \n     Guild of St. Agnes depends on it!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Edward P. Madaus,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2892. A bill to provide economic security for America's workers; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the U.S. is in the midst of another \n``jobless recovery,'' similar to the early 1990s, with the unemployment \nrate showing few signs of falling in the coming months. Over the past \nthree months, the jobless rate has hovered around 6 percent and long-\nterm unemployment levels now exceed those reached in any recent \nrecession. Last month, nearly one in five unemployed workers remained \nout of work for six months or more. Some 150,000 jobs have been lost \nsince the beginning of this year and 8.4 million people are currently \nunemployed.\n  The recent spate of corporate scandals has only made it worse. Sadly, \nEnron and WorldCom were not isolated events of corporate greed that \nhurt America's workers. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs because \nof the disgrace and mistrust company leaders created, or because of \ncompany mismanagement. At Lucent, 77,000 workers were laid off. At \nKmart, 22,000 workers were laid off. At Xerox, over 13,000 workers were \nlaid off. At Tyco, almost 10,000 workers were laid off. At Global \nCrossing, over 9,000 workers were laid off. At Polaroid, over 4,000 \nworkers were laid off.\n  As new corporate scandals lead to additional mass lay-offs and \nAmericans remain unemployed longer, workers are losing their \nunemployment benefits with no hope for a new job in sight. Too many \nlow-wage and part-time workers remain without unemployment benefits. \nAnd benefit levels remain too low to keep families out of poverty in \nmany states. Today, I along with Senators Clinton and Rockefeller, am\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\nintroducing the Economic Security Act 2002 to protect those unemployed \nworkers and reinvigorate the economy.\n  Last year, Senate Democrats responded to the recession with an \nimmediate plan to stimulate the economy and help laid-off workers get \nback on their feet. In March, House Republicans finally relented and we \nextended unemployment benefits for millions of workers. It was a \nsignificant step forward, but it did not go far enough.\n  This week, economists confirmed that recovery is slow at best. \nEconomic growth fell from 5.0 percent in the first quarter of 2002 to \n1.1 percent in the second quarter. Business investment still has not \nrecovered and continues to decline, while the trade deficit soared to \nrecord highs. Job growth, the last area of the economy to recover after \na recession, continues to lag. As hundreds of thousands of workers \nexhaust their extended benefits, it's time to close the gaps in the \nextended benefit program. The Economic Security Act of 2002 will \nprovide additional extended benefits for millions of workers who remain \nunemployed.\n  The bill will also help those workers currently left out of the \nunemployment insurance system, part-time and low-wage workers. Part-\ntime work is a significant part of our modern economy and women and \nlow-wage workers disproportionately comprise the part-time workforce. \nYet, the majority of states do not provide benefits to unemployed \nworkers seeking part-time work. The twenty States that already provide \nbenefits to unemployed part-time workers have not found their inclusion \noverly costly.\n  In addition, according to the GAO, low-wage workers are half as \nlikely to receive unemployment benefits than other unemployed workers, \neven though low-wage workers as twice as likely to be unemployed. In \nall but 12 States, most unemployed low-wage workers are not eligible \nfor benefits because their most recent earnings are not counted. \nFailing to count a worker's most recent earnings not only denies \nunemployed workers benefits, but also cuts down on the duration and \namount of benefits that some unemployed workers receive.\n  These part-time and low-wage workers pay into the unemployment \nsystem, but fail to receive benefits. In January, Democratic Senators \nwere joined by ten of our Republican colleagues in a vote to provide \ntemporary benefits to part-time and low-wage workers, as well as \nincreasing benefit levels and extending benefits. The Economic Security \nAct of 2002 incorporates these important provisions.\n  Too often, those who receive unemployment find that unemployment \nchecks are not sufficient to meet basic needs. In some states, the \nmaximum weekly benefit amount is less than the poverty level for a one-\nparent, two-child family. Raising benefit levels helps families stay \nout of poverty and invests more in the economy. After all, unemployed \nworkers immediately spend unemployment insurance benefits in their \ncommunities, providing immediate economic stimulus. This bill would \ngive a boost to workers and the economy by raising temporary extended \nbenefit levels by the greater of 15 percent or $25 a week.\n  As Americans exhaust their benefits in greater numbers, we must \nensure that all workers can put food on their families' tables and keep \na roof over their heads when jobs are scarce. And we must ensure that \nunemployment insurance serves the purpose for which it was created, to \nserve as a safety net for all workers during tough economic times and \nstimulate economic growth. The Economic Security Act of 2002 will be a \ngiant leap forward for America's workers.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, despite some signs of an improving \neconomy, for hard-working Americans, it is, unfortunately, a ``jobless \nrecovery.'' While we see some positive economic indicators, the \nunemployment rate continues to rise and shows few signs of falling. For \nworking Americans, that is bad news. Too many people are finding \nthemselves without a job, and without a source of income.\n  The Labor Department reports that over the past few months, the \nunemployment rate has hovered around 6 percent, with 8.4 million people \nofficially counted as unemployed. My home State of West Virginia \nreported an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent in June, which is only \nsomewhat higher than the national average, but some of our counties are \nstruggling with unemployment rates in the double digits.\n  Not only are more people being laid off, they are also remaining \nunemployed for longer. From January to May 2002, the proportion of \nunemployed workers who were still looking for work after 27 weeks \nincreased by 41 percent, and unemployment levels now exceed those \nreached in any recent recession. Workers are suffering unemployment for \nlonger periods, and are losing benefits before they can find new jobs. \nIn January 2002, a total of 373,000 workers exhausted their benefits, a \nsizeable 11 percent increase from the same time last year.\n  We faced similar troubles in the early 1990s, when, amidst a \nrecession, Congress enacted an emergency Federal extended benefits \nprogram designed to help unemployed workers and their families. Some \nanalysts suggest that without that program, approximately 70 percent of \nunemployed families would have ended up with incomes below the federal \npoverty line. When our Nation faces such an economic downturn, action \nis essential to help hard-working Americans get back on their feet \nafter a devastating layoff. Now, in the midst of another economic \ndownturn, we must also act to provide American families with the \nassistance they need.\n  I rise today in support of a bill to be introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, that would remedy several flaws in the current \nunemployment benefits program. This is an enormously important piece of \nlegislation, one that should be enacted immediately for the sake of \nworking families who have been put out of jobs through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  The measure would give States administrative funding so they can \ndistribute benefit checks punctually and accurately. It would ensure \nthat all unemployed workers receive a full 13 weeks of benefits. And it \nwould repeal the 20-weeks-of-work prerequisite to receiving benefits \nthat primarily punishes low-wage workers and newer entrants to the job \nmarket.\n  Beginning in 1986, Federal and State governments began withholding \ntaxes from the benefit checks of all aid recipients. However, no \naccommodations were made to offset these deductions, and recipients saw \na significant reduction in benefits. To ameliorate this problem, \nSenator Kennedy's legislation would raise benefit levels by 15 percent \nor $25 a week, whichever is higher.\n  Finally, a majority of States currently refuse benefits to unemployed \nworkers seeking part-time work. West Virginia does cover part-time \nworkers, but I believe every state should do this as well. Part-time \nwork is an enormously important component of our economy, particularly \nas it involves large numbers of women and low-wage earners. Senator \nKennedy's bill would require states to base eligibility on a worker's \nmost recent earnings. This seemingly technical provision would greatly \nexpand eligibility to benefits for many workers, in my state, and \nacross the country.\n  Millions of Americans are still struggling, and they do not have a \nsteady source of income. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to \nreform America's unemployment insurance program; it is urgently needed \nand should be passed with great haste. This bill is the right thing to \ndo for working Americans, and it is an essential measure for those \nstill suffering from the effects of our uncertain economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2893. A bill to provide that certain Bureau of Land Management \nland shall be held in trust for the Pueblo of Santa Clara and the \nPueblo of San Ildefonso in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nBingaman in introducing legislation that declares the United States \nholds certain public domain lands in trust for the Pueblos of San \nIldefonso and Santa Clara in New Mexico.\n  In 1988 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), pursuant to the Federal \nLands Policy and Management Act, declared approximately 4,484 acres \nlocated in the eastern foothills of the Jemez Mountains in north \ncentral New\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\nMexico, including portions of Garcia and Chupadero Canyons, to be \n``disposal property.'' The Garcia Canyon surplus lands qualify for \ndisposal partially because the tract is an isolated tract of land \nalmost inaccessible to the general public. It is surrounded on three \nsides by the reservations of Santa Clara Pueblo and the Pueblo of San \nIldefonso, and by U.S. Forest Service land on the remaining side. The \nonly road access consists of unimproved roads through the two Pueblo's \nreservations. These factors have resulted in minimal or no public usage \nof the Garcia Canyon surplus lands in recent decades.\n  I understand that currently there are no resource permits, leases, \npatents or claims affecting these lands. It is unlikely that any \nsignificant minerals exist with the Garcia Canyon transfer lands. The \nGarcia Canyon transfer lands contain a limited amount of lesser quality \nforage for livestock and have not been actively grazed for over a \ndecade. However, the Garcia Canyon surplus lands constitute an \nimportant part of the ancestral homelands of the Pueblos of Santa Clara \nand San Ildefonso.\n  Santa Clara and San Ildefonso are two of the Tewa-speaking federally-\nrecognized Indian Pueblos of New Mexico. Both Pueblos have occupied and \ncontrolled the areas where they are presently located since many \ncenturies before the arrival of the first Europeans in the area in late \n16th century. Their homelands are defined by geographical landmarks, \ncultural sites, and other distinct places whose traditional Tewa names \nand locations have been known and passed down in each Pueblo through \nthe generations. Based upon these boundaries, about 2,000 acres of the \nGarcia Canyon surplus lands is within the aboriginal domain of the \nPueblo of San Ildefonso. The remaining lands, approximately 2,484 acres \nare in Santa Clara's aboriginal lands.\n  The Bureau of Land Management currently seeks to dispose of the \nGarcia Canyon surplus lands and the Pueblos of Santa Clara and San \nIldefonso seek to obtain these lands. In addition, the BLM and Interior \nDepartment for years have supported the transfer of the land to the two \nPueblos, provided the Pueblos agree upon a division of the Garcia \nCanyon surplus lands. In response, the two Pueblos signed a formal \nagreement affirming the boundary between their respective parcels on \nDecember 20, 2000.\n  The Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso have worked diligently \nin arriving at this agreement. They have also worked collaboratively in \nseeking community support and garnering supporting resolutions from Los \nAlamos, Rio Arriba and Santa Fe Counties, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians and supporting letters from the National Audubon \nSociety's New Mexico State Office, the Quivira Coalition and the Santa \nFe Group of the Sierra Club.\n  This unique situation presents a win-win opportunity to support more \nefficient management of public resources while restoring to tribal \ncontrol isolated tracts of federal disposal property. Upon transfer, \nthe Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso intend to maintain these \nlands in their natural state and use them for sustainable traditional \npurposes including cultural resource gathering, hunting and possibly \nlivestock grazing. Where appropriate, both tribes are interested in \nperforming work to restore and improve ecosystem health, particularly \nto support habitat for culturally significant animal and plant species. \nBoth Pueblos have experienced Natural Resource Management and \nEnvironmental Protection programs and are capable of managing these \nlands for both ecologic health and community benefits.\n  We want to secure Congressional authorization to transfer control of \nthese lands to the two Pueblos, with legal title being held in trust by \nthe Secretary of Interior for each of the Pueblos for their respective \nportions of the property. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the security of the United States by \nprotecting seaports, and for other purposes; to the Committee, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nComprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002 to protect \nagainst terrorist attacks on or through our Nation's seaports. I would \nlike to thank Senators Kyl, Hutchison, and Snowe for joining me in \nsponsoring this bill.\n  Currently, our seaports are the gaping hole in our Nation's defense \nagainst terrorism. Of the over 18 million shipping containers that \nenter our ports each year, 6 million come from overseas. However, only \n1 or 2 percent of these containers are inspected, and inspections \nalmost invariably occur after the containers arrive in the United \nStates.\n  The problem is that single container could contain 60,000 pounds of \nexplosives, 10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow \nup the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma city, and a single container \nship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time. Containers \ncould easily be exploited to detonate a bomb that would destroy a \nbridge, seaport, or other critical infrastructure, causing mass \ndestruction and killing thousands.\n  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' \ncould also be installed in a container and shipped to the United \nStates. The odds that the container would never be inspected. And, even \nif the container was inspected, it would be too late. The weapon would \nalready be in the United States--most likely near a major population \ncenter.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that terrorists are seeking to exploit \nvulnerabilities at our seaports right now.\n  For example, a recent article in the Bangkok Post notes that ``Al-\nQaeda is among international terrorist organisations responsible for an \nincrease in piracy against ships carrying radioactive materials through \nthe Malacca Straits. . . . The terrorist groups' main aims were to \nobtain substances such as uranium and plutonium oxide for use in so-\ncalled dirty bombs.''\n  In addition, any attack on or through a seaport could have \ndevastating economic consequences. Every year U.S. ports handle over \n800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion.\n  Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 \npercent of U.S. trade. Two of the busiest ports in the world are in my \nhome State of California: Los Angeles/Long Beach and at Oakland.\n  We cannot inspect every container coming into the United States, but \nwe can do a better job devoting our attention to cargo that could put \nour national security at risk. The legislation we introduce today will \nensure that we devote the limited resources we do have to inspect cargo \nin the most efficient and effective manner. It will allow us to reduce \nthe size of the haystack to make it easier to find the needle.\n  Since September 11th, the Federal Government has taken steps to \nsecure our airports and our borders, however, we still have not adopted \na blueprint for helping protect America's 361 seaports. While the \nSenate passed S. 1214, a bill written by Senator Hollings last \nDecember, and the House has also passed a port security bill, \nconference negotiations are still ongoing.\n  I hope the conferees will adopt the provisions in this bill before \nthey complete their work in conference because I believe that this bill \nis the only legislation that thoroughly addresses the issue of port \nsecurity from the point cargo is loaded in a foreign country to its \narrival on land in the United States.\n  We have known for a long time that America's ports needed an \nextensive security strategy and upgrade. In the fall of 2000, a \ncomprehensive report was issued by the Interagency Commission on Crime \nand Security in U.S. Seaports. I testified before the commission and I \nbelieve its report makes a number of sensible suggestions on how we can \nimprove security and fight crime at seaports.\n  Before the September 11 terrorist attacks, S. 1214 was drafted to try \nto implement many of the commission's recommendations. Before the bill \npassed the Senate in December 2001, the sponsors made some additional \nchanges to help prevent a terrorist attack. However, I believe that \nthere is much more Congress can do to prevent terrorists from launching \na terrorist attack through our seaports.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will complement the Hollings \nbill and the seaport security legislation passed by the House. \nTogether, I believe the provisions in these three bills will erect a \nformidable security barrier at our seaports.\n  I believe that Al Qaeda is planning to attack the United States again \nsoon and that it may well try to do so through a U.S. seaport. Indeed, \nthe Al Qaeda training manual specifically mentions seaports as a point \nof vulnerability in our security.\n  In addition, we know that Al Qaeda has succeeded in attacking \nAmerican interests at and through seaports in the past. Let me mention \nsome examples.\n  In June, the FBI issued a warning for Americans to be on the lookout \nfor suspicious people wanting training in scuba diving or trying to \nrent underwater gear. Law enforcement officials fear that Al Qaeda \noperatives could try to blow up ships at anchor or other waterfront \ntargets.\n  In May the FBI received reports that Al Qaeda terrorists may be \nmaking their way toward Southern California from a Middle Eastern port \nvia merchant ships. Catalina Island--22 miles off the coast of Los \nAngles, was mentioned as a possible destination for about 40 Al Qaeda \nterrorists.\n  In October 2001, Italian authorities found an Egyptian man suspected \nfor having ties to Al Qaeda in a container bound for Canada. He had \nfalse identifications, maps of airports, a computer, a satellite \nphones, cameras, and plenty of cash on hand.\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\n  In October 2000, Al Qaeda operatives successfully carried out a \ndeadly bombing attack against the U.S.S. Cole in the port of Yemen.\n  In 1998, Al Qaeda bombed the American Embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania. Evidence suggests that the explosives the terrorists used \nwere shipped to them by sea. And the investigation of the embassy \nbombings concluded that Bin Laden has close financial tries to various \nshipping companies.\n  I believe that this legislation would go far to make the United \nStates less vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The main provisions will: \n1. Establish a risk profiling plan for the Customs Service to focus \ntheir limited inspection capabilities on high-risk cargo and \ncontainers, and 2. Push U.S. security scrutiny beyond our Nation's \nborders to monitor and inspect cargo and containers before they arrive \nnear America's shores.\n  These provisions complement and extend a strategy Customs \nCommissioner Robert C. Bonner is already in the process of \nimplementing. To prevent a weapon of mass destruction from getting to \nthe U.S. in the first place, Customs has entered into formal agreements \nwith a handful of foreign governments to station U.S. inspectors at \nports overseas to profile high risk cargo and target suspicious \nshipments for inspection.\n  The Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act will also: \nDesignate an official at each U.S. port as the primary authority \nresponsible for security. This will enable all parties involved in \nbusiness at a port to understand who has final say on all security \nmatters.\n  Require the FBI to collect and make available data relating to crime \nat and affecting seaports. With more data, law enforcement agencies \nwill be able to better identify patterns and weaknesses at particular \nports.\n  Require ports to provide space to Customs so that the agency is able \nto use its non-intrusive inspection technology. In many cases, Customs \nhas to keep this technology outside the port and bring it in every day, \nwhich prevents some of the best inspection technology, which is not \nportable, from being used.\n  Give Customs responsibility of licensing and overseeing regulated \nintermediaries in the international trade process, these intermediaries \nhandle over 80 percent of all cargo in international trade. Currently, \nthe U.S. Federal Maritime Commission oversees most of these \nintermediaries, but Customs will have more resources to oversee this \nregulation.\n  Require shippers bound for U.S. ports to transmit their cargo \nmanifests with more detailed information at least 24 hours prior to \ndeparting from a foreign port.\n  Impose steep monetary sanctions for failure to comply with \ninformation filing requirements, including filing incorrect \ninformation, the current penalty is only a maximum of $1000 or $5000, \ndepending on the offense. The Seaport Commission found that about half \nof the information on ship manifests was inaccurate.\n  Require all port employees to have biometric smart identification \ncards.\n  Restrict private vehicle access to ports.\n  Prohibit guns and explosives at ports, except when authorized.\n  Mandate that radiation detection pagers be issued to each inspector.\n  Requires the Transportation Security Administration to set standards \nto ensure each port has a secure port perimeter, secure parking \nfacilities, controlled points of access into the port, sufficient \nlighting, buildings with secure doors and windows and an alarm.\n  Require all ports to keep sensitive information on the port secure \nand protected. Such information would include, but not be limited to \nmaps, blueprints, and information on the Internet.\n  Require the use of high security seals on all containers coming into \nthe U.S.\n  Require that each container to be transported through U.S. ports \nreceive a universal transaction number that could be used to track \ncontainer movement from origin to destination. Require shippers to have \nsimilar universal numbers.\n  Require all empty containers destined for U.S. ports to be secured.\n  Fund pilot programs to develop high-tech seals and sensors, including \nthose that would provide real-time evidence of container tampering to a \nmonitor at a terminal.\n  I believe that Congress should act quickly on this legislation. This \nbill could very well prevent the arrival or detonation of a nuclear \n``suitcase bomb'' or radiological ``dirty bomb'' at a U.S. seaport-an \nattack that could bring U.S. seaborne commerce to a grinding halt, \nleaving our economy and national security in shambles.\n  In closing, I want to thank staff at the Customs Service, \nTransportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and various ports \nfor their helpful comments on this legislation. I also want to thank a \n``working group'' of experts I assembled for their suggestions \nregarding the bill. These experts included former government officials, \nindustry executives, and security consultants.\n  I also want to thank Senator Hollings and the other members of the \nCommerce Committee for the work they have done on the port security \nissue. I have spoken to Senator Hollings about the bill I am \nintroducing today, and my staff is working with his staff and with the \nstaff of other conferees to come up with comprehensive seaport security \nlegislation.\n  I hope that the legislation ultimately adopted by the conference \nincludes the Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002. \nI would urge the conferees to work quickly to draft a final bill that \nwe can send to the President's desk before September 11.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 134\n\n       Whereas while our society has developed highly effective \n     means of speedy communication around the world, it has failed \n     to ensure communication around the world and among \n     individuals who live side by side;\n       Whereas the endurance of human values and consideration for \n     others is of prime importance if civilization is to survive; \n     and\n       Whereas being good neighbors to those around us is the \n     first step toward human understanding: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should--\n       (1) issue a proclamation designating the fourth Sunday of \n     each September as ``National Good Neighbor Day''; and\n       (2) call upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups and organizations to observe such day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I introduce a resolution to designate the \nfourth Sunday of each September as National Good Neighbor Day.\n  Back in the 1970's, a wonderful lady from Montana named Becky Mattson \ncame up with the idea of National Good Neighbor Day. She observed that \ntechnology was allowing the world to grow closer together. Television \nallowed individuals to learn about new cultures and ways of life. Wide \nuse of the telephone was allowing people to communicate from across the \nglobe. However, people were becoming less likely to get to know their \nnext-door neighbor.\n  She concluded that, as a nation, we should place greater emphasis on \nthe importance of community and being a good neighbor. Becky believed \nthat kids who were taught to be good neighbors would become adults who \nwere good neighbors and that a day dedicated to this cause would be a \ncatalyst to encourage families to be good neighbors.\n  Becky was successful in her efforts and with the help of the late \nSenator Mansfield, three presidents--President Carter, President Ford, \nand President Nixon proclaimed the fourth Sunday of September National \nGood Neighbor Day.\n  Now, in the aftermath of the events of September 11, Americans have \nunited in an unprecedented way. Strangers, friends, colleagues, \nclassmates, and family have exhibited the best of the human spirit in \nthe face of enormous tragedy. From the firefighters and rescue workers \nin New York City and at the Pentagon to the second graders who have \nheld bake sales to raise money for the families of victims, Americans \nhave defined the meaning of a good neighbor.\n  Now, when illustrating the definition of a good neighbor means more \nthan ever before, both Becky and I believe that National Good Neighbor \nDay should be made permanent. Having a day designated to being a good \nneighbor will reinforce the strength of our communities and show our \nresolve to be united as a nation. I thank the co-sponsors to this \nresolution--Senators Burns, Miller, Levin, Cochran, Clinton, Landrieu, \nand Johnson and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it.

Res. 135\n\n       Whereas the United States and Canada have, since 1989, \n     worked to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers to trade;\n       Whereas free trade has greatly benefitted the United States \n     and Canadian economies;\n       Whereas the U.S. International Trade Commission only found \n     the potential for a Threat of Injury (as opposed to actual \n     injury) to domestic lumber producers but the Department of \n     Commerce imposed a 27 percent duty on U.S. lumber consumers;\n       Whereas trade restrictions on Canadian lumber exported to \n     the U.S. market have been an exception to the general rule of \n     bilateral free trade;\n       Whereas the legitimate interests of consumers are often \n     overlooked in trade disputes;\n       Whereas the availability of the affordable housing is \n     important to American home buyers and the need for the \n     availability of such housing, particularly in metropolitan \n     cities across America, is growing faster than it can be met;\n       Whereas imposition of special duties on U.S. consumers of \n     softwood lumber, essential for construction of on-site and \n     manufactured homes, jeopardizes housing affordability, and\n       Whereas the United States has agreed to abide by dispute \n     settlement procedures in the World Trade Organization and the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement, providing for \n     international review of national remedy actions; and,\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization and North American \n     Free Trade Agreement dispute panels are reviewing findings by \n     the ITC: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), that it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) The Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade \n     Representative should work to assure that no delays occur in \n     resolving the current disputes before the NAFTA and WTO \n     panels, supporting a fair and expeditious review;\n       (2) U.S. anti-dumping and countervail law is a rules-based \n     system that should proceed to conclusion in WTO and NAFTA \n     trade panels;\n       (3) The President should continue discussions with the \n     Government of Canada to promote open trade between the United \n     States and Canada on softwood lumber free of trade restraints \n     that harm consumers;\n       (4) The President should consult with all stakeholders, \n     including consumers of lumber products in future discussions \n     regarding any terms of trade in softwood lumber between the \n     United States and Canada.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 136--REQUESTING THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE A \nPROCLAMATION IN OBSERVANCE OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF \n      THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Burns) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 136\n\n       Whereas on September 17, 1902, when Theodore Roosevelt was \n     President, 8 wildlife managers and game wardens from 6 States \n     met in West Yellowstone, Montana, on behalf of the country's \n     beleaguered fish and wildlife populations, and established \n     the National Association of Game and Fish Wardens and \n     Commissioners, which later became the International \n     Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA);\n       Whereas 100 years later, IAFWA represents the fish and \n     wildlife agencies of all 50 States and enjoys the membership \n     of several Federal natural resource agencies, the Federal and \n     provincial fish and wildlife agencies of Canada, and the \n     Federal natural resource agency of Mexico;\n       Whereas IAFWA has been a significant force in the enactment \n     of fish and wildlife conservation treaties and Federal \n     statutes too numerous to enumerate, including the Migratory \n     Bird Treaty Act; the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \n     Act; the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish Restoration Act; all farm \n     bills enacted since 1985; the North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Act; the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     Improvement Act of 1997, and the Fish and Wildlife Programs \n     Improvement and National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial \n     Act of 2000, to mention but a few;\n       Whereas IAFWA continues to promote the sustainable use of \n     natural resources, to encourage cooperation and coordination \n     of fish and wildlife conservation and management at all \n     levels of government; to encourage professional management of \n     fish and wildlife; to develop coalitions among conservation \n     organizations to promote fish and wildlife interests; and to \n     foster public understanding of the need for conservation; and\n       Whereas the State fish and wildlife agencies have \n     successfully restored healthy fish and wildlife populations \n     enjoyed by all Americans largely using Federal excise taxes \n     paid by hunters and anglers into the Federal trust funds \n     known as the Pittman-Robertson, Dingell-Johnson, and Wallop-\n     Breaux trust funds, and using State hunting and fishing \n     license fees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the centennial of the \n     establishment of the entity that became the International \n     Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies;\n       (2) acknowledges the outstanding contributions of its \n     members agencies to fish and wildlife conservation; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     observing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the \n     International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 137--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n THE FEDERAL MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE SHOULD EXERT ITS BEST \nEFFORTS TO CAUSE THE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION AND THE \n OWNERS OF THE TEAMS OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT \n TO CONTINUE TO PLAY PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL GAMES WITHOUT ENGAGING IN A \nSTRIKE, TO LOCKOUT, OR ANY CONDUCT THAT INTERFERES WITH THE PLAYING OF \n                 SCHEDULED PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL GAMES\n\n  Mr. MILLER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 137\n\n       Whereas major league baseball is a national institution and \n     is commonly referred to as ``the national pastime'';\n       Whereas major league baseball and its players played a \n     critical role in restoring America's spirit following the \n     tragic events of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas major league baseball players are role models to \n     millions of young Americans; and\n       Whereas while the financial issues involved in this current \n     labor negotiation are significant, they pale in comparison to \n     the damage that will be caused by a strike or work stoppage: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, on its own motion \n     and in accordance with section 203(b) of the Labor Management \n     Relations Act, 1947 (29 U.S.C. 173(b)), should immediately--\n       (1) proffer its services to the Major League Baseball \n     Players Association and the owners of the teams of Major \n     League Baseball to resolve labor contract disputes relating \n     to entering into a collective bargaining agreement; and\n       (2) use its best efforts to bring the parties to agree to \n     such contract without engaging in a strike, a lockout, or any \n     other conduct that interferes with the playing of scheduled \n     professional baseball games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S7966-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7966-S7967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4467.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drug costs are increasing at an alarming \n     rate and are a major worry of American families and senior \n     citizens;\n       (2) enhancing competition between generic drug \n     manufacturers and brand-name manufacturers can significantly \n     reduce prescription drug costs for American families;\n       (3) the pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals, \n     but competition must be further stimulated and strengthened;\n       (4) the Federal Trade Commission has discovered that there \n     are increasing opportunities for drug companies owning \n     patents on brand-name drugs and generic drug companies to \n     enter into private financial deals in a manner that could \n     restrain trade and greatly reduce competition and increase \n     prescription drug costs for consumers;\n       (5) generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of scientific testing and \n     other information establishing that pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the use of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals could save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n       (B) generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent and 60 \n     percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, resulting in an \n     estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on each prescription;\n       (7) generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office;\n       (8) expanding access to generic pharmaceuticals can help \n     consumers, especially senior citizens and the uninsured, have \n     access to more affordable prescription drugs;\n       (9) Congress should ensure that measures are taken to \n     effectuate the amendments made by the Drug Price Competition \n     and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 1585) \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Hatch-Waxman Act'') to \n     make generic drugs more accessible, and thus reduce health \n     care costs; and\n       (10) it would be in the public interest if patents on drugs \n     for which applications are approved under section 505(c) of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(c)) \n     were extended only through the patent extension procedure \n     provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act rather than through the \n     attachment of riders to bills in Congress.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to increase competition, thereby helping all Americans, \n     especially seniors and the uninsured, to have access to more \n     affordable medication; and\n       (2) to ensure fair marketplace practices and deter \n     pharmaceutical companies (including generic companies) from \n     engaging in anticompetitive action or actions that tend to \n     unfairly restrain trade.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, may turn to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 150, H.R. 2563, and the bill be \nconsidered under these limitations: Immediately after the bill is \nreported S. 1052 be passed by the Senate in lieu thereof; that no other \namendments be in order, the bill, as amended, be read three times, and \nthere then be 60 minutes of debate with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg or their \ndesignees, and that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage the Senate insist \non its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate without any intervening \naction or debate, with the ratio of conference being 6 to 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have just received this \nnotification tonight. We haven't consulted with everyone on our side. \nWe have really no objection to appointing conferees. We just have to \nwork it out.\n  I will mention that the House passed this bill a year ago tomorrow on \nAugust 2. So we have been waiting to have conferees appointed for \nalmost a year--364 days. We will be happy to do that. But since we just \ngot this notification, and the majority wanted to do this, we have to \nconsult with various interests and parties. We haven't had time to do \nthat in the rush of business today.\n  We will cooperate with the majority to get this done early when we \nreturn. But, at this point, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have only to say that it doesn't matter. \nWe have been busy here for the last 2 days, but they got the stuff \nyesterday. I understand the Senator's position. We wish we could go \nforward on this. There could be work done on the break. But we will \nwork it out when we come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Adak Island is an isolated island located 1,200 miles \n     southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, between the Pacific Ocean and \n     the Bering Sea. The Island, with its unique physical and \n     biological features, including a deep water harbor and \n     abundant marine-associated wildlife, was recognized early for \n     both its natural and military values. In 1913, Adak Island \n     was reserved and set aside as a Preserve because of its value \n     to seabirds, marine mammals, and fisheries. Withdrawals of \n     portions of Adak Island for various military purposes date \n     back to 1901 and culminated in the 1959 withdrawal of \n     approximately half of the Island for use by the Department of \n     the Navy for military purposes.\n       (2) By 1990, military development on Adak Island supported \n     a community of 6,000 residents. Outside of the Adak Naval \n     Complex, there was no independent community on Adak Island.\n       (3) As a result of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \n     Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 1808), as amended, the Adak Naval \n     Complex has been closed by the Department of Defense.\n       (4) The Aleut Corporation is an Alaskan Native Regional \n     Corporation incorporated in the State of Alaska pursuant to \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), as amended \n     (43 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.). The Aleut Corporation represents \n     the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands who prior to \n     the Russian exploration and settlement of the Aleutian \n     Islands were found throughout the Aleutian Islands which \n     includes Adak Island.\n       (5) None of Adak Island was available for selection by The \n     Aleut Corporation under section 14(h)(8) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. \n     1613(h)(8)) because it was part of a National Wildlife Refuge \n     and because the portion comprising the Adak Naval Complex was \n     withdrawn for use by the United States Navy for military \n     purposes prior to the passage of ANCSA in December 1971.\n       (6) The Aleut Corporation is attempting to establish a \n     community on Adak and has offered to exchange ANCSA land \n     selections and entitlements for conveyance of certain lands \n     and interests therein on a portion of Adak formerly occupied \n     by the Navy.\n       (7) Removal of a portion of the Adak Island land from \n     refuge status will be offset by the acquisition of high \n     quality wildlife habitat in other Aleut Corporation \n     selections within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife \n     Refuge, maintaining a resident human population on Adak to \n     control caribou, and making possible a continued U.S. Fish \n     and Wildlife Service presence in that remote location to \n     protect the natural resources of the Aleutian Islands Unit of \n     the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\n       (8) It is in the public interest to promote reuse of the \n     Adak Island lands by exchanging certain lands for lands \n     selected by The Aleut Corporation elsewhere in the Alaska \n     Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Experience with \n     environmental problems associated with formerly used defense \n     sites in the State of Alaska suggests that the most effective \n     and efficient way to avoid future environmental problems on \n     Adak is to support and encourage active reuse of Adak.\n\n     SEC. 2. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n       The document entitled the ``Agreement Concerning the \n     Conveyance of Property at the Adak Naval Complex'' \n     (hereinafter ``the Agreement''), and dated September 20, \n     2000, executed by The Aleut Corporation, the Department of \n     the Interior and the Department of the Navy, together with \n     any technical amendments or modifications to the boundaries \n     that may be agreed to by the parties is hereby ratified, \n     confirmed, and approved and the terms, conditions, \n     procedures, covenants, reservations, indemnities and other \n     provisions set forth in the Agreement are declared to be \n     obligations and commitments of the United States and The \n     Aleut Corporation: Provided, That modifications to the maps \n     and legal descriptions of lands to be removed from the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System within the military \n     withdrawal on Adak Island set forth in Public Land Order 1949 \n     may be made only upon agreement of all Parties to the \n     Agreement and notification given to the Committee on \n     Resources of the United States House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United \n     States Senate: Provided further, That the acreage conveyed to \n     the United States by The Aleut Corporation under the \n     Agreement, as modified, shall be at least 36,000 acres.\n\n     SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF LANDS FROM REFUGE.\n\n       Effective on the date of conveyance to the Aleut \n     Corporation of the Adak Exchange Lands as described in the \n     Agreement, all such lands shall be removed from the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System and shall neither be considered as \n     part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge nor be \n     subject to any laws pertaining to lands within the boundaries \n     of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, including \n     the conveyance restrictions imposed by section 22(g) of the \n     ANCSA, 43 U.S.C. 1621(g), for land in the National Wildlife \n     Refuge System. The Secretary shall adjust the boundaries of \n     the Refuge so as to exclude all interests in lands and land \n     rights, surface and subsurface, received by The Aleut \n     Corporation in accordance with this Act and the Agreement.\n\n     SEC. 4. ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT.\n\n       Lands and interests therein exchanged and conveyed by the \n     United States pursuant to this Act shall be considered and \n     treated as conveyances of lands or interests therein under \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, except that receipt \n     of such lands and interests therein shall not constitute a \n     sale or disposition of land or interests received pursuant to \n     such Act. The public easements for access to public lands and \n     waters reserved pursuant to the Agreement are deemed to \n     satisfy the requirements and purposes of Section 17(b) of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. REACQUISITION OF LANDS.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire by \n     purchase or exchange, on a willing seller basis only, any \n     land conveyed to The Aleut Corporation under the Agreement \n     and this Act. In the event any of the lands are subsequently \n     acquired by the United States, they shall be automatically \n     included in the Refuge System. The laws and regulations \n     applicable to Refuge lands shall then apply to these lands \n     and the Secretary shall then adjust the boundaries \n     accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 6. GENERAL.\n\n       (a) [Notwithstanding any other provision of law,] \n     Notwithstanding the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 483-484) and the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended \n     (10 U.S.C. 2687), and for the purposes of the transfer of \n     property authorized by this Act, Department of Navy personal \n     property that remains on Adak Island is deemed related to the \n     real property and shall be conveyed by the Department of the \n     Navy to The Aleut Corporation at no additional cost when the \n     related real property is conveyed by the Department of the \n     Interior.\n       (b) The Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the Aleut \n     Corporation those lands identified in the Agreement as the \n     former landfill sites without charge to the Aleut \n     Corporation's entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act.\n       (c) Any property, including, but not limited to, \n     appurtenances and improvements, received pursuant to this Act \n     shall, for purposes of section 21(d) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act, as amended, and section 907(d) of the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, as amended, \n     be treated as not developed until such property is actually \n     occupied, leased (other than leases for nominal consideration \n     to public entities) or sold by The Aleut Corporation, or, in \n     the case of a lease or other transfer by The Aleut \n     Corporation to a wholly owned development subsidiary, \n     actually occupied, leased, or sold by the subsidiary.\n       (d) Upon conveyance to The Aleut Corporation of the lands \n     described in Appendix A of the Agreement, the lands described \n     in Appendix C of the Agreement will become unavailable for \n     selection under ANCSA.\n       (e) The maps included as part of Appendix A to the \n     Agreement depict the lands to be conveyed to The Aleut \n     Corporation.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 388, S. 2487.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2487) to provide for global pathogen \n     surveillance and response.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \ntoday is taking up S. 2487, the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of \n2002.'' This bill authorizes $150 million over the next two fiscal \nyears to provide assistance to developing nations to improve global \ndisease surveillance to help prevent and contain both biological \nweapons attacks and naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks \naround the world.\n  This bill is the result of a joint effort by Senator Helms and I to \nact on key lessons learned during an important hearing the Foreign \nRelations Committee held last September on the\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nthreat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases. I am also \nproud that Senators Kennedy and Frist, the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Public Health Subcommittee of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, are original cosponsors of this bill.\n  Senator Helms and I recognize all too well that biological weapons \nare a global threat with no respect for borders. A terrorist group \ncould launch a biological weapons attack in Mexico in the expectation \nthat the epidemic would quickly spread to the United States. A rogue \nstate might experiment with new disease strains in another country, \nintending later to release them here. A biological weapons threat need \nnot begin in the United States to reach our shores.\n  For that reason, our response to the biological weapons threat cannot \nbe limited to the United States alone. Global disease surveillance, a \nsystematic approach to tracking disease outbreaks as they occur and \nevolve around the world, is essential to any real international \nresponse.\n  This country is making enormous advances on the domestic front in \nbioterrorism defense. Mr. President, $3 billion has been appropriated \nfor this purpose in FY 2002, including $1.1 billion to improve State \nand local public health infrastructure. Delaware's share will include \n$6.7 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \nimprove the public health infrastructure and $548,000 to improve \nhospital readiness in my State.\n  Earlier this year, the President signed into law a comprehensive \nbioterrorism bill drafted last fall following the anthrax attacks via \nthe U.S. postal system. Those attacks, which killed five individuals \nand infected more than 20 people, highlighted our domestic \nvulnerabilities to a biological weapons attack. We need to further \nstrengthen our nation's public health system, improve federal public \nhealth laboratories, and fund the necessary research and procurement \nfor vaccines and treatments to respond better to future bioterrorist \nattacks. As an original cosponsor of the ``Kennedy-Frist'' bill in the \nSenate, I know the implementation of this new law will help achieve \nmany of those objectives.\n  Nevertheless, any effective response to the challenge of biological \nweapons must also have an international component. Limiting our \nresponse to U.S. territory would be shortsighted and doomed to failure. \nA dangerous pathogen released on another continent can quickly spread \nto the United States in a matter of days, if not hours. This is the \ndark side of globalization. International trade, travel, and migration \npatterns offer unlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across \nnational borders and to move from one continent to another. Moreover, \nan overseas epidemic could give us our first warning of a new disease \nstrain that was developed by a country or by terrorists for use as a \nbiological weapon, or that could be used by others for that purpose.\n  How does disease surveillance fit into all of this? A biological \nweapons attack succeeds partly through the element of surprise. A \ncluster of flu-like symptoms in a city or region may be dismissed by \nindividual physicians as just the flu when in fact it may be anthrax, \nplague, or another biological weapon. Armed with the \nknowledge, however, that a biological weapons attack has in fact \noccurred, doctors and nurses can examine their patients in a different \nlight and, in many cases, effectively treat infected individuals.\n\n  Disease surveillance, a comprehensive reporting system to quickly \nidentify and communicate abnormal patterns of symptoms and illnesses, \ncan quickly alert doctors across a region that a suspicious disease \noutbreak has occurred. Epidemiological specialists can then investigate \nand combat the outbreak. And if it is a new disease or strain, we can \nbegin to develop treatments that much earlier.\n  A good surveillance system requires trained epidemiological \npersonnel, adequate laboratory tools for quick diagnosis, and \ncommunications equipment to circulate information. Even in the United \nStates today, many states and localities rely on old-fashioned pencil \nand paper methods of tracking disease patterns. Thankfully, we are \naddressing those domestic deficiencies through the new bioterrorism law \nand substantially increased appropriations.\n  For example, in Delaware, we are developing the first, comprehensive, \nstate-wide electronic reporting system for infectious diseases. This \nsystem will be used as a prototype for other states, and will enable \nmuch earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks, both natural \nand bioterrorist. My congressional colleagues from Delaware and I have \nbeen working for over 2 years to get this project up and running, and \nwe were successful in obtaining $2.6 million in funding for this \nproject over the past 2 years. I and my colleagues have requested $1.4 \nmillion for additional funding in FY 2003, and we are extremely \noptimistic that this funding will be forthcoming.\n  It is vitally important that we extend these initiatives into the \ninternational arena. However, as many developing countries are way \nbehind us in terms of public health resources, laboratories, personnel, \nand communications, these countries will need help just to get to the \nstarting point we have already reached in this country.\n  An effective disease surveillance system is beneficial even in the \nabsence of biological weapons attacks. Bubonic plague is bubonic \nplague, whether it is deliberately engineered or naturally occurring. \nJust as disease surveillance can help contain a biological weapons \nattack, it can also help contain a naturally occurring outbreak of \ninfectious disease. According to the World Health Organization, 30 new \ninfectious diseases have emerged over the past 30 years; between 1996 \nand 2001 alone, more than 800 infectious disease outbreaks occurred \naround the world, on every continent. With better surveillance, we can \ndo a better job of mitigating the consequences of these disease \noutbreaks.\n  According to a report by the National Intelligence Council, \ndeveloping nations in Africa and Asia have established only rudimentary \nsystems, if any at all, for disease surveillance, response, and \nprevention. The World Health Organization reports that more than sixty \npercent of laboratory equipment in developing countries is either \noutdated or nonfunctioning.\n  This lack of preparedness can lead to tragic results. In August 1994 \nin Surat, a city in western India, a surge of complaints on flea \ninfestation and a growing rat population was followed by a cluster of \nreports on patients exhibiting the symptoms of pneumonic plague. \nHowever, authorities were unable to connect the dots until the plague \nhad spread to seven states across India, ultimately killing 56 people \nand costing the Indian economy $600 million. Had the Indian authorities \nemployed better surveillance tools, they may well have contained the \nepidemic, limited the loss of life, and surely avoided the panic that \nled to economically disastrous embargoes on trade and travel. An \noutbreak of pneumonic plague in India this February was detected more \nquickly and contained with only a few deaths--and no costly panic.\n  Developing nations are the weak links in any comprehensive global \ndisease surveillance network. Unless we take action to shore up their \ncapabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we leave the \nentire world vulnerable to a deliberate biological weapons attack or a \nvirulent natural epidemic.\n  It is for these reasons that Senator Helms and I have worked together \nto craft the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002. This bill \nauthorizes $150 million in FY 2003 and FY 2004 to strengthen the \ndisease surveillance capabilities of developing nations. First, the \nbill seeks to ensure in developing nations a greater number of \npersonnel trained in basic epidemiological techniques. It offers \nenhanced in-country training for medical and laboratory personnel and \nthe opportunity for select personnel to come to the United States to \nreceive training in our Centers for Disease Control laboratories and \nMaster of Public Health programs in American universities.\n  Second, the bill provides assistance to developing nations to acquire \nbasic laboratory equipment, including items as mundane as microscopes, \nto facilitate the quick diagnosis of pathogens.\n  Third, the bill enables developing nations to obtain communications \nequipment and information technology to\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nquickly transmit data on disease patterns and pathogen diagnoses, both \ninside a nation and to regional organizations and the WHO. Again, we \nare not talking about fancy high-tech equipment, but basics like fax \nmachines and Internet-equipped computers.\n  Finally, the bill gives preference to countries that agree to let \nexperts from the United States or international organizations promptly \ninvestigate any suspicious disease outbreaks.\n\n  If this bill becomes law, the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of \n2002 will go a long way in ensuring that developing nations acquire the \nbasic disease surveillance capabilities to link up effectively with the \nWHO's global network. This bill offers an inexpensive and common sense \nsolution to a problem of global proportions--the dual threat of \nbiological weapons and naturally occurring infectious diseases. The \nfunding authorized is only a tiny fraction of what we will spend \ndomestically on bioterrorism defenses, but this investment will pay \nenormous dividends in terms of our national security.\n  In addition Senator Helms and I have introduced a managers' \namendment, which I expect will be adopted. This amendment, drafted in \nresponse to specific suggestions by executive branch departments and \nagencies as well as nongovernmental organizations, addresses two \nimportant objectives.\n  First, it ensures that priority in the provision of assistance to \ndeveloping countries under the authority of this bill will be given \nthose nations which agree to provide early notification of disease \noutbreaks. In the past, too many nations have sought to limit the \nrelease of information on disease outbreaks out of fear for the likely \nimpact on their trade and tourism. In today's world, where an epidemic \ncould be the first signs of a biological weapons attack, that type of \nreticence by national governments is simply unacceptable.\n  The amendment also stipulates that priority in assistance under this \nbill be assigned to those countries which agree to share with the \nUnited States data collected through its pathogen suveillance networks. \nOur epidemiological experts at the Centers for Disease Control and \nother U.S. departments and agencies are among the best in the world in \nanalyzing such data. We should strive to create an international \nframework where multilateral organizations, national governments, and \neven private groups can examine aggregrate data on disease \ncharacteristics and symptom reports to help detect emerging patterns \nand provide early warning on alarming developments. In short, the more \ninformation shared under pathogen surveillance, the better protected \nthe world is against surprise bioterrorist attacks and rapid natural \nepidemics.\n  Second, the managers' amendment makes the necessary changes to take \ninto account the need for the quick transmission of data collected \nthrough pathogen surveillance networks to appropriately respond to \nlocal conditions. In the United States and other advanced industrial \nnations, disease surveillance may well operate most efficiently through \nInternet-based communications. In some developing countries, however, \nthe cost of introducing new Internet links and computer equipment may \nbe prohibitive. In those cases, leveraging existing telephone-based \nnetworks may prove a more cost-effective method in quickly relaying \ninformation such as patient reports. Under certain conditions, mobile \nphones may even prove a reliable tool. The managers' amendment will \nprovide for such flexibility.\n  In conclusion, the fundamental premise of the Global Pathogen \nSurveillance Act of 2002 is that we cannot leave the rest of the world \nto fend for itself in combating biological weapons and infectious \ndiseases if we are to ensure America's security. Indeed, this bill can \nserve as a key contribution to strengthening our homeland security. I \nurge the Senate to pass S. 2487 and the related managers' amendment \ntoday.\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the anthrax attacks against the \nSenate and the news media this past fall demanded that we recognize how \nvulnerable America is to bioterroism. The murderous and cowardly \nperpetrators of this terrorism must be brought to justice, but we must \nalso prepare ourselves for other attacks in the future.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senator Biden in co-authoring the \nGlobal Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002, S. 2487, and I am pleased \nthat a bipartisan effort has led to its consideration today.\n  This bill recognizes that bioterrorism is a transnational threat and \nthat the defense of the U.S. homeland is not an isolated activity. \nRather, our homeland defense requires a comprehensive international \nstrategy. A recent National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the \nprospect of a bioterrorist attack against U.S. civilian and military \npersonnel will continue to grow as states and terrorist groups continue \nto acquire biological warfare capabilities. This same report warns that \nemerging and reemerging infectious diseases that originate overseas \nthreaten Americans not only here in the United States, but also our \nmilitary personnel stationed overseas participating in humanitarian and \npeacekeeping operations.\n  On September 5, 2001, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a \nhearing on ``The Threat of Bioterrorism and the Spread of Infectious \nDiseases.'' The compelling testimony of several expert witnesses, along \nwith the assessments of the intelligence community, prompted Senator \nBiden and I to undertake this important legislation with the goal of \ncombating bioterrorism, and ultimately enhancing U.S. national \nsecurity. In order to enhance U.S. efforts to combat bioterrorism, it \nis critical that we address the glaring gap that exists in the \ncapabilities of developing countries to conduct pathogen surveillance \nand monitoring.\n  This legislation authorizes the President a total of $150 million \ndollars over the next 2 years to fund pathogen surveillance and \nresponse activities through the Department of State, in consultation \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of \nDefense. Several provisions are designed to address shortfalls in \npublic health education and training, including short-term public \nhealth training courses in epidemiology for public health professionals \nfrom eligible developing countries. The President is authorized to \nprovide assistance for the purchase and maintenance of public health \nlaboratory and communications equipment. In addition, the heads of \nappropriate Federal agencies are authorized to make available a greater \nnumber of U.S. government public health personnel U.S. missions abroad, \ninternational health organizations, and regional health networks.\n  All of the provisions of S. 2487 are directed towards enabling \ndeveloping countries to acquire basic disease surveillance and \nmonitoring capabilities to effectively contribute to community, local, \nregional, and global surveillance networks.\n  In order to ensure that the United States has all of the requisite \ntools at its disposal to protect U.S. civilians and military personnel \nagainst intentional or naturally occurring disease outbreaks, priority \nfor assistance under S. 2487 will be for countries that provide early \nnotification of disease outbreaks and pathogen surveillance data to \nappropriate U.S. departments and agencies. There is a critical need for \ntransparency and information sharing of pathogen surveillance data so \nthat the United States can utilize a comprehensive toolkit to combat \nbioterrorism. It is my expectation that developing countries receiving \nassistance under this Act will make a steadfast commitment to improving \ntheir pathogen surveillance and monitoring efforts.\n\n  I am particularly proud of the provisions of S. 2487 that address the \nglaring need for syndrome surveillance--the recording of symptoms \n(patient complaints) and signs (derived from physical examination) \ncombined with simple geographic locators--to track the emergence of a \ndisease in a population. Provisions on syndrome surveillance address \nthe need to narrow the existing technology gap in syndrome surveillance \ncapabilities and real-time information dissemination to public health \nofficials. Current disease reporting is paper-based and ineffective in \ntransmitting important information to public health officials in \ndeveloping countries where one doctor often cares for hundreds of \npatients. Thus, S. 2487 authorizes the President to provide assistance \nto eligible developing countries to purchase simple computer \ntechnology, including touch-screens and low-speed Internet connections \nfor use by physicians in health clinics.\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n  Let me close with the astute words of Dr. Alan P. Zelicoff, Senior \nScientist, Sandia National Laboratory, as stated during his testimony \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee in a March 2002, on the threat \nposed by chemical and biological weapons. Dr. Zelicoff has spent a \nconsiderable amount of his distinguished career developing technology \nand solutions to assist the medical and public health communities \nidentify natural and deliberate disease outbreaks. According to Dr. \nZelicoff,\n\n       When all is said and done, should would-be perpetrators of \n     bioterror know that the effects of their attack would be \n     blunted if not eliminated, they might well re-think their \n     strategy in the first place. A multi-national cadre of \n     clinicians and nurses, exchanging up-to-the-minute \n     information is our single best defense, and we have the \n     resource--now--to so equip them. All that is required is a \n     policy shift emphasizing and strengthening this lynchpin \n     capability.\n\n  While we are supportive of the public health benefits of this Act, we \nshould not lose sight of the intent of this legislation--to combat \nbioterrorism and enhance U.S. national security. I look forward to \nworking with the Bush administration and members of Congress to secure \nfunding for these invaluable activities directed towards global \npathogen surveillance and monitoring.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3253 \nand\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3253) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to provide for the establishment within the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs of improved emergency medical preparedness, \n     research, and education programs to combat terrorism, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass this legislation that would \nhelp VA--and our entire Nation--prepare for the potential medical \nconsequences of another terrorist attack.\n  As Congress seeks ways to avert the threats posed by biological, \nchemical, radiological, and other potential terrorist weapons, we must \nmake certain that we use our existing national resources as efficiently \nas possible. I thank Ranking Member Specter and his staff for their \nefforts in helping to ensure that VA--the Nation's largest integrated \nhealthcare system--is prepared for the role that it can and must play \nduring emergencies.\n  The pending measure is an omnibus bill that would improve VA's \nability to fulfill its responsibilities to veterans, its staff, and \ncommunities during disasters, and would also address VA nonprofit \nresearch corporation activities.\n  ``The Department of Veterans Affairs Emergency Preparedness Act,'' as \nreported, which I will refer to as the ``Committee bill,'' acknowledges \nVA's role in offering health care and support to individuals affected \nby disasters, and would give VA staff the tools that they need to \ncontinue serving veterans during emergencies.\n  The committee bill would establish four medical emergency \npreparedness research centers within the Department of Veterans Affairs \nhealth care system. VA researchers possess expertise in the long-term \nhealth consequences of biological, chemical, and radiological \nexposures, and sustain an unparalleled clinical management research \nprogram. The centers authorized by this legislation would make the most \nof these resources to learn how best to manage--or prevent--the mass \ncasualties that might arise from the use of terrorist weapons.\n  The committee bill also includes provisions requested by the \nAdministration that would create an office, directed by an Assistant \nSecretary, to coordinate preparedness strategies within VA and with \nother Federal, State, and local agencies. I strongly believe that this \nnew office represents an essential step in helping VA improve emergency \npreparedness while maintaining its primary mission of caring for the \nNation's veterans.\n  Another emergency preparedness provision within the committee bill \nwould create no new responsibilities or missions for VA, but would \nauthorize VA's enormous contribution to public safety and emergency \npreparedness. In 1982, Congress charged VA to care for active duty \nmilitary casualties during a conflict or disaster. Since then, VA has \ntaken a much larger share of the Federal responsibility for public \nhealth during emergencies, supporting mass care as part of the Federal \nResponse Plan for disasters and serving as a cornerstone of the \nNational Disaster Medical System.\n  VA has responded to every major domestic disaster of the last two \ndecades with personnel, supplies and medications, facilities, and--when \nnecessary--direct patient care for overwhelmed communities. VA health \ncare providers who care for disaster victims serve not only as part of \nthe Federal response to emergencies, but as part of the communities in \nwhich they live. The committee bill would acknowledge VA's emergency \nresponse missions by authorizing VA to provide medical treatment for \nindividuals affected by or responding to disasters.\n  The committee bill also makes changes in law affecting VA's nonprofit \nresearch corporations. The first allows employees of nonprofit VA \nresearch and education corporations assigned to approved VA research, \neducation, or training projects to be considered VA employees for \npurposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The other provision clarifies \nthat VA Medical Centers may enter into contracts or other forms of \nagreements with nonprofit research corporations to provide services to \nfacilitate VA-approved research and education projects. These changes \nwould further VA's research and education missions.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support these research and \nemergency preparedness enhancements for VA. This bipartisan commitment \nto our Nation's veterans and VA represents a small investment with \npotentially enormous rewards.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Sumamry of S. 2132: The Department of Veterans Affairs Emergency \n                        Preparedness Act of 2002\n\n\n     Medical Emergency Preparedness Centers in the Veterans Health \n                             Administration\n\n       Authorizes VA to establish four centers for medical \n     emergency preparedness within existing VA medical centers.\n       Directs centers to carry out research on the medical \n     management of injuries or illnesses arising from the use of \n     chemical, biological, radiological, or incendiary or other \n     explosive weapons or devices in coordination with national \n     strategies for homeland security.\n       Allows centers to provide medical consequence management \n     education and training to VA health care professionals, and \n     to non-VA providers at the Secretary's discretion.\n       Authorizes VA to provide laboratory, epidemiological, \n     medical, or other assistance to Federal, State, and local \n     health care entities by request during a national emergency.\n\n\n              Reorganization of VA Preparedness Functions\n\n       Increases the number of authorized assistant secretaries \n     from six to seven, and adds ``operations, preparedness, \n     security, and law enforcement'' to their authorized \n     functions.\n       Increases the number of authorized deputy assistant \n     secretaries from 18 to 20.\n\n\n        Authorizing VA to Provide Medical care During Disasters\n\n       Authorizes VA to furnish medical care to individuals--\n     regardless of enrollment status--affected by a major disaster \n     or presidentially declared emergency, or following activation \n     of the National Disaster Medical System.\n       Allows VA to provide care to individuals affected by \n     disasters before any other group except service-connected \n     veterans and active-duty military casualties, and would allow \n     VA to be reimbursed for care provided to employees of other \n     Federal agencies.\n\n\n              VA Nonprofit Research Corporation Activities\n\n       Authorizes VA to contract with VA nonprofit research \n     corporations in order to conduct VA-approved research, \n     training, or education.\n       Allows employees of nonprofit VA research and education \n     corporations assigned to approved VA research, education, or \n     training projects to be considered VA employees for purposes \n     of Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       Removes the sunset date of December 31, 2003, currently \n     established in 38 USCS Sec. 7638, for authority to establish \n     nonprofit VA research and education corporations.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nreturn to legislative session.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first let me thank my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Reid and Senator Daschle, for finally moving some \nof these nominees. Some are long overdue. Some are still yet to be \nconfirmed.\n  I will make one mention: Kyle McSlarrow, to be Deputy Secretary of \nEnergy. He worked for us in the Senate. He is more than qualified. I \nhappen to know the Secretary of Energy because he used to be a Senator, \nSpence Abraham, and he has personally requested that he be confirmed. \nHe needs a Deputy Secretary of Energy.\n  So while I am pleased we were able to confirm a large number of \nnominees, we have some nominees who are now going to have to wait the \nentire month of August and well into September to be confirmed. I find \nthat to be unfair. I wanted to express my pleasure with the one we were \nable to confirm and my displeasure with the fact that there are about \n30 people who will still be left on the calendar, including individuals \nsuch as Kyle McSlarrow to be Deputy Secretary of Energy, and other \noutstanding nominees who will still be held in limbo in the \nconfirmation process throughout August and maybe well into September. I \nfind that regrettable. There is no reason in the world not to move more \nof these nominees. I am appreciative of the many we have confirmed. I \nhave not totaled the number, but it is a significant number. Still, \nthere will be several very well qualified individuals who, for no \nreason whatever, are not being confirmed to this date.\n  I wanted to express my displeasure and mention that nominee. I could \ngo through the list. I will not do that at this late time. I want my \ncolleague to know I am not happy we were not able to confirm Mr. \nMcSlarrow, who was reported out by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee unanimously on June 5. He has been waiting almost 2 months. \nThe Secretary of Energy has been waiting to get a deputy. \nUnfortunately, he still will not have a deputy for the next couple of \nmonths, at a time when we will mark up an energy bill. It is probably \nthe most significant piece of energy legislation in decades, and the \nSecretary does not have his deputy confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it would be good if we could approve all of \nthese, but problems occur. As I indicated, on one of these nominees, I \npersonally went to a lot of trouble to find a Senator so we could get \nthat person approved.\n  This is not a perfect system, but it works pretty well and we do the \nvery best we can. It is not just holds over here; we have holds over \nthere on people we care about.\n  I worked on the Aging Subcommittee; I am still a member of the Aging \nSubcommittee. One of the highest people assigned to me was a man by the \nname of Jonathan Steven Adelstein. I hoped he would be approved to \nserve on the Federal Communications Commission. We could go tit for \ntat. But I would tell my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, for whom, \neveryone knows, I have the greatest respect about a trip I had a couple \nof weeks ago to Nevada. I had the wonderful opportunity to have three \nof my grandchildren spend a weekend with us. My little grandchild just \nturned 4, Mitchell. I did not realize his parents had told him to be \npatient because I would want to find out how Tiger Woods was doing in \nthe golf tournament, and he wanted to watch a video. This little boy \ncame into the room and looked at me with sad eyes saying: ``It is so \nhard to be patient.''\n  I say to my friend Senator Nickles, it is so hard being patient, but \nbeing a Member of the Senate, you have to be. Even a 4-year-old said \nthat. It certainly applies to what goes on in the Senate. It is hard to \nbe patient, but I think a lot of people are celebrating tonight because \nthese people have already been approved.\n  I look forward to coming back in the fall and hoping we can confirm \nmore of these men and women who certainly, with rare exception, are \nqualified for the appointments they have been given.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague. I \nunderstand that maybe he is not the source of some of the remaining \nholds. We are confirming a large number of people, well qualified \npeople, at long last. That is good. There still remain some outstanding \nnominees; I think about 30.\n  I hope my colleague from Nevada will work with me and Senator Daschle \nand Senator Lott and see if we can clean the rest of the calendar. \nHistorically, we try to clean the calendar before we break, both in \nAugust and October. I hope we will not wait until the end, early \nOctober, to clean the calendar this time. I hope we will try to confirm \nas many of these nominees as early as we can in September, both for the \nagencies that need the help and the expertise and also for them \nindividually. They should not be held indefinitely.\n  I will work with my colleague, and I would appreciate his assistance \nto see if we can get some of them through--there may be holds on both \nsides--and see if we can eliminate some of those and expedite the \nconfirmation process.\n  Mr. REID. I look forward to that. One thing we need to do: It does \nnot matter if you have a Republican President or a Democrat President, \nthe problem is the slow process in approving nominees to serve in an \nadministration. It is not right that we have to wait months for a \nPresidential nomination. Judicial appointments are a good example. They \ngo step after step after step before we even get to look at them. We \nhave to speed up this process for the good of the country. It is not \nright that this President is almost halfway through his term and still \ndoes not have people working for him. It is not all our fault, and it \nis not all the minority's fault. Much of it is the fault of the system. \nWe have to do something to make it a system that moves more quickly.\n  If there were ever something we needed to work on in conjunction with \nthe executive branch of Government, it would be to establish a blue \nribbon panel to figure out a way we could speed up this process. It \ntakes a long time for nominees to be sent to the Senate. We are running \ngood people away from government, not because the process is too long, \npeople are beleaguered before they even go through it.\n  I would be happy to work with my friend doing what we can to clear up \nthe nominations. I look forward to that. I also hope the Senator will \nwork with me, and maybe we can come up with an idea that will make all \nPresidencies a little more in tune with what is going on, because we \nhave to wait for months and months to get people working in agencies.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my colleague would yield, I would be happy to work \nwith the Senator. Some legislation has been\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nconsidered by the Governmental Affairs Committee on that issue, and \nmaybe we should review that to achieve more fair consideration.\n  I spoke earlier tonight about judicial nominations. We did confirm, I \nbelieve, seven or eight judges today. That is good. But on circuit \ncourt nominees, we have confirmed 13 out of 32; that is 40 percent, 8 \nof which have been languishing for over a year, 445 days, I think, \nsince May of last year. Several of those eight are outstanding \nnominees. One of them, John Roberts, has argued 37 cases before the \nSupreme Court. Miguel Estrada has argued 15 cases before the Supreme \nCourt and has yet to have a hearing. Another nominee argued 10 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. Other nominees served on district court \nlevels for years, and were rated very high by the ABA. For fairness, we \nneed to treat these individuals with respect and give them a hearing \nbefore the committee.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent on the circuit court level is not \nsatisfactory. I just mention that; I am not trying to pick a fight. I \nwould just like to see that we let circuit court nominees have \nconsideration. They should not have to languish for over a year after \nthe nomination to have a hearing.\n  I might mention, two of the eight have had hearings. Six of the eight \nhave not even had a hearing scheduled, and they have waited over a \nyear.\n  So I mention that. I appreciate my colleague's consideration.\n  Mr. Reid. I think, generally speaking, we have to do better. It is \ntoo bad that someone has had to wait a year. But during the time when \nwe were trying to get some judges approved and we were in the minority, \nwe had judges who waited 4 years. I hope that record is not beaten.\n  I would say we have held more hearings on district and circuit court \nnominees, 78, than in the past 22 years. I have all the statistics \nhere. We need not go through them.\n  We need to try to have a better system. I am happy to work on that, \nand I will be happy to work with my esteemed friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, to do whatever we can to work out some of these bumps in \nthe road that exist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/08/01/senate-section/article/S8029-1", "month": "08", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
