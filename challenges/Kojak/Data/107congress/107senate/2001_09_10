Gratefully, we remember \nthe historic event which made possible one of America's most enduring \ntraditions. On September 7, 1774, the first prayer in Congress was \nprayed when the Continental Congress convened. We praise You that this \ndeclaration of dependence on You led to the Declaration of Independence \ntwenty-two months later. We reflect on the many times throughout our \nNation's history that prayer broke deadlocks, opened the way to greater \nunity, and brought light in our darkest times. As we celebrate the \npower of prayer in years past, deepen our individual and corporate \nprayers for this Senate and our Nation. Help us to say those crucial \nwords, ``One Nation Under God'' with new trust in You this morning.\n  Dear God, bless America. Guide this Senate to lead this Nation to \ngreater trust in You. We need a profound spiritual awakening once \nagain. Forgive our Nation's humanistic secularism, materialism, and \ninsensitivity to the problems of poverty, racism, and injustice. Lower \nYour plumb line of righteousness on every facet of our society and \nreveal what is out of plumb for what You desire for America. May our \nprayers draw us to Your heart. We want this prayer to begin a \ncontinuous conversation with You throughout this day. Help us to \nlisten, discern Your will, and obey with faithfulness. You are our Lord \nand Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9205-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9205-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am on the floor of the Senate today to \nspeak to an issue that is right in Washington D.C., in our midst. It is \nsomething that I think few of us realize, but it has begun to get the \nattention of the American public. We have seen several news articles on \nit in the last month.\n  Mr. President, the Bush administration inherited an environmental \nmess from previous administrations over the past good number of years. \nAs I have said, it is right here in the backyard of Washington, DC. The \nWashington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers, \nis in violation of the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. \nMillions of pounds of sludge, laced with alum, are created when the \nPotomac River water is treated for drinking water for the Washington, \nD.C. and Northern Virginia area.\n  I have a picture of the release of the aqueduct into the Potomac \nRiver. Rather than send the sludge to a landfill, as other cities are \nrequired to do, it is dumped back into the Potomac River. Strangely \nenough, Mr. President, it is dumped into the river at\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nnight. Why? I suspect so that the public will not see it or ask the \nquestion: What is it? Therefore, it is dumped through the Chesapeake \nand the Ohio Canal National Historic Park.\n  The Corps claims that to alter this process so that it functions like \nother water treatment facilities will take years to plan, to build, and \nto become operational. The only problem is that they have been saying \nthat now for decades.\n\n  The Corps has stated that if it were prohibited from dumping millions \nof pounds of toxic sludge into the river to protect an endangered \nspecies would create a security crisis. What would the crisis be? Well, \nit would deprive the White House, the Congress, the courts, and the \nPentagon of adequate drinking water.\n  Mr. President, I have to be honest. That kind of an argument and that \nsituation outrages me. I believe that no one should be above the law, \nincluding the Nation's Capital. Of all the places that I thought we \nwould never hear the phrase, ``not in my backyard,'' we are hearing it \nrepeatedly said right here in Washington by the Army Corps of \nEngineers. A situation of this nature would never have occurred in the \nWest because the Endangered Species Act would have trumped all of the \nother needs first. In fact, a community would be taxed beyond its \ncapacity to finance a new facility and that facility would be ordered \nto be built by a court. There would be no arbitrary frustration of \nnational security or that we simply can't get there in a timely \nfashion.\n  Let me give you an example in McCall, ID. The drinking water source \nfrom the community is cleaner than the standards of the Safe Water \nDrinking Act. However, the community has been struggling for the last \ndecade to finance a new drinking water system in order to comply with \nFederal regulations.\n  I strongly feel that no one entity should operate as if it was above \nthe law and especially in our Nation's Capital. If changes need to be \nmade to the Washington Aqueduct, then the Corps should be taking steps \nto work with the affected communities to establish a new plan. That is \nwhat is expected of all of the communities in my State, in the West, \nand across the Nation, and no less should be expected by our Nation's \nCapital.\n  A new discharge permit would require the current illegal discharge to \ncease, and that, of course, is the problem. This new permit has not \nbeen issued because there is a concern by local residents who do not \nwant the dump trucks hauling the sludge through their community; thus, \na resulting belief that ratepayers would prefer that the sludge be \ndumped into the river rather than pay for the cost of the facilities to \ntreat it. At least that appears to be the attitude at this moment.\n  I have a hard time believing that the residents of any community \nwould want to pollute the water of their community and especially \nthrough the middle of a national park. However, this is the typical \nresponse of ``not in my backyard.'' We now affectionately call it NIMBY \nor being ``NIMBYfied.''\n  Clearly, in this instance, Washington is silent in its NIMBYism. The \nsituation, I repeat, would not be tolerated in the West because a \nFederal court would order a community to stand down and be responsible \nunder the regulations of the law.\n  According to the Army Corps, the volume of chemically treated sludge \ndischarged into the primary, if not the only, spawning habitat of the \nendangered shortnose sturgeon is large enough to require 15 dump \ntruckloads a day to haul it away from the area.\n  This chart is a picture taken at dawn of the sludge pouring into the \nriver. While it is hard to see, in the distance lies the natural \nquality of the water. This is the chemical sludge that pours into the \nPotomac River during the night. Of course, this is a picture that is \nnot very handsome, and I am sure the Army Corps of Engineers would not \nlike to have it dramatized, but in reality, this is exactly what goes \non. This dumping represents 15 truckloads of material that should be \nhauled away on a daily basis.\n\n  It has been concluded that a single enormous discharge that includes \nseveral million pounds of solids, often done under the cover of night, \nas I have mentioned, or in inclement weather, may contain the \nequivalent of a significant amount of the total annual discharge of \nphosphorous and nitrogen by the city's sewer treatment facilities. This \ngives you the magnitude of the problem with which we are dealing.\n  In the mid-1990's, area residents managed to get the Congress to \nrequire that Federal agencies give special attention to the concerns of \nthe local residents when the facility was repermitted and thwarted the \nEPA's issuance of a new permit that would have halted the dumping. In \nother words, there was an effort at one point, but local citizens and, \nquietly, the EPA in the mid-90'S winked and nodded and said--``Not In \nOur Backyard.'' This is the Nation's Capital and it would create a \nnational security problem, and so you are permitted. No new permit, \nthough, has been issued since the old one expired. They just let it \nroll on. The expired permit has no limits on the total suspended \nsolids, alum, and iron, discharged by the aqueduct. No other city in \nthe Nation would get away with that, nor would there be a wink and a \nnod. The aqueduct discharges under continuation of the old permit \npending issuance of a new one.\n  The Department of Justice contends this is not a violation of the ESA \nto dump millions of pounds of chemically treated sludge into the \nprimary spawning habitat of an endangered species that may be present \nat the exact location of the dumping in the Potomac River.\n  None of this is going on in the Columbia and Snake Rivers, and yet we \nhave five listed endangered species of salmon there. That water must be \nmaintained in a near or pristine quality, and we have all kinds of \nactivities going on up and down the stretch of the rivers to improve \nthe water quality, but not in Washington and not for the shortnose \nsturgeon.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \nService have stated that the discharge may also result in chemo-sensory \ndisruption and EPA documents state that the discharges may result in \nwhat we call bio-accumulation of harmful chemicals. I am getting a \nlittle more technical than is necessary.\n  This picture is worth a thousand more words than I can express about \nthe situation that is going on.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service is allowing the project to \nproceed on the basis that the fish has not been verified in the upper \ntidals of the Potomac. Yet the regional director of the National Marine \nFisheries Service stated more than 2 years ago that studies funded by \nthe Corps that were critical to the analysis of the sturgeon status in \nthe Potomac would commence that spring.\n  It was determined that the fish are in the river. Only four species \nhave been verified, not counting reports of sturgeon caught by sports \nfishermen. In fact, at one time, sturgeon was so abundant in the river, \nalong with other fish, that it created a commercial fishery. George \nWashington took advantage of that commercial fishery with his own fleet \nof fishing boats. In fact, I am oftentimes told, and I have even looked \nat the transcripts from Mount Vernon, that one of the most lucrative \nparts of the Mount Vernon operation was fishing in the Potomac. We know \nthat cannot happen nor would it happen today.\n\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service has concluded that the fish is \npresent in the general area because commercial fishermen turned in the \nsturgeon they happened to catch in their nets in response to a reward \nprogram for another species of sturgeon that was known to be in the \narea.\n  The bottom line is, there are threatened and endangered fish in the \nPotomac River, and yet the Army Corps has done nothing in response to \nthe need to cooperate.\n  In my State of Idaho, or any other State in the Nation, this is a \npractice that would not be tolerated, and that is why I have come to \nthe floor today. We pass laws, you and I, Mr. President, and the \nadministration writes the regulations to administer those laws. The \nEndangered Species Act over the last three decades has been touted by \nsome to be the most progressive environmental law in our Nation, and \nclearly it has saved species of threatened and endangered plants, \nanimals, fish.\n  My State has been largely reshaped by it. Federal land use plans in \nmy\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\nState are much more prescriptive today and controlled by the very issue \nof the Endangered Species Act. But here, by a wink and by a nod, \nnothing happens. It is a river that you and I, Mr. President, for years \nhave worked to pass legislation that would progressively clean it up \nand improve it, moving it back toward a time when it was a viable \nfishery on the east coast. But with the millions of pounds of sludge \ndumped daily into this river in the dark of night under a permit that \nhas not been reissued since 1994--really, how long do we allow \nsomething like this to go on? How long do we allow the Army Corps of \nEngineers to continue to operate because it is in our best interest in \nthe Nation's Capital, the city that ought to lead by example but can \nget away with a direct violation of the law or by ignoring the \nenforcement of the law?\n  I do not think that should be the case. That is why I stand in the \nChamber to dramatize this issue and to speak more clearly to it. While \nI believe the Endangered Species Act needs to be reformed, there is not \nany way I could write it to reform it that would justify this, nor \nwould I try. Nor would any Senator vote for that kind of a reform.\n  Yes, we would expect the Endangered Species Act to be more practical \nin its application, and, yes, we would want a more cooperative \nrelationship with local communities of interest, but never would we \never tolerate the kind of an aggressive act that goes on in Washington \non a daily basis, as I have said, oftentimes in the dark of night by \nthis city and by our own agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, which is \nprimarily responsible for the water treatment of this city.\n  The application of the Endangered Species Act, as we see it, is good \nfor the country and good for the West. It ought to be the same act and \nit ought to be enforced in the same way in our Nation's Capital. This \nis simply not being done.\n  I am in the Chamber to speak to that issue and to recognize I have \nbeen involved with others in trying to bring about the conformity of \nthe enforcement of the Endangered Species Act as we rebuild the Woodrow \nWilson Bridge. This is one of many issues where there seems to be this \nattitude, well, if it is the Government doing it, somehow the \nGovernment can get away with it, and if it is in or near our Nation's \nCapital, where national security and the importance of the Congress are \ninvolved, then surely we can wink and nod and we can let the law be \nbypassed.\n  I think not, Mr. President, and I think you agree with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9207-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9207-S9208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PLANNING THE SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we enter into our second week of this \nfall's session after the recess, and we are faced with much to do. I \nthink that is not unusual. It is often the case things pile up towards \nthe end of the session, of course, but it seems to me we have a great \nmany items to consider.\n  There are 13 appropriations bills to be passed in order to have this \nGovernment operate in the next fiscal year. The fiscal year begins \nOctober 1, which is only 3 weeks away. In the course of those 3 weeks, \nthere are several days which, for various reasons--the Jewish holidays, \nand so on--there will not be votes. So we have really a relatively \nshort time.\n  Obviously, what we will be doing is passing a continuing resolution \nbefore this is over, but nevertheless we have a great deal to do. None \nof these bills has yet gone to the President. Some of them have been \npassed in both Houses and are waiting now on the conference committees.\n  To be sure, it is difficult. It is always difficult. This year we are \nseeing some more difficulties because of the change in conditions with \nregard to the surplus, because of the difficulty I think we are finding \nnow in staying within the budget we passed some time ago. Nevertheless, \nthose are the items before us.\n  It does not seem to me perhaps that we are moving ahead quite as \nrapidly as we might. It does not seem to me we have a very well \ndesigned plan to accomplish these things within a certain period of \ntime.\n  I understand it is very difficult to bring together a group of this \nkind with different views and properly argue those views. On the other \nhand, the role of leadership is to have a plan. It is the role of \nleadership to cause things to happen. Even though they are difficult \nissues, they must be done. Unfortunately, as I noticed particularly \nthis weekend on public media, and so on, rather than seeking to find a \nplan to move forward, we seem to be spending more time blaming one \nanother, particularly the President and the administration, for the \ndifficulties in which we find ourselves.\n\n  We can have different points of view about whether that is valid or \nwhether it is not, but even if it is, the fact is we have things to do \nand we should be moving ahead with the plan to do them. Instead of \nthat, we seem to be spending more of our time complaining about the \nadministration's plan. The fact is, we do have indeed the second \nlargest surplus in our history. We also have a budget that we passed \nthat is about a 4-percent increase, which is a fairly low increase, \nwhich is what we need compared to what we have spent in the past \nseveral years. Our challenge is to stay within the budget we passed and \nto continue to move forward in doing that.\n  We hear a great deal of complaint about tax relief--too much tax \nrelief. As a matter of fact, we are in the process of passing that \nrelief back to the people who own the money, and that is as it should \nbe, I believe, particularly as we find ourselves in a time with a very \nslowing economy. What else is more important than to return more money \nto the taxpayers if we indeed have a surplus? And we are doing that.\n  The question, of course, is one of not reaching into Social Security, \nwhich I happen to agree with, although we have done that for how many \nyears and those dollars are accounted for in the Social Security fund, \neven though for years they have been spent for other things without a \ngreat deal of complaint, I might add.\n  However, I do not think that is really the issue. The issue is \nholding down spending to comply with the budget that we passed. It \nseems to me that ought to be our challenge.\n  There is, of course, in my view, no real threat to the beneficiaries \nof Social Security. Those obligations are there. They are going to be \nthere. We have paid down more debt because of the surpluses over the \nlast several years than in years past. So what we really need to do is \naddress ourselves to the issues we have before us. The turndown in the \neconomy, of course, is the thing most of us are very concerned about, \nall of us, whether we are here, whether we are in Casper, WY, or \nwherever, and to do what we can to seek to play the Government's role \nin doing what we can to change that.\n  A reduction in taxes, the return of taxes, is designed to help do \nthat. Hopefully, it will. We are not through with that yet. We are in \nthe process with, I believe, seven reductions in the last year in \ninterest rates designed hopefully to stimulate the economy. We need to \ndo that.\n  Limiting our spending in the budget is another aspect we are seeking \nto help pick up and strengthen the economy. There are some other things \nwe ought to be doing. We ought to be doing something with giving the \nPresident the opportunity to have trade agreements that are then \nbrought to the Senate for approval. They are all brought to the Senate \nfor approval, but the world economy and our involvement in trade, \nparticularly in agriculture, in which I am involved, was the difficulty \nin the Asian currency a year ago which brought a good deal of problems \nto our economy. So we are a part of that, of course.\n  There are a number of things we can do, and I cannot think of \nanything more important for us to talk about collectively than what is \nappropriate for the Government in helping to strengthen this economy.\n  Yesterday, again on the TV, there were some questions about that: Oh, \nno, it is up to the President to do that. I do not agree with that. Of \ncourse, the President is the one who brings up the suggestions to the \nSenate. The President is not in control of the Senate, and the Senate \nhas some responsibilities to take leadership as well. The idea of \nsaying it all began since this President became President is not true.\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\n It has been here for a year, and then to say it is up to the \nPresident, I do not agree with that.\n  Each of us in this body has some responsibility to give thought to \nwhat we can do to help strengthen this economy, which everyone in this \ncountry wants us to do.\n  In addition to that, of course, it seems to me we ought to be moving \non an energy bill. This is very important to us, not only to the \neconomy, but we are going to see some more impacts of it, of course, in \nthe winter. We can do that. We started to work on pharmaceuticals. The \nbudget contains opportunity for that. We can do that. Education has \nbeen passed by both Houses of Congress and still remains in conference.\n\n  I know many in the leadership on both sides are very anxious to work \ntogether and show evidence of working together and want to work \ntogether. I certainly encourage that be done so we can do what we are \nhere to do, which is to solve the problems before the country, the \nlegitimate problems for the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9208-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9208-S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Wyoming, it is true \nwe have the second largest surplus in the history of this country; \nhowever, it is all Social Security money.\n  The administration keeps talking about this huge surplus. They never \ngive a caveat, saying, yes, we have the second largest surplus, but the \nreason we have that is because in 1983, the Congress, with Thomas \n``Tip'' O'Neill, Claude Pepper, Senator Byrd, and President Reagan, got \ntogether and said, let's forward fund Social Security. In fact, Social \nSecurity has been forward funded, recognizing the baby boomers would \nhave to receive large sums of money up front. So when the baby boomers \ncome, there will be money. If we did nothing with Social Security, \neveryone would draw 100 percent of their benefits until about the year \n2030. After 2030, if we did nothing, they would still draw 75 to 80 \npercent of benefits. The debate is to make sure after the year 2030 \nSocial Security recipients receive all their benefits.\n  For Members to say President Bush is such a great guy, he has the \nsecond largest surplus in the history of the country, is disingenuous. \nIt is not factual. The surplus is as a result of Social Security.\n  My friend from Wyoming said we should move forward. We have been \ntrying to move forward. We would have already completed the \nappropriations bills but we have been prevented from moving forward on \nthem. When we finished the legislation last week that we worked so hard \nto complete, the Export Administration legislation--which, by the way, \nwas held up strictly by people from the Republican camp, totally, for \nweeks and weeks, and months, and more than a year; we were finally able \nto get to that legislation after being held up for several days--after \nwe finished that bill we wanted to go to Commerce-State-Justice but \nthey would not let us. There was an objection to a motion to proceed.\n  Members can come to the floor all they want to talk about what is \ngoing on, but Members should state the facts. The facts are, we have \nbeen trying to move forward. If it had been up to us, we would have \ncompleted all the appropriations bills.\n  The economy is in trouble. Whether we like it or not, the President \nof the United States is seen to be the person directing the economy of \nthe country. Basically, that is true.\n  Over the weekend, the press reported all over America a conversation \nbetween Speaker Hastert and the President of the United States, George \nW. Bush. I quote Speaker Hastert: A year from now is when it matters. \nHe is talking to the President about the terms of the economy. A year \nfrom now is when it matters.\n  Let's see, a year from now is real close to midterm elections. Is \nthat what they are talking about? Of course it is.\n  President Bush responds: ``It's my timeframe, too.'' So we have the \nSpeaker and the President saying they are not concerned about the \neconomy now, but they are concerned about what happens a year from now. \nThat is too bad. We have to be concerned about the economy today, not a \nyear from now. We have an economy that is in real trouble. That is a \nfact. Rarely do all economists agree on everything, but when it comes \nto the current state of our economy, there is uniform agreement that \nthings are getting worse instead of better.\n  As a result of the 1993 Budget Deficit Reduction Act, which was a \nvery difficult vote, President Clinton gave us that budget. It was a \ntough vote for all Members. In the House of Representatives, without a \nsingle Republican vote, it passed by one vote. Courageous people lost \ntheir seats in the House of Representatives. The hero that I look to is \nMaria Cantwell. She served one term in the House of Representatives. \nShe knew if she voted for that Budget Deficit Reduction Act it would \nhurt her in reelection, and it did, but she did the right thing and now \nis a Member of the Senate. Not all people were as fortunate as Maria \nCantwell. Some lost and their political careers ended.\n\n  In the Senate of the United States, the vote was a tie and the Vice \nPresident of the United States came over and sat where the Presiding \nOfficer is now sitting and cast a tie-breaking vote to allow that \nbudget deficit plan to go forward. As a result, we had 7 years of \nreally good times in this country. The votes were tough. We reduced \nunemployment by over 300,000 people, excluding the military. We had the \nlowest inflation, lowest employment in more than 40 years, created 25 \nmillion new jobs, reduced the deficit from $300 billion a year to \nsurpluses.\n  Now, with this great budget we have been given by George W. Bush, we \nare in trouble already. Everyone acknowledges that we don't have the \nmoney for these tremendous tax cuts in the future. It has put a real \ndamper on our economy.\n  Since the passage of the President's budget, we have witnessed a \nsteady decline in the number of economic indicators. Each week there is \na new economic indicator indicating we are in trouble. Majority Leader \nDaschle said this weekend, when you take a U-turn on economic policy, \nyou can expect a U-turn in the direction of the economy.\n  That is what we have. The problems we face because of the President's \nbudget deserve immediate attention.\n  My friend from Wyoming said it is really not the President. It is the \nPresident. He got us into this mess. He needs to give us a blueprint \nfor trying to get out of this mess. We are going to go ahead and do the \ncountry's business and work our way through the appropriations bills \nthe best we can. We have a one-vote majority. That makes it tough in \nthe Senate. We need some leadership from the President of the United \nStates, other than saying ``a year from now is when it matters.''\n  It matters right now. The current state of the economy is one of \npeople losing jobs; the surplus has already disappeared. We are going \nback to the days of deficits already. And the fact that the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, my friend from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, was quoted in the press, saying maybe we should spend Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  To show the disarray on the other side, we have some who are calling \nfor more tax reductions to solve the problems of this economy and to \nreduce the capital gains taxes. The thing we are now hearing is the \nRepublicans are fighting among themselves as to whether that is a good \ndeal.\n  The President of the United States today, as we speak, is in Florida \ntalking about the need to pass an education bill. The first thing the \nDemocrats did upon taking power in the Senate was pass the education \nbill. We did that. Senator Daschle could have brought up all kinds of \nother legislation, but the majority leader placed education on the \nagenda. And we worked our way through that and passed it. There were \nsome battles as to whether we should do this or that, but it was \npassed. There was compromise. Legislation is about the art of \ncompromise.\n  For the President of the United States to be in Florida saying, \n``Pass my education bill,'' which is now in conference, takes money, \ndollars, not to just go around talking about what a great bill we have.\n\n  I can remember when I was not as educated in ``things Washington,'' \nand I would read in the newspapers that\n\n[[Page S9209]]\n\nsomeone in the Nevada delegation issued a statement that some bill had \npassed. Oh, I thought, good times are here. Little did I know that what \nyou needed was an appropriation to go along with that authorization. I \ndo not think the President of the United States is being fair to the \nAmerican public by not recognizing that you need to do more than \nauthorize; you need to appropriate. And he will not help us with that. \nSo to go down to Florida today and have a big cheerleading session with \nstudents about ``I am the guy who is going to help you with education'' \nwhen he is unwilling to help us finance education is wrong.\n  I don't know how many more people have to lose their jobs, lose their \ncars, lose their homes. How many will it take before we have the \nPresident telling us we need a new budget? The old budget will not \nwork. The economy will not be fixed by hastily arranged press \nconferences such as we had last week when they found there was a 4.9-\npercent unemployment rate. There was a quick press conference held, and \nall the congressional leadership ran to the White House, and that is \nwhere they came up with this brilliant statement; it doesn't matter \nwhat is happening now; what we need to look at is what going to happen \na year from now.\n  We need to work with the President in righting this problem, but we \nneed some direction from the White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9209-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 3 years ago a young man by the name of Steve \nRigazio, president and chief operating officer for the largest utility \nin Nevada, Nevada Power--a fine, fine young man--was diagnosed with Lou \nGehrig's disease. It is a devastating illness that affects the nerve \ncells in the spinal cord and causes muscles to wither and die very \nquickly. He has lived longer than people expected. The normal time from \nthe time of diagnosis, when you are told you have this disease, until \nthe time you die, is 18 months. He has lived 3 years. He no longer \nworks. He finally had to give up his job.\n  Because Lou Gehrig's disease attacks the body but leaves the mind \nintact, this vibrant man has had to watch his body deteriorate around \nhim. He is a man of great courage, and I hope he lives much longer than \npeople expect. He deserves it.\n  I have had visiting me for a number of years now two beautiful little \ngirls from Las Vegas. They are twins. They are now 12 years old. One of \nthe twins, Mollie Singer, has struggled with juvenile diabetes since \nshe was 4 years old. She has had thousands of pricks of her skin--\nthousands. She is a beautiful little girl who believes that we in \nWashington can help her not have to take all these shots. As do the \nmillion Americans who suffer from this illness, Mollie fears that her \nkidneys will fail, she will get some kind of infection and have one of \nher limbs amputated or even lose her sight as a result of this \ndiabetes.\n  There is something that gives Mollie and Steve hope, and that is stem \ncell research. It gives hope to tens of millions of Americans and their \nfamilies who, like Steve Rigazio and Mollie Singer, suffer from Lou \nGehrig's disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, lupus, heart \ndisease, spinal cord injuries, and other illnesses. Since stem cells \ncan transform into nearly all the different tissues that make up the \nhuman body, they can replace defective or missing cells. Scientists are \nreally very optimistic that one day stem cells will be used to replace \ndefective cells in children with juvenile diabetes or even to create \nrejection-free organs.\n\n  Knowing that stem cells may have the power to save and improve lives, \nwe cannot deny researchers the tools they need to fully realize the \npotential of stem cells. If we fail to seize promising research \nopportunities, we will fail millions of Americans and their families \nand people all over the world.\n  Early last month, President Bush announced he would limit Government \nfunding for research to the stem cell lines that already existed at the \ntime of his announcement. This was obviously a political compromise. I \nam pleased that the President left the door open for Federal funding of \nstem cell research in some capacity, but I am very concerned that he \nhas not opened the door far enough to allow scientists to fully realize \nthe life-saving potential of stem cells.\n  Last week, Secretary Thompson announced that no more than 25 of the \n64 stem cell lines the National Institutes of Health listed as falling \nunder the President's criteria are fully developed. We still do not \nknow whether the remaining 40 stem cell lines would be useful to \nscience. What we do know about the 25 viable stem cell lines that fall \nunder the President's guidelines is very troubling. Why? Most, if not \nall, of the existing stem cell lines have been mixed with mouse cells. \nAs a result, these cells could transfer deadly animal viruses to \npeople, human beings.\n  It is also unclear whether these cells will be suitable for \ntransplanting into people. Just last week, Dr. Douglas Melton, a \nprofessor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, testified that \ncells derived from mice ``have proven unreliable over time for \nresearch, either dying out or growing into diseased forms.''\n  Even though scientists are working on ways to grow human embryonic \ncell lines without using mouse cells, they will not be eligible for \nFederal research money because they will be created after President \nBush's arbitrary August 12 deadline. Last week the administration \nconfirmed it would not reconsider this deadline, even if it were later \ndiscovered that none of these cell lines was suitable for long-term \nresearch.\n  If we fail to fund research for the new stem lines that are created \nwithout mouse cells, foreign scientists will still conduct research on \nstem cell lines that fall outside his guidelines. This research is \ngoing to go forward. Shouldn't it go forward under the greatest \nscientific umbrella in the history of the world, the National \nInstitutes of Health? The answer is yes, that is where it should go \nforward, not in the little communities throughout the world that are \ntrying to get a step up on the United States. This research is going to \ngo forward. Let's do it the right way.\n  As a result of the guidelines of the President, we will not have the \nability to provide any oversight of this research, if it is done \noverseas, to ensure that it is conducted by ethical means. Not only \nwill we risk losing our most talented scientists to foreign countries, \nbut we also jeopardize our potential as a nation to remain a world \nleader in stem cell research.\n  Over the course of the next several months, scientists will continue \nto determine whether President Bush's policy will allow stem cell \nresearch to advance at a reasonable pace. As we continue to evaluate \nthe President's funding guidelines, we need to keep in mind that \nmillions of Americans who suffer from devastating illnesses do not have \nthe luxury of time--Steve Rigazio as an example. We cannot continue to \ndangle the hope of cure or the promise of scientific breakthrough \nbefore these patients and their families without adequately supporting \nresearch to allow scientists to achieve these very important \ndiscoveries.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nconsidered adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 1533) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe fiscal year 2002 State, Justice, Commerce, the Judiciary, and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill. This bill was accepted \nunanimously by the full committee in July. As in past years, this has \nbeen an extremely bi-partisan effort on the part of the members and \nstaff of this subcommittee. In particular, I would like to thank the \nranking member, Senator Gregg, for his dedication to producing a fair \nand well rounded bill. He has chaired this subcommittee in a \ndistinguished fashion during the past 4 years. He knows this bill \nthrough and through and his assistance during the change over has been \ngreatly appreciated. Also, I want to recognize the hard work of my \nsubcommittee staff; my majority clerk, Lila Helms, Jill Shapiro Long, \nLuke Nachbar, and Dereck Orr; as well as the minority clerk, Jim \nMorhard along with Kevin Linskey, Katherine Hennesey, and Nancy \nPerkins.\n  This is my 31st year on the CJS Subcommittee, and this is the 25th \nannual appropriations bill for CJS that I have been privileged to \npresent to the Senate either as chairman, or as ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. I am still amazed at the range of important issues that \nthis bill addresses.\n  Funds appropriated under this bill directly affect the daily lives of \nall Americans.\n  Under CJS, the Nation's primary and secondary schools are made safer \nby providing grants for the hiring of school resource officers to \nensure that our children can grow and learn in a protected environment. \nThis bill provides funds to protect all americans by increasing the \nnumber of police officers walking the Nation's streets, providing \nadditional funds to fight the growing problem of illegal drug use, \nguarding consumers from fraud, guarding children from internet \npredators and protecting Americans from acts of terrorism here at home \nand abroad.\n  People throughout this country benefit from weather forecasting \nservices funded through this bill, whether they are farmers receiving \ninformation necessary to effectively manage their crops, or families \nreceiving lifesaving emergency bulletins regarding tornadoes, floods, \ntorrential rains, and hurricanes.\n  Small communities benefit from the economic development programs \nfunded in this bill. Nearly 1,500,000 small businesses benefit from the \nfree SBA assistance provided in this bill. All American businesses and \ntheir employees benefit from the funding provided to enforce our trade \nlaws and to prevent illegal, often dangerous products, from being \ndumped on our markets.\n  This appropriations bill provides funds to improve technology in a \nhost of areas; funding is provided for developing cutting edge \nenvironmental satellites, for developing cutting edge industrial \ntechnologies that keep us competitive, and for developing basic \ncommunications tools for State and local law enforcement so that they \ncan do their jobs more safely and effectively.\n  In all, the CJS bill totals $41.5 billion in budget authority, which \nis $719.9 million above the President's request. There are four \nspecific accounts that benefit from the increased funding above the \nPresident's request. They are MARAD, COPS Universal Hiring Program, \nNIST's Advanced Technology Program, and the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  First, the President's budget proposed to move MARAD into the \nDepartment of Defense. The subcommittee received letters from over one-\nthird of the senate indicating opposition to such a move. The committee \nbill reflects that request and provides $98.7 million for the Maritime \nSecurity Program and $100 million for the Title XI Loan Guarantee \nProgram.\n  Second, the President's budget proposed to fund only the school \nresource officer component of the COPS Program. The committee bill \nbefore the Senate today fully supports the School Resource Officers \nProgram, but also restores the Universal Hiring Program. The committee \nbill provides $190 million for the Universal Hiring and Cops More \nProgram.\n\n  Third, the President's request proposed to zero out the Advanced \nTechnology Program. The committee bill restores this program and \nprovides the same level of funding, $60.7 million, for new awards as \nwas provided last year. As a result, the bill includes $190 million \nabove the President's request for the ATP Program.\n  Finally, the President's request proposed to move SBA from a service \nagency to a fee for service agency. In order to correct this misguided \nunderstanding of the services SBA provides this country's more than \n1,500,000 small businesses, the committee bill provides an additional \n$231 million above the President's request to restore funding for all \nthe proposed taxes contained in the President's request.\n  In addition to restoring the funding for Priority National Programs, \nthe Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill also focuses on \nreplacing the aging information technology and other core \ninfrastructure needs of the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and \nState.\n  As I said before, this is a well rounded bill with a number of \nimportant accounts. I would like to take a few more minutes to go over \nsome of the specific funding highlights from the CJS bill the committee \nis bringing before the Senate today.\n  Once again, the FBI's Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report \nreleased this past May demonstrates how well these programs are \nworking. According to the FBI's report, in 2000, serious crime has \nleveled to mark a decline of 7-percent from 1998, and marking 9 \nconsecutive years of decline. This continues to be the longest running \ncrime decline on record. Bipartisan efforts to fund DOJ's crime \nfighting initiatives have impacted this reduction in crime during the \npast 10 years.\n  The bill provides $3.47 billion for the FBI, which is $216 million \nabove last year's funding level. To meet the FBI's training, resources, \nand equipment needs, the bill provides $142 million for the FBI's \nComputer Modernization Program, trilogy; $6.8 million to improve \nintercept capabilities; $7 million for counter-encryption resources; \n$12 million for forensic research; $4 million for four mitochondrial \nDNA forensic labs; and $32 million for an annex for the engineering \nresearch facility, which develops and fields cutting edge technology in \nsupport of case agents.\n  To highlight the changing mission of the FBI, the bill provides a new \nbudget structure. Three old criminal divisions were combined into two, \nand new divisions for cybercrime and counterterrorism were created. The \nnew structure provides the Bureau with more flexibility and should \nimprove the Bureau's responsiveness to changing patterns of crime and \nheadquarters' support of the field. The bill also directs the FBI to \nre-engineer its workforce by hiring and training specialists that are \ntechnically-trained agents and electronics engineers and technicians.\n  The bill provides $1.5 billion for DEA, $8.8 million above the budget \nrequest. Increased funds are provided for technology and infrastructure \nimprovements, including an additional $30 million for DEA's computer \nnetwork, firebird, and an additional $13 million for DEA's laboratory \noperations for forensic support.\n\n  To combat drugs that are reaching our streets and our children, the \nbill provides $52.8 million to fight methamphetamine and encourages the \nDEA to increase efforts to combat heroin and emerging drugs such as \noxycontin and MDMA, also known as ecstacy. The bill also directs DEA to \nrenew its efforts to work with Mexico to combat drug trafficking and \ncorruption under the country's new President Vicente Fox.\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\n  For the INS, the bill includes $5.5 billion, $2.1 billion of which is \nderived from fees. This funding provides the necessary resources to \naddress border enforcement and benefits processing. For border \nenforcement, the bill provides $75 million for 570 additional Border \nPatrol Agents, $25 million for 348 additional land border inspectors, \nand $67.5 million for additional inspectors and support staff.\n  To better equip and house these agents and inspectors, the bill \nprovides $91 million for border vehicles, $22 million for border \nequipment, such as search lights, goggles and infrared scopes, $40.5 \nmillion to modernize inspection technology; and $205 million for Border \npatrol and detention facility construction and rehabilitation.\n  For INS' other hat, benefits processing, the bill provides $67 \nmillion additional funds to address the backlog and accelerate the \nprocessing times.\n  This bill includes $3.07 billion for the Office of Justice Programs, \nwhich is $259.8 above the amount requested by the President. This bill \nprovides for the funding of a number of important law enforcement \nprograms.\n  The committee has provided $2.08 billion for State and Local Law \nEnforcement Assistance Grants. Within this amount; $400 million is for \nthe Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program; $390.5 million is for \nViolence Against Women Act--VAWA--programs, including programs to \nassist disabled female victims, programs to reduce violence against \nwomen on college campuses, and efforts to address domestic and child \nabuse in rural areas; and $265 million is provided for the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program which reimburses States for the \nincarceration costs of criminal aliens.\n  Within the amount provided for the Office of Justice Programs, a \ntotal of $328.5 million has also been recommended for juvenile justice \nprograms. These funds will go towards programs aimed at reducing \ndelinquency among at-risk youth; assisting States in enforcing underage \ndrinking laws; and enhancing school safety by providing youth with \npositive role models through structured mentoring programs, training \nfor teachers and families so that they can recognize troubled youth, \nand training to students on conflict resolution and violence reduction.\n  This bill includes $1.019 billion for the COPS office in new budget \nauthority, which is $164.7 billion above the President's request. As in \nprior years, the Senate has provided $180 million for the Cops-in-\nSchools Program to fund up to 1,500 additional school resources \nofficers in FY02, which will make a total of 6,100 school resource \nofficers funded since Senator Gregg and I created this program in 1998.\n  This committee also remains committed to providing grant funds for \nthe hiring of local law enforcement officers through the COPS Universal \nHiring Program. Although the President did not seek funding for this \nprogram in FY02, the committee has provided $190 million to continue to \nhire officers, as well as to provide much needed communications \ntechnology to the Nations law enforcement community.\n\n  Within the COPS budget, the committee has also increased funding for \nprograms authorized by the Crime Identification and Technology Act, \nCITA. In FY02, $150.9 million is provided for programs that will \nimprove the retention of, and access to, criminal records nationwide, \nimprove the forensic capabilities of State and local forensic labs, and \nreduce the backlog of crime scene and convicted offender DNA evidence.\n  And finally, the committee has provided $48.3 million within COPS to \ncontinue the COPS methamphetamine initiative. These funds will provide \nfor the clean-up of meth production sites which pose serious health \nrisks to law enforcement and the surrounding public. Funds will also be \nprovided to State and local law enforcement to acquire training and \nequipment to safely and effectively dismantle existing meth labs.\n  For the Department of Commerce in fiscal year 2002, the committee has \nfocused on the separate but equally important goals of improving \ndepartmental infrastructure and promoting the advancement of \ntechnology. The Nation is blessed with an outstanding group of \nindividuals who go to work every day, across the Nation, for the \nDepartment of Commerce. Thirty-seven thousand people work in agencies \nas diverse as the Economic Development Administration, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Bureau of the Census. \nThey are highly-trained experts who are responsible for a huge array of \ncritical programs. These people help minority businesses and small \nmanufacturers flourish, run trade missions to open foreign markets to \nAmerican goods, forecast hurricanes, estimate the Nation's gross \ndomestic product, set standards and measurements recognized and used \nworld-wide, fly satellites, manage the Nation's fisheries, conduct \ncensuses, and process patents. These missions of the Department of \nCommerce are the glue that holds together the U.S. economy, both \ndomestically and abroad.\n  There is no doubt as to the importance of the missions under the \npurview of the Department of Commerce. There is, however, a crisis \nlooming in terms of the infrastructure available to the employees who \nwork there. In many cases, Mr. President, these people are going to \nwork in World War II-era buildings that are literally crumbling around \nthem. We saw this last year in Suitland where we had leaks in the roof, \nlead in the water, and asbestos in the air systems and we provided \nfunding for new buildings. The average age of the NOAA fleet of \nresearch vessels is close to 30 years old. Employees in Department of \nCommerce bureaus are working with antiquated computer systems that \noften do not speak to the outside world.\n  The bill we have before us begins to turn the tide on infrastructure \nneeds. In all cases, the bill funds the President's request for capital \nupgrades. This includes new information technology systems at the \nMinority Business Development Agency, the Bureau of the Census, the \nEconomic Development Agency, and the Office of Economic and Statistical \nAnalysis. The bill includes a $76 million increase for the next \ngeneration of polar-orbiting satellites. It also includes a new radio \nspectrum measurement system at the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration.\n  In other cases, this bill jump-starts capital projects that were not \nrequested by the President when they should have been. For example, \nfunding is included to begin work on upgrading the Boulder, CO, campus \nof the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We also \nencourage the United States Patent and Trademark Office to reflect on \nits infrastructure needs and to report back on what we can do to help \nin the future.\n  In terms of NOAA, the bill includes funding for 2 new research \nvessels and funds to refurbish 6 others. In addition, funding is \nincluded for needed repairs at the Beaufort, Oxford, and Kasitsna \nCoastal Laboratories. Sufficient funding is provided to begin \nconstruction on regional National Marine Fisheries Service Buildings in \nHawaii and in Alaska. The bill provides funding to start building \nvisitor facilities at National Marine Sanctuaries.\n  Mr. President, the funding provided in this bill for these purposes \nis a down-payment on the future of a robust Department of Commerce. I \nbelieve that the people at the Department are its greatest asset and \nthat these targeted funds will allow those people to better do their \njobs for decades to come.\n  In terms of advancing technology, in addition to the satellite \nprograms, research vessels, radio spectrum management systems and other \nprograms that I mentioned earlier, the bill provides $696.5 million for \nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology--NIST. This amount \naggressively funds scientific and technical research and services that \nare carried out in the NIST Laboratories in Gaithersburg and in \nBoulder. The bill provides the current year funding level of $60.7 for \nnew ATP awards. The ATP is an industry-led, competitive, and cost-\nshared program to help the U.S. develop the next generation of \nbreakthrough technologies in advance of its foreign competitors. ATP \ncontracts encourage companies to undertake initial high-risk research \nthat promises significant widespread economic benefits. Over one-half \nof the ATP awards go to small companies. To date, Mr. President, 41 ATP \ncompetitions have been held; 4,435 proposals\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\nhave been submitted involving 7,343 participants; 526 awards have been \nissued involving 1,167 participants, and 248 ATP projects have been \ncompleted. Of the 526 awards, 173 are joint ventures, and 353 are \nsingle applicants. Fify-nine percent of the projects are led by small \nbusinesses and 71 percent of the single applicant projects are led by \nsmall business. More than 150 different universities are involved in \n280 ATP projects and over 100 new technologies have been commercialized \nas products or services. Companies have identified nearly 1,400 \npotential applications of ATP research.\n  Is ATP a success? The answer clearly is ``yes.'' The Advanced \nTechnology Program has been extensively reviewed. Since its inception, \nthere have been 52 studies on the efficacy and merits of the program. \nThese assessments reveal that the ATP does not fund projects that \notherwise would have been financed in the private sector. Rather, the \nATP facilitates so-called ``Valley of Death'' projects that private \ncapital markets are unable to fund. In June 2001, the National Academy \nof Sciences' National Research Council completed its comprehensive \nreview of the ATP. It found that the ATP is an effective Federal \npartnership that is funding new technologies that can contribute to \nimportant societal goals. They also found that ``the ATP could use more \nfunding effectively and efficiently.'' A March 1999 study found that \nfuture returns from just 3 of the 50 completed ATP projects--improving \nautomobile manufacturing processes, reducing the cost of blood and \nimmune cell production, and using a new material for prosthesis \ndevices--would pay for all projects funded to date by the ATP. \nMeasurement and evaluation have been part of the ATP since its \nbeginning. What the analysis shows time and time again is that the ATP \nis stimulating collaboration, accelerating the development of high-risk \ntechnologies, and paying off for the Nation.\n\n  The bill includes a total of $7.6 billion for the Department of State \nand related agencies, an increase of $617 million above last year's \nfunding level of $7.0 billion. Within the State Department account, \n$1.1 billion has been provided for worldwide security upgrades of State \nDepartment facilities. Additionally, the bill provides $773 million to \ncontinue our Nation's international peacekeeping activities.\n  During the past several years, the worldwide security accounts and \nthe peacekeeping account have accounted for the majority of increases \nin the Department's budget while the day-to-day operations have been \nneglected. As a result, many of the Department's quality of life \ninitiatives and the Department's other infrastructure needs--\ncommunications, transportation, office equipment--have suffered. The \nfunding provided in this bill fully funds all current services for the \nDepartment of State. In addition, this bill funds all quality of life \ninitiatives such as: additional language, security, leadership and \nmanagement training; monetary incentives to attract employees to \nhardship posts; incentives to allow civil service employees to compete \nfor 2-year overseas assignments; and replacement of obsolete furniture \nand motor vehicles.\n  As with the other departments funded through this bill, full funding \nis provided for information technology upgrades. The worldwide web has \nbecome essential to the conduct of foreign policy. Yet, very few \noverseas posts have that capability. The funding provided in this bill \nfully supports Secretary Powell's decision to place information \ntechnology among the Department's top priorities and fully funds the \nDepartment's efforts to provide internet access to all State Department \ndesktops by January 2003.\n  Let me conclude by saying again this is a solid piece of legislation \nthat addresses issues that affect the daily lives of all Americans. It \nis a good bill that balances the needs on many diverse missions, and \nthe interests of members from both parties. Every year, we face \ndifficulties with respect to limited funding and multiple, sometimes \ncompeting, priorities. This year was no different. And, as in past \nyears, the CJS Subcommittee made those decisions in a bipartisan and \njudicious manner. This could not have happened without the assistance \nof Senator Gregg and the endless hours of work that both my and his \nstaff put into drafting the bill before the Senate today. With the help \nof my colleagues, I look forward to swift passage of this vital \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill brought \nforward by the Senator from South Carolina. I thank Senator Hollings \nfor the tremendous courtesy and teamwork approach he has taken on this \nbill relative to the Republican side of the aisle. I especially thank \nhis staff, led by Lila Helms, for their efforts to make sure we had an \napproach that involved all the different players on the committee.\n  This has been a bill which Senator Byrd, during the full committee \nmarkup, described as the ``most bipartisan bill in his memory.'' We are \nvery proud of that. I think it is very much a reflection of the \nleadership of Senator Hollings and the approach he has taken. So I \nexpress my deep and sincere thanks to him.\n  Senator Hollings has outlined pretty specifically the areas this bill \nfunds and some of the initiatives in the bill. Let me talk about a \ncouple, however, that I would like to highlight myself.\n  First, the appropriation level on this bill is significant, $41.5 \nbillion, which is over the President's request by a fair amount--about \none-half billion dollars. It is my hope--and I have discussed this with \nSenator Hollings--as we move through the process that we can come a \nlittle closer to the President's request. I note, however, that the \nbill is within our budget resolution and the allocation given to this \ncommittee. So as a practical matter it does not in any way negatively \nimpact the budget. It is a rather responsible bill. The reason it \nspends these dollars is because it has significant agencies that it \nfunds.\n  The Department of Justice is, of course, a critical agency; the \nDepartment of State; Department of Commerce; Judiciary; FTC; FCC; and \nthe SEC. These are all agencies that play a huge role in the \ndeliverance of quality Government in our country. It is our obligation \nto strongly support them.\n  One area on which we have focused a considerable amount of time in \nthe committee has been the issue of terrorism and our preparation for \nterrorism as a government. Earlier in the year, we had a joint hearing \nthat involved a large number of Senators participating, at which \nhearing we had present and testifying all the major agencies that \nimpact terrorism within the Federal Government--I believe the number is \n42, or maybe 46. I myself even lost count, even though I stay fairly \nattentive to this issue. We heard from the leaders of each agency. We \nheard from the Secretary of State, the head of FEMA, the Attorney \nGeneral, of course, and down the line. We heard from leaders within our \ncommunities and agencies. We heard from the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The conclusion, which was clear and regrettably unalterable, is that \nthere are simply too many people trying to cook this pie, too many \npeople trying to stir the stew, and, as a practical matter, the \ncoordination necessary in order to deliver a thoughtful and effective \nresponse to the threat of terrorism is not that strong.\n  Terrorism can be divided into three basic areas of responsibilities, \nthe first being intelligence, both domestic and international; the \nsecond being interdiction, again domestic and international; and the \nthird being consequence management should an event occur.\n  In all these areas, there is a significant overlap of responsibility \nand, as a result, through this hearing and many other hearings we have \nheld, we have come to the conclusion that we have to become more \nfocused within especially the Justice Department, which has a huge role \nin this area, but within other agencies which naturally fold into the \nJustice Department.\n  We have suggested in this bill that we create a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral who would serve as a national go-to person on the issues \nrelating to domestic terrorism. This individual would obviously work in \ntandem with a lot of other major players, including FEMA, but as a \npractical matter at least we would have one central place where we \ncould begin and where people could look to more response to terrorism. \nIt would be a central place where not\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nonly the response would occur but the responsibility would occur and \ntherefore we would have accountability, which is absolutely critical \nand which today does not exist.\n  This bill creates that position and funds it, along with funding a \nsignificant increase in the counterterrorism activity at a variety of \nlevels which are critically important to our efforts to address this \nissue.\n  I do not want to sound too pessimistic about our efforts in this \narea. Compared to 4 or 5 years ago when we began this initiative, we \nare way down the positive road. We have, in effect, up and running a \nfirst responder program in a number of communities across this country, \nand we are moving aggressively across the country to bring critical \nareas up to speed.\n  We have an effective intelligence effort and effective interdiction \neffort, but we still have a long way to go. If you put it on a \ncontinuum time of a person, it is as if this person were born 5 years \nago and we were now in mid-adolescence, in our late teens, moving, \nhowever, aggressively into a more mature approach to the issue.\n  Another area I think needs to be highlighted, on which I congratulate \nthe chairman, as I have with counterterrorism, is the issue of NOAA. \nNOAA is absolutely a critical agency for us. It is one of the premier \nagencies in our Nation in addressing the question of scientific \nexcellence. I was just watching the weather today and noticed there is \na hurricane off the northern part of our east coast. It is going to be \npushed off the coast in New England because of the weather patterns.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Hopefully it will not hit New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Hopefully it will not hit New Hampshire.\n  Because of NOAA, we can predict where a hurricane will go with a \ngreat deal more accuracy. Certainly, States such as South Carolina and \nthose that are located along the hurricane trough have taken full \nadvantage of it.\n  This agency goes way beyond the issues of atmospherics. It goes into \nquality of water, ocean activity, marine fisheries, and we have made a \nhuge commitment in this area in this bill.\n  Environmental conservation is extraordinarily important as part of \nthe NOAA initiative in this bill, and, as the chairman was reciting, we \nhave put a large amount of dollars into it, especially in the Coastal \nZone Management Program and the National Estuarine Research Reserve.\n  The committee recognizes that 90 percent of the commerce in this \ncountry enters through our ports, and our nautical charts are grossly \noutdated. This year we address this problem by aggressively increasing \nfunding for mapping and charting, electronic navigational charts, \nshoreline mapping, the survey backlog, and securing additional \nhydrographic ships.\n  Because of the critical importance of fishing to our economy and our \ncultural history, the committee is funding a new $54 million fishery \nresearch vessel, as was mentioned by the chairman --this is absolutely \ncritical--along with making a significant effort to protect and \npreserve the right whale population which is very important to my part \nof the country.\n  Given the current concerns regarding our national energy policy, the \ncommittee is providing funds through NOAA again to examine an extension \nof the U.S. claim to the mineral continental shelf, implementation of a \nregional temperature forecasting system to better project electricity \ndemands, and to develop an air quality forecasting system to minimize \nthe impact of powerplant emissions on air quality.\n  The committee funded the following programs: Coastal Zone Management \ngrants at $65 million, $5 million over last year's level; National Sea \nGrant College Program at $56 million, the same level as the budget \nrequest; the National Weather Service's Local Warnings and Forecasts \nProgram at $80 million; the National Polar Orbiting Environmental \nSatellite System at $156 million. This is a recognition by this \ncommittee of the significance and importance of NOAA and the role it \nplays in maintaining the quality of our science in this country but, \nmore importantly, the quality of the life of our citizenry.\n  As was mentioned by the chairman of the committee, we have made a \nstrong commitment to the judiciary which has its own unique problems, \nand we continue to work hard, especially in the area of pay. I \npersonally believe we should do something aggressively in the area of \npaying our judges. I suspect the Chair also feels this way, as he is \nthe fellow responsible for these judges. The fact is, it is very hard \nto attract into the judiciary high-quality individuals who might have \nyoung children or especially families whose kids are about to head off \nto college under the present pay scale, and something needs to be done. \nWe are trying to address that in this bill.\n  Again, as was mentioned by the chairman, the State Department has \nbeen aggressively addressed. I am happy to report, as the chairman has \nalluded, that the arrears situation is much improved, thanks to the \ngood work of our former Ambassador to the U.N., Richard Holbrooke. Mr. \nHolbrooke accomplished what many said could not be done: He \nsuccessfully negotiated a new U.S. assessment rate both for the regular \nbudget and the peacekeeping account so that the burden is more fairly \ndistributed.\n  For me, the renegotiation of the assessment scale is a perfect \nexample of how the United States can use its large contribution to the \nU.N. as a leverage to demand fairness, accountability, and reform. Our \n``tough love'' policy vis-a-vis the U.N., the basis of the Helms-Biden \nlegislation, is successful because it is premised on good intentions \nand high expectations.\n  I also want to mention that funds have been made available in this \nbill for information technology in the total of $210 million. As the \nchairman of this committee mentioned, for the last 4 years I have been \nextremely supportive of this attempt to try to upgrade the IT \ncapabilities of the State Department. I have been disappointed, \nhowever, by the lack of progress made by the Department in this area.\n  The only goal the State Department has achieved is providing e-mail \ncapability to all Department desktops. Most desktops still do not have \nWeb access. The networks of various U.S. agencies operating overseas \nhave not been integrated, and the classified system needs to be \noverhauled.\n  I am encouraged by Secretary Powell's recognition of IT as one of the \nDepartment's top priorities. The fiscal year 2002 mark fully funds IT, \nand I congratulate Senator Hollings for his commitment in this area. \nHopefully, the Department will make good use of these funds.\n  Lastly, I want to mention something that is especially important to \nme personally, and that is the bill's effort to eliminate the illegal \ndiamond trade that has fueled the violent conflict in African nations \nsuch as Sierra Leone, Congo, and Angola.\n  Nowhere has the effect of this illicit diamond trade been more \ngraphic than in Sierra Leone. As early as 1991, a criminal gang called \nthe Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, began taking control of many of \nthe Sierra Leone diamond mines. Since then, RUF has used profits from \nthe sale of diamonds to terrorize civilians for no other reason than to \nexpand their influence. The RUF is notorious for its use of forced \namputations, murder, and rape in waging its war of terrorism. I assure \nyou, there will be no end to the violence unless we address this \nproblem at its root. As long as the RUF can profit from the sale of \nconflict diamonds, the butchery will continue.\n  What is needed is a ban on the importation into the United States of \ndiamonds from countries that fail to observe an effective diamond \ncontrol system. Clearly, this will involve substantial commitment on \nthe part of the Africa's diamond-producing countries. But the onus \ncannot fall entirely on them. It is equally the responsibility of \ndiamond-importing countries to do all we can to ensure we are not \nfacilitating the trade in conflict diamonds.\n  In the past, we have been unable or unwilling to act even while \neffective preventive measures, measures such as the ones I have \nintroduced today and which Senator Hollings has been kind enough to \ninclude in this bill, are at our fingertips. There are things we can do \nto make the situation in Africa better. The key is to act. We have a \nchance to save lives, to promote peace, merely by changing the way we \ndo business. This bill goes a long way in addressing the appalling \nevents currently taking place in much of West Africa.\n\n[[Page S9214]]\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Hollings for his commitment in this area and \nhis willingness to support this effort and be a leader on it. In \nconclusion, I also thank Senator Hollings, and especially his staff, \nfor all they have done to make this a bipartisan bill and a bill which \nI can enthusiastically support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     United States voted against final adoption of the Rome \n     Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the Statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the Statute.\n       (3) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (4) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deserve the full protection of the United States Constitution \n     wherever they are stationed or deployed around the world to \n     protect the vital national interests of the United States. \n     The United States Government has an obligation to protect the \n     members of its Armed Forces, to the maximum extent possible, \n     against criminal prosecutions carried out by United Nations \n     officials under procedures that deny them their \n     constitutional rights.\n       (5) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court for national security decisions \n     involving such matters as responding to acts of terrorism, \n     preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     and deterring aggression.\n       (6) The claimed jurisdiction of the International Criminal \n     Court over citizens of a country that is not a state party to \n     the Rome Statute is a threat to the sovereignty of the United \n     States under the Constitution of the United States.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act shall be available for \n     cooperation with, or assistance or other support to, the \n     International Criminal Court or the Preparatory Commission. \n     This subsection shall not be construed to apply to any other \n     entity outside the Rome treaty.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, at this time I ask for the yeas and nays \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1537 To Amendment No. 1536\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I now submit a second-degree amendment to \nthe amendment, which I think is at the desk as I speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1537 to amendment numbered 1536.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the availability of funds for cooperation with, \nor assistance or other support to, the International Criminal Court or \n                      the Preparatory Commission)\n\n       Strike line 2 and all that follows, and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 623. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act shall be available for cooperation \n     with, or assistance or other support to, the International \n     Criminal Court or the Preparatory Commission. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to apply to any other entity outside \n     the Rome treaty.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I take this time to address with my \ncolleagues a matter that I believe has the most grave consequence on \nour national sovereignty.\n  I also submit for the Record three articles that pertain to this \nissue that I think are fundamentally important for my colleagues to \nhave and understand. One of those happens to be an op-ed of mine that \nappeared in the Washington Posts in August, another one from John \nBolton, and another one from Mr. Lee Casey. I ask unanimous consent \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Post, August 22, 2001]\n\n                          (By Larry E. Craig)\n\n       At its founding, the mission of the United Nations, as \n     stated in its charter, was ``to save succeeding generations \n     from the scourge of war.'' It made no claim to supersede the \n     sovereignty of its member states. Article 2 says that the \n     United Nations ``is based on the principle of the sovereign \n     equality of all its Members,'' and it may not ``intervene in \n     matters which are essentially within the domestic \n     jurisdiction of any state.''\n       Since then, the United Nations has turned the principle of \n     national sovereignty on its head. Through a host of \n     conventions, treaties and conferences, it has intruded into \n     regulation of resources and the economy (for example, \n     treaties on ``biological diversity,'' marine resources and \n     climate change) and family life (conventions on parent-child \n     relations and women in society). It has demanded that \n     countries institute racial quotas and laws against hate \n     crimes and speech. Recently the United Nations tried to \n     undermine Americans' constitutional right to keep and bear \n     arms (with proposed restrictions on the international sale of \n     small arms).\n       Fortunately, many of these have been dead on arrival in the \n     U.S. Senate, successive presidents have refused to endorse \n     others, and in any case the United Nations had little power \n     of enforcement. But in 1998, one mechanism of global \n     government came to life with the so-called ``Rome Statute'' \n     establishing a permanent International Criminal Court. Once \n     this treaty is ratified by 60 countries, the United Nations \n     will wield judicial power over every individual human being--\n     even over citizens of countries that haven't joined the \n     court.\n       While the court's stated mission is dealing with war crimes \n     and crimes against humanity--which, because there is no \n     appeal from its decisions, only the court will have the right \n     to define--its mandate could be broadened later. Based on \n     existing U.N. tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which are \n     models for the International Criminal court, defendants will \n     have none of the due process rights afforded by the U.S. \n     Constitution, such as trial by jury, confrontation of \n     witnesses or a speedy and public trial.\n       President Clinton signed the Rome treaty last year, citing \n     U.S. support for existing U.N. war crimes tribunals. Many \n     suppose the court will target only a Slobodan Milosevic or \n     the perpetrators of massacres in Rwanda, or dictators like \n     Iraq's Saddam Hussein. But who knows? To some people, Augusto \n     Pinochet is the man who saved Chile from communism; to others \n     he is a murderer. Who should judge him--the United Nations or \n     the Chilean people?\n       In dozens of countries, governments use brutal force \n     against insurgents. Should the United Nations decide whether \n     leaders in Turkey or India should be put in the defendants' \n     dock, and then commit the United States to bring them there? \n     How about Russia's Vladimir Putin, for Chechnya? Or Israel's \n     Ariel Sharon? Can we trust the United Nations with that \n     decision?\n       The court's critics rightly cite the danger to U.S. \n     military personnel deployed abroad. Since even one death can \n     be a war crime, a U.S. soldier could be indicated just for \n     doing his duty. But the International Criminal Court also \n     would apply to acts ``committed'' by any American here at \n     home. The European Union and U.S. domestic opponents consider \n     the death penalty ``discriminatory'' and ``inhumane.'' Could \n     an American governor face indictment by the court for \n     ``crimes against humanity'' for signing a death warrant?\n       Milosevic was delivered to a U.N. court (largely at U.S. \n     insistence) for offenses occurring entirely within his own \n     country. Some say the Milosevic precedent doesn't threaten \n     Americans, because the U.S. Constitution protects them. But \n     for Milosevic, we demanded that the Yugoslav Constitution be \n     trashed and the United Nations' authority prevail. Why should \n     the International Criminal Court treat our Constitution any \n     better?\n       Instead of trying to ``fix'' the Rome treaty, the United \n     States must recognize that it is a fundamental threat to \n     American sovereignty. The State Department's participation in \n     the court's preparatory commission is counterproductive. We \n     need to make it clear that we consider the court an \n     illegitimate body, that the United States will never join it \n     and that we will never accept its ``jurisdiction'' over any \n     U.S. citizen or help to impose it on other countries.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Post, January 4, 2001]\n\n                           Unsign That Treaty\n\n                          (By John R. Bolton)\n\n       President Clinton's last-minute decision to authorize U.S. \n     signing of the treaty creating\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\n     an International Criminal Court (ICC) is as injurious as it \n     is disingenuous. The president himself says that he will not \n     submit the Rome Statute to the Senate for ratification \n     because of flaws that have existed since the treaty was \n     adopted in Rome in 1998. Instead, he argues that our \n     signature will allow the United States to continue to affect \n     the development of the court as it comes into existence.\n       Signing the Rome Statute is wrong in several respects.\n       First, the Clinton administration has never understood that \n     the ICC's problems are inherent in its concept, not minor \n     details to be worked out over time. These flaws result from \n     deep misunderstandings of the appropriate role of force, \n     diplomacy and multilateral institutions in international \n     affairs. Not a shred of evidence; not one; indicates that the \n     ICC will deter the truly hard men of history from committing \n     war crimes or crimes against humanity. To the contrary, there \n     is every reason to believe that the ICC will shortly join the \n     International Court of Justice as an object of international \n     ridicule and politicized futility. Moreover, international \n     miscreants can be dealt with in numerous other ways, as \n     Serbia may now be proving with Slobodan Milosevic.\n       Second, the ICC's supporters have an unstated agenda, \n     resting, at bottom, on the desire to assert the primacy of \n     international institutions over nation-states. One such \n     nation-state is particularly troubling in this view, and that \n     is the United States, where devotion to its ancient \n     constitutional structures and independence repeatedly brings \n     it into conflict with the higher thinking of the advocates of \n     ``global governance.'' Constraining and limiting the United \n     States is thus a high priority. The reality for the United \n     States is that over time, the Rome Statute may risk great \n     harm to our national interests. It is, in fact, a stealth \n     approach to eroding our constitutionalism and undermining the \n     independence and flexibility that our military forces need to \n     defend our interests around the world.\n       Third, the administration's approach is a thinly disguised \n     effort to block passage of the American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act, introduced last year in Congress. This bill, \n     if adopted, would unequivocally make it plain that the United \n     States had no interests in accepting or cooperating with the \n     ICC. Sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms and Rep. Tom DeLay, the \n     proposal has garnered impressive political support, including \n     from former secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, George \n     Shultz, James Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of \n     Defense-designate Donald Rumsfeld and former secretary Caspar \n     Weinberger and former national security advisers Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft and Richard Allen.\n       So what will signing the Rome Statute do? The president is \n     undoubtedly thinking of Article 18 of the Vienna Convention, \n     which requires signatories to a treaty, before ratification, \n     not to undertake any actions that would frustrate its \n     objectives. President Clinton has used this provision before. \n     After the Senate defeated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \n     the administration cited Article 18 (rather than the \n     president's constitutional authority as commander in chief) \n     to justify a continued moratorium on underground nuclear \n     testing. Obviously, the pending anti-ICC bill would divorce \n     the United States from the court and violate Article 18, or \n     so we will soon hear.\n       Relying on Article 18, which cannot sensibly apply to our \n     government of separated powers, is wrong in many respects, \n     not least that the United States has never even ratified this \n     Vienna convention. Ironically, however, President Clinton's \n     ``midnight decision'' to sign the Rome Statute provides \n     guidance to solve the problem he has needlessly created, and \n     others as well.\n       After appropriate consideration, the new administration \n     should straightforwardly announce that it is unsigning the \n     Rome Statute. President Clinton himself stated that he will \n     not submit the treaty to the Senate, so this is a purely \n     executive decision. What one president may legitimately (if \n     unwisely) do, another may legitimately (and prudently) undo. \n     The incoming administration seems prepared to take similar \n     actions in domestic policy, and it should not hesitate to do \n     so internationally as well.\n       Not only would an unsigning decision make the U.S. position \n     on the ICC clear beyond dispute, it would also open the \n     possibility of subsequently unsigning numerous other \n     unratified treaties. It would be a strong signal of a \n     distinctly American internationalism.\n       The writer, a senior vice president of the American \n     Enterprise Institute, was assistant secretary of state for \n     international organization affairs in the first Bush \n     administration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Washington Legal Foundation, May 18, 2001]\n\n  The International Criminal Court: Undemocratic and Unconstitutional\n\n                           (By Lee A. Casey)\n\n       Lee A. Casey is a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of \n     the law firm Baker & Hostetler. He served in the Department \n     of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and Office of Legal \n     Policy during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush \n     administrations. Mr. Casey writes and speaks frequently on \n     international law and constitutional issues.\n       The 1998 Rome Treaty, which would establish a permanent \n     International Criminal Court (``ICC''), creates a number of \n     unprecedented challenges for the United States. The ICC will \n     have the power to investigate and prosecute a series of \n     international criminal offenses, such as ``crimes against \n     humanity,'' heretofore enforceable only in national courts, \n     or in ad hoc tribunals of very limited application. If the \n     U.S. ratifies this treaty, the ICC would have the authority \n     to try and punish American nationals for alleged offenses \n     committed abroad, or in the United States, and that court \n     will be entirely unaccountable for its actions. The ICC \n     would, in fact, be in a position to punish individual \n     American officials for the foreign policy and military \n     actions of the United States, and would not offer even the \n     minimum guarantees of the Bill of Rights to any of the \n     defendants before it.\n       President Clinton made a serious mistake when he signed the \n     Rome Treaty in the waning days of his Administration. The ICC \n     treaty regime is inconsistent with the most basic political \n     and legal principles of the United States, and U.S. \n     ratification of this treaty would, in fact, be \n     unconstitutional. President Bush should move forward and \n     withdraw the Clinton signature.\n       United States Participation in the ICC Treaty Regime Would \n     Threaten American Democracy. The United States was founded on \n     the basic principle that the American people have a right to \n     govern themselves. The elected officials of the United \n     States, as well as its military and the citizenry at large, \n     are ultimately responsible to the legal and political \n     institutions established by our federal and state \n     constitutions, which exercise the sovereignty of the American \n     people. The Rome Treaty would erect an institution, in the \n     form of the ICC, that would claim authority superior to that \n     of the federal government and the states, and superior to the \n     American electorate itself. This court would assert the \n     ultimate authority to determine whether the elected officials \n     of the United States, as well as ordinary American citizens, \n     have acted lawfully on any particular occasion. In this, the \n     Rome Treaty is fundamentally inconsistent with the first \n     tenet of American republicanism--that anyone who exercises \n     power must be responsible for its use to those subject to \n     that power. The governors must be accountable to the \n     governed.\n       Moreover, the ICC would be a powerful tool, for both our \n     adversaries and our allies, to be used against the United \n     States when states that have ratified the Rome Treaty \n     disagree with U.S. foreign and military policy decisions. The \n     offenses within the ICC's jurisdiction, although they are \n     ``defined'' in the Rome Statute, are remarkably flexible in \n     their application. As was acknowledged by the Prosecutor's \n     office of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (``ICTY''), which is widely recognized as \n     the model for the ICC, whether any particular action violates \n     international humanitarian norms is almost always a debatable \n     matter and: ``[t]he answers to these questions are not \n     simple. It may be necessary to resolve them on a case by case \n     basis, and the answers may differ depending on the background \n     and values of the decision-maker.'' See Final Report to \n     the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review NATO \n     Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia, para. 50 (June 13, 2000).\n       The ``values'' of the ICC's prosecutor and judges are \n     unlikely to be those of the United States. The Rome Treaty \n     has been embraced by many states with legal and political \n     traditions dramatically different from our own. This includes \n     states such as Algeria, Cambodia, Haiti, Iran, Nigeria, \n     Sudan, Syria and Yemen, all of which have been implicated in \n     torture or extra-judicial killings, or both. Even our closest \n     allies, including European states following the civil law \n     system, begin with very different assumptions about the power \n     of the courts and the right of the accused. Nevertheless, if \n     it is permitted to be established, the ICC will claim the \n     power to try individual Americans, including U.S. service \n     personnel and officials acting fully in accordance with U.S. \n     law and interests. The court itself would be the final \n     arbiter of its own power, and there would be no appeal from \n     its decisions.\n       United States Ratification of the Rome Treaty Would Be \n     Unconstitutional. Not surprisingly, U.S. ratification of the \n     Rome Treaty would be unconstitutional. By ratifying that \n     agreement, the United States would become a full participant \n     in the ICC treaty regime, affirmatively vesting in the court \n     jurisdiction over its nationals. At the same time, the ICC \n     would not provide the rights guaranteed to all Americans by \n     the Bill of Rights. There would be no jury trials in the ICC, \n     which would follow the Continental ``inquisitorial'' system \n     rather than the Common Law ``adversarial'' system. Moreover, \n     that court would not guarantee Americans the rights to \n     confront hostile witnesses, to a speedy and public trial, and \n     against ``double jeopardy.''\n       For example, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal \n     defendant the right to ``confront'' all hostile witnesses, \n     and, therefore, the right to exclude from evidence most \n     ``hearsay'' evidence. This right is not preserved on the \n     international level. In the ICTY, a court that, like the ICC, \n     theoretically guarantees the right of the confrontation, both \n     anonymous witnesses and virtually unlimited hearsay evidence \n     have been permitted in criminal trials. Similarly, although, \n     like the ICC, the ICTY theoretically preserves the right to a \n     speedy and public trial, defendants often wait years in \n     prison\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\n     for a trial, large portions of which are conducted in secret. \n     In addition, although the Constitution's guarantee against \n     ``double jeopardy'' prevents the prosecution in a criminal \n     case form appealing a judgment of acquittal, acquittals in \n     the ICC would be freely appealable by the prosecution, as \n     they are now in the ICTY--where the Prosecutor has appealed \n     every judgment of acquittal.\n       ICC supporters incorrectly suggest that U.S. participation \n     would not be unconstitutional because that court would not be \n     ``a court of the United States,'' to which the Constitution \n     applies, and invariably point to extradition cases, where the \n     Supreme Court has ruled that Americans may be extradited to \n     face trial overseas in courts without the guarantees of the \n     Bill of Rights. In fact, and unlike the situation in an \n     ordinary extradition case, if the U.S. ratified the Rome \n     Treaty, it would be a full participant in the ICC and its \n     governing structures, and any prosecution brought by the ICC \n     would be as much on behalf of the U.S. as any other state \n     party.\n       Although the Supreme Court has not directly faced such a \n     case, it has suggested that, where a prosecution by a foreign \n     court is, at least in part, undertaken on behalf of the \n     United States, for example, where ``the United States and its \n     allies had enacted substantially similar criminal codes aimed \n     at prosecuting offenses of international character . . .'' \n     then the Bill of Rights would have to apply ``simply because \n     that prosecution [would not be] fairly characterized as \n     distinctly `foreign.' The point would be that the prosecution \n     was as much on behalf of the United States as of the \n     prosecuting nation. . .'' United States v. Balsys, 525 U.S. \n     666 (1998). This would, of course, be exactly the case with \n     the ICC. Since the full and undiluted guarantees of the Bill \n     of Rights would not be available in the ICC, the United \n     States cannot, constitutionally, ratify the ICC Treaty.\n       In addition, by ratifying the Rome Treaty, the United \n     States would vest the ICC with jurisdiction over offenses \n     committed entirely within its territory. The Supreme Court \n     has, however, made clear that criminal offenses committed in \n     the United States, and otherwise within the judicial power of \n     the United States, must be tried in Article III courts, with \n     the full panoply of the Bill of Rights. As the Court \n     explained in the landmark Civil War cases of Ex parte \n     Milligan (1866), 71 U.S. 2 (1866) reversing a civilian's \n     conviction by a military tribunal, ``[e]very trial involves \n     the exercise of judicial power,'' and courts not properly \n     established under Article III can exercise ``no part of the \n     judicial power of the country.'' Thus, since the ICC would \n     not guarantee all of the protections of the Bill of Rights, \n     and because it would not be an ``Article III'' court, the \n     United States cannot vest that institution with any judicial \n     authority over its nationals or its territory.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, last December, President Clinton \ndeposited his signature to the Rome treaty, thereby making the United \nStates party to the creation of a permanent International Criminal \nCourt with unlimited jurisdiction. Once created, this court will have \nthe right to prosecute U.S. citizens without any of the guarantees or \nprotections provided by the Constitution. This will also affect our \nability to protect men and women of our uniformed services and meet our \nmilitary commitments to our allies.\n  President Clinton even acknowledged as he deposited his signature \nthat the Rome treaty had, in his own words, ``significant flaws'' and \nwould not send it to the Senate for ratification.\n  In his confirmation hearing testimony, Secretary Powell made it clear \nthat the administration would not send this treaty to the Senate for \nratification. However, in my opinion and the opinion of others, this is \nnot enough. Once the 60th country ratifies the treaty, the United \nStates and her citizens will become subject to the jurisdiction of the \nICC, regardless of Senate approval under the treaty's own terms. This \nis precisely why we cannot simply allow the treaty to just be confirmed \nand collect dust. I believe it is incumbent upon all of us to try to \nbring, in essence, the treaty down.\n  U.S. Armed Forces operating overseas in peacekeeping operations could \nconceivably be prosecuted by the ICC for protecting the vital interests \nof the United States. In other words, the Senate of the United States \ncould support our men and women going to war in a foreign nation only \nto have an international court rule them as criminals against the state \nor, in essence, criminals against the world.\n  Furthermore, Americans prosecuted by the ICC will not be guaranteed \nany of the procedural protections to which all Americans are entitled \nunder the Bill of Rights. I can recite those for us. We have heard them \nall of our lives: The rights such as the right to a trial by jury or \nthe right to a jury of one's own peers and the right to question one's \naccusers--that is just to name a few of the very rights that we now \nwalk away from for our citizens if we do not stand up boldly and say \nthe International Criminal Court should, in fact, not become an arm of \nthe United Nations.\n  Currently, the Rome treaty already has 139 signatories, and over half \nof the necessary countries have already ratified it. In short, the ICC \nwill soon become a reality unless we act now. The question is whether \nthe United States will oppose it--and we have already opposed Kyoto, \nBiodiversity, CTBT, and other bad treaties--or whether we will simply \nacquiesce to it. The answer to that question is not only one of \nprotecting our service personnel; it is also one of principle. Are we \nfundamentally committed to the sovereign rule of the domestic law of \nour country under the U.S. Constitution as opposed to global justice \nunder the U.N. auspices? I think that is a question on which this \namendment comes right to the point. And are we fundamentally committed \nto helping other countries establish and maintain their own \nconstitutions and their own rule of law?\n  The consequence of allowing this court to come to fruition stretches \nfar beyond the threat of prosecution of American military personnel. It \nwill also put some of our closest allies in direct jeopardy, as we have \nseen in the example of the World Conference on Racism that we have \nheard about over the last good many months. We have seen that action \ntaken by the United Nations and its institutions are not always \nimpartial in their findings. In fact, at the World Conference Against \nRacism, language was adopted hostile to Israel, and it is not limited \nto the text regarding Zionism. Reference to it has attracted much \nattention in light of the 1975 U.N. General Assembly Resolution 3379, \nwhich passed in November of 1975, which condemned Zionism in similar \nthough not identical terms, as ``a threat to world peace and \nsecurity,'' a ``racist and imperialist ideology,'' and as ``a form of \nracism and racial discrimination.''\n  Largely due to American efforts, the General Assembly finally revoked \nResolution 3379 in 1991 with a substantial vote.\n  Ironically, some nations that took part in the World Conference \nAgainst Racism, and who were supporters of language denouncing Zionism \nas racism, are currently still practicing slavery and the trafficking \nof human beings. As a result of this controversy over Zionism, one \ncould easily see the International Criminal Court become nothing more \nthan another U.N. forum for anti-Semitism where the same players that \ncaused the United States and Israel to walk out on the World Conference \non Racism would reappear. The result could be the extradition and \nprosecution of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on charges of crimes against \nhumanity for taking actions to protect the citizens of Israel against \nterrorism within the sovereign boundaries of his own nation. Another \ndocument connected to the Durban conference charges Israel with \n``genocide'' and ``crimes against humanity''--judicial terms that \ndirectly setting the stage for a future prosecution in an international \ncriminal court.\n  I will be the first to admit that atrocities are being committed in \nsome parts of the world, and that the perpetrators of such atrocities \nmust be brought to justice. And whenever possible the United States \nshould serve as a facilitator for that justice to take place, and \nalways be a shining city on a hill, a supreme example for all nations, \nparticularly those with fledgling democracies and judicial systems. But \nthe answer to that problem is not to create a permanent International \nCriminal Court with supra-national jurisdiction capable of undermining \ndemocratic governments, Constitutions, and judicial systems, just \nbecause the court is not satisfied with the outcome of a domestic \nruling. Rather we should work hard to strengthen the rule of law within \nforeign countries, by helping them to establish their own impartial \ncourts capable of ensuring justice for all.\n  When the United Nations was founded in 1945, its primary mission, as \nstated in the preamble of the U.N. Charter, was ``to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has \nbrought untold sorrow to mankind.'' Initially composed only\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\nof countries that had been allied against the Axis, it soon became seen \nas a dispute resolution forum for all countries.\n  In principle at least, the United Nations initially made no claim to \nsupersede the sovereignty of its member states. Even its own Charter, \nArticle 2, says that the U.N. ``is based on the principle of the \nsovereign equality of all its Members,'' and it may not ``intervene in \nmatters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any \nstate.''\n  That is what its charter says. Let's remember what it has done in the \nlast few years.\n  Even in the U.N.'s premiere judicial body, the International Court of \nJustice, the principle of state sovereignty was maintained, with the \nCourt only having limited jurisdiction in disputes between nations. It \nhad no authority over individual citizens of those nations.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years the U.N. has turned the principle of \nnational sovereignty on its head. Through a proliferating host of \nconventions, treaties, conferences, commissions, and initiatives, the \nU.N. has intruded into virtually every aspect of human life once \nthought to be the exclusive preserve of national governments, not to \nmention private citizens. These include efforts to regulate resources \nand the economy, for example treaties on ``biological diversity,'' the \nuse of marine resources, and climate change. They include claims over \nfamily life, such as conventions on parent-child relations and the role \nof women in society. They include, under the guise of anti-racism, \ndemands that countries institute quotas and hate crimes and hate speech \nlaws.\n  While all of these on the surface appear to be good, and in many \ninstances many of us would support them, we must stop short in saying \nthat the U.N. has the right to bring them down on any nation and tread \non that nation's sovereignty.\n  Recently, under the pretext of fighting illicit trafficking in \nweapons, the U.N. has even set its sight on undermining American's \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms under the second amendment.\n  Thankfully, many of these initiatives have been dead-on-arrival in \nthe Senate, and successive Presidents have refused to endorse others. \nMoreover, despite the U.N.'s evolution toward governmental authority it \nhad little to enforce its will. Ideas for global taxation and a \nstanding U.N. army have so far gained little ground.\n  But one key mechanism of global government began to be realized in \n1998 with the adoption of the so-called ``Rome Statute'' establishing a \npermanent International Criminal Court (ICC). Once this dangerous \ntreaty is ratified by 60 countries, the ICC will come into existence. \nFor the first time, the U.N. will wield a judicial power not just over \nnations, but directly over every individual human being. It will even \nclaim authority over citizens of countries whose governments have \nrefused to join the ICC. While the ICC's stated mission is dealing with \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity--which, since there is no appeal \nfrom its decisions, only the ICC will have the right to define--nothing \nprevents the U.N. from broadening its mandate later. Defendants will \nhave none of the due process rights afforded by the U.S. Constitution, \na speedy and public trial, protection against double jeopardy, or \nprotection against self-incrimination, and others previously mentioned. \nAs with other U.N. panels, it can be expected that it will include \n``justices'' from countries notorious for their human rights abuses.\n  It is tempting for many to suppose the ICC will only target the likes \nof a Slobodan Milosevic or the perpetrators of massacres in Rwanda, or \nmaybe rogue state dictators like Iraq's Saddan Hussein, Libya's Muammar \nQadhafi, or Cuba's Fidel Castro. But who can be sure that will be their \nonly target? To some people, former Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet \nis a patriot who saved his country from a communist coup.\n  Again, in the eyes of the beholder, what is he? There are different \nopinions and different attitudes. Who has responsibility? I would \nsuggest that the U.N. should not be allowed to be the judge, or that \nthe U.N. should not be allowed to be the court. Ultimately, the people \nof Chile; in this case, Pinochet. They were the people who made the \ndecisions. They were the judges.\n  In dozens of countries governments enjoy brutal force to suppress \nviolent insurgencies. Should we empower the U.N. to decide whether the \nmilitary authorities in Algeria, Turkey, Macedonia, Sri Lanka, China, \nand India should be put in the defendants' dock, and then commit the \nUnited States to employ sanctions or even military force to bring them \nthere? How about Russia's Vladimir Putin for his war in Chechnya? Or \nIsrael's Ariel Sharon for his war against the Palestinian intifada? Are \nwe ready to trust the U.N. to tell us who should be prosecuted and who \nshouldn't? Critics of the ICC rightfully cite the danger it presents to \nthe safety of U.S. military personnel. What will be the consequences \nfor U.S. national defense and our alliance obligations? Since the death \nof even one person can qualify as a war crime or even genocide in the \nICC, how can we be sure a U.S. soldier serving abroad will not be \nindicted for what we see as just doing their duty?\n\n  The ICC applies not just to soldiers, and not just to acts committed \nabroad; it also would apply to acts ``committed'' by any American here \nat home.\n  Let me suggest, Is this a stretch of my imagination? It is not. \nStatements are broad. The argument of authority within the Rome treaty \nis broad.\n  Even today, our friends in the European Union join domestic critics \nin branding the death penalty in the United States as \n``discriminatory'' and ``inhumane.'' My guess is some of our colleagues \nwould agree with that, while others would not.\n  Who can guarantee that an American Governor might not face an \nindictment by the ICC for ``crimes against humanity'' for signing a \ndeath warrant, or that someday, under some foreign judge's idea of \n``arms trafficking,'' a U.N. court will not demand the extradition of a \nprivate American citizen for selling a gun to his neighbor?\n  It has been suggested that Milosevic's extradition does not set an \nICC precedent threatening U.S. citizens because they will be protected \nby the U.S. Constitution. But why? In the Milosevic case, we demanded \nthat the newly established Yugoslav Constitution be trashed for the \nauthority of the United Nations. We are not defending a constitutional \nright at that point; we are simply saying that an international body \nhas a higher authority. Once the ICC is up and running, why should we \nassume that our Constitution would not be thrown in the trash as well \nas that of Yugoslavia? Nothing in the treaty requires them to respect \nus and to respect our Constitution and our citizens' rights.\n  Trying to ``fix'' the Rome treaty's flaws so we can live with it is \nlike zipping a silk purse out of a sow's ear or putting lipstick on \nthat little piggy. Instead of mistakenly trying to fix the Rome \ntreaty's flaws, the United States must recognize that the ICC is a \nfundamental threat to American sovereignty and civil liberty, and that \nno deal, nor any compromise, is possible. We need to make it clear that \nwe consider the ICC an illegitimate body, that the United States will \nnever become part of it, and that we will never accept its jurisdiction \nover any U.S. citizen or help to impose it on other countries. \nPresident Bush has flatly rejected the Kyoto global warming convention. \nIt is no less urgent that we act as forthrightly on the ICC.\n  According to the administration, the State Department is already \nengaging in what we call low-level participation in the ICC Preparatory \nCommission. Why are we helping to establish an institution that is \ncreated by a treaty that the administration has stated they will not \nsend to the Senate for ratification? Any kind of participation that \nwould lend legitimacy to the Rome treaty would be a mistake and would \nsend a wrong message to our friends in the international community.\n  That is why during my recent meeting with Secretary Powell, and in my \nown op-ed that was published on August 22 in the Washington Post, I \nhave encouraged the administration to remove our signature from the \nRome treaty and to discontinue assistance to\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\nthe International Criminal Court's Preparatory Commission. Such a \nstatement of policy would send a clear signal to those countries that \nare currently wrestling with the issue of ratification that the United \nStates does not support the creation of the Court. This clear signal \nhas already been sent by the House of Representatives earlier this year \nwhen they passed an amendment, with overwhelming bipartisan support, to \nthe State authorization bill that prohibits cooperation with the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n\n  To complement the administration's efforts, and the efforts of the \nHouse of Representatives, I am offering this first- and second-degree \namendment to Commerce-State-Justice, and the Judiciary appropriations \nbill that would prohibit funding to the International Criminal Court \nand its Preparatory Commission. I have discussed this issue with \nSenator Helms. He and many others have indicated their strong support \nfor the proposal.\n  When we stand to cast a vote on these amendments, we literally are \nvoting about American sovereignty. My guess is, when the dust settles \nand the stories are written and this amendment is analyzed, that is \nexactly how it will be viewed. It is a vote to protect the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces--without question--and a vote to protect our \nallies that have become subject to the Court.\n  I will be darned if American sovereignty and the U.S. Constitution \nbecome subject to an International Criminal Court on my watch. And I \nwould hope all of my colleagues would agree.\n  The creation of an international court is not a foregone conclusion. \nWe can intervene. We can state a position. We can ask that we step back \nand withdraw our signatures from this critical action and say to all \nthe world that we will not support an International Criminal Court's \nratification, and we would ask other nations in the world to act \naccordingly.\n  Madam President, at this time I know of no others in this Chamber who \nwish to debate this issue, so I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1538\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, on behalf of Senators \nHarkin, Warner, Inhofe, Cochran, and myself, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Warner, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Cochran, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1538.\n\n  Mr. SMITH Of New Hampshire. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide protection to American Servicemen who were used in \n                      World War II as slave labor)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds made available in this Act may be \n     used by the Department of Justice or the Department of State \n     to file a motion in any court opposing a civil action against \n     any Japanese person or corporation for compensation or \n     reparations in which the plaintiff alleges that, as an \n     American prisoner of war during World War II, he or she was \n     used as slave or forced labor.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, there are many things \nthat happen in war of which, when we look back, many of us on both \nsides of the aisle are not always proud. But I want to point out that \nsometimes things happen that must be corrected just because it is the \nright thing to do. This amendment I am offering is likely to be \nmischaracterized. There will be a lot of things said about what my \namendment does not do. I want to make sure everybody understands what \nmy amendment does. This concerns something that happened during World \nWar II. I want to refer to it before I go to the actual context of the \namendment.\n  There is an article written by Peter Maas I want printed in the \nRecord which is entitled ``They Should Have Their Day In Court.'' I ask \nunanimous consent a copy of that article be printed in the Record. It \nis a Parade magazine article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Parade Magazine, June 17, 2001]\n\n                  They Should Have Their Day In Court\n\n                            (By Peter Mass)\n\n       Tears suddenly fill Lester Tenney's eyes. ``I'm sorry,'' he \n     says. ``It's been a long time, but it's still very hard \n     sometimes to talk about.'' All I can do is nod dumbly. Words \n     fail me as I listen to the horror he is describing.\n       On April 9, 1942, Tenney, a 21-year-old Illinois National \n     Guardsman, was one of 12,000 American soldiers who \n     surrendered to the Japanese at the tip of Bataan Peninsula, \n     which juts into Manila Bay in the Philippines. Ill-equipped, \n     ill-trained, disease-ridden, they had fought ferociously for \n     nearly five months against overwhelming odds, with no \n     possibility of help, until they ran out of food, medical \n     supplies and ammunition.\n       As prisoners of war, Tenney among them, they were taken to \n     a prison camp by the Japanese army on what became infamous as \n     the nine-day, 55-mile-long Bataan Death March, during which \n     1000 of them perished. The atrocities they suffered have to \n     some extent been revealed. But what happened afterward--when \n     they were forced into inhuman slave labor for some of Japan's \n     biggest corporations--remains largely unknown. These \n     corporations, many of which have become global giants, \n     include such familiar names as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Kawasaki \n     and Nippon Steel.\n       Through interviews with former POWs and examinations of \n     government records and court documents, I learned that in \n     1999 Tenney had filed a lawsuit for reparations in a \n     California state court. His suit was followed by a number of \n     others by veterans who had suffered a similar fate. The \n     Japanese corporations, instead of confronting their dark \n     past, went into deep denial. Represented by American law \n     firms, they maintained that, by treaty, they didn't owe \n     anybody anything--not even an apology.\n       Surprisingly, the U.S. government stepped in on behalf of \n     the Japanese and not only had these lawsuits moved to federal \n     jurisdiction but also succeeded in getting them dismissed by \n     Vaughn R. Walker, a federal judge in the Northern District of \n     California. In his ruling, Judge Walker declared in essence \n     that the fact that we had won the war was enough of a payoff. \n     His exact words were ``The immeasurable bounty of life for \n     themselves [the POWs] and their posterity in a free society \n     services the debt.'' In applauding the judge's decision, an \n     attorney for Nippon Steel was quoted as saying, ``It's \n     definitely a correct ruling.'' She did not dwell on what \n     these men had gone through.\n       What befell Lester Tenney as a POW was by no means unique. \n     He got an inkling of what was to come on that April day in \n     1942 when he surrendered and one of his captors smashed in \n     his nose with the butt end of a rifle. Forced to stumble \n     along a road of crushed rock and loose sand, the men--\n     wracked with malaria, jaundice and dysentery--were given \n     no water. Occasionally, they would pass a well. Anyone who \n     paused to scoop up a handful of water was more likely than \n     not bayoneted or shot to death. The same fate awaited most \n     POWs who could no longer walk. ``If you stopped,'' Tenney \n     recalls, ``they killed you.''\n       As Tenney staggered forward, he saw a Japanese officer \n     astride a horse, wielding a samurai sword and chortling as he \n     tried, often successfully, to decapitate POWs. During a rare \n     respite, one prisoner was so disoriented that he could not \n     get up. A rifle butt knocked him senseless. Two of his fellow \n     POWs, were ordered to dig a shallow trench, put him in it and \n     bury him while he was still alive. They refused. One of them \n     immediately had his head blown off with a pistol shot. Two \n     more POWs were then ordered to dig two trenches--one for the \n     dead POW, the other for the original prisoner, who had begun \n     to moan. Tenney heard him continue to moan as he was being \n     covered with dirt.\n       Tenney was one of 500 POWs packed into a 50-by-50-foot hold \n     of a Japan-bound freighter. The overhead hatches were kept \n     closed except when buckets of rice and water were lowered \n     twice daily. Each morning, four POWs were allowed topside to \n     hoist up buckets of bodily wastes and the corpses of any-one \n     who had died during the night, which were tossed overboard.\n       In Japan, the prisoners were sent to a coal mine about 35 \n     miles from a city they had never heard of, called Nagasaki. \n     The mine was owned by the Mitsui conglomerate, which is today \n     one of the world's biggest corporations. You see the truck \n     containers it builds on every highway in America. The mine \n     was so dangerous that Japanese miners refused to work in it.\n       The Geneva Convention of 1929 specified that the POWs of \n     any nation ``shall at all times be humanely treated and \n     protected'' and explicitly forbade forced labor. Japan, \n     however, never ratified the treaty. That was how it justified \n     putting POWs to work during World War II, freeing up able-\n     bodied Japanese men for military service.\n       Lester Tenney and his fellow POW slave laborers worked 12-\n     hour shifts. Their diet, primarily rice, amounted to less \n     than 600 calories a day. This was subsequently reduced\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n     to about 400 calories. When he was taken prisoner, Tenney \n     weighed 185 pounds. When he was liberated in 1945, he weighed \n     97 pounds.\n       Vicious beatings by Mitsui overseers at the mine were \n     constant. Tenney's worst moment came when two overseers \n     decided he wasn't working fast enough and went at him with a \n     pickax and a shovel. His nose was broken again. So was his \n     left shoulder. The business end of the ax pierced his side, \n     just missing his hip bone but causing enough internal damage \n     to leave him with a permanent limp.\n       Frank Bigelow was a Navy seaman on the island fortress of \n     Corregodor in Manila Bay. It was lost about a month after \n     Bataan fell, so Bigelow escaped the Death March. But he ended \n     up in the same Mitsui coal mine as Tenney. He was in the \n     deepest hard-rock part of the mine when a boulder toppled \n     onto his leg, snapping both the tibia and fibula bones 6 \n     inches below the knee. A POW Army doctor, Thomas Hewlett, was \n     refused plaster of Paris for a cast. Hewlett tried to \n     construct a makeshift splint, but it didn't work. Bigelow's \n     leg began to swell and become putrid. Tissue-destroying \n     gangrene had set in.\n       With four men holding Bigelow down, Hewlett performed an \n     amputation without anesthesia, using a razor and a hacksaw \n     blade. Bigelow recalls: ``I said, `Doc, do you have any \n     whiskey you could give me?' and he said, `If I had any. I'd \n     be drinking it myself.' '' To keep the gangrenous toxins from \n     spreading, Hewlett packed the amputation with one item \n     readily available in the prison camp--maggots. Bigelow still \n     can't comprehend how he withstood the excruciating pain. \n     ``You don't know what you can do 'till you do it,'' he says.\n       Another seaman, George Cobb, was aboard the submarine \n     Sealion in Manila Bay when it was sunk in an air attack three \n     days after Pearl Harbor. Cobb was shipped to a copper mine in \n     northern Japan owned by the Mitsubishi corporate empire. Clad \n     only in gunnysacklike garments, the POWs had to trudge to the \n     mine through 10-foot-snowdrifts in bitter winter cold. Of 10 \n     captured Sealion crewmen. Cobb is the sole survivor. ``I try \n     not to remember anything,'' he says. ``I want it to be a \n     four-year blank.''\n       One day in August 1945, Lester Tenney and his fellow POWs \n     saw a huge, mushroom-shaped cloud billowing from Nagasaki. \n     None of them, of course, knew it was the atom bomb that would \n     end the war. They found out on Aug. 15 that Japan has \n     surrendered when they were given Red Cross food packages for \n     the first time during their long captivity. They then found a \n     nearby warehouse crammed with similar packages and medical \n     supplies that had never been distributed. They also would \n     learn that the Japanese high command had a master plan to \n     exterminate all the POW slave laborers, presumably to cover \n     up their horrific ordeal.\n       After the POWs returned home, they were given U.S. \n     government forms to sign that bound them not to speak \n     publicly about what had been done to them. America was in a \n     geopolitical battle with the Soviet Union and, later, Red \n     China for the hearts and minds of the postwar Japanese and \n     did not want to do anything that might prove offensive to our \n     recent enemy. The State Department's chief policy adviser to \n     Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who headed up the occupation of \n     Japan, rhetorically asked: ``Is it believed that a Communist \n     Japan is in the best interests of the United States?''\n       But Tenney, possibly because of his extended \n     hospitalization, never got one of those forms. In 1946 he \n     wrote a letter to the State Department citing his experience \n     and requesting guidance on how to mount claims against those \n     who had beaten, tortured and enslaved him. The State \n     Department replied that it was looking into the matter and \n     advised him not to retain an attorney.\n       Hearing nothing further, Tenney, a high school dropout, \n     decided to get on with his life. He eventually earned a Ph.D. \n     in finance and taught at both San Diego State University and \n     Arizona State University. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Japan \n     finalized a peace treaty in 1951.\n       Two years ago, Tenney read that the U.S. government not \n     only had successfully worked on behalf of Holocaust victims \n     in Europe but also was brokering an agreement with Germany to \n     compensate those forced into slave labor during the Nazi \n     regime. It was then that he filed his own lawsuit against \n     Mitsui.\n       The U.S. State Department and Justice Department intervened \n     for the Japanses corporate defendants on the basis of the \n     1951 treaty, a clause of which purports to waive all future \n     restitution claims. But the treaty contains another clause, \n     which the U.S. government to date has chosen to ignore, \n     stating that all bets would be off if other nations got the \n     Japanese to agree to more favorable terms than our treaty. \n     Eleven nations--including the then Soviet Union, Vietnam and \n     the Philippines--got such terms.\n       There is still hope for the surviving POWs, their widows \n     and heirs. Last March, two California Congressmen, Republican \n     Dana Rohrabacher and Democrat Mike Honda, co-sponsored a bill \n     (H.R. 1198) calling for justice for the POWs.\n       Notably, Honda is a Japanese-American who, as an infant, \n     was interned by the U.S. with his mother and father during \n     World War II. The U.S. has since paid each surviving internee \n     $20,000 in restitution and, perhaps more important, \n     acknowledged that the internment was wrong. ``I believe,'' \n     Honda told me, ``that these POWs not only fought for their \n     country but survived, and now they are trying to survive our \n     judicial system. They should have their day in court.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I think most of us are \nfamiliar with or have heard discussions about the Bataan Death March. \nThat was a terrible experience for a lot of American GIs. But I think \nwhat happened after the Bataan Death March, to some of those same \npeople, and others, is particularly outrageous.\n  I want to refer to a couple of paragraphs from this article because \nit certainly sums up why they should have their day in court and what \nexactly we are talking about with regard to these American GIs and \nPOWs. Let me read a couple of paragraphs.\n  On April 9, 1942, a gentleman by the name of Lester Tenney, one of \n12,000 POWs, American soldiers, surrendered to the Japanese at the tip \nof Bataan Peninsula. They were taken to a prison camp by the Japanese \nArmy on what became infamous as the 9-day, 55-mile-long Bataan Death \nMarch during which 1,000 of them perished. I will not go into all of \nthe details, but a few details will show why a day in court is \njustified and is important. The atrocities they suffered--some have \nbeen revealed; some have not--and what happened afterward, where they \nwere forced into slave labor camps for some of Japan's biggest \ncorporations, remains largely unknown. Frankly, until I got involved in \nthis a few months ago, I didn't know some of this had happened.\n  Many of these corporations have become global giants today, including \nsome names that would certainly get one's attention: Mitsubishi, \nMatsui, Kawasaki, and Nippon, to name just a few.\n  Through interviews with former POWs, we have come to learn a lot. But \nto my amazement, the United States Government stepped in on behalf of \nthe Japanese and not only had lawsuits thrown out to get reparations \nfor what happened--they moved to Federal jurisdiction--but also \nsucceeded in getting them dismissed. I found that particularly \noutrageous. This is all pointed out by Mr. Maas in his article.\n  I want to quote one paragraph as to what happened during that march \nand then go into a little bit about what happened after the Bataan \nDeath March:\n       What befell Lester Tenney as a POW was by no means unique. \n     He got an inkling of what was to come on that April day in \n     1942 when he surrendered and one of his captors smashed his \n     nose with the butt end of a rifle. Forced to stumble along a \n     road of crushed rock and loose sand, the men--wracked with \n     malaria, jaundice and dysentery--were given no water. \n     Occasionally, they would pass a well. Anyone who paused to \n     scoop up a handful of water was more likely than not \n     bayoneted or shot to death. The same fate awaited most POWs \n     who could no longer walk. ``If you stopped,'' Tenney recalls, \n     ``they killed you.''\n       As Tenney staggered forward, he saw a Japanese officer \n     astride a horse, wielding a samurai sword and chortling as he \n     tried, often successfully, to decapitate POWs. During a rare \n     respite, one prisoner was so disoriented that he could not \n     get up. A rifle butt knocked him senseless. Two of his fellow \n     POWs were ordered to dig a shallow trench, put him in it and \n     bury him while he was still alive. They refused. One of them \n     immediately had his head blown off with a pistol shot. Two \n     more POWs were then ordered to dig two trenches--one for the \n     dead POW, the other for the original prisoner, who had begun \n     to moan. Tenney heard him continue to moan as he was being \n     covered with dirt.\n       Tenney was one of 500 POWs packed into a 50-by-50-foot hold \n     of a Japan-bound freighter. The overhead hatches were kept \n     closed except when buckets of rice and water were lowered \n     twice daily. Each morning, four POWs were allowed topside to \n     hoist up buckets of bodily wastes and the corpses of anyone \n     who had died during the night. . . .\n\n  This is what happened to them after the Bataan Death March. When they \nsurvived that, they were put on these freighters and taken into these \ncoal mines and basically made slaves.\n  Vicious beatings by Mitsui overseers at the mine were constant. \nTenney's worst moment came when two overseers decided he wasn't working \nfast enough and went at him with a pickax and a shovel. His nose was \nbroken again. So was his left shoulder. The business end of the ax \npierced his side, just missing his hip bone but causing enough internal \ndamage to leave him with a permanent limp.\n  Most of us are familiar enough with stories that came out of the \nBataan Death March to know what happened there. But to think of \nsurviving that 55-mile trek over a 9-day period, basically being \nbayonetted if you helped a\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\nfriend who fell down or beaten or whatever, to survive all of that and \nthen be placed into camps, slave labor camps on behalf of these \ncorporations by these corporations.\n  I want to read the amendment I am offering because it is important to \nunderstand what the content is. All it says is:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used by \n     the Department of Justice or the Department of State to file \n     a motion in any court opposing a civil action against any \n     Japanese person or corporation for compensation or \n     reparations in which the plaintiff alleges that, as an \n     American prisoner of war during World War II, he or she was \n     used as a slave or forced labor.\n\n  All this says is that no funds will be used to block the right of \nthese folks to go to court. It doesn't provide any money to anybody. It \ndoesn't assume that anybody is going to win this case. It doesn't do \nany of that. We are probably going to hear that. That is not the case.\n  All it says is that the State Department stays out of it, the Justice \nDepartment stays out of it, and these folks are allowed to have their \nday in court.\n  Let me explain why I introduced this amendment. As I said, to go \nthrough what they went through in the Bataan Death March, and then to \nbe put into slave camps by Japanese companies was atrocious. I want to \nmake clear what I mean by Japanese corporations. War is a terrible \nreality. I have said that. What happens during war is tragic, and \nsometimes it just happens. There is not a heck of a lot you can do \nabout it. What happened in World War II at the hands of these private \nJapanese companies is especially tragic because there has never been \nanything done about it. We are not talking about the Japanese \nGovernment torturing American prisoners. I want to make that clear. The \nwar is over. A treaty was signed. Whatever happened, happened. That is \nbehind us.\n  What we are talking about is private Japanese corporations, many of \nwhich exist today, corporations that Americans know and trust, who used \nAmericans as slaves, who should have been offered protection under the \nGeneva Convention--not the Japanese Government, please understand, the \nJapanese corporations.\n  Out of the 36,000 U.S. soldiers who were captured by the Japanese, \n5,300 roughly are alive today. They are not getting any younger.\n  Several of those veterans live in New Hampshire. I was astounded to \nfind out that eight or nine of them do actually live in New Hampshire. \nI am sure they can be found in every State in the Union. I met with \nsome of those veterans during the August recess. It was a very \nemotional meeting, but the interesting thing about it, there was no \nanger presented to me about what happened in the war. The anger and \nfrustration that was expressed to me was what happened with these \nprivate companies that went beyond what happened in the war.\n  Arthur Reynolds from Kingston, NH, spent 3\\1/2\\ years as a POW, 2 \nyears of which he spent shoveling coal under unspeakable conditions for \na private Japanese company. He lost 100 pounds in captivity and weighed \nless than 100 pounds when he was liberated. He survived on barely 500 \ncalories a day, suffered countless beatings. Now he is being told by \nhis Government--not the Japanese Government, the United States \nGovernment--that they are on the side of the Japanese corporation that \nenslaved him.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is just flat out wrong. Whatever happens \nin the courtroom happens in the courtroom. That is why we have lawyers \non both sides. But what we are talking about here is the right to sue.\n  That is what we are talking about--not the right to have a victory \nwhen you sue, just the right to sue. However you feel, I have some very \nstrong feelings that they should win this case and many Americans--\nmost, I hope--also do. We are not asking for a victory, as much as I \nwould like to see it. We are asking for the right to sue.\n  Arthur is 85 years old. How much longer is Arthur going to live? \nManford Dusett from Seabrook, NH, spent 3\\1/2\\ years as a POW. Like \nArthur Reynolds, he is a survivor of the Bataan Death March and the so \ncalled hell ships that transported the prisoners to Japan. He was \nforced to work in a coal mine for 10 to 12 hours a day, with almost no \nfood and under the worst imaginable conditions. He suffered a broken \nleg in the mine. Frankly, he is lucky to be alive today. He was able to \nget just enough medical treatment to survive. Manford, as his \ncolleague, weighed less than 100 pounds when he was released. There \nwere others from New Hampshire. This gentleman in the picture here is \nRoland Stickney from Lancaster. I met with him. There are others from \nNew Hampshire: Roland Gagnon from Nashua, Roland Stickney from \nLancaster, Arthur Locke from Hookset, Wesley Wells from Hillsburo, Bill \nOnufrey from Freedom, Ernest Ouellette of Boscawen, and I am sure I \nmissed a few. I tried to find everybody.\n  My colleagues who might be familiar with the plight of these \nveterans, I have submitted for the Record the Parade magazine article. \nIt is important you read that to understand not only what happened to \nthem in the Bataan Death March but, after that, how they survived when \nthey were put on those ships. Imagine being taken in those ships to the \ncoal mines and other places where they were reported to work as slaves.\n  These veterans are seeking compensation through our legal system--\nthat is all they are doing--from the Japanese corporations that used \nthem as slave laborers. That is all they are doing. Yet, believe it or \nnot, our Government, the U.S. Government, is trying to stop that. They \nare opposing veterans' efforts to seek proper redress through our \njudicial system. Is that constitutional?\n  Should our Government be stopping a private citizen from seeking his \nor her day in court for a grievance? I don't think so. I think it is \nwrong. I am, frankly, ashamed it is happening, which is why I am on the \nfloor of the Senate. I am not here to redebate the war, refight the \nwar, or bring up and point out the atrocities of the war. That is not \nwhy I am here. I don't think the veterans would want me to do that. The \nState Department facilitated, ironically, a recent agreement between \nGerman companies and their victims who were used as slave laborers \nduring World War II. I commend them for that. That was the right thing \nto do.\n  Last year this body passed S. Con. Res. 158, introduced by my \ncolleague and good friend, Senator Hatch, and urged the Secretary of \nState to facilitate discussions between these veterans and the guilty \ncorporations. But the State Department chose to ignore this \nrecommendation, unlike what they did in the German case. When it comes \nto the Japanese case, they chose to ignore this. In the case of the \nJapanese companies, the State and Justice Departments argued--listen \ncarefully--that the private claims of the veterans were waived by the \n1951 peace treaty with Japan. I will repeat that because it is very \nimportant to the whole discussion of this case. The State and Justice \nDepartments argued that the private claims of veterans were waived by \nthe 1951 peace treaty with Japan. I am going to say, with the greatest \nrespect, that that is flatout wrong. Their rights were not waived. Why \ndo they maintain this position then?\n  Let me read from the 1951 peace treaty, article 14(b). Let me read \nfrom article 14(b) in the 1951 peace treaty:\n       [E]xcept as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the \n     Allied Powers waive all reparation claims of the Allied \n     Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals \n     arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals \n     in the course of the prosecution of the war and claims of the \n     Allied Powers for direct military costs of occupation.\n\n  If I had only read article 14(b), which I just read, I might have \nagreed--and probably would have--that the claims of these veterans were \nwaived by the treaty because that is what it sounds like. But the issue \nis a lot deeper than that. So if someone is going to read article 14(b) \non the Senate floor and say, therefore, these claims are waived, then \nwe have to go beyond that. Let me go beyond that:\n\n       Article 14(b) does not waive private claims against private \n     Japanese companies.\n\n  Don't be mistaken. The State Department knew this in 1951 when the \ntreaty was signed. In fact, John Foster Dulles, the chief negotiator \nfor the treaty--prior to his being Secretary of State--orchestrated a \nconfidential exchange of diplomatic notes between the Japanese and the \nDutch to address this very issue in 14(b). In short, the Dutch didn't \nwant any part of 14(b). They refused to waive the private claims of\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\ntheir nationals because, as the United States--remember the fifth \namendment?--the Dutch were constitutionally barred from doing so \nwithout due process of law. So they had a constitutional problem like \nwe have. They can't waive the private claims. Fortunately, the \ndiplomatic notes--and this is what burns me up, frankly, if I may say \nit as nicely as I can. We find so much information classified in \nGovernment. It is the old cover-your-you-know-what routine. That is why \nwe keep it classified. There are legitimate reasons to classify \nmaterials, but 50 years later we finally get the truth declassified. \nAll these guys, for all these years, were being denied their day in \ncourt when the truth was buried in the classified files. It is just \nabsolutely unbelievable. I am not saying I am the first to find it. I \nknow lawyers have found it for the others, for those doing this, those \nwho are suing. But let me go right at it.\n  What did those diplomatic notes say? We have it right here. This is \nSeptember 7, 1951, just declassified in 2000, 50 years later, after all \nthese guys have fought all these years trying to get reparations, and \nmost of them have died. Only 5,300 remain out of 12,000. Here we are. I \nwill read this letter:\n\n       Dear Mr. Prime Minister,\n       I beg to draw the attention of Your Excellency to the \n     paragraph in the address to President and Delegates of the \n     Peace Conference I made yesterday, reading as follows:\n       ``Some question has arisen as to the interpretation of the \n     reference in article 14(b) to ``claims of Allied Powers and \n     their nationals''--\n\n  It sounded as if we waived everybody's rights--\n\n     which the Allied Powers agree to waive.\n       It is my Government's view that article 14(b) as a matter \n     of correct interpretation does not involve the expropriation \n     by each Allied Government of the private claims of its \n     national so that after the Treaty comes into force these \n     claims will be non-existent.\n       The question is important because some Governments, \n     including my own, are under certain limitations of \n     constitutional and other governing laws as to confiscating or \n     expropriating private property of their nationals.\n\n  Signed by the Prime Minister of Japan.\n  This one is signed by Dirk Stikker, Minister of Foreign Affairs of \nthe Netherlands. A copy was sent to the Japanese Government. It says, \nin part:\n\n       Also, there are certain types of private claims by allied \n     nationals, which we would assume the Japanese Government \n     might want voluntarily to deal with in its own way as a \n     matter of good conscience or of enlightened expediency . . . \n     .\n\n  And so forth.\n  To get to the fourth chart, this is from the Prime Minister of Japan \nto the Dutch, and I will read this portion outlined:\n\n       With regard to the question mentioned in Your Excellency's \n     note, I have the honor to state as follows:\n       In view of the constitutional legal limitations referred to \n     by the Government of the Netherlands, the Government of Japan \n     does not consider that the Government of the Netherlands by \n     signing the Treaty has itself expropriated the private claims \n     of its nationals so that, as a consequence thereof, after the \n     Treaty comes into force these claims would be nonexistence.\n\n  The Japanese Government is saying that:\n\n       However, the Japanese Government points out that, under the \n     Treaty, Allied nationals will not be able to obtain \n     satisfaction regarding such claims, although, as the \n     Netherlands Government suggests, there are certain types of \n     private claims by Allied nationals which the Japanese \n     Government might wish to voluntarily deal with.\n\n  These two documents remained classified for 50 years while these guys \ntried for 50 years to get their day in court. Our own Government would \nnot give these documents to our own soldiers. What an outrage that is. \nThat is an absolute outrage.\n  The 1951 peace treaty in no way obligates the Government of Japan to \npay any private claims. I admit that. It does not obligate them to do \nanything. We are not talking about the Government of Japan.\n  At the same time, the treaty does not waive private claims against \nprivate Japanese companies, as the State and Justice Departments would \nlike you to believe, and it is right there in declassified documents \nfinally after 50 years.\n  How is an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Government of \nJapan and the Government of the Netherlands relevant to the United \nStates and its citizens? Good question. The answer lies in article 26 \nof the peace treaty, and this is what article 26 says:\n\n       Should Japan make a peace settlement or war claims \n     settlement with any state granting that state greater \n     advantages than those provided by the present treaty, those \n     same advantages shall be extended to the parties of the \n     present treaty.\n\n  In other words, if they make a deal with the Netherlands, it does not \ninvolve anybody else who has the same constitutional problems. This \noccurred in an exchange of diplomatic notes. Japan made it clear the \ntreaty did not waive the private claims of Dutch citizens, and article \n26 automatically extends this to American citizens. Pure and simple. \nEnd of story.\n  This would have been resolved 20 or 30 years ago if somebody had just \ndeclassified these documents. If somebody can please tell me why these \ndocuments were classified for 50 years because of national security, I \nwill be happy to say we should classify them again.\n\n  The Departments of State and Justice are on the side of Japanese \ncorporations. That is what this amendment is about: Are you on the side \nof our Justice Department and State Department that are on the side of \nthe Japanese corporations that did this to our Americans, against the \nintent of that treaty, or are you on the side of the American GIs and \nPOWs who for 50 years have been denied their day in court?\n  That is it. There is nothing complicated about my colleagues' vote on \nthis one. That is it: You are either for the American GIs who served \nand were prisoners and were slaves or you are on the side of the \nJapanese corporations that put them in slave camps and your own Justice \nDepartment and State Department which kept the documents classified for \n50 years so they could not get their day in court. Whose side are you \non? That is it. There is nothing complicated about it.\n  What has happened is wrong. It goes against the historical record, \nand my amendment simply prevents the unnecessary interference of the \nDepartments of State and Justice in this case. I repeat, because it is \nvery important to understand, I do not predetermine the outcome with my \namendment.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to repeat what the amendment says so \nthat everybody understands it:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act--\n\n  The underlying legislation, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, \nState--\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Department of Justice or the Department of State to file \n     a motion in any court opposing a civil action . . . .\n\n  In other words, we do not want Justice and State to come in now and \noppose the action of this court, of these men, mostly men. Why? Because \nfor 50 years these documents were classified and they did not even have \nthe opportunity to do it. We did them a disservice. These are men who \nfought and suffered horribly in a terrible war.\n  I urge my colleagues to please read my amendment when you come down \nto the Chamber to vote to give these men--brave men, heroes--the \nopportunity to go to court under the terms of the 1951 treaty, and give \nthem an opportunity to be heard. That is all we are doing.\n  I also want to point out in all that--I did not say it at the time, \nbut to give a little bit more credence to the argument, guess who \ndrafted the memos we are talking about between the Dutch and the \nJapanese. Who was involved in that draft? None other than John Foster \nDulles. That is the great tragedy of this. John Foster Dulles himself \nparticipated in the draft of those documents. We have all the evidence \nto that as well.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will say to Justice and State: \nStep aside; it is the right thing to do. You kept this secret all these \nyears by classifying documents and did not allow our guys a day in \ncourt. Step aside; do the decent thing and let these men go to court, \nas it is determined under the treaty we now know, and allow them to \nsue. If they lose, they lose. If they win, they win, but just let them \ngo to court.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, for proposing this important \nlegislation and for offering this amendment today, which I am proud to \ncosponsor.\n  Before I get into the need for the amendment and perhaps repeat some \nof the facts that the Senator from New Hampshire brought up, let me \ntake a minute to summarize what happened in the Philippines and Japan \nbetween 1942 and 1945.\n  On March 11, 1942, Gen. Douglas MacArthur reluctantly left behind \nthousands of American troops in the Philippines. Arriving in Melbourne, \nAustralia, he pledged, of course, those famous words: ``I shall \nreturn.''\n  General MacArthur did return. He liberated the Philippines and rolled \nback the forces of imperial Japan. Sadly, MacArthur was too late for \nthe hundreds who had died in the infamous Bataan Death March. In that \n3-day forced march, American troops were denied food and water, beaten \nand bayoneted if they fell to the ground. As many as 700 Americans lost \ntheir lives in those 3 days.\n  It also was too late for the thousands who lost their lives on the \nso-called hell ships that transported surviving POWs to Japan and \nJapanese-occupied territories. Packed into cargo holds, American POWs \nstruggled for air, as temperatures reached 125 degrees. Almost 4,000 \nAmerican servicemen would lose their lives just on these journeys in \nthese cargo ships.\n  Those who survived Bataan and the hell ships would find little rest \nas Japanese POWs. For more than 3 years, they would serve as slave \nlabor for private Japanese companies, the same companies whose names we \nrevere today and whose products we buy daily, weekly, and monthly in \nthe United States: Matsui, Mitsubishi, Nippon, and others.\n  Throughout the war, Americans worked in the mines of these companies, \ntheir factories, their shipyards, their steel mills. They labored every \nday for 10 hours or more a day in dangerous working conditions. Some of \nthose who went into the mines were sent into the mines because it was \ntoo dangerous for Japanese to work in them. So they sent the American \nPOWs into the coal mines to dig the coal. They were beaten on a regular \nbasis.\n  Frank Exline of Pleasant Hill, IA, was one of those POWs. A Navy \nseaman who was captured April 9, 1942, Frank spent 39 months working \nfor Japanese companies in Osaka, Japan. He began on the docks unloading \nrock salt and keg iron. Later, he found himself toiling in the rice \nfields. He was fed two rice bowls a day and given very little water.\n  During his time with these Japanese companies, Frank was tortured and \nbeaten, once for stealing a potato. Upon being caught, the potato was \nshoved in his mouth as he was forced to stand at rigid attention \ndirectly in the sun for 45 minutes. If he moved or even blinked, he was \nhit in the face.\n  Then there is Frank Cardamon of Des Moines, a marine who was \nstationed in China. His ship was sent back to the U.S. to get more \nsupplies. When it stopped in the Philippines, of course, the ship was \nattacked and captured. Frank was captured at Corregidor and sent to \nJapan to work in an auto parts factory and then in the lead mines.\n  He was never paid for his work, fed two cups of rice a day, and went \nfrom 160 pounds to 68 pounds in his 3 years of capture. These men tell \nme they survived on sheer will, not on the food.\n  Last month in Iowa, as Senator Smith did in New Hampshire, I met with \nthree other POWs and their families on this issue. I met with William \nMcFall of Des Moines, who received a Purple Heart and numerous other \nmedals. He worked in the coal mines and told me about how dangerous it \nwas working in the coal mines.\n  I met with the sisters of Jon Hood, a Navy seaman forced to work on \nthe shipping docks. I met with Gene Henderson of Des Moines. He \nactually was not in the military. He was a civilian employee at the \nPacific Naval Air Base on Wake Island. Gene Henderson was captured and \nsent to China to work on Japanese artillery ranges before he was sent \nto work in the iron ore pits in Japan.\n  Although she could not attend the meeting I held, Margaret Baker of \nOelwin, IA, wrote me a letter in June about her late husband Charles \nBaker. Charles Baker, who was an Army private, survived the Bataan \nDeath March before he was sent to work in the mines in Japan for 3 \nyears. He died at age 54 in 1973. In her letter she wrote:\n\n       He suffered many injuries and hunger on the Death March \n     during his imprisonment. We feel that his early death was \n     caused by the suffering that he endured while working long \n     hours in the mines, without food, rest and clothing.\n\n  I speak for this amendment and support it on behalf of these veterans \nand their families. These men and 700 of their fellow prisoners of war \nand their families are now seeking long delayed justice. They have gone \nto court to ask for compensation from the Japanese companies that used \nthem as slave laborers during the war.\n  They deserve their day in court. Yet as the Senator from New \nHampshire has pointed out, our own State Department has come down on \nthe side of the Japanese companies, not our POWs. The State Department \nhas taken the view that the peace treaty signed in 1951 prohibits \nreparations from private Japanese companies for survivors such as Frank \nCardamon or Gene Henderson. In fact, State Department officials have \nsubmitted statements to the Court in support of the view of the \nJapanese companies. I do not think that is right. I do not think it is \nfair. That is why I am a cosponsor of Senator Smith's amendment that \nwould stop the State Department and the Department of Justice from \nusing taxpayer dollars to defend the interests of these Japanese \ncompanies.\n  I might add, the House passed this amendment in July by an \noverwhelming 393-to-33 vote, an amendment stating the State Department \nshould not be allowed to use our tax dollars to fight against our \nAmerican POWs in court. Now again, as Senator Smith said, I am sure \nwhile we both believe the Japanese companies ought to pay reparations \nand ought to pay these POWs for the slave labor they provided during \nthe war, that is not what our amendment says. Our amendment simply says \nlet them go to court; let them make their case; let the Japanese \ncompanies come in and defend themselves, if they will.\n  That is all we are asking. We are not preconditioning the outcome. We \nare not setting up any kind of a standard by which they will be held in \none view over the Japanese companies. We are simply saying let them \nhave their day in court. We are saying our State Department should not \nbe intervening in State or Federal courts against these POWs. Let the \nPOWs have their own arguments and their day in court, and let us keep \nour State Department out of it.\n\n  These men courageously served our country. They endured unspeakable, \nwretched conditions as slave laborers for these Japanese companies. \nMacArthur was forced to leave them behind in 1942. In 2001, let us not \nleave them behind one more time. Let us give them their day in court.\n  My colleague has given all of the arguments. He has outlined what the \ntreaty said in article 14(b). He laid out very cogently and clearly the \nside agreements that had been done by John Foster Dulles, at that time \nthe chief negotiator for the allied nations, whose letters and side \nagreements were not brought to light until April of last year. So for \nall of these years these POWs and their lawyers really perhaps did not \nhave a leg to stand on because of this treaty, but then after April of \n2000 we found out the Japanese had made an agreement with the \nGovernment of the Netherlands to allow the private citizens of the \nNetherlands to pursue their private claims.\n  Then article 26 of the 1951 peace treaty sort of trumps article \n14(b). Now article 14(b), as Senator Smith pointed out, basically said: \nThe allied powers waive all reparation claims of the allied powers, \nother claims of the allied powers and their nationals arising out of \nany actions taken by Japan and its nationals in the course of the \nprosecution of the war.\n  On its face, that ends it. That ends it right there. For all of these \nyears, that is what sort of the basis in court was. Article 26 did \nstate, should Japan make a peace settlement or war claims settlement \nwith any state granting that state greater advantages than those \nprovided by the present treaty, those\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nsame advantages shall be extended to the parties to the present treaty.\n  We did not know until April 2000 that the Japanese Government had \nindeed made a war claims settlement with another state granting greater \nadvantages to the nationals of that state, and that was, of course, the \nDutch citizens because the diplomatic note to the Japanese Prime \nMinister from the Dutch Foreign Minister--again which was read by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, and I just repeat it for emphasis sake--it \nsaid that: It is my Government's view--that is, the Government's view \nof the Government of the Netherlands--that article 14(b), as a matter \nof correct interpretation, does not involve the expropriation by each \nallied government of the private claims of its nationals. So that after \nthe treaty comes into force, these claims will be nonexistent.\n  In other words, the Dutch Minister said: It is my Government's view \nthat 14(b) does not prohibit private claims of the nationals of the \nNetherlands.\n  The Japanese Prime Minister responded:\n\n       In view of the constitutional legal limitations referred to \n     by the government of the Netherlands, the government of Japan \n     does not consider that the government of the Netherlands by \n     signing the treaty has itself expropriated the private claims \n     of its nationals so that, as a consequence thereof, after the \n     treaty comes into force these claims would be nonexistent.\n\n  Taken out of international State Department legalese, what that \nbasically says is the Government of Japan has said to the Government of \nNetherlands that just signing this treaty does not mean you take away \nfrom your citizens their right of private claims against the Government \nof Japan or the nationals of the nation of Japan.\n  This is the document we did not know about until April of 2000. So we \nknow that article 26 of the treaty of 1951 now comes into full force \nand play, and because Japan made a war claims settlement with the \nNetherlands that gives them greater advantages than those provided in \nthe present treaty, those same advantages should be extended to all of \nthe parties of the present treaty. Therefore, we believe very strongly \nthat our private citizens, our POWs who worked as slave laborers, have \nevery right to pursue their claims in whatever courts they can find to \ntake up those claims.\n  Unfortunately, the Departments of State and Justice are not on the \nside of our POWs. They convinced a Federal judge to dismiss these \nlawsuits. This is fundamentally unfair. This amendment would correct \nthis injustice. I do not know whether or not in a court of law these \nPOWs will be able to prevail. I don't know all of the legal \nimplications. I do know they should have their day in court to argue \ntheir claims against these private companies. It is not as if \nMitsubishi, Matsui, and Nippon are bankrupt. These are multinational \ncorporations. They are big.\n\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire said, our POWs are getting older \nand not that many remain. It seems to me this is the fair and right \nthing to do, to make final these reparations, and without interference \nfrom the executive branch of the Government.\n  I am constrained to say I hope no one interprets this amendment or \nour support for this amendment as somehow trying to bring up again \nWorld War II or bringing up in a way that would be detrimental to the \npresent Government of Japan the actions taken during World War II. That \nis not our intention at all. We all recognize the Government of Japan \nis one of the great, strong democracies of our present world. They have \na system of free government and free enterprise in Japan that is the \nenvy of many places in the world.\n  For a year and a half I was privileged to serve my country as a Navy \npilot stationed at Atsugi airbase in Japan in the mid to late 1960's. I \nspent a year and a half living on the Japanese economy. I worked every \nday with men and women who worked for the Nippon Aircraft Corporation. \nI was one of their test pilots. I worked with them every day. During my \nyear and a half there, I can honestly say I became an admirer of the \nJapanese people and an admirer of many of the things they have done \nafter World War II. I don't for one minute admire anything they did \nduring World War II, what the warlords did, what they did to lead that \nnation into World War II. The atrocities they committed during World \nWar II are a definite blot on their history.\n  Today, the Japanese Government stands as a beacon of democracy and \nrepresentative government. The Japanese people, I think, have expunged \nthemselves of this terrible legacy of World War II. I am saying this \nbecause I don't want anyone to interpret that we are using this \namendment or offering this amendment as if making a detrimental \nstatement about the present Government of Japan. That is not so.\n  We are saying we believe in the rule of law, just as the Japanese \nGovernment, since World War II, believes in the rule of law. This rule \nof law we adhere to, that we believe in so strongly, says that people \nwho are wronged, people who believe they have a claim against another \nperson or a government, ought to have their day in court. That is all \nwe are saying. Let them make their case. If the Japanese companies want \nto defend themselves and say they have already paid reparations, they \nhave already paid in full for all of this, let them come to court and \nshow us. That is all we are saying.\n  The administration argues this amendment violates our Constitution \nregarding the separation of powers. This type of restriction we are now \nplacing on appropriations by the participation of the Attorney General \nin private litigation has been enacted in Congress before and has been \naccepted and complied with by the executive branch. There was an \nexample offered by Warren Rudman, another Senator from New Hampshire, \npassed in 1983 that barred the Justice Department from intervening in \ncertain types of private antitrust lawsuits. We have done that many, \nmany times in the past. I don't think the argument that somehow this \nviolates our separation of powers holds any water.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his leadership on this \nissue, for sticking up for our POWs and for offering this amendment. I \nhope it is passed overwhelmingly so we can coordinate with the House, \nwhich passed it overwhelmingly, and permit these lawsuits to move ahead \nand give POWs their long overdue day in court. They may have been left \nbehind in 1942 by General MacArthur; let's not leave them behind one \nmore time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, two of my most distinguished colleagues, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, have offered this amendment to the measure before the \nSenate. I will share my thoughts on this amendment and the reasons why \nI oppose it.\n  While listening to my colleagues' speak, I was reminded that a few \ndays ago I was called upon by one of my dear friends in the Senate, \nadvising me that I should not be involved in this matter; that it would \nbe, without question, an amendment of high emotions, and that it would \nrevive memories of a distant past, black memories.\n  Like some of my colleagues, I am old enough to recall those dark days \nin our history. Like some Members, I was involved in that ancient war, \nWorld War II. Sometimes I have my personal nightmares.\n  There is no question that none of us here would ever condone any of \nthe actions taken by the Japanese in the Bataan death march. Being of \nJapanese ancestry becomes a rather personal matter. Who knows, one of \nmy cousins could have been the one with the bayonet and rifle. I have \nno way of knowing. But those men who mistreated our men were of the \nsame ancestry.\n  Therefore, I stand before the Senate not with any great pleasure but \nbecause I feel it must be done. Two days ago, officials of our Nation \nand the high officials of Japan gathered in the city of San Francisco \nto commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of San \nFrancisco which ended the hostilities of Japan in World War II. This \ntreaty was a farsighted document designed very deliberately to \neliminate the possibility of further Japanese aggression by paving the \nway for an enduring peace between our two countries.\n  Central to this goal was the recognition by the United States that it \nhad a responsibility to rebuild war-torn Japan so that it could regain \nits economic self-sufficiency. The economic abandonment of Germany \nafter World War I by the victorious nations of Europe and its horrific \nconsequences were\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nenough to convince the President and the Congress of the United States \nto avoid inviting a repetition in the Pacific. Accordingly, the \nprovisions of the San Francisco treaty were specifically aimed at \nprotecting the recovering economy of Japan, and among the most \nimportant of these was article 14(b) of that treaty. I think we should \nread this article 14(b) once again:\n\n       [E]xcept as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the \n     Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of the Allied \n     Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals \n     arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals \n     in the course of the prosecution of the war[.]\n\n  It was clear that this language was intended to waive, unless \notherwise provided in the treaty, all claims of the United States and \nallied nationals against Japan and Japanese nationals arising from \nWorld War II.\n  No one can deny the pain and the atrocities suffered by American \ncitizens who were prisoners of war in Japan, and by agreeing to article \n14(b), our Nation did not intend to turn its back on its own citizens.\n  I have had the privilege and the great honor of serving in the \nCongress now for nearly 42 years and during that time I believe my \nrecord is very clear when it comes to the support of the men and women \nin uniform. At this moment, I find myself in some disagreement with the \ngreat leaders of this Senate as to how the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee's bill should be handled. I have always maintained that we \ncannot do enough for men and women in uniform. Less than one-half of 1 \npercent of this Nation has stepped forward to indicate to the rest of \nus that they are willing to stand in harm's way and, if necessary, at \nthe risk of their lives. How can anyone say this is not something \nworthy of our support? So my support for the men in uniform, I hope, \nwill not be questioned by any one of my colleagues.\n  When we signed the treaty and when we passed the War Claims Act of \n1948 soon thereafter, our Nation assumed the responsibility of making \nreparations to our people using the proceeds of Japanese assets ceded \nby Japan under the treaty. We thought it was important enough at that \nmoment in our history to take over that responsibility.\n  I do not stand before you to present any rationale or apology for \nJapanese war crimes because history has shown that during the war, as \nin many great wars, officers and men of competing armies oftentimes \nresort to treatment of prisoners so cruel and inhumane as to seem \nbarbaric. There are no good people in a war.\n  Those of us on the committee, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, have one thing in mind--to prevent wars--because many of \nus have seen what war can do. There is no question that American \nprisoners in the hands of the Japanese suffered much. I think the \nevidence is rather clear, as pointed out by the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Iowa. However, when the officials of our \nnations met with representatives of the defeated nation, Japan, these \natrocities were recognized and taken into account in the consideration \nand ratification of the treaty of San Francisco.\n  Moreover, the Government of Japan has acknowledged the damage and \nsuffering it caused during World War II. Last Saturday, September 8, \nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tanaka, reaffirmed Japan's \nfeelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apologies that had been \npreviously expressed in 1995 by then-Prime Minister Murayama.\n\n  Unfortunately, the amendment presented by my two distinguished \ncolleagues attacks a central provision of the treaty by making it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for the Departments of Justice and State \nto intervene in reparations suits and assert article 14(b) of the \ntreaty.\n  I think we should remind ourselves that article II of the \nConstitution of the United States makes it very clear that it is the \nPresident of the United States who has the responsibility of \nnegotiating treaties and making certain that the provisions of the \ntreaties are carried out. It is not the right of any State or any \nindividual, nor is it the right of this Congress.\n  Thus, if this amendment is approved by both Houses of Congress and \nsigned into law by the President, it would announce our intention to \nabrogate a central term of the treaty of San Francisco. This action \nwill abrogate that treaty. Some have suggested it might be a slap in \nthe face of the Japanese. Yes, it might be, but, more importantly, it \nwill abrogate a treaty.\n  We who have stood on this floor time and again condemning other \nnations for slight deviation of their treaties are now coming forth \ndeliberately to say that we are prepared to abrogate this treaty. This \nwould be contrary to U.S. foreign policy because it would signal to the \nworld that the United States cares little for its treaty obligations. \nIt would be also contrary to U.S. national security policy because the \nSan Francisco treaty is the cornerstone of U.S. security arrangements \nin the Asia-Pacific region.\n  In addition to the foreign and security policy considerations, this \namendment might also encourage other nations to facilitate lawsuits \nagainst the United States, and against U.S. companies and the U.S. \nGovernment and its officials for actions by U.S. military and those who \nsupport such actions.\n  This is not farfetched. It could expose our Nation and our Nation's \ncitizens to millions, if not billions, of dollars in claims. The \nadministration of President Bush, in its policy statement issued \nthrough the Department of State, concurs with this analysis and \nstrongly opposes the amendment.\n  Indeed, the administration additionally objected to the amendment \nbecause it would impair the executive branch's ability to carry out its \ncore constitutional responsibility relating to treaties, article II of \nthe Constitution. Accordingly, reopening this issue as the amendment \nnow proposes would have very serious negative consequences for United \nStates-Japan relations, and, sadly, would sow doubt about America's \nword among other allies.\n  Therefore, I oppose the amendment and I hope all of my colleagues \nwill carefully consider the points that I have raised.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond to my great friend--he \nis my great friend--and colleague from Hawaii. There is no one with \nwhom I have greater respect and admiration in the Senate for all the \nyears I have been here than the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. \nCertainly, I commend him for his statement and the courage he has shown \nto take his position on this matter. No one should in any way \nmisinterpret the action taken by Senator Inouye in opposing this \namendment. I know he comes at it with conscience and with his own \nfeeling of what is right.\n  I may not agree with his position on it, and let no one think that in \nany way Senator Inouye now or at any time has let down our country, or \nour veterans, or our military establishment. By his own life and by his \nown example, Senator Inouye has shown what it means to be a patriot and \nto put himself in harm's way and possibly give one's life for his \ncountry. He did that during World War II.\n  No one could have been more proud than all of us here when President \nClinton finally recognized his efforts, his dedication, and his \nsacrifice during war in finally granting Senator Inouye the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. It was a recognition that was long \noverdue.\n  I hope that no one misinterprets what the Senator said in his opening \nstatement about taking his position. I certainly don't, and no one else \nshould.\n  As I said, we have a disagreement. And, quite frankly, I am hard \npressed to think of the last time I disagreed with the Senator from \nHawaii because I have high regard for him in matters pertaining to our \nmilitary, to our veterans, and the defense of our country. But I just \nhappen to have a disagreement on this one issue.\n  Again, I point out that all we are trying to do is give the day in \ncourt for our rule of law. I believe we can do so without in any way \nabrogating a treaty or harming our relations with Japan. As I said \nearlier, I have the highest esteem for Japan and the people of Japan. I \nwould want nothing in any way to be misinterpreted that we are in any \nway trying to bring up the dark days of World War II again. But I \nbelieve just as strongly that our rule of law commands us not to do \notherwise.\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\n We must permit them to have their day in court. It is their right.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering the \namendment.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Inouye for his years of \ndedication to our country, for his leadership during World War II, and \nfor his 42 years of leadership in the Senate. I am sorry I have to \ndisagree with him on this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to associate myself \nwith every single word the Senator from Iowa just said regarding our \ncolleague, Senator Inouye. I want to state for the record that Senator \nInouye has earned the right to say anything he wishes on the floor of \nthe Senate with his distinguished service to our country. I think we \nhave a difference of opinion on what the treaty said or didn't say. \nThat is it as far as I am concerned, to make the record clear.\n  I want to respond to the point on the abrogation of treaties because \nI think it is important we understand that, in my view--and I think in \nthe view of many--it doesn't abrogate the treaty at all. It limits the \nState and the Justice departments from interfering. That is all. The \ncourts will decide the true intent of the treaty. That is what courts \nare supposed to do. But they should be able to do so without what I \nwould consider unnecessary meddling.\n  Article 26 of the treaty makes it very clear that the Japanese \nentered into a more advantageous agreement than those terms apply to \nall the signatories of the treaty.\n  We are not abrogating the treaty. We are fulfilling the treaty.\n  I think it is very important to understand those points that were \nmade in the exchange between the Japanese Government and the Dutch \nGovernment and article 26 in the sense that the person who offered \nthose documents, John Foster Dulles, made it very clear that we don't \nwant to deny individuals under a constitutional government the right to \nhave their constitutional rights fulfilled.\n  I would respond quickly to three or four points that were made by the \nopponents and then yield the floor.\n  We just talked about those who say it undermines the treaty \nobligations. It merely prevents the State and the Justice departments \nfrom distorting the true facts. I am not saying the State and Justice \ndepartments in any way directly are responsible for holding back \ndocuments. The truth is our own Government for 50 years never released \nthese documents. Had these documents been available 50 years ago, I \nthink this matter would have been resolved.\n  For all these years our veterans never had the opportunity to have \nthis information and take it to court.\n  The judicial branch is perfectly capable and within its rights to \ninterpret treaties without any assistance from or deference to the \nviews of the executive branch or frankly, the legislative branch. This \nis law. That is how things are settled.\n  In any event, the amendment does not prevent the executive branch \nfrom executing the treaty. I want to make that very clear. It does not \nprevent the executive branch from executing the treaty. It merely \nprevents the executive branch from advocating a certain interpretation \nin court.\n  All we are doing with my amendment and that of Senator Harkin and \nothers who cosponsored it is to say we are not going to provide \ntaxpayer dollars to allow that argument to be fought. Let it go to \ncourt. That is all. I think it is very important that we understand \nthat.\n  Some say the amendment impairs the ability of the courts to interpret \ntreaties. The courts are perfectly capable of interpreting treaties \nwithout the assistance of the executive branch. They are not bound by \nexecutive interpretation. In fact, the Supreme Court noted in one of \nits opinions that the courts interpret treaties for themselves. The \ncourts remain the final arbiter of a treaty's meaning and have the \nright to interpret a treaty.\n  The courts observed that the views of the executive branch regarding \na treaty are entitled to no deference of any type when they appear to \nhave been adopted either solely for political reasons or in the context \nof any particular litigation. I believe we are dealing with the latter \nin this case.\n  Let me also get to the point of damaging relations with Japan. No one \nwants to do that. I want to make it very clear that I believe Japan is \na valuable ally in the Far East and that they are very important to us, \nespecially as we look at the emergence of China and the threat of the \nChinese. This is not about the Japanese Government. It is not about \nreplaying the war. It is about interpreting a treaty the way it was \nintended and allowing people to have their day in court without losing \ntheir constitutional rights. That is for all of us.\n  It should not change our relationship with Japan. I do not know of \nanybody who wants to do that. We are strong allies. We are close \nfriends. We are going to continue to be close friends after this. This \nshould not, in any way, be construed as an unfriendly act. Secretary \nPowell, I think, recently called Japan our Pacific anchor. I think he \nis right. But it does send a serious message that as long as these \nveterans are with us, this is going to be an area of contention.\n  Frankly, I think it is better for Japanese-American relations to get \nit behind us. Let's move on. And the best way to do it is to allow \nthese men to come to court without the interference of the Justice and \nState Departments; let them come to court, have their day in court, and \nget a decision. That was the right thing to do when the State \nDepartment did that in relation to the activities in the German case, \nand I think it is the right thing to do in this case.\n  Last year, again, as I said earlier in my statement, this body passed \nS. Con. Res. 158, offered by Senator Hatch, which urged the Secretary \nof State to facilitate discussions between the veterans and the \nJapanese. Unfortunately, though, the State Department chose to ignore \nthat. All we are trying to do is to move forward and not have it hang \nout there any longer.\n  Again, this is an issue between private Japanese companies and \nprivate United States citizens who have been wronged by those \ncompanies. It is also important to remind people that we do have a \nConstitution and every single one of us has constitutional rights.\n  Under the fifth amendment: ``No person shall . . . be deprived of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall \nprivate property be taken for public use, without just compensation.''\n  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal Government can take or \nespouse private claims of United States citizens against foreign \ngovernments and their agents, but this case involves private claims \nagainst private corporations that are not agents of the Japanese \nGovernment. There are no constitutional or legal precedents for the \nFederal Government to take or espouse the private claims of its \ncitizens against private foreign entities.\n  In fact, if you read article 14(b), which we have done a couple \ntimes, to mean ``private versus private claims,'' this raises very \nserious fifth amendment concerns. The Federal Government does not have \nthe right to espouse private versus private claims. There is an \nimportant difference between the private versus Government claims, \nwhich the Federal Government can espouse, and the private versus \nprivate claims, which the Federal Government cannot espouse. That is a \nbig difference.\n  Just like the United States Government, the Dutch were faced with the \nsame problem. The Dutch had a constitutional issue, which is why they \nraised the issue at the time, which is why article 26 was written. John \nFoster Dulles certainly had a hand in writing both of those letters and \nthe exchange of letters between the Japanese and the Dutch. He \nunderstood both sides of it. And he understood it completely. That is \nwhy the letters were written and why the Dutch raised the question. And \nthat is why they made certain that if another country raised similar \nobjections, such as the United States, they would have the opportunity \nto have their citizens have their day in court.\n  So I hope that as we get to whatever point the leadership decides to \ncall a vote on this, we understand that this is not about bringing up \nsome old war stories or replaying the war or anything at all. It is \nsimply about the right of an American citizen, who happened to be a \nPOW, to get his or her\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\nday in court against a private company in another country and not be \ninterfered with by our own Government.\n\n  All our amendment does is say that no funds under this act shall be \nused by our country or our Government to interfere with that claim. \nThat is it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Point of inquiry: Will this matter be voted upon at 5:30?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think so. We are ready to make that request, but I \nwant to say a word in debate.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n3:15 p.m. be for debate with respect to the Smith amendment No. 1538; \nthat at 3:15 p.m. the amendment be set aside to recur at 5 p.m. today, \nwith all time equally divided and controlled between Senators Smith of \nNew Hampshire and Hollings or their designees; that a vote in relation \nto the amendment occur at 5:30 p.m. today, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; \nfurther, that at 3 p.m. Senator Dorgan be recognized to offer an \namendment relating to TV Marti.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You mean 3:15.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, 3:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the Senator from \nIdaho, who is not in the Chamber, for allowing us to move forward on \nthis even though his amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, who keeps the trains running--and on time --and, incidentally, \nis fully informed on what is on that train. That is really the point to \nbe made with Senator Harry Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is no question when the chorus is \nformed to praise our distinguished senior colleague from Hawaii, I am \ngoing to be in that chorus. There is no one I admire more.\n  I remember the debate with respect to the reparations, and I was \nmoved by our other wonderful Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Matsunaga. But \nmind you me, that was a very different situation.\n  Here is an individual of Japanese descent, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, \nwho fought for over a year to try and gain acceptance as a soldier in \nthe cause of the United States in World War II. And having done that--\nbecause I was in that particular theater--to go forward in Italy with \nthe Nisei fighters, even after the armistice peace had been signed with \nItaly, with his arm gone and 22 slugs in his body.\n  He only got the Distinguished Service Cross. It hit my conscience \nthat here was an individual, just because he was alone, and not \nrecognized at that time, who only received the Distinguished Service \nCross. And that was repaired last year when he, and others of those \nbrave Nisei fighters, received the Medal of Honor. So the record has \nbeen made.\n  But this isn't on account of Senator Inouye's courage. I really am \ngrateful, managing this bill myself, that he has taken this position \nthat does take courage in one sense of the word. But under the \nConstitution, which the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire points \nout, there is no other course than to kill this particular amendment.\n  Let me speak again of my high regard for the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Iowa in their feeling for the veterans, \nparticularly those who suffered under that death march from Bataan, \nbecause I was dragged into this thing myself in May of 1942, when \nothers just ahead of me got caught up not only in the Bataan march but \nserved as prisoners of war under such treatment that has been described \nby the distinguished Senators from New Hampshire and Iowa.\n  I think of Jack Leonard. I think of other classmates who suffered in \nthat period of the war. So I share the feeling of the Senator from New \nHampshire. You cannot be more devastated and defaced and tortured than \nthese Japanese prisoners of war. They deserve every bit of \nconsideration they can get under the Constitution. But if we are going \nto be a body of laws, there isn't any question about whose side--I was \ntaken by the Senator from New Hampshire who said you are either on the \nside of the private Japanese corporations or you are on the side of the \nveterans. Not at all. You are either on the side of the Constitution or \nyou are not. And our Constitution says: The treaty made duly ratified \nis the law of the land. That terminated any particular claims or their \nday in court.\n\n  To understand, read this amendment, not agreeing, if you please, with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, not agreeing, if you please, with the \nSenator from South Carolina, but it says:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Department of Justice or the Department of State to file \n     a motion in any court opposing a civil action against any \n     Japanese person or corporation for compensation or \n     reparations in which the plaintiff alleges that, as an \n     American prisoner of war during World War II, he or she was \n     used as a slave or forced labor.\n\n  It says that the Department of Justice and the Department of State \ncannot function as a Department of Justice and a Department of State. \nCertainly, they don't want to do that. If it is to be that they have a \nright or day in court--and certainly nothing we vote on this afternoon \nwill take away that right or day in court--it has been had, this time \nlast year in the California court. The judge found it and studied it \nand objectively looked at it in every particular regard and found \notherwise. Nothing that we vote on today one way or the other is going \nto take away their right in court.\n  But there is a right and a duty and a responsibility of the \nDepartment of State and the Department of Justice to defend the \nposition of the United States. And we think that the position of the \nUnited States is under article 14 of that particular treaty with Japan, \nratified in 1952 by an overwhelming vote that was entered into by \nPresident Truman, ratified by a 66-10 bipartisan vote in the U.S. \nSenate. If I raise my hand as a Senator, I hereby pledge to preserve, \nprotect, and defend. So it is not the side of the corporation or the \nside of the veteran. It is the position under the Constitution. You \nhave to defend the laws of the land.\n  Certainly, I am not totally familiar with this particular issue, \ncertainly not as much so perhaps as the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire. But there have been others who have studied it very \nthoroughly.\n  I have a letter from a distinguished former Secretary of State. This \nis in June. He writes to the House chairman of Foreign Relations, I \ntake it, at that particular time. I want to read from this letter from \nGeorge P. Shultz:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you to express my deep \n     reservations about H.R. 1198, the Justice for the U.S. \n     Prisoners of War Act of 2001.\n\n  This was passed overwhelmingly, incidentally, in the House of \nRepresentatives. We have too many pollsters in Government. My pollster, \nmy political consultant said: Why don't you keep your mouth shut. Let \nDanny Inouye defend it and you don't have to say anything. And then in \nthe next election, you won't have to explain how the veterans now are \nall against you.\n  Life is too short for that kind of nonsense. You have to take \npositions here. Let me go ahead with Secretary Shultz's letter:\n\n       I express my opposition to the bill against the background \n     of tremendous sympathy for the problems of the United States' \n     citizens who have in one way or another been harmed, many \n     severely, in the course of war and its sometimes dehumanizing \n     impact.\n       But the bill in question would have the effect of voiding \n     the bargain we made and explicitly set out in the Treaty of \n     Peace between Japan, the United States, and forty-seven other \n     countries. President Truman with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate ratified the treaty and it became effective April \n     28, 1952.\n       The Treaty has served us well in providing the fundamental \n     underpinning for the peace and prosperity we have seen, for \n     the most part, in the Asia Pacific region over the past half-\n     century.\n       The Treaty addresses squarely the issue of compensation for \n     damages suffered at the hands of the Japanese. Article 14 in \n     the treaty sets out the terms of Japanese payment ``for the \n     damage and suffering caused by it during the war.'' The \n     agreement provides:\n       1. a grant of authority to Allied Powers to seize Japanese \n     property within their jurisdiction at the time of the \n     treaty's effective date;\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\n       2. an obligation of Japan to assist in the rebuilding of \n     territory occupied by Japanese forces during the war; and\n       3. waiver of all ``other claims of the Allied Powers and \n     their nationals arising out of any action taken by Japan and \n     its nationals of the war.''\n\n  Let me divert from the reading of this letter. One says ``to seize \nthe property.'' That was done. Japanese property was seized. You \nconstantly hear in the presentation that this is against private \ncorporations. The treaty was against private corporations and their \nproperty and was distributed to the prisoners of war. It wasn't done \nenough; you and I both agree on that in a flash. I sympathize with the \nmotivation of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, but we did \nseize the property. And we did distribute it as reparations. That ended \nall claims of all nationals.\n  The waiver of all other claims of the allied powers and their \nnationals, that ended it. It didn't say whether 50 years from now we \ncan find some memo with respect to the Netherlands and whether or not \nthey had constitutional authority. There isn't any question that our \nSecretary of State, John Foster Dulles, had authority. There isn't any \nquestion that the President of the United States who signed the treaty, \nthe Congress itself, the U.S. Senate that ratified that treaty, had its \nauthority. This is by the board what was found 50 years later by the \nNetherlands. Let's find out what was found by the United States of \nAmerica, its President and its Senate as constitutionally binding under \nthe treaty.\n  Let me go back to the letter from George P. Shultz:\n\n       The interests of Allied prisoners of war are addressed in \n     Article 16, which provides for transfer of Japanese assets in \n     neutral or even me jurisdictions to the International Red \n     Cross for distribution to former prisoners and their \n     families.\n       H.R. 1198 challenges these undertakings head on, as it \n     says, ``In any action in a Federal court . . . the court . . \n     . shall not construe section 14(b) of the Treaty of Peace \n     with Japan as constituting a waiver by the United States of \n     claims by nationals of the United States, including claims by \n     members of the United States armed forces, so as to preclude \n     the pending action.''\n\n  I read further:\n\n       I have read carefully an opinion of Judge Vaughn R. Walker \n     of the U.S. District Court in California rendered on July 21, \n     2000 . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the opinion be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      H.R. 1198--THE JUSTICE FOR U.S. PRISONERS OF WAR ACT OF 2001\n\n\n   In Re World War II Era Japanese Forced Labor, September 21, 2000, \n     Decision by Judge Vaughn R.

Mitsui & Co., Ltd., CD Cal No 00-2057\n\n       On December 23, 1941, after mounting a brave resistance \n     against an overwhelming foe, the small American garrison on \n     Wake Island in the South Pacific surrendered to Imperial \n     Japanese forces. James King, a former United States Marine, \n     was among the troops and civilians taken prisoner by the \n     invaders. He was ultimately shipped to Kyushu, Japan, where \n     he spent the remainder of the war toiling by day as a slave \n     laborer in a steel factory and enduring maltreatment in a \n     prison camp by night. When captured, King was 20 years old, 5 \n     feet 11 inches tall and weighed 167 pounds. At the conclusion \n     of the war, he weighed 98 pounds.\n       James King is one of the plaintiffs in these actions \n     against Japanese corporations for forced labor in World War \n     II; his experience, and the undisputed injustice he suffered, \n     are representative. King and the other plaintiffs seek \n     judicial redress for this injustice.\n\n                                   I\n\n       These actions are before the court for consolidated \n     pretrial proceedings pursuant to June 5, 2000, and June 15, \n     2000, orders of transfer by the Judicial Panel on \n     Multidistrict Litigation. On August 17, 2000, the court heard \n     oral argument on plaintiffs' motions for remand to state \n     court and defendants' motions to dismiss or for judgment on \n     the pleadings.\n       This order addresses, first, all pending motions for \n     remand. For the reasons stated below, the court concludes \n     that notwithstanding plaintiffs' attempts to plead only state \n     law claims, removal jurisdiction exists because these actions \n     raise substantial questions of federal law by implicating the \n     federal common law of foreign relations.\n       Second, the court addresses the preclusive effect of the \n     1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan on a subset of the actions \n     before the court, namely, those brought by plaintiffs who \n     were United States or allied soldiers in World War II \n     captured by Japanese forces and held as prisoners of war. \n     The court concludes that the 1951 treaty constitutes a \n     waiver of such claims.\n       This order does not address the pending motions to dismiss \n     in cases brought by plaintiffs who were not members of the \n     armed forces of the United States or its allies. Since these \n     plaintiffs are not citizens of countries that are signatories \n     of the 1951 treaty, their claims raise a host of issues not \n     presented by the Allied POW cases and, therefore, require \n     further consideration in further proceedings.\n\n                                   II\n\n       Defendants may remove to federal court ``any civil action \n     brought in a State court of which the district courts of the \n     United States have original jurisdiction.'' 28 USC \n     Sec. 1441(a). ``The propriety of removal thus depends on \n     whether the case originally could have been filed in federal \n     court.'' Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 US \n     156, 163 (1997).\n       Federal courts have original jurisdiction over cases \n     ``arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the \n     United States.'' 28 USC Sec. 1331. For purposes of removal, \n     federal question jurisdiction exists ``only when a federal \n     question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly \n     complaint.'' Caterpillar Inc v. Williams, 482 US 386, 392 \n     (1987). Since a defense is not part of a plaintiff's properly \n     pleaded statement of his claim, a case may not be removed to \n     federal court on the basis of a federal defense. Rivet v. \n     Regions Bank of La, 522 US 470, 475 (1998).\n       Defendants' assertion of the Treaty of Peace with Japan as \n     a defense to plaintiffs' state law causes of action does not, \n     therefore, confer federal jurisdiction. Recognizing this, \n     defendants rely on a line of cases committing to federal \n     common law questions implicating the foreign relations of the \n     United States.\n       In Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 US 398, 425 \n     (1964), a case in which federal jurisdiction was based on \n     diversity of citizenship, the Supreme Court held that \n     development and application of the act of state doctrine was \n     a matter of federal common law, notwithstanding the general \n     rule of Erie R Co v. Thompkins, 304 US 64, 78 (1938), that \n     federal courts apply state substantive law in diversity \n     cases. The court reasoned that because the doctrine concerned \n     matters of comity between nations, ``the problems involved \n     are uniquely federal in nature.'' Id at 424. Although the \n     applicable state law mirrored federal decisions, the Court \n     was ``constrained to make it clear that an issue [involving] \n     our relationships with other members of the international \n     community must be treated exclusively as an aspect of federal \n     law.'' Id at 425.\n       Under Banco Nacional, federal common law governs matters \n     concerning the foreign relations of the United States. See \n     Texas Indus, Inc v. Radcliffe Materials, Inc,  451 US 630, \n     641 (1981). ``In these instances, our federal system does not \n     permit the controversy to be resolved under state law, either \n     because the authority and duties of the United States as \n     sovereign are intimately involved or because the * * * \n     international nature of the controversy makes it \n     inappropriate for state law to control.'' Id.\n       If an examination of the complaint shows that the \n     plaintiff's claims necessarily require determinations that \n     will directly and significantly affect United States foreign \n     relations, a plaintiff's state law claims should be removed. \n     Republic of Phillipines v. Marcos, 806 F2d 344, 352 (2d Cir \n     1986). This doctrine has been extended to disputes between \n     private parties that implicate the ``vital economic and \n     sovereign interests'' of the nation where the parties' \n     dispute arose. Torres v. Southern Peru Copper Corp, 113 F3d \n     540, 543 n8 (5th Cir 1997).\n       The court concludes that the complaints in the instant \n     cases, on their face, implicate the federal common law of \n     foreign relations and, as such, give rise to federal \n     jurisdiction. Plaintiffs' claims arise out of world war and \n     are enmeshed with the momentous policy choices that arose in \n     the war's aftermath. The cases implicate the uniquely federal \n     interests of the United States to make peace and enter \n     treaties with foreign nations. As the United States has \n     argued as amicus curiae, these cases carry potential to \n     unsettle half a century of diplomacy.\n       After a thorough analysis, Judge Baird in the Central \n     District of California denied remand in one of the cases now \n     before the undersigned pursuant to the multidistrict \n     litigation transfer order. Poole v. Nippon Steel Corp, No. \n     00-0189 (CD Cal March 17, 2000). The court agrees with the \n     analysis and the conclusion in that case. (In another related \n     case in which remand was granted, Jeong v Onoda\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n     Cement Co, Ltd, 2000 US Dist LEXIS 7985 (CD Cal May 18, \n     2000), the court did not consider the federal common law of \n     foreign relations as a basis for federal jurisdiction.) Judge \n     Baird held: ``[T]his case, on its face, presents substantial \n     issues of federal common law dealing with foreign policy and \n     relations. * * * As such, plaintiffs may not evade this \n     Court's jurisdiction by cloaking their complaints in terms of \n     state law.'' The motions for remand are DENIED.\n\n                                  III\n\n       In addressing the motions to dismiss, the court refers \n     again to a complaint that is representative of the actions by \n     United States and Allied POWs, King v. Nippon Steel Corp., No \n     99-5042.\n       As noted at the outset of this order, plaintiff King seeks \n     redress for wrongs inflicted by his captors half a century \n     ago. In count one of the complaint, he asserts a claim under \n     California Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 354.6, a new law that \n     permits an action by a ``prisoner-of-war of the Nazi regime, \n     its allies or sympathizers'' to ``recover compensation for \n     labor performed as a Second World War slave labor victim * * \n     * from any entity or successor in interest thereof, for whom \n     that labor was performed * * *.'' Cal Code Civ Pro \n     Sec. 354.6. Count two is an unjust enrichment claim in which \n     plaintiff seeks disgorgement and restitution of economic \n     benefits derived from his labor. In count three, plaintiff \n     seeks damages in tort for battery, intentional infliction of \n     emotional distress and unlawful imprisonment. Count four \n     alleges that defendant's failure to reveal its prior \n     exploitation of prisoner labor to present-day customers in \n     California and elsewhere constitutes an unfair business \n     practice under California Business and Professions Code \n     Sec. 17204.\n       Defendants move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n     12(c) for a judgment on the pleadings, arguing: (1) \n     plaintiff's claims are barred by the Treaty of Peace with \n     Japan; (2) plaintiff's claims raise nonjusticiable political \n     questions; (3) the peace treaty, the War Claims Act of 1948 \n     and the federal government's plenary authority over foreign \n     affairs combine to preempt plaintiff's claims and (4) because \n     the complaint alleges injuries caused by the Japanese \n     government, plaintiff's claims are barred by the act of state \n     doctrine and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n       These arguments, and King's countervailing positions, arise \n     in all of the cases before the court brought on behalf of \n     Allied POWs against Japanese corporations. The court need not \n     address all of them. For the reasons stated below, the court \n     concludes that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Treaty of \n     Peace with Japan.\n\n                                   A\n\n       A motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal \n     Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is the proper means to \n     challenge the sufficiency of the complaint after an answer \n     has been filed. Depending on the procedural posture of the \n     individual case, some defendants have filed motions pursuant \n     to FRCP 12(c) and others have filed motions to dismiss \n     pursuant to FRCP 12(b). The distinction in the present \n     context is not important. In the Ninth Circuit, the standard \n     by which the district court must determine Rule 12(c) motions \n     is the same as the standard for the more familiar motion to \n     dismiss under rule 12(b)(6): ``A district court will render a \n     judgment on the pleadings when the moving party clearly \n     establishes on the face of the pleadings [and by evidence of \n     which the court takes judicial notice] that no material issue \n     of fact remains to be resolved and that it is entitled to \n     judgment as a matter of law.'' Enron Oil Trading & Transp Co \n     v. Walbrook Ins Co, 132 F3d 526, 529 (9th Cir 1997) \n     (citations omitted).\n\n                                   B\n\n       The Treaty of Peace with Japan was signed at San Francisco \n     on September 8, 1951, by the representatives of the United \n     States and 47 other Allied powers and Japan. Treaty of Peace \n     with Japan, [1952] 3 UST 3169, TIAS No 2490 (1951). President \n     Truman, with the advice and consent of the Senate, ratified \n     the treaty and it became effective April 28, 1952. Id.\n       Article 14 provides the terms of Japanese payment ``for the \n     damage and suffering caused by it during the war.'' Id at Art \n     14(a). For present purposes, the salient features of the \n     agreement are: (1) a grant of authority of Allied powers to \n     seize Japanese property within their jurisdiction at the time \n     of the treaty's effective date; (2) an obligation of Japan to \n     assist in the rebuilding of territory occupied by Japanese \n     forces during the war and (3) waiver of all ``other claims of \n     the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of any \n     actions taken by Japan and its nationals in the course of the \n     prosecution of the * * *.'' Id at Art 14(a)-(b) (emphasis \n     added).\n       It is the waiver provision that defendants argue bars \n     plaintiffs' present claims. In its entirety, the provision \n     reads: ``(b) Except as otherwise provided in the present \n     Treaty, the Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of \n     the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and \n     their nationals arising out of any actions taken by Japan \n     and its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the \n     war, and claims if the Allied Powers for direct military \n     costs of occupation.'' Id at Art 14(b).\n       On its face, the treaty waives ``all'' reparations and \n     ``other claims'' of the ``nationals'' of Allied powers \n     ``arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals \n     during the course of the prosecution of the war.'' The \n     language of this waiver is strikingly broad, and contains no \n     conditional language or limitations, save for the opening \n     clause referring to the provisions of the treaty. The \n     interests of Allied prisoners of war are addressed in Article \n     16, which provides for transfer of Japanese assets in neutral \n     or enemy jurisdictions to the International Committee of the \n     Red Cross for distribution to former prisoners and their \n     families. Id at Art 16. The treaty specifically exempts from \n     reparations, furthermore, those Japanese assets resulting \n     from ``the resumption of trade and financial relations \n     subsequent to September 2, 1945.'' Id at Art \n     14(a)(2)(II)(iv).\n       To avoid the preclusive effect of the treaty, plaintiffs \n     advance an interpretation of Article 14(b) that is strained \n     and, ultimately, unconvincing. Although the argument has \n     several shades, it comes down to this: the signatories of the \n     treaty did not understand the Allied waiver to apply to \n     prisoner of war claims because the provision did not \n     expressly identify such claims, in contrast to the \n     corresponding Japanese waiver provision of Article 19. \n     Article 19(b) states that the Japanese waiver includes ``any \n     claims and debts arising in respect to Japanese prisoners of \n     war and civilian internees in the hands of the Allied Powers \n     * * * .''\n       That the treaty is more specific in Article 19 does not \n     change the plain meaning of the language of Article 14. If \n     the language of Article 14 were ambiguous, plaintiffs' \n     expressio unius  argument would have more force. But \n     plaintiffs cannot identify any ambiguity in the language of \n     Article 14. to do so would be to inject hidden meaning into \n     straightforward text.\n       The treaty by its terms adopts a comprehensive and \n     exclusive settlement plan for war-related economic injuries \n     which, in its wholesale waiver of prospective claims, is not \n     unique. See, for example, Neri v. United States, 204 F2d 867 \n     (2d Cir 1953) (claim barred by broad waiver provision in \n     Treaty of Peace with Italy). The waiver provision of Article \n     14(b) is plainly broad enough to encompass the plaintiffs' \n     claims in the present litigation.\n\n                                   C\n\n       The court does not find the treaty language ambiguous, and \n     therefore its analysis need go no further. Chan v. Korea \n     Airlines, 490 US 122, 134 (1989) (if text of treaty is clear, \n     courts ``have no power to insert an amendment.''). To the \n     extent that Articles 19(b) raises any uncertainty, however, \n     the court ``may look beyond the written words to the history \n     of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical \n     construction adopted by the parties.'' Air France v. Saks, \n     470 US 392, 396 (1985). These authorities are voluminous and \n     therefore of doubtful utility due to the potential for \n     misleading selective citation. Counsel for both sides have \n     proved themselves skilled in scouring these documents for \n     support of their positions, and that both sides have \n     succeeded to a certain degree underscores the questionable \n     value of such resort to drafting history. Nevertheless, \n     the court has conducted its own review of the historical \n     materials, and concludes that they reinforce the \n     conclusion that the Treaty of Peace with Japan was \n     intended to bar claims such as those advanced by \n     plaintiffs in this litigation.\n       The official record of treaty negotiations establishes that \n     a fundamental goal of the agreement was to settle the \n     reparations issue once and for all. As the statement of the \n     chief United States negotiator, John Foster Dulles, makes \n     clear, it was well understood that leaving open the \n     possibility of future claims would be an unacceptable \n     impediment to a lasting peace:\n       ``Reparation is usually the most controversial aspect of \n     peacemaking. The present peace is no exception.\n       ``On the one hand, there are claims both vast and just. \n     Japan's aggression caused tremendous cost, losses and \n     suffering. * * *\n       ``On the other hand, to meet these claims, there stands a \n     Japan presently reduced to four home islands which are unable \n     to produce the food its people need to live, or the raw \n     materials they need to work. * * *\n       ``Under these circumstances, if the treaty validated, or \n     kept contingently alive, monetary reparations claims against \n     Japan, her ordinary commercial credit would vanish, the \n     incentive of her people would be destroyed and they would \n     sink into a misery of body and spirit that would make them \n     easy prey to exploitation. * * *\n       ``There would be bitter competition [among the Allies] for \n     the largest possible percentage of an illusory pot of gold.''\n\n     See US Dept of State, Record of Proceedings of the Conference \n     for the Conclusion and Signature of the Treaty of Peace with \n     Japan 82-83 (1951) (Def Req for Judicial Notice, Exh I).\n       The policy of the United States that Japanese liability for \n     reparations should be sharply limited was informed by the \n     experience of six years of United States-led occupation of \n     Japan. During the occupation the Supreme Commander of the \n     Allied Powers (SCAP) for the region, General Douglas \n     MacArthur, confiscated Japanese assets in conjunction with \n     the task of managing the economic affairs of the vanquished \n     nation and with a view to reparations payments. See SCAP, \n     Reparations: Development of Policy and Directives (1947). It \n     soon became clear that Japan's financial condition would \n     render any aggressive reparations plan an exercise in \n     futility. Meanwhile, the importance of a stable, democratic \n     Japan as a bulwark to communism in the region increased.\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\n     At the end of 1948, MacArthur expressed the view that ``[t]he \n     use of reparations as a weapon to retard the reconstruction \n     of a viable economy in Japan should be combated with all \n     possible means'' and ``recommended that the reparations issue \n     be settled finally and without delay.'' Memorandum from \n     General Headquarters of SCAP to Department of the Army (Dec. \n     14, 1948) at para. 8 (Def Req for Judicial Notice, Exh E).\n       That this policy was embodied in the treaty is clear not \n     only from the negotiations history but also from the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee report recommending approval of \n     the treaty by the Senate. The committee noted, for \n     example: ``Obviously insistence upon the payment of \n     reparations in any proportion commensurate with the claims \n     of the injured countries and their nationals would wreck \n     Japan's economy, dissipate any credit that it may possess \n     at present, destroy the initiative of its people, and \n     create misery and chaos in which the seeds of discontent \n     and communism would flourish. In short, [it] would be \n     contrary to the basic purposes and policy of * * * the \n     United States * * *.''\n       Japanese Peace Treaty and Other Treaties Relating to \n     Security in the Pacific, S Rep No 82-2, 82d Cong, 2d Sess 12 \n     (1952) (Def Req for Judicial Notice, Exh F). The committee \n     recognized that the treaty provisions ``do not give a direct \n     right of return to individual claimants except in the case of \n     those having property in Japan,'' id at 13, and endorsed the \n     position of the State Department that ``United States \n     nationals, whose claims are not covered by the treaty \n     provisions * * * must look for relief to the Congress of the \n     United States,'' id at 14.\n       Indeed, the treaty went into effect against the backdrop of \n     congressional response to the need for compensation for \n     former prisoners of war, in which many, if not all, of the \n     plaintiffs in the present cases participated. See War Claims \n     Act of 1948, 50 USC Sec. Sec. 2001-2017p (establishing War \n     Claims Commission and assigning top priority to claims of \n     former prisoners of war).\n       Were the text of the treaty to leave any doubt that it \n     waived claims such as those advanced by plaintiffs in these \n     cases, the history of the Allied experience in post-war \n     Japan, the drafting history of the treaty and the \n     ratification debate would resolve it in favor of a finding of \n     waiver.\n\n                                   D\n\n       As one might expect, considering the acknowledged \n     inadequacy of compensation for victims of the Japanese regime \n     provided under the treaty, the issue of additional \n     reparations has arisen repeatedly since the adoption of that \n     agreement some 50 years ago. This is all the more \n     understandable in light of the vigor with which the Japanese \n     economy has rebounded from the abyss.\n       The court finds it significant, as further support for the \n     conclusion that the treaty bars plaintiffs' claims, that the \n     United States, through State Department officials, has stood \n     firmly by the principle of finality embodied in the treaty. \n     This position was expressed in recent congressional testimony \n     by Ronald J. Bettauer, deputy legal advisor, as follows: \n     ``The 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan settles all war-related \n     claims of the U.S. and its nationals, and precludes the \n     possibility of taking legal action in United States domestic \n     courts to obtain additional compensation for war victims from \n     Japan or its nationals--including Japanese commercial \n     enterprises.''\n       POW Survivors of the Bataan Death March, Hearing before the \n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary (June 28, 2000) (statement \n     of Ronald J Bettauer, United States Department of State) (Def \n     Req for Judicial Notice, Exh P).\n       In another recent example, in response to a letter from \n     Senator Orrin Hatch expressing ``disappointment'' with the \n     ``fifty-five year old injustice imposed on our military \n     forces held as prisoners of war in Japan'' and urging the \n     Secretary of State to take action, a State Department \n     representative wrote: ``The Treaty of Peace with Japan has, \n     over the past five decades, served to sustain U.S. \n     security interests in Asia and to support peace and \n     stability in the region. We strongly believe that the U.S. \n     must honor its international agreements, including the \n     [treaty]. There is, in our view, no justification for the \n     U.S. to attempt to reopen the question of international \n     commitments and obligations under the 1951 Treaty in order \n     now to seek a more favorable settlement of the issue of \n     Japanese compensation.\n       ``This explanation obviously offers no consolation to the \n     victims of Japanese wartime aggression. Regrettably, however, \n     it was impossible when the Treaty was negotiated--and it \n     remains impossible today, 50 years later--to compensate fully \n     for the suffering visited upon the victims of the war * * \n     *.'' Letter of Jan 18, 2000, from US Dept of State to The Hon \n     Orrin Hatch at 2.\n       The conclusion that the 1951 treaty constitutes a waiver of \n     the instant claims, as stated above and argued in the brief \n     of the United States as amicus curiae in this case, carries \n     significant weight. See Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 US 187, 194 \n     (1961) (``While courts interpret treaties for themselves, the \n     meaning given them by the departments of government \n     particularly charged with their negotiation and enforcement \n     is given great weight.''); Sullivan v. Kidd, 254 US 425, 442 \n     (1921) (``[T]he construction placed upon the treaty before us \n     and consistently adhered to by the Executive Department of \n     the Government, charged with the supervision of our foreign \n     relations, should be given much weight.''). The government's \n     position also comports entirely with the court's own analysis \n     of the treaty and its history.\n       Plaintiffs raise several additional arguments that bear \n     only brief mention. First is the characterization of these \n     claims as not arising out of the ``prosecution of the war,'' \n     as that phrase is used in the treaty. Plaintiffs attempt to \n     cast their claims as involving controversies between private \n     parties.\n       It is particularly far-fetched to attempt to distinguish \n     between the conduct of Imperial Japan during the Second World \n     War and the major industry that was the engine of its war \n     machine. The lack of any sustainable distinction is apparent \n     from the complaints in these cases. For example, the King \n     complaint alleges that a class of war prisoners were forced \n     to work ``in support of the Japanese war effort,'' Compl \n     para. 56, and pursuant to a directive from the Japanese \n     government that the ``labor and technical skill' '' of \n     prisoners of war ``be fully utilized for the replenishment of \n     production, and contribution rendered toward the prosecution \n     of the Greater East Asiatic War,' '' id at para. 30. \n     Furthermore, the complaint asserts that plaintiff worked in a \n     factory ``where motor armatures were manufactured for the war \n     effort.'' Id at para. 35. These allegations quite clearly \n     bring this action within the scope of the treaty's waiver of \n     all claims ``arising out of any actions taken by Japan and \n     its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the war.'' \n     Treaty at Art 14(b).\n       Plaintiffs also argue that waiver of plaintiffs' claims \n     renders the treaty unconstitutional and invalid under \n     international law. This position is contrary to the well-\n     settled principle that the government may lawfully exercise \n     its ``sovereign authority to settle the claims of its \n     nationals against foreign countries.'' Dames & Moore v. \n     Regan, 453 US 654, 679-80 (1981); See also Neri, 204 F2d \n     at 868-69 (enforcing treaty waiver of reparations claims).\n       Finally, plaintiffs assert that subsequent settlements \n     between Japan and other treaty signatories on more favorable \n     terms than those set forth in the treaty should ``revive'' \n     plaintiff's claims under Article 26, which provides in \n     relevant part: ``Should Japan make a * * * war claims \n     settlement with any State granting that State greater \n     advantages than those provided by the present Treaty, those \n     same advantages shall be extended to the parties to the \n     present Treaty.'' Treaty at Art 26. Without deciding whether \n     the evidence plaintiff cities of other agreements implicates \n     Article 26, the court finds that that provision confers \n     rights only upon the ``parties to the present treaty,'' i.e., \n     the government signatories. The question of enforcing Article \n     26 is thus for the United States, not the plaintiffs, to \n     decide.\n\n                                   IV\n\n       The Treaty of Peace with Japan, insofar as it barred future \n     claims such as those asserted by plaintiffs in these actions, \n     exchanged full compensation of plaintiffs for a future peace. \n     History has vindicated the wisdom of that bargain. And while \n     full compensation for plaintiffs' hardships, in the purely \n     economic sense, has been denied these former prisoners \n     countless other survivors of the war, the immeasurable bounty \n     of life for themselves and their posterity in a free society \n     and in a more peaceful world services the debt.\n       The motions to dismiss and/or for judgment on the pleadings \n     are GRANTED. The clerk shall enter judgment in favor of \n     defendants in the above-captioned cases.\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n     Vaughn R. Walker,\n     United States District Judge.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Quoting, again, from the letter:\n\n       I have read carefully an opinion of Judge Vaughn R. Walker \n     of the U.S. District Court in California rendered on \n     September 21, 2000, dealing with claims, many of a heart-\n     rending nature. His reasoning and his citations are incisive \n     and persuasive to me. He writes, ``The cases implicate the \n     uniquely federal interests of the United States to make peace \n     and enter treaties with foreign nations. As the United States \n     has argued as amicus curiae, there cases carry potential to \n     unsettle half a century of diplomacy.'' Just as Judge Walker \n     ruled against claims not compatible with the Treaty, I urge \n     that Congress should take no action that would, in effect, \n     abrogate the Treaty.\n       The chief negotiator of the Treaty on behalf of President \n     Truman was the clear-eyed and tough-minded John Foster \n     Dulles, who later became Secretary of State for President \n     Eisenhower. He and other giants from the post World War II \n     period saw the folly of what happened after World War I, when \n     a vindictive peace treaty, that called upon the defeated \n     states to pay huge reparations, helped lead to World War II. \n     They chose otherwise: to do everything possible to cause \n     Germany and Japan to become democratic partners and, as the \n     Cold War with the Soviet Union emerged, allies in that \n     struggle.\n       As Judge Walker notes in his opinion, ``the importance of a \n     stable, democratic Japan as a bulwark to communism in the \n     region increased.'' He says, ``that this policy was embodied \n     in the Treaty is clear not only from the negotiations \n     history, but also from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \n     report recommending approval of the Treaty by the Senate . . \n     . and history has vindicated the wisdom of that bargain.''\n\n  This is George P. Shultz, and I quote further:\n\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\n\n       I served during World War II as a Marine in the Pacific. I \n     took part in combat operations. I had friends--friends close \n     to me--friendships derived from the closeness that comes from \n     taking part in combat together, killed practically beside me. \n     I do not exaggerate at all in saying that the people who \n     suffered the most are the ones who did not make it at all. I \n     have always supported the best of treatment for our veterans, \n     especially those who were involved in combat. If they are not \n     being adequately taken care of, we should always be ready to \n     do more.\n       If you have fought in combat, you know the horrors of war \n     and the destructive impact it can have on decent people. You \n     also know how fragile your own life is. I recall being the \n     senior Marine on a ship full of Marines on our way back from \n     the Pacific Theater after 3 years overseas. We all knew that \n     we would reassemble into assorted forces for the invasion of \n     the Japanese home islands. As Marines, we knew all about the \n     bloody invasion of Tarawa, the Palaus, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and \n     many other Islands. So we knew what the invasion of the \n     Japanese home islands would be like.\n       Not long after we left port, an atomic bomb was dropped on \n     Japan. None of us knew what that was, but we sensed it must \n     be important since the event was newsworthy enough to get to \n     our ships at sea. Then we heard of a second one. Before our \n     ship reached the States, the war was over.\n       I have visited Japan a number of times and I have been \n     exposed to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Civilians there were \n     caught up in the war. I am sympathetic toward them. I have \n     heard a lot of criticism of President Truman for dropping \n     those bombs, but everyone on that ship was convinced that \n     President Truman saved our lives. Yes, war is terrible, but \n     the treaty brought it to an end.\n\n  I can divert and express those same sentiments. I didn't get back \nuntil November. He is talking about August when those bombs were \ndropped in 1945. But there is no question that President Truman was the \nhero for dropping those bombs. But under the International Criminal \nCourt, somebody could try to file a claim 50 years later that he was a \nwar criminal. A kind of thinking that is going on today is that this is \npolitically correct. I will resume reading the letter from George P. \nShultz:\n\n       The Bill would fundamentally abrogate a central provision \n     of a 50 year old treaty, reversing a longstanding foreign \n     policy stance. The Treaty signed in San Francisco nearly 50 \n     years ago and involving 49 nations could unravel. A dangerous \n     legal precedent would be set.\n       Once again, I would say to you, where we have veterans, \n     especially veterans of combat who are not being adequately \n     supported, we must step up to their problems without \n     hesitation. But let us not unravel confidence in the \n     commitment of the United States to a Treaty properly \n     negotiated and solemnly ratified with the advice and consent \n     of the United States Senate.\n       I submit this letter to you and other members of the House \n     of Representatives with my deep respect for the wisdom of the \n     congressional process, and for the vision embodied in the \n     past World War II policies that have served our country and \n     the world so well.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 George P. Shultz.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The time \nbetween now and 3:15 was to have been equally divided between the \nSenator from South Carolina and the Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me ask--my distinguished colleague from New \nHampshire, I am sure, will say a word to extend the time. My \nunderstanding in the agreement was that it was 3:15.\n  I just say that the distinguished Senator's amendment is clear. It \nsays, look, Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Attorney General of the Justice \nDepartment, you shall not defend the U.S. position. Now, come on. If \nthere is a dispute--and there obviously is--with the Senator's \namendment with respect to the right of these veterans, then let it be \ndetermined with a comprehensive review, with all the documents and \neverything else in a court of law. This doesn't prevent the veterans \nfrom moving forward, but it certainly prevents the United States of \nAmerica, through its Department of Justice and Department of State, \nfrom defending the position of the United States under this particular \ntreaty.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire could well say, wait a \nminute, here is this information that has come to light 50 years later. \nWhether that has an effect or not is to be determined. No rights have \nbeen taken away from my veteran friend here who might stand at my side \nand say, Hollings, I want you to bring the case. Nothing prevents the \ncase from being brought. But this amendment says no one defends this \nparticular treaty. The Senate, which ratified the treaty, doesn't want \nto take the position that its ratification cannot even be commented on \nby this particular amendment because all funds are removed, no motion \ncan be made, no defense can be made. On that basis alone, I will \nsupport the Senator from Hawaii in his opposition and commend him again \nfor his courage, and I commend my friend from New Hampshire for raising \nthis particular question because it is a serious one, but it ought to \nbe discussed in a court of law and both sides heard fully, without \nsaying one particular side can't be defended at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I wish to respond briefly \nto a couple of the points my colleague from South Carolina made. The \nargument that our former POWs have already been compensated under the \nWar Claims Act and 1951 peace treaty is ridiculous, to be candid about \nit. POWs who were enslaved by private Japanese corporations received \nnext to nothing in compensation. Many POWs received nothing--nothing, \nzippo.\n  A Federal judge who dismissed many of the lawsuits wrote in his \nopinion--listen to this:\n\n       The immeasurable bounty of life for themselves and their \n     posterity in a free society services the debt.\n\n  That is what he said. If that is not a ridiculous statement, even if \nit did come from a judge, I have never heard one. Here it is again:\n\n       The immeasurable bounty of life for themselves [POWs] and \n     their posterity in a free society services the debt.\n\n  It is true under the War Claims Act POWs could receive minimal \ncompensation--a dollar a day--for their claims against the acts of \npowers. They could not be compensated for claims against private \ncorporations and nationals who were not agents.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues that a treaty that is signed \nbetween the United States and another government that says that a U.S. \ncitizen cannot sue another U.S. citizen--excuse me, another citizen in \na foreign country without due process--it is wrong. You can't do that.\n  You cannot deny due process. John Foster Dulles realized it when they \nwrote the side agreement and they wrote this memorandum of \nunderstanding and then buried it. They classified it. Senator Inouye \nand others have pointed out what article 14(b) says. I read it, and I \nagree. If article 14(b) is read alone without knowing any other \nbackground, then one could make the case these folks should not have \nthat opportunity to proceed.\n  This is right out of the memorandum of understanding, and this was \npartially written by Dulles himself:\n\n       Following the conversation of September 3, 1951, between \n     the Secretary of the Dutch Foreign Ministry . . . Dutch \n     Ambassador, and others, we emphasize that the purpose of this \n     statement was not to obligate the Japanese actually to pay \n     out any money to the claimants. He realized fully this was an \n     unlikely possibility. He emphasized, however, the statement \n     he had made to the Secretary the day before that the Dutch \n     Government was faced with a difficult legal problem; namely, \n     without a proper interpretation agreed to by the Japanese, it \n     would appear the Dutch Government was, by the act of signing \n     the Japanese peace treaty, giving up without due process \n     rights held by Dutch subjects.\n\n  That is the same issue with the United States, and Dulles realized \nit. You cannot sign a treaty that says we have no due process against \nanother citizen in another country. You simply cannot do it.\n  Talk about sticking to the Constitution and defending the \nConstitution. That is exactly what I am doing, and that is exactly what \nJohn Foster Dulles and others were doing because they realized article \n14(b) was wrong. Then in an effort to cover it all up to satisfy the \nDutch, he buried it. He classified it and kept it classified for 50 \nyears to keep these people from having the right to go to court. That \nis what he did. That is what the U.S. Government did. That is wrong, \nand we need to correct it. We can correct it right here today.\n  We cannot say we are not defending the Constitution. We are not only \ndefending the Constitution, we are defending the rights of individuals \nwho live under this Constitution to have due process. That is what we \nare doing, and that is what this debate is about.\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nSmith Amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State Authorization.\n  I do not do so because I think that the lawsuits filed against the \nJapanese corporations by the former Prisoners of War who were used as \nslave labor during World War II should not go forward--just the \nopposite--but because I believe that this Amendment takes the wrong \napproach to this issue.\n  I strongly support the right of the POWs to file lawsuits against the \nJapanese corporations. The POWs and veterans are only seeking justice \nfrom the private companies that enslaved them, and these claims should \nbe allowed to move forward.\n  In fact, Senator Hatch and I introduced legislation earlier this \nyear, S. 1272, the POW Assistance Act of 2001, precisely because I \nbelieve that it is important for those POWs who were used as slave \nlabor during World War II to have their day in court, and an \nopportunity to press their claims for remuneration and compensation.\n  There are serious questions about whether the 1951 Treaty between \nJapan and the United States has settled these claims, and these \nquestions should be dealt with seriously. But as these lawsuits go \nforward, I do not think that it is right and proper to enjoin the \nDepartment of State and the Department of Justice from offering the \ncourt their opinion on the meaning and interpretation of the 1951 \nTreaty. That opinion--which may ultimately be determined to be \nincorrect--is a perfectly legitimate part of the proceedings.\n  I strongly support the right of the POWs to seek justice. This is a \nmatter that belongs before the courts. But I do not think that the \nSmith Amendment is the right way to go, and I urge my colleague to \noppose its passage.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to express my support \nfor amendment No. 1538 of Senators Smith and Harkin regarding American \nPOWs held in Japan. I do so with much respect for those who have served \nand suffered horrible treatment as a result of their service. I was \ntraveling with President Bush in Florida when the vote occurred, but \nhad I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' to the motion to table \nthe amendment.\n  We do have an international treaty with Japan to which we are bound. \nBut, this amendment is not about what the Treaty signed 50 years ago \ndoes or does not allow. It is about due process to those Americans who \nsuffered a grievous wrong. The point is that these brave Americans be \nallowed their day in court to have their case heard. Actions by the \nDepartments of Justice and State to block such actions deprive them of \nfairness and due process. Congress should not be a party to such \ndeprivations.\n  I support the Smith-Harkin amendment and wish to be on record as \nopposed to the motion to table it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, during World War II, 36,000 Americans were \ncaptured and held prisoner by Japan. The story of the often horrific \ntreatment of these prisoners is punctuated by episodes such as the \nBataan Death March, where ten Americans lost their lives for every mile \nof the gruesome journey, and by the pictures of the emaciated soldiers \nwho spent years in confinement on starvation rations. I cannot think of \nany way in which we, as a nation, could begin to repay the men who \nsuffered through such abhorrent treatment.\n  The amendment before us today, offered by Senator Smith and Senator \nHarkin, however, puts in jeopardy constitutional principles that each \nmember of the Armed Forces, and each member of this body, swore to \nuphold. The amendment would prevent the Department of State and the \nDepartment of Justice from defending the U.S. Government in court \nagainst lawsuits that challenge whether provisions in the Treaty of San \nFrancisco will continue to be in force as the law of the land.\n  The treaty, which brought peace between Japan, the United States, and \nour Allies in World War II, explicitly settled all wartime reparations \nclaims that might arise against Japan. The text of the peace treaty is \nvery clear in this regard. Because, under Article VI of the \nConstitution, a ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land, it is \nequally clear that this treaty prohibits the Government of the United \nStates, or its people, from seeking further reparations from the \nGovernment of Japan, or its people. This is the position that the \nDepartment of State and the Department of Justice have maintained since \nratification of the treaty in 1952.\n  The amendment before us would prohibit those departments from arguing \nin court against lawsuits that violate the peace treaty. It would \nprevent the U.S. Government from upholding a supreme law of our land. \nIt would prohibit our government from acting in a responsible manner in \nsupport of our international obligations. It would stop the executive \nbranch from taking action on this issue, which affects our foreign \npolicy. I cannot support an amendment that challenges so many of our \nbasic constitutional principles on the importance of treaties and the \nconduct of foreign policy.\n  This is not to say that our veterans who were held prisoner by Japan \nmust be denied compensation or restitution for the inhumane treatment \nthey suffered. Those veterans were eligible for compensation \ndistributed by the U.S. Government under the War Claims Act of 1948. \nThe proponents of the amendment before us may believe that compensation \nwas not sufficient, which may be true. There are other ways to \ncompensate our veterans that do not tread upon constitutional \nprinciples. One proposal is in the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense \nAuthorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee last \nFriday.\n  The bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay $20,000 \nto former prisoners, or their surviving spouses, who were forced to \nperform slave labor while held by Japan. Such a proposal would allow \nthose veterans to receive the compensation they seek, without \nchallenging the legal status of a ratified treaty. There may be other \nproposals to compensate the veterans in question as well.\n  We must also consider how other countries would react to an action by \nCongress that would question our Nation's adherence to a 50-year-old \ntreaty with one of our closest allies. Already this year, the United \nStates has shown an alarming tendency toward unilateralism in regard to \na number of international agreements: the Kyoto Protocol, the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty, the International Criminal Court, the \nBiological Weapons Convention, and the U.N. convention on small arms. A \nmove to reverse a major provision of such a longstanding peace treaty \nwould be an disconcerting confirmation, and escalation, of this trend. \nThis is a particularly inopportune time to raise further questions \nabout our Nation's ability to cooperate with other countries.\n  I urge my colleagues not to view the vote on the Smith-Harkin \namendment as an up-or-down vote on our veterans. There are serious \nconstitutional and foreign policy issues at stake, and other means to \ncompensate these veterans have not yet been exhausted. We should take a \ncloser look at alternative means of compensation, and reject this \nattempt to tie the hands of our government in discharging its \nconstitutional duty to defend a ratified treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska be given 10 extra minutes to present his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Hawaii, who is, as we have heard today, one of the most \ndistinguished veterans of World War II, as is his colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  I am a bit of an interloper on this issue, except to say my father \nspent 3 years in the South Pacific during World War II in the Army Air \nCorps. So I know some of what my distinguished colleagues are talking.\n  I am most appreciative of the efforts and the motives of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith. I know of his \nfather's great sacrifice during World War II, meaning the sacrifice \nSenator Smith's family made to this country. I do not tread upon this \nsubject lightly.\n  I rise to oppose this amendment. The Senator from South Carolina and \nthe Senator from Hawaii have made very significant, substantive points \nas to\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nwhy it is the wrong course of action, in the opinion of some, including \nthis Senator from Nebraska.\n  I will say first, there is surely no way a grateful nation can ever \nadequately compensate or express our feelings to those brave men and \nwomen who gave so much to this country, who were the subjects of the \nslave labor camps, the forced marches, the unspeakable brutality, \nexcept this: We should put some of this in some perspective. What, \nindeed, was it that these brave men and women fought and endured for? \nIt was freedom. It was the liberty for a nation, an individual, to have \nthe kind of life and dignity for which America has stood for over 200 \nyears. That is what it was about.\n  How do we compensate, how do we adequately thank these men and women? \nWe cannot, of course, but we should remember this: What they fought \nfor, what they endured, can be, in fact, recognized by knowing and \nunderstanding that the greatest legacy any of us can leave in life is a \nfamily, the world better than we found it, and accomplishing something \nmuch greater than our own self-interests. That is the most important \ndynamic for me as I have listened to this debate and as I have read the \nreasons and listened to the reasons that Senator Smith has put forward \nto essentially change our treaty obligations.\n  Make no mistake. This is a very significant step that this body, this \nCongress, this Nation will take if, in fact, we vote for this \namendment. Great nations honor their treaty commitments. Treaty \ncommitments are important, and we can debate the specifics of sections \nand paragraphs of law and treaties, and as has been articulated rather \ndirectly and plainly this afternoon, there are various interpretations \nof that. But we should make it very clear that this great Nation will, \nin fact, live up to its commitments of our treaties, a commitment that \nwe made 50 years ago when that treaty was signed in San Francisco, \nwhich was, as expressed here, commemorated last weekend. It is a 50-\nyear treaty.\n  Was it awkward? Was it done not exactly the right way? Were parts of \nthat treaty misclassified? Why did we classify some of it in the way we \ndid? I suppose we could take days, weeks, and months debating that, but \nthat is part of a smaller issue. The bigger issue really, in fact, is: \nAre we, in fact, going to unilaterally reinterpret the commitment we \ngave to 48 other nations that signed this treaty 50 years ago? That is \nreally the issue.\n  American prisoners of war forced into slave labor by Japan during \nWorld War II suffered unspeakable brutality, and their treatment by \nJapanese overseers violated every standard of human decency. Their \nsacrifice and heroism now forms one of the most distinguished chapters \nin American history.\n  While we must not forget these Americans who suffered so greatly, we \nalso must not forget our country's historic and principled decision in \nthe aftermath of this terrible conflict. Our peace treaty with Japan \nwas not punitive. Although the United States had defeated a brutal \nenemy, we chose not to claim the spoils of war. Instead, the peace \ntreaty with Japan reflected the great humanity, vision, spirit and \ngenerosity of the American people. Referred to at the time as a ``Peace \nof Reconciliation,'' it looked forward to Japan's economic recovery and \nnot backward to its defeat. Most important, it reflected the new \nstirrings of a great and magnanimous superpower.\n  In 1945, most Americans felt the terms of surrender with Japan were \ntoo lenient. By 1951, most Americans began to see Japan in a very \ndifferent light--as a potential friend and ally in East Asia, not as an \nimplacable foe. When John Foster Dulles negotiated our generous peace \nwith Japan, waiving all reparation claims, the American public \nsupported the treaty, and the Senate ratified it with a lopsided \nmajority, 66-10, on March 20, 1952. The United States has stood behind \nthis decision for 50 years. Last Saturday, on September 8, Secretary of \nState Powell and Japanese Foreign Minister Tanaka commemorated the 50th \nanniversary of the Treaty of San Francisco at San Francisco's War \nMemorial Opera House, and formally renewed the strategic partnership \nbetween the United States and Japan. This relationship stands as one of \nthis country's most important--a tie of friendship and common interest \nthat will grow stronger and become increasingly important to our \nstrategic interest in East Asia and the world in the coming decades.\n  Senate amendment No. 1157, which has been offered today, would \nprevent the State and Justice Departments from stating our San \nFrancisco Treaty obligations in court. This action is not \ninsignificant. It would hamper the President's ability to conduct \nUnited States foreign policy, and it would violate the spirit, and \nlikely the letter, of one of the most significant treaties of the 20th \ncentury. This would set a dangerous precedent. While many of my \ndistinguished colleagues may no longer agree with the decision made by \nthe United States in 1951, it still stands as a treaty obligation and \nthe official United States position in U.S. court cases. We are a \nnation that upholds the rule of law and honors its treaty commitments.\n\n  How then should we honor and fairly compensate the Americans who \nsuffered grievously as slave or forced labor in World War II without \nviolating our long-held treaty obligation with Japan? Two of our World \nWar II allies, Canada and the United Kingdom, recently provided \ncompensation to their prisoners of war--recognizing that Japan has no \nobligation to do so under the Treaty of San Francisco. This is a model \nthat we might consider using for the surviving American prisoners of \nwar who suffered as Japanese slaves or forced laborers, without \nundermining our treaty obligations. Under the War Claims Act of 1948, \nand its 1952 amendment, the United States Government took all \nresponsibility for compensating World War II prisoners of war. Our \nprisoners of war received some compensation in the decade following \nWorld War II. Senators Bingaman and Hatch introduced legislation, S. \n1302, early last month to provide $20,000 to each veteran or civilian \ninternee, or their surviving spouses.\n  The last Congress, the 106th Congress, enacted Senate Concurrent \nResolution 158 calling on the Secretary of State to facilitate \ndiscussions between American prisoners of war forced into slave labor \nduring World War II and the Japanese companies that benefitted from \ntheir enslavement. The issue of forced and slave labor has been raised \nwith the Japanese government at a variety of levels by our State \nDepartment. The recent decision by Germany to compensate slave and \nforced laborers during World War II may provide a model on this issue.\n  Japan and the United States commemorated the 50th anniversary of the \nTreaty of San Francisco over the weekend. The treaty underpins and \nsupports the United States security structure in East Asia, and forms \nthe basis of our friendship with Japan. Treaty commitments and \nsymbolism are important. We should not risk our reputation as a \nreliable treaty partner by unilaterally reinterpreting an important \nprovision of this treaty that has stood for 50 years. Great nations are \nconsistent. We should act appropriately.\n  I will oppose this amendment.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to pay careful attention to this \namendment, and in the next couple of hours, if you are not aware of \nwhat this amendment does, please make yourself aware of it because if \nwe vote for this amendment, it will be about much bigger things than \nthe specific point of this amendment. I do not believe that is in the \nbest interests of our country, the best interests of the world, and, \nquite honestly, the best interests of the very families and the \nlegacies these brave men and women will leave behind and what they \nendured for us.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment as we vote this \nafternoon and once again recognize the Senator from New Hampshire for \nhis motives, for his intent, but in this Senator's opinion it is the \nwrong approach to accomplish something that is important.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I believe there is no further statement to be made with \nrespect to the Smith amendment and that now the unanimous consent \nagreement takes place whereby the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota will ask to set the Smith amendment aside, to be brought up at 5 \np.m. with the time equally divided between 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., and \nthe vote to\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\noccur at 5:30 p.m. Until then, the agreement is the Senator from North \nDakota will be recognized for him to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thank you and I thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  I actually have two amendments. I will talk about the first, offer \nthe amendment following my discussion of it, and then ask that it be \nset aside by consent and offer the second amendment.\n  I will take a moment to begin discussing the first amendment. The \nfirst amendment is an amendment to increase the amount of resources we \nare putting in this appropriations bill to deal with trade compliance \nand trade enforcement. The area of international trade is a very \nimportant area, and we are losing a lot of ground despite what one \nhears from some in Washington, DC.\n  I will put up a chart which shows the trade deficits we now have. \nThis chart shows the ballooning trade deficits year after year after \nyear. These are the merchandise trade deficits. They have risen from \n$132 billion a year in 1993 to over $450 billion a year in 2000, and \nwill likely to go even higher in the year 2001.\n  Our trade deficits are out of control. They are growing larger and \nlarger and larger. Now this trade deficit comes from the following \nsources: In the year 2000, we had an $81 billion trade deficit with \nJapan; an $84 billion trade deficit with China; a $56 billion trade \ndeficit with the European Union; a $50 billion trade deficit with \nCanada; and a $24 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Many of our \ntrading partners, as we all know, have a very poor record of complying \nwith trade agreements.\n  This red book, which my colleague from South Carolina frequently \nholds up in debate, is a book called ``Foreign Trade Barriers.'' It is \na rather thick book that describes all of the trade barriers American \nproducers and workers confront when trying to send American products \nabroad.\n  Let us talk for a moment about China, Japan, Canada, and Mexico. Do \nyou know that the number of people at the Department of Commerce who \nare monitoring our trade with China has declined from 10 to 7 people \nbetween 1994 and the year 2000? We used to have 10 people monitoring \nour trade with China; last year we had only 7.\n  What do we have with China? An $84 billion trade deficit. In 1992, \nChina agreed to eliminate import licenses. Shortly after that agreement \nwas signed, Beijing announced a new series of import registration \nrequirements that covered many of the same products. They have reneged \non commitments to make public the rules and regulations affecting \nforeign trade and investment. But that is just an example of how we \nnegotiate agreements. We just negotiated a new bilateral agreement with \nChina. Nobody seems to ever care whether the other country complies \nwith its half of the bargain.\n  With respect to China, we used to have 10 people monitoring trade \nwith China. Now we have seven, at a time when our trade deficit with \nChina is $84 billion.\n  How about Japan? With Japan, we have an $81 billion trade deficit. In \n1992, we had 17 people monitoring trade with Japan with respect to \ntrade enforcement. In 2000, it was seven. So we went from 17 people \ndown to 7 people monitoring trade agreements with Japan. Is that moving \nin the right direction, with a country that has an $81 billion trade \nsurplus with us or we a deficit with them? I do not think so.\n  With respect to Canada and Mexico, the number of trade monitors has \ngone from 33 to 13 people. Our ballooning deficit with both Canada and \nMexico continues to increase. We used to have 33 people monitoring \ntrade compliance and trade enforcement with Mexico and Canada. Last \nyear, we had only 13.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has brought a bill that moves in the \nright direction. It is the right step. It increases these areas. I \npropose to further increase them to the point where we have a more \nrobust ability to enforce and monitor these trade agreements. My \namendment proposes to add $10 million for these activities. This is \nless than the $30 million that the Senate Budget Resolution called for, \nbut it's a step in the right direction. I will state where I want to \nget the money, but first let me continue on this trade issue and why it \nis important.\n  I spoke last week about international trade and why I get so upset \nabout it from time to time. I mentioned in the area of trade, we have \nproblems with China, Japan, Korea, Europe, Mexico, Canada. I mentioned \nwe have nearly 570,000 motor vehicles coming into this country from \nKorea every year. Do you know how many vehicles we send to Korea? A \nlittle more than seventeen hundred. Think of that.\n  Today in Canada, they are loading molasses with Brazilian sugar. It \nis called stuffed molasses. Do you know what it is? It is a scheme. It \nis a fraud in international trade. Stuffed molasses is a way to \nartificially take Brazilian sugar and move it from Canada into this \ncountry in contravention of our trade agreement. Does anybody care much \nabout it? No, not much.\n  China, I could go forever on China. Japan, the same thing. I could \ntalk forever about the trade impediments and the barriers to try to get \nAmerican products into those countries or to stop unfairly subsidized \nproducts from those countries coming into our country.\n\n  I come from a State where we produce wonderful potatoes up in the Red \nRiver Valley. We produce a lot of potatoes. Some are turned into potato \nflakes which are used in fast food. Try to send potato flakes to South \nKorea. Do you know what happens when you try to send potato flakes to \nKorea? They impose a 300-percent tariff on potato flakes. Outrageous. \nAnd we have a huge deficit with Korea.\n  How about with Mexico? We have a very large deficit with Mexico. \nIncidentally, before NAFTA we had a tiny surplus, and then we passed a \ntrade agreement and turned it into a huge deficit. We try to send high \nfructose corn syrup to Mexico, and they put the equivalent of a 33- to \na 73-percent tariff on it.\n  The fact is, this country does not stand up for its economic \ninterests. Too many people in this country do not seem to care. This \nburgeoning trade deficit will make a difference. It will be repaid \nsomeday in some way by a lower standard of living in this country. We \nought to get it under control now. We ought to do it by insisting on \nother countries owning up to the trade agreements they have reached \nwith us and by insisting in this country that our own trade negotiators \nbegin to negotiate trade agreements they do not lose in the first week \nof the discussion.\n  What am I proposing? I am proposing that we reverse the trend we have \nregarding a reduction in the number of people enforcing our trade \nagreements and monitoring compliance of these agreements. As I \nmentioned, this number has gone from 10 people monitoring China down to \n7 people; from 17 people monitoring Japan down to 7 people; from 33 \npeople monitoring Canada and Mexico to 13 people. I am suggesting we \nreverse that trend.\n  How do we reverse it? By adding $10 million as a first step back to \nthis appropriations bill. How would I get the money to do that? To get \nthe money to enforce our trade laws, I propose we cut funding for \nsomething called TV Marti. TV Marti, boy, that will spark some interest \namong some. Let me describe what TV Marti is.\n  TV Marti is the basis by which we broadcast television signals into \nCuba to tell the Cubans the truth. The Cubans need to know the truth. \nThey can get a lot of Miami radio stations and from Radio Marti. I \nsupport Radio Marti. It costs $14 or $15 million a year. Having been in \nCuba, I understand the Cubans listen to and appreciate the broadcasts. \nGood for Radio Marti. Count me as a supporter.\n  But nobody sees TV Marti. Each year we spend lots of money on TV \nMarti, despite the fact that it is absurd to do so. Here is the \ntelevision picture seen on TV Marti in Havana. Does it look like snow \nand only snow? It does, because it is jammed. The signal does not get \nthrough. It is a jammed signal.\n  We spend a substantial amount of money, about $10 million a year, on \nTV Marti. TV Marti has 55 employees, broadcasting 4\\1/2\\ hours a day, \nfrom 3:30 a.m.--yes, that is right, 3:30 a.m.--until about 8 a.m. We \nbroadcast a jammed signal, 4\\1/2\\ hours a day, starting at 3:30 a.m. We \nspend $10 million a year to broadcast a signal no one can see. That is \nwhat we do as taxpayers. Is that a\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\ngood deal? I don't think so. I think we ought to cut that and use the \nmoney to enhance our compliance in the area of international trade.\n  To make the rest of the case, I will describe more about TV Marti. As \nI said, I fully support Radio Marti. I know it is effective. TV Marti, \non the other hand, is a total, colossal waste of the taxpayers' money, \nproviding no picture to anyone, and does so at 3:30 in the morning.\n  Last year, we spent $10.8 million beaming TV Marti to Cuba, where the \nviewership was approximately zero. Since the inception, we have spent \nabout $150 million of taxpayers' money on TV Marti. We continue to \nbroadcast 4\\1/2\\ hours a day--31\\1/2\\ hours a week--from 3:30 a.m. \nuntil 8 a.m. What we broadcast are fuzzy lines, as I indicated before. \nTV Marti's broadcast to Cuba has been consistently jammed to the \npublic. No one can view the programs.\n  To lessen the effects of jamming, the TV Marti signal is randomly \nshifted east and west of Havana during broadcast hours. Those who want \nto watch a snowy jammed signal that one cannot see have to catch it as \na signal that moves around Havana somewhere between 3:30 in the morning \nand 8 a.m.\n  TV Marti is seen by those who would visit the visa department at our \nInterest Section in Havana where they play videotapes of the program. \nThus, it reaches those who have already decided they want to leave \nCuba. We have plenty of evidence there are people who want to leave \nCuba. I don't know that we have to tell the Cubans the difference \nbetween living in the United States and in Cuba. People living in Cuba \nunderstand what is happening in Cuba.\n  Let me talk about the question of whether we want to spend money on \nsomething that is not effective. We broadcast TV Marti through an \nantenna and a transmitter mounted on a tethered balloon 10,000 feet \nabove Cudjoe Key in Florida. This is a picture of Fat Albert. Fat \nAlbert is the aerostat balloon which we send up to 10,000 feet which \nbroadcasts a line of sight signal to Cuba that is jammed at 3:30 in the \nmorning. A Cuban television set can have snow. Fat Albert, of course, \nis not invincible. Television is easy to jam. TV Marti is easy to jam. \nTV Marti's signal, according to experts, is able to be jammed by \nseveral off-the-shelf antennas and 100-watt transmitters, the power of \na light bulb. The antennas cost about $5,000 each to block the signals.\n  Why waste money when the message can get through by radio and you \ncan't get the message through by television signal? Transmitting by \naerostat balloon is not perfect. They have to be taken up and down. \nThey regularly require maintenance. They are affected by weather \nconditions.\n\n  TV Marti employs 55 people and keeps spending money even if the \nballoon cannot go up for various reasons. TV Marti did not broadcast \nfrom October 1999 to October 2000 because it lost its transmission \nballoon in a storm. Fat Albert got lost in a storm and they did not \nbroadcast for an entire year. But they continued to operate at TV Marti \nat $27,000 a day.\n  This was not the first time that a Fat Albert-type balloon had \nproblems at Cudjoe Key. In the early 1990s, a Fat Albert balloon broke \nfrom its cable and landed in the Everglades 70 miles away where it was \nrecovered by a team with a helicopter. And a balloon like Fat Albert \nescaped in 1981--before TV Marti started, of course--and local \nfishermen caught it and tethered it to the bow of the boat. As the sun \nwarmed up the blimp, it started to rise higher and higher and actually \nlifted the fishing boat out of the water and the poor folks in the \nfishing boat had to dive off the boat. So much for Fat Albert and so \nmuch for tethered balloons.\n  That is how we broadcast a blocked signal to Cuba. We have an \naerostat balloon, Fat Albert, broadcasting a jammed signal to Havana, \nCuba, at 3:30 in the morning so people with a television set are unable \nto see a picture. And this is paid for with U.S. taxpayers' funds.\n  One might be able to ask the question with a straight face, is this \ngood public policy? Does it serve the taxpayers interests? With Radio \nMarti, the answer to that would be yes. Radio Marti works. The signal \ngets through to Cuba and people listen to it. I think it is an \neffective piece of public policy.\n  TV Marti has been supported, notwithstanding the fact it does not \nwork, by this Congress year after year because even waste has a \nconstituency. No more, in my judgment.\n  Let Congress, where we are wasting money, stop wasting money and \ninvest that money in something that is important for this country. In \nthis case, we have a crying need to better enforce our trade laws and \nmake sure that other countries comply with the trade laws that they \nhave entered into with us. Let's not see a continued degradation of our \nability to comply and enforce our trade laws with China and Japan and \nEurope and Mexico and Canada. Let's enhance that. Let's not degrade it.\n  Yet, what we have seen in recent times is a substantial diminution of \nour ability to require others to comply with our trade laws and to \nenforce those trade laws.\n  My proposition is simple: Abolish that which is wasteful, TV Marti. \nAnd, yes, we will get people coming to the floor who say: Gosh, this \nwould be the wrong signal to send to Fidel Castro. He doesn't get the \nsignal nor do the Cuban people get the signal. This is not about \nsignaling anybody except the American taxpayer that we will quit \nwasting money.\n  I am sure people will make the point: We should not give aid and \ncomfort to Fidel Castro. I am not interested in that. I am interested \nin giving aid and comfort to the American taxpayer. Cuba is a country \nthat, in my judgment, needs a new government; its people deserve a new \ngovernment. The approach that we use to deal with it ought not be an \napproach that wastes American taxpayers' money. It ought to be an \napproach that is effective, investing in the things that can help us \ngive the Cuban people some assistance. Radio Marti does that. TV Marti \ndoes not.\n  I hope that if we decide to abandon a failed policy, we do not get \ninto a debate about this failed policy somehow giving comfort to Fidel \nCastro. It does not make any sense to me.\n  In 1991 and 1994, the President's Task Force on U.S. Government \nInternational Broadcasting found there was not enough of an audience \nfor TV Marti to continue funding it. That was nearly a decade ago when \nthat judgment was made. A decade later we are still doing it. In 1994, \nit was concluded it was pointless and wasteful to continue TV Marti's \noperations unless the viewing audience could be substantially expanded. \nThe viewing audience in 2001 is about the same as it was in 1994, \nnearly zero.\n  It is time, in my judgment, long past the time, to use these funds in \na more effective way. We should pursue a public policy that will \nstrengthen the United States and help it with respect to its problems \nin international trade.\n  So that is my proposal. As I indicated, I know it will be \ncontroversial for some, not perhaps because I want to invest more in \nmaking sure we better enforce our trade law and have people monitoring \nits compliance with respect to other countries. It will be \ncontroversial because I propose abolishing the $10 million of funding \nfor TV Marti.\n  Again, let me say almost everyone will concede that virtually no one \nin Cuba sees the signals of TV Marti. As I mentioned before, Radio \nMarti is effective, but TV Marti is a colossal and tragic waste of \ntaxpayers' money. I hope my amendment will be accepted as one that is \nthoughtful, useful, and one that will advance this country's interests.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask the amendment at the desk be called \nup at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1542.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funds for the trade enforcement and trade \ncompliance activities of the International Trade Administration and to \n                       reduce funds for TV Marti)\n\n       On page 44, line 1, strike ``$347,090,000'' and insert \n     ``$357,090,000''.\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\n       On page 44, line 6, strike ``$27,441,000'' and insert \n     ``$32,441,000''.\n       On page 44, line 7, strike ``$42,859,000'' and insert \n     ``$47,859,000''.\n       On page 88, line 7, strike ``and television''.\n       On page 88, line 9, strike ``and television''.\n       On page 88, line 10, strike ``$24,872,000'' and insert \n     ``$14,872,000''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment does exactly what I \ndescribed with respect to the numbers.\n  That is all I have to say about the amendment. If there are others \nwho wish to speak on it, I will be happy to entertain questions or \nengage in a discussion with them. If not, I ask consent to offer a \nsecond amendment to this legislation. I therefore ask unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending amendment so I may offer my second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object, let me say a word. Will \nthe Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Perhaps the Senator from South Carolina should seek \nrecognition, after which I will seek to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senators from Florida, \nboth of them--Senator Graham, I am sure, will be here momentarily. I \nthink he is on the way to the floor. I am double-checking that now.\n  The junior Senator, Senator Bill Nelson, was with the President in \nFlorida. Maybe that is where Senator Graham is also. But that is why \nthey are not here to be heard. It is very vital to their interests to \nbe heard.\n  Barring that, let me say defending Fat Albert has always been a role \nof this particular subcommittee. Time and again, since its institution \nover 15 years ago, we have had reports--the most recent one, of course, \nis the one referred to by my distinguished colleague from North \nDakota--the Report of the Advisory Panel on Radio Marti and TV Marti.\n  While it found it might not be economically feasible, I read the \nfinding:\n\n       TV Marti's broadcasts are technically sound and contain \n     essential information not otherwise available to the Cuban \n     people. Persistent Cuban jamming does limit viewership on the \n     island, however. These broadcasts could prove vital to the \n     United States interests and to the welfare of the Cuban \n     people now and in the future.\n  True it is, it comes on in the middle of the night, 3 in the morning, \nbut then it goes on to early morning when it is generally picked up, \nexcept for that year's period when Fat Albert was down.\n  Our distinguished friend Larry King made himself famous. I used to be \non his program when it was out on the west coast at 1 in the morning. \nIt was only, what, 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in California. But he came \non at midnight to 3 in the morning and got so famous that we can't get \nhim off the air now. He is on the east coast at 9 o'clock every night. \nI don't think he should be off the air. I think it is wonderful \nprogramming.\n  So my emphasis is on the timing of it. We are going to have these \ndebates back and forth on this particular amendment. As I understand \nthe unanimous consent agreement, we are going to vote on the Smith \namendment after a half hour equally divided, from 5 to 5:30. We are \ngoing to vote at 5:30 on the Smith amendment. Then we'll have the other \nvotes with respect to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho relative to the International Crime Commission. The Fat Albert \namendment, which the Senator from North Dakota has up, is subsequent \nthereto.\n  Having the floor, I cannot pass the opportunity, because as my friend \nfrom West Virginia carries around the Constitution, I carry around the \nrecord of waste. I heard the word ``waste'' but it was in regard to \nabout $10 million. Let's talk about billions--$1 billion a day waste.\n  I hold in my hand the public debt to the penny, put out by the \nDepartment of Treasury as of this morning. We are already in the red \nthis fiscal year, which is going to end now in about 3 weeks' time, \n$100 billion.\n  That didn't happen overnight. I guess $74 billion came from that tax \ncut--that didn't help the economy--and the rest just followed suit. But \nthat is another debate to be had at a different time.\n  But let's pay attention to the fact that the public debt is $100 \nbillion. If anybody wants to get into this yin-yang about the public \ndebt and the Government debt--yes, the public debt has gone down $59 \nbillion but the Government debt has gone up $159 billion. So it is \npaying off your Visa card with your MasterCard. That gets people \nconfused. But there is not any confusion on the actual figure put out \nby the Treasury Department of $100 billion.\n  Under President Bush's budget and under the CBO budget, both of them \nsubmitted within the last 3 weeks, they estimate a deficit ending the \nfiscal year, that is September 30--today is the 10th, 20 days from now, \nof $123 billion or $124 billion.\n  Consequently, since we ran a deficit last year of $23.2 billion, and \nwe are going to run a deficit this year--where is the surplus that \neveryone talks about? I have been on the floor since January saying: \nWait a minute, there is not any surplus, there is not any surplus. But \neverybody was talking surplus to get that tax cut. Now they are all \nrunning around saying where has the money gone?\n  The big waste is the interest cost, when the debt goes up, up and \naway, from $5.674 trillion at the end of the last fiscal year, to now, \nthis minute, it is at $5.774 trillion. The interest costs necessarily \ngo up. As that interest goes up, the waste goes up.\n  Having talked about waste, let me say a word about the current \naccount deficit, or the deficit in the balance of trade. This is a \nfavorite subject of mine. It used to be just $17 billion. Monitoring \nthat $81 billion deficit in the balance of trade with Japan, that $17 \nbillion is down to $7 billion; or that $10 billion, monitoring the $84 \nbillion deficit in the balance of trade with the People's Republic of \nChina, is down to $7 billion.\n  There is a question about this particular International Trade \nCommission receiving more money. I have found from some 34, almost 35 \nyears' experience, that the International Trade Commission is a \ngimmick. The reason I call it a gimmick, advisedly, is through hard \nexperience.\n  Time and again, corporate America has taken its trade violation case \nagainst Japan, against China etc., to the International Trade \nAdministration in the Department of Commerce, and they have found a \ndumping case, that the goods are being sold at less than cost.\n  I have a Lexus. Let's say that Lexus costs $35,000. Go buy that same \nLexus in Tokyo, Japan. Its cost is $45,000.\n  The Japanese article imported into this country is sold here for much \nless. Time and time again it is proven that it is being sold at less \nthan cost. Take the Kodak case. What happens? That is what I call a \ngimmick. Then they go for a fix before the Finance Committee of the \nSenate to find out, even though there is dumping, if there is injury. \nThat is the question before the International Trade Commission. And \nthey file for injury.\n  It is very interesting that there is now a steel case the President \nis disturbed about because over 20 mills have closed down in the last \n18 months with a loss of 40,000 steel jobs. Since NAFTA, the State of \nSouth Carolina has lost 48,600 textile jobs, which are just as \nimportant as the steel jobs to the economy--found so by a special \nhearing under President Kennedy. But time and again you go before the \nInternational Trade Commission, and that is why they don't enforce the \nlaws.\n  There is no such thing as free trade.\n  That was a pretty good wag at the end of World War II when we had the \nwhole industry and we were in the cold war and wanted capitalism to \ndefeat communism. We put in the Marshall Plan. We more or less gave up \nour manufacturing sector in pursuit of the defeat of communism with \ncapitalism. It has worked. Nobody is complaining about that. It has \npersisted in Europe, even with the fall of the Soviets, and certainly \nis strong and viable in the Pacific rim.\n  I was just in the People's Republic of China. They are on the right \ntrack. But don't misunderstand my statement. China is communist, and \nmany human rights abuses occur there. But as the seed of capitalism \ntakes over more and more each day, as it finally prevailed in the \nSoviet Union, the hope of the free world will prevail in the People's \nRepublic of China.\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\n  We have really gone awry with respect to international trade that the \ndistinguished Senator talks about.\n  I say there is no such thing as free trade. Let's go back to the \nearliest day when this country was built on protectionism. The debate \nensued. Colonies had just won their freedom. The United Kingdom said to \nthe fledgling colonies, you trade with us what you produce best and we \nwill trade back with you what we produce best. Early economist David \nRicardo put forth his doctrine of comparative advantage. However, the \ntrade debate really was between Thomas Jefferson, the agriculturalist, \nand Alexander Hamilton, the industrialist. Hamilton wrote a booklet \ncalled ``Reports on Manufacturing.'' There is one copy left in the \nLibrary of Congress. But in a line, without reading that booklet, he \ntold the Brits to bug off; we are not going to remain your colony and \nship you our agriculture, our foodstuffs, our timber, our iron ore, and \nbring in the finished products from England.\n  As a result, the second act that passed this Congress in its entire \nhistory--the first act was for the seal--but on July 4, 1789, the \nsecond act in its history that passed Congress was an act of \nprotectionism and a 50-percent tariff on 60 articles.\n  We began the United States by building up its manufacturing capacity. \nLincoln kept it going at the very beginning of the War Between the \nStates whereby we were trying to build a transcontinental railroad. \nThey said we were going to get the steel rails from England. President \nLincoln said no. He said we would build up our own steel capacity, and \nwhen we were through, we would have not only the transcontinental \nrailroad, but we would have a steel industry.\n  It comes right on down the line with America's agriculture and the \ndarkest days of the Depression when the only hope we had was hope \nitself. It was Roosevelt who put in the best of the best protections.\n\n  We will be passing an agriculture bill. I don't know where we are \ngoing to find the money. But you can bet your boots it will be $5 \nbillion to $6 billion for America's agriculture. We subsidize--protect, \nif you please.\n  My point was made best by Akio Morita of Sony some 20 years ago up in \nChicago when we had a conference up there, and he was addressing the \nemerging Third World nations. He admonished that they had to develop a \nstrong manufacturing sector to become a nation state. He pointed at me \nand said: Senator, the world power that loses its manufacturing \ncapacity will cease to be a world power.\n  Where are we? From 41 percent of the workforce in manufacturing down \nto 12--making what? Nothing.\n  I was sort of amazed at Alan Greenspan saying in February that we \nhave so much productivity we must have a surplus as far as the eye can \nsee, and so we ought to have a tax cut when the productivity has gone \noverseas.\n  We have lost 1 million manufacturing jobs in the last year in the \nUnited States of America. That is the problem that we have with respect \nto trade. There is no question that if we don't begin to compete--as \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota wants to do with respect to \nthese trade deficits going up, up, and away--we will finally learn the \nlesson that has already been given us.\n  In 1989, we passed a resolution to have hearings with respect to \nChina on human rights. And the Chinese went down to New Zealand, to \nAustralia, and over to Africa and their friends. They never had a \nhearing on that resolution. About 5 months ago the United States was \nkicked off the Human Rights Commission. Sudan and Libya remained on the \ncommission.\n  The atom bomb, the aircraft carrier, forget it. It is the economy, \nstupid. It is the industrial power, and your money in international \naffairs as well as domestic politics.\n  We don't seem to realize that the name of the game out there is \nmarket share. The name of the game in the United States is standard of \nliving. So we continue to add not just a minimum wage, Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, plant closing notices, clean air and clean water, \nsafe workplace conditions, safe machinery, and on and on. Ergonomics \nwas the last one. I am glad we voted it down. But they think up all \nkinds of things here for the high standard of living, and then don't \nwant to protect the economy of the United States.\n  The security of our Nation is like a three-legged stool. You have the \nvalues as a nation, the one leg; unquestioned. Everyone knows that \nAmerica stands for indivisible rights and freedom. The second leg is \nthe military; unquestioned. But the third leg is industrial capacity. \nIndustrial capacity has been fractured.\n  I am glad the distinguished Senator from North Dakota brought this \nsubject up when we have just a few minutes.\n  What we should be doing is paying the bill. What we should be doing \nis getting competitive and enforcing the laws on the books.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota want to set aside his amendment \nand go to another amendment?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is nothing quite like the sight of \nthe Senator from South Carolina in full voice in support of things he \ncares about passionately. Among them are trade and related issues. He \nis kind of like a jockey on a horse who are is running when he is \nmoving on these issues. Then I watched him turn to the support of Fat \nAlbert. He had the body language of someone headed toward a dental \nchair. There is no one, in my judgment, less capable of defending Fat \nAlbert, based on his good record of public service, than the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I would only like to refer to the 1994 CRS report to Congress about \nTV Marti. It said TV Marti is worthless. It does not reach the \npopulation. It is easily jammed. It broadcasts at 3:30 in the morning. \nNobody sees it.\n  I am not interested in being soft on Castro, nor am I interested in \nbeing hard on the American taxpayer. So my point is very simple: Let's \nget rid of wasteful spending. I understand why some have to defend Fat \nAlbert, but Fat Albert is indefensible. So let's get rid of that $10 \nmillion and move on and invest in something that really does strengthen \nthis country and our manufacturing center. Let's demand and insist that \nother countries with whom we have trade relationships own up to those \ntrade relationships and begin to exhibit fair trade practices with this \ncountry.\n  Again, let me say to my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, I \nhave always enjoyed the Senator from South Carolina when he gets a full \nhead of steam on the issue of international trade. He is interesting to \nlisten to and knows his stuff. I hope he agrees with me that we should \nincrease the number of people engaged in monitoring the compliance and \nrequiring the enforcement of our trade laws with respect to other \ncountries. Compliance and enforcement has decreased rather than \nincreased, and as a result, our trade deficit has dramatically \nballooned.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Having said all that, let me now turn to my next amendment. I will be \nmercifully brief. I will offer this amendment because I think it is \nimportant to have this discussion and to pass a piece of legislation \nsuch as it.\n  This amendment deals with the Small Business Administration. Many of \nyou will remember the disaster in the State of North Dakota when the \ncity of Grand Forks--the Red River Valley, in fact--experienced a very \nlarge flood in 1997. The city of Grand Forks, a city of nearly 50,000 \npeople, had to be nearly completely evacuated. It is almost an \nunprecedented event in this country, in the last 150 years, to have a \ncity of that size be nearly completely evacuated as a result of a \nflood.\n  In the middle of that flood, a fire broke out in the downtown \nbusiness section. So we had a raging flood of the Red River, that had \nrequired the evacuation of a city. Then, we had a roaring fire in the \nmiddle of that downtown that had been evacuated. You might remember on \ntelevision the images of firefighters trying to fight a fire in the \nmiddle of a flood. It was really quite a remarkable sight.\n  That disaster, as other disasters in this country, prompted the Small \nBusiness Administration, and other agencies, including FEMA and HUD, to \ncome in with some assistance. We do that in times of disaster. Our \nGovernment programs are meant to say to people who are down and out, \nflat on\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\ntheir back, hit with a natural disaster: We are here to help you. Here \nis a helping hand. We want to help you during troubled times. So we \ndid that.\n\n  One of the things we did was provide Small Business Administration \nlow-interest loans, 4-percent loans. There were some grants and other \nthings as well, but the centerpiece was an SBA loan to a homeowner or a \nbusiness that had been dramatically flooded and was in very difficult \ntrouble.\n  What I did not know at the time, and what I think many of you perhaps \ndo not know in this Chamber, is that those loans by the SBA, including \nthe disaster loans I am now discussing, were later packaged together \nand then sold to the highest bidder. Companies that are engaged to \nbring money together to invest in Government loans decide: We are going \nto now buy a package of loans from the SBA. Then they bid 50 cents on \nthe dollar or 60 cents on the dollar, and they buy the loans from the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  I never thought much about that. I suspect most people have not \nthought about that. The problem is when the SBA sells disaster loans, \nyou have the potential for a second disaster for a family or business. \nHere is why.\n  The SBA, when it serviced those disaster loans itself, was always \nreasonably flexible in dealing with people. Oh, we want people to pay \nthose loans back. That is for sure. But if someone got stuck in a tough \nsituation, the SBA would work with them. For example, if a business had \nto sell one asset and replace it with another asset that was more \nefficient and if the old asset had an SBA disaster lien on it, the SBA \nwould say: Yes, we will work with you on that; we will transfer the \nlien. And the business was able to deal with that.\n  Now these disaster loans are sold to financial companies, and the \nfinancial companies say: We are sorry, we don't intend to transfer any \nliens. We are sorry, there is no flexibility here. We are not going to \ndo what the SBA did for you.\n  I will give you an example--there are many--but I will offer an \nexample of a woman in Grand Forks, ND. This is one of many letters I \nhave received:\n\n       I'm another flood victim trying to find a way to transfer \n     the current loan I have from the SBA to another property. My \n     SBA loan was sold to [blank--I will not name the company--] \n     and I've been told by them they don't transfer loans, period. \n     So I am out of luck. Personal circumstances made it necessary \n     for me to sell my property. And I need this low interest rate \n     in order to afford another property to get back on my feet.\n\n  She had the disaster. The disaster still hurts, but something \nhappened in her circumstance where she had to sell that property and \nreplace it with another property because of family circumstances. In \nthe past, the SBA always would have said: Yes, we will work with you to \ntransfer the lien, as long as we still have a lien on the property. The \nnew investors--now that the loans have been sold--say: We're sorry, we \nwon't change the interest rate on you. We won't change the terms of the \nloan. But there is no flexibility. Any changes at all might cost you a \nhuge fee. And in some cases they say: There's no fee because there are \nno changes. We have no flexibility.\n  So I have talked to the head of the SBA. I had a visit with him, in \nfact, on Friday of this past week. He understands there can be some \nproblems in these areas. He told me he is going to try to put an \nadvisory panel together to see if they can work on individual cases. \nBut I really believe we ought not be selling disaster loans. I do not \nobject to selling other loans, if they want loan processing to be done \nby someone else in ordinary circumstances, but I do not believe \ndisaster loans represent ordinary circumstances. I believe disaster \nloans ought to be serviced by the SBA. That way, the SBA controls and \nmaintains the policies with respect to how these loans are treated.\n  My preference is that the SBA go ahead and sell whatever loans they \nwant, except disaster loans. The SBA, I believe, has a responsibility \nand an obligation to service those disaster loans.\n  CBO tells me there is no scoring on this amendment.\n  So I am offering the amendment. I do not know whether a copy of my \namendment is at the desk. If not, I will send it to the desk at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1543.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the sale of disaster loans authorized under \n                section 7(b) of the Small Business Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON SALE OF DISASTER LOANS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no amount made \n     available under this Act may be used to sell any disaster \n     loan authorized by section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 636(b)) to any private company or other entity.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not continue further. I have been \nappreciative of the efforts by the Senators from South Carolina and New \nHampshire to allow me to offer these amendments. I know they will set \nthem aside to proceed with other things on the bill.\n  I will continue to work with those in the authorizing committee on a \ncouple of these issues. But it is my hope we will be able to consider \nboth pieces of legislation favorably. I know one of them is--or can \nbe--controversial; it should not be. As I said, even waste has a \nconstituency, I guess, in Congress and perhaps in some parts of the \ncountry. But I think, to the extent we can--especially as we suffer an \neconomic downturn in this country--when we see waste, we really ought \nto eliminate it. On behalf of the American taxpayer, we ought to take \naction. So my hope is that the Senate will find its way to be \nsupportive of both amendments I have offered.\n  Mr. President, I understand there will be a request to set these \naside. I will be happy to work with the chairman and the ranking member \nto see if we can find a way to clear one or both of these amendments as \nwe proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to hear momentarily from the \nSmall Business Administration with respect to the handling of these \ndisaster loans. The position of the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota is very appealing. It sounds logical to me.\n  On the other hand, think of it for a second, and you understand that \nSBA is selling these particular loans and taking the funds and \nleveraging even more SBA loans. Because of some of the wrongs that may \nhave occurred with the private sector purchasing the loans, as well as \nother administrative problems, I want to hear from the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  I am not trying to put it off, but I will learn quite shortly. I know \nthere will be opposition to Fat Albert. There are a lot of people on a \ndiet, but not Fat Albert.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from South Carolina will \nyield, my hope is that as he continues to consider this issue, he will \nbe the last to come to the aid of Fat Albert, having heard my \ndiscussion about Government waste and knowing his position on \nGovernment waste. My hope is he will be the last in line to be \nsupportive of the aerostat balloon called Fat Albert, a balloon that \nbroadcasts a signal no one can see at 3:30 in the morning.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand the pending business, \nand I ask the Chair to confirm, at 5 o'clock we come back to the Smith-\nHarkin amendment relative to compensation for the POWs, Japanese \nprisoners of war, with the time equally divided between Senator Smith \nand Senator Inouye, 15 minutes per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be \nequally allocated to both Senator Smith and Senator Inouye.\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthe order for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is my understanding we \nhave the vote on the Smith amendment at 5:30. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleagues who are also here \nto speak, I will be very brief in deference to those on both sides who \nwish to speak.\n  I want to say what the Smith amendment does. It says:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Department of Justice or the Department of State to file \n     a motion in any court opposing a civil action against any \n     Japanese person or corporation for compensation or \n     reparations in which plaintiff alleges that, as an American \n     prisoner of war during World War II, he or she was used as \n     slave or forced labor.\n\n  All this says is that no funds in this act will be used to block that \nlawsuit.\n  That is it. We are not making any editorial comment on the merits or \ndemerits of the lawsuit or who should win it. I have personal feelings \nabout who should win it. I believe the Ameican POWs should win the \nlawsuits. That is up to the courts. All we want to do is let that \nprocess proceed.\n  I also want to make it very clear that this amendment does not \nabrogate the 1951 peace treaty with Japan. I repeat, It does not \nabrogate the 1951 peace treaty with Japan. It merely limits the State \nand Justice departments from interfering in the veterans' lawsuits.\n  Why does it not do it? Because article 26 makes it very clear that if \nthe Japanese should enter into any agreement that is more advantageous, \nthen the same terms apply to all the signatories to the treaty. That is \nwhat it says. Should Japan make a war claims settlement with any state \ngranting that state greater advantage than those provided by the \npresent treaty, those same advantages shall be extended to the parties \nto the present treaty.\n  Did that happen? The answer is, yes, it did--right here in an \nagreement that was written between the Japanese Government and the \nDutch. The point is it did happen.\n  We are not violating the treaty. Article 26 is part of the treaty. We \nare simply complying with the treaty.\n  The bottom line is we are not only not abrogating it, but we are \ncomplying with the treaty. This is about whether or not we are going to \nside with Japanese companies or American war heroes. That is the bottom \nline. That is the issue. As Senator Hollings said a while back, this is \nabout the Constitution and about the treaty; it is not. We are \ncomplying with the treaty with this amendment.\n  This is about siding with Japanese companies in this lawsuit or with \nAmerican war heroes.\n  That is the issue. We are not even doing that. We are just allowing \nthe process to move forward because American war heroes can have their \nday in court. That is all we are doing. The treaty allows for that very \nclearly.\n  As I indicated in my previous remarks today, John Foster Dulles, when \nhe did the background and memorandum of understanding and wrote some of \nthis language, understood it, too. Then this was classified for 50 \nyears.\n  We didn't know about it. The lawyers who are trying to present these \nlawsuits on behalf of American war heroes--the greatest generation--\ndidn't have access to this information until it was declassified a year \nago. That is what this is about, pure and simple. There is nothing \ncomplicated.\n  You are either for allowing American war heroes who were in the \nBataan Death March and who were forced into slave labor camps to have \ntheir day in court--you don't even have to be for them winning, as I \nhappen to be, and as I know many others are. You just have to be for \nallowing them their day in court as is prescribed under that 1951 \ntreaty, period. That is what it is about. You are either for that or \nyou are for the Japanese companies that basically forced them into \nslave labor.\n  That is the difference. That is what we are talking about in this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe all of us will agree that the \natrocities committed and the inhumane treatment of our war prisoners \ncannot be condoned and cannot in any way be justified. We condemn those \natrocities. It is not a question of Japanese corporations versus \nAmerican heroes. What is involved is the Constitution of the United \nStates. Article II makes it very clear that treaties are to be \nnegotiated by the President or the executive branch of this country--\nnot by any State, nor by any individual, nor by the Senate. It will be \nby the executive branch. There is no question about that.\n  The document that my dear friend from New Hampshire has referred to \nwhich was arranged by our then-Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, \nshould be praised and not condemned. I would like to explain.\n  I believe the references to this arrangement is a bit misleading. I \nsay so most respectfully. This arrangement which was engineered by \nSecretary Dulles was simply a side agreement designed to address a \ndomestic issue for the Dutch and thereby enabling the Dutch to sign on \nas a signatory to the treaty of peace in San Francisco.\n  It does not in any way change the terms of the treaty. My colleagues \nfrom New Hampshire and Iowa have read the documents. But somehow we \nhave slid over certain words. If I may, very carefully I will quote \nfrom their document.\n\n       However, the Japanese Government points out that under the \n     treaty allied nationals will not be able to obtain \n     satisfaction regarding such claims. Although, as the \n     Netherlands government suggests, there are certain types of \n     private claims by allied nationals which the Japanese \n     Government might wish voluntarily to deal with.\n\n  We have somehow skimmed over that word ``voluntarily.''\n  At this moment, Mr. President, if you wanted to sue me and I said to \nyou, I voluntarily open myself up to you, we need not go to court, no \none is going to fuss over that. If at this moment a prisoner of war of \nthe United States should decide that he wants to sue the Japanese \nGovernment or a Japanese national notwithstanding the treaty, and if \nthat Japanese national or the Japanese Government should say, yes, they \nvoluntarily expose themselves, we don't have to break the treaty. But \nif the Japanese Government or the Japanese national should resist and \nchallenge that claim, then I say the executive branch of the Government \nof the United States should have every right to intervene in such a \nsuit because it does impact upon the treaty of San Francisco.\n  I think we should read this again:\n\n       There are certain types of private claims by allied \n     nationals which the Japanese Government might wish \n     voluntarily to deal with.\n\n  This amendment is not necessary. If you want to sue the Japanese \nGovernment or its national at this moment, and the Government and the \nnational said to you, yes, they will voluntarily enter into an \nagreement with you to compensate you for whatever claims you may have, \nno one is going to complain. But this amendment will without question \nimpact upon the treaty. It will abrogate the treaty. Then other \ncountries will begin to doubt our good word. Is our word good? Are the \npromises made by the United States good? We are constantly criticizing \nother nations for violating, if I may say, provisions of treaties.\n  This is very simply an attempt on the part of the United States to \nviolate a provision of a treaty. I hope that my colleagues will not \nlead us down this very dangerous path. If we violate, how can we be \ncritical of other nations violating provisions of their treaties? So I \nhope this matter will be settled. And accordingly, if I may, Mr. \nPresident, I move to table the Smith amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is premature while time remains.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I assumed the Senator had finished.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Senator Harkin wishes to speak.\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How many minutes do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, we are not abrogating any \ntreaties with this amendment. How could we abrogate a treaty with an \namendment that simply says: No moneys can be expended by the State \nDepartment Attorney General to go into court opposing our POW cases \nagainst private Japanese companies? That is all we are saying. Again, \nwe have done this time and time and time again in the history of this \ncountry. This is not something new.\n  We have the power to do that. We have the power of the purse strings. \nWe are not abrogating the treaty. We are just saying that the U.S. \nGovernment cannot go into court using taxpayer money to oppose the POWs \nwho are filing these lawsuits.\n  If the court upholds the treaty and says that they cannot get \nanything, that they have already been compensated, well, that's the end \nof it. I guess they can appeal it to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, but if the courts find, as my friend from Hawaii says, that \nthis treaty holds and would be abrogated, and we can't do that, then \nthat is the end of the case, but at least the POWs will have had their \nday in court.\n  That is all we are asking with this amendment. We are not abrogating \nany treaties; we are simply trying to uphold the rule of law and our \nown private citizens' rights.\n  Let's keep in mind whom we are talking about: 30,000 men who served \ntheir country in unbearable conditions in Japanese prisoner-of-war \ncamps. Now we are talking about at least 700 of them--some from my own \nState of Iowa--seeking some long-delayed justice. They have gone to \ncourt to demand compensation from the Japanese companies that used them \nas slave laborers.\n  And who were these companies? Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nippon Steel. These \nare not tiny, little companies that are going to go broke because they \nmight have to pay these people some back wages and compensation for \nwhat they endured during those war years.\n  I think it is unconscionable that our own State Department has \nintervened in the courts to keep them from pressing their case. That is \nnot right. It is not fair.\n  So, No. 1, this amendment does not, in any way, undermine the treaty. \nLet the court decide that. All we are saying is, the State Department \ncannot use our taxpayers' money--the very taxes paid by these former \nPOWs--to go into court to keep them from seeking redress.\n  No. 2, this does not violate a separation of powers. We have, time \nand time again, used the power of the purse strings to say that the \nAttorney General cannot intervene in certain court cases. That is \nnothing new. We have done that before.\n  No. 3, they have said the POWs have already been compensated by the \nUnited States. Well, I talked to three POWs from Iowa who were slave \nlaborers in Japan during the war, and not one of them got paid. So I do \nnot know whom they are talking about, but they did not get a dime.\n  No. 4, it has been said this opens up the United States to lawsuits \nfrom other countries. Again, the United States was known to treat our \nPOWs more decently. Many of the German POWs who worked here in the \ncotton fields were indeed paid for their work when they worked in the \nUnited States as POWs.\n  Again, we can get wrapped up in all these details, but let's keep in \nmind what we are talking about. We are talking about men who survived \non a cup of rice a day. The one person I knew in Iowa, who is still \nalive, went from 160 pounds down to 68 pounds in 3 years working in a \nJapanese auto parts factory and then in the lead mines in Japanese \noccupied territory.\n  Again, these survivors and their families should at least give them \ntheir day in court. That is all we are asking. Mitsubishi, they have a \nlot of money. Nippon Steel, they can hire the best lawyers if they want \nto argue this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe number of former POWs in various States who would be affected by \nthis class action suit: 1,454 in California, 200 in Arizona, 200 in \nColorado, 150 in Georgia, 150 in Illinois--I am not going to read the \nwhole list, but I ask to have that list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   State by State Listing of Survivors and Their Families who Would \n         Benefit or Would Be Affected by the Class Action Suit\n\n       Arizona: 200.\n       California: 1,454\n       Colorado: 200.\n       Georgia: 150.\n       Illinois: 150.\n       Louisiana: 140.\n       Maryland:, 1,154.\n       New York: 240.\n       Virginia: 189.\n       Oregon: 250.\n       Texas: 972.\n       Washington: 350.\n       Wisconsin: 106.\n       Ohio: 100.\n       North Carolina: 100.\n       Pennsylvania: 100.\n       Massachusetts: 100.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, let's keep in mind that all the \nSmith-Harkin amendment says is: Do not use taxpayers' money to have the \nState Department come into court to fight our former POWs who are \nseeking compensation from Japanese companies that never paid them. That \nis all we are asking. If the judge and the Supreme Court of the United \nStates find that they cannot abrogate that treaty, that is the end of \nit, but at least give them their day in court.\n  Let's not turn our backs on them. They suffered long enough. It is \ntime they get their just compensation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, just a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wayne Allard be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The sponsors' time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier this afternoon, it \nwas certain that this debate would become a highly emotional one. A few \nof us were involved in that ancient war, and we know what the Bataan \nDeath March was all about. We do not condone that; we condemn it. We \nare not here to justify or provide a rationale for the actions taken by \nthe Japanese troops; far from it. But we are here to maintain the \nintegrity of our country and our treaties.\n  Yes, we have provided provisions in the appropriations bill stopping \nour Departments from suing on certain issues, but never on a treaty. \nThis one will break a treaty.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will go along in support of \nmy motion to table.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, before the motion is made, \nI have one more unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ben Campbell also be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield back the remainder of our time and move to table \nthe Smith amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. Carnahan), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), the \nSenator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow), and the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Torricelli) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl) and \nthe Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 34, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 276 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--34\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kohl\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--8\n\n     Carnahan\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1538) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise very briefly to give my colleagues some bad news and \nsome good news. The bad news is the house of my colleague, Senator Jean \nCarnahan, was struck by lightening Saturday evening. It suffered \nserious damage from a fire and also from water.\n  I spoke with Senator Carnahan. She is in Rolla, MO. There are about \n30 good friends helping her retrieve her belongings and to work with \ninsurance companies. It is a real mess and she is therefore unable to \nattend this vote.\n  The record should show because of this grave, unfortunate \ncircumstance, she did not vote. The good news is she sounded to be in \ngood spirits, no one was hurt, and she expects to return to this body \nas soon as she can complete arrangements in Rolla. I thank the \nChairman, and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we made some good progress this \nafternoon. Aside from this particular vote, we have three amendments \npending, two by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, on both the aerostat of TV Marti and the Small Business \nAdministration amendment.\n  We have the amendment by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, relative \nto the International Criminal Court. There being no further debate, as \nI understand it, I am waiting to check with the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle on how they intend to continue, but we will meet \nearly in the morning and I am asking all Senators, please, if they have \nany amendments, get ready and let us bring them up and let us see if we \ncan move along like we did today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1536\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to be heard on the Craig amendment, \nunless there is some reason why I cannot. Is that in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized on \nthe Craig amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the President, and I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment offered \nby my good friend from Idaho. I do so because it goes back a long time. \nAs a matter of revealing past history, I take great pride in the fact \nthat the person at whose desk I now stand and in whose chair I now sit \nfrom time to time was the executive trial counsel at the Nuremberg \ntrials. I was about a year old, a year and 2 months old, when my father \nwent off to Nuremberg as a young lawyer and became an executive trial \ncounsel at the end of those historic trials at the end of World War II.\n  I remember vividly growing up with my father and others of his \ngeneration arguing most strongly that had there been in the 1920's or \n1930's criminal courts of international justice the tragedies of World \nWar II might have been avoided.\n  He never said it would have been absolutely because obviously that \nwould be an impossibility to predict, but there was no place, there was \nno forum in which the civilized world could gather, in a sense, to \ndenounce or to indict a madman such as Adolf Hitler.\n  As a result of the world's silence, in many ways, through the 1930's, \nthe events and the tragedies in the latter part of that decade, of \ncourse, the events of the first part of the 1940's occurred. So after \nWorld War II, there were many highly responsible individuals in this \ncountry and elsewhere who argued most strongly for the establishment of \nsuch a court. In fact, it was the United States that led the way to \nestablish a United Nations system. It was the Eisenhower \nadministration.\n  In fact, some of the strongest conservatives of that era argued very \nstrongly that it was in the interest of the United States, in our own \nself-interest, as the leader of free peoples around the globe to have \nsome place where we could indict those who would commit the horrors and \ntragedies of human rights violations.\n  So it is somewhat ironic--in a way sadly so--that we find ourselves \nat the outset of the 21st century with the United States apparently \nleading the charge to see to it that no such organization should ever \ncome into existence.\n  Let me quickly say to my colleagues, I do not at all support the \npresent configuration or proposal on an international criminal court. \nIt is tremendously flawed as a proposal. It is very much in our \ninterest, as a nation, to be at the table to help fashion this court.\n  Ultimately we may vote against it. We may try to see to it that it \ndoes not become established. However, there is a great risk that it \nwill become established. In the absence of our participation, it could \nend up being a lot worse--for us, for men and women in uniform in this \ncountry, for the interests of the United States in an ever-shrinking \nglobal community.\n  I am deeply concerned, as I am now told the administration is as \nwell, with this amendment as presently proposed. As I understand it, \nthe Craig amendment bars the United States from using funds in support \nof the International Criminal Court or to continue to participate in \nmeetings of the Preparatory Commission which is working to finalize \nmatters relating to the Court.\n  I think this is a dangerous amendment in many ways. I have proposed \nlanguage which we have not yet considered in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee dealing with one of the major concerns being raised about the \nestablishment of a criminal court; that is, the vulnerabilities of our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  The legislation that I have drafted is gathering wide-range support. \nThe administration itself finds an awful lot included in the bill that \nthey would like to support. We are working with them to fashion \nsomething to meet their support.\n  The adoption of this amendment, however, is a major setback, in my \nview, in this effort. As currently drafted, the Craig amendment \nforecloses one of the options the Bush administration is currently \nreviewing with respect to how to remain actively engaged \ninternationally in support of the rule of law.\n  It is my understanding that the Bush administration strongly opposes, \nin fact, what our good friend and colleague from Idaho is suggesting \nwith this amendment. Under existing law, the administration is \ncurrently prohibited from expending funds in support of the Court. That \nis the law today. That was adopted in 1999. The law has left the door \nopen for the Bush administration to determine whether or not it wishes \nto participate in the work of the Preparatory Commission. It makes all \nthe sense in the world to be so involved. The structure of the \nPreparatory Commission is such that it is\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\ncharged with finalizing the details of the implementing language of the \nCourt in resolving outstanding definitions, ambiguities, and \ndifficulties with the Rome statute.\n  The Craig amendment closes the door with respect to the possibility \nof U.S. participation in the Preparatory Commission. This, in my view, \nis very shortsighted since there are a number of issues which we would \nwant to and should work to resolve or clarify, even if we never decide \nto become a party to the treaty.\n  Clearly, I am hopeful President Bush will choose to stay part of the \nPreparatory Commission process, but the decision as to whether or not \nto do so is up to him, not up to the Congress. Frankly, to prohibit the \nPresident from participating in the Preparatory Commission is probably \na violation of the President's constitutional treaty power to conduct \nnegotiations with other states on behalf of our own Nation. Moreover, I \nthink this amendment sends a terrible signal just as the international \ncommunity gathers in New York to listen to President Bush address the \nUnited Nations for the first time since coming to office. What message \nwill they derive from yet another U.S. unilateral rejection of \ninternationalism? Perhaps they will take it as a signal that we in the \nUnited States no longer intend to be leaders in the international \nadvocacy of the rule of law and human rights.\n\n  How ironic, how truly ironic that is. How quickly we seem to have \nforgotten the Holocaust and the international community's decision to \nconvene the Nuremburg trial of the leading Nazi war criminals following \nWorld War II, or that this war crimes tribunal was largely an American \ninitiative. Justice Robert Jackson's team drove the process of the \ndrafting of the indictments, the gathering of the evidence, and the \nconducting of that extraordinary trial. The trial was a landmark in the \nstruggle to deter and punish crimes of war and genocide, setting the \nstage for the Geneva and Genocide Conventions.\n  The surrender of Slobodan Milosevic to the International Criminal \nTribunal for Yugoslavia is a strong reminder that war crimes are not a \nthing of the distant past. At Nuremberg Justice Jackson said: It is \ncommon to think of our own time as standing at the apex of \ncivilization. The reality is that in the long perspective of history, \nthe present century will not hold an admirable position, unless its \nsecond half is to redeem its first.\n  My father, Thomas Dodd, served as executive trial counsel at the \ntrials at Nuremberg, among his proudest accomplishments as a human \nbeing. But it was also part of the common theme that rang through a \nlifetime of public service. He believed that America had a special role \nto make the rule of law relevant in every corner of the globe. I \nbelieve my father was correct, that Justice Jackson was correct, and \nthose who came after that generation, the reason they fought so hard at \nthe trials and subsequently was that they believed that had there been \na forum, a place for the rule of law where natural law could reside, we \nmight very well have avoided the Holocaust and other such events that \ngripped the midpart of the 20th century.\n  I believe my father would have endorsed President Clinton's decision \nto sign the Rome statute last December on behalf of the United States. \nPresident Clinton did so, knowing full well much of the work remained \nto be done before the United States would ever become a party to the \nU.N. convention establishing an international criminal court.\n  The Bush administration is currently reviewing its options with \nrespect to the Rome statute and with respect to the ongoing preparatory \nwork that will make the Court operational only once 60 parties have \nratified it. If the Craig amendment is adopted, it will foreclose the \nBush administration from opting to stay engaged as a participant in the \nwork of the Preparatory Commission in order to protect U.S. interests \nand interact with friends and allies on these matters.\n  Let there be no doubt; at some date in the future an international \ncriminal court will come into existence; 36 states have already \nratified the treaty, including all members of the European Community. \nFor the United States to be totally on the sidelines as the last \ndetails of procedures are hashed out is clearly contrary to our \nnational self-interests. There may also be times when, on a case-by-\ncase basis, the United States may want to assist in the prosecution of \nforeign war criminals, particularly those cases where the crimes are \nagainst American citizens.\n  We just debated, ironically, a proposal dealing with the war crimes \nof World War II. I think but for the treaty of San Francisco, it would \nhave been adopted 100 to 0. As related in the persuasive arguments of \nDan Inouye and others, we believe treaties are important and should not \nbe violated. How ironic that we find ourselves in this particular \nmatter, depriving ourselves of the opportunity to be able to fight hard \nwhere war crimes are committed, and, in fact, U.S. citizens may be the \nvictims because we will not allow the option to be involved in the \nPreparatory Commission of such a court.\n\n  Elie Wiesel has warned that legislation of this kind would erase \nAmerica's Nuremberg legacy by ensuring that the United States will \nnever again join the community of nations to hold accountable those who \ncommit war crimes and genocide. A vote to shut the door forever on the \nInternational Criminal Court and bar the United States from being \nengaged, ironically, may be read by some as a signal that the United \nStates accepts immunity from the world's worst atrocities. What a \nterrible possibility.\n  It is a sad day, as we embark on the 21st century, that the U.S. \nSenate, the great bastion of debate on international matters of such \nimportance and weight, might vote to deprive us of even being involved \nin the Preparatory Commission considering an international court of \ncriminal justice where human rights and genocide matters can be \ndebated, where those who commit those crimes can be brought to the bar \nof justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to think more carefully about this vote. I \naccept there are problems with the Rome treaty as currently written. I \nwould not support it. If the Rome treaty came to this Chamber as \nwritten, I would vote against it. But that is not the case. There is \nwork to be done. We ought to be engaged in that work. That is why I \nintroduced legislation before the August recess to protect U.S. \ninterests until we can successfully work out our differences on this \nissue.\n  I hope the Foreign Relations Committee will hold hearings on this \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  This bill, the American Citizens Protection and War Criminal \nProsecution Act of 2001--the American Citizens Protection Act, would \nboth protect America's Nuremberg legacy while at the same time \nsafeguarding the rights of American citizens who might be brought \nbefore foreign tribunals even if we are not a party to them. This bill \ncalls for active U.S. diplomatic efforts to ensure that the ICC \nfunctions properly mandates the assertion of U.S. jurisdiction over \nAmerican citizens and bars the surrender of U.S. citizens to the ICC \nonce the U.S. has acted.\n  The Bush administration is currently studying this and other \napproaches to issues related to the ICC. We should permit that review \nto continue and give the President the flexibility to decide how best \nto serve U.S. interests in this important area.\n  The world is a global village in this new millennium. The U.S. must \nstrike the right balance between protecting our citizens and our men \nand women in the armed forces who may be traveling or deployed abroad, \nand preserving United States leadership and advocacy of universal \nadherence to principles of international justice and the rule of law.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the Craig amendment \nand let existing law stand with respect to limitations on funding in \nsupport of the ICC at this time.\n  This is no time for us to be walking away from a responsibility which \nwe have shouldered proudly for the past half century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of our \ncolleague, Senator Craig of Idaho, of which I am a cosponsor. I \nlistened very\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\ncarefully to the eloquent words of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, and his arguments in opposition to this amendment. In my view, \nthe proposed International Criminal Court is a threat to the \nsovereignty of the United States and our individual God-given rights \nthat are protected in the Constitution of the United States and in the \nconstitutions and laws of several states. President Clinton, in my \nview, made a serious mistake when he signed the Rome treaty in the \nwaning days of his administration. That treaty, which would establish a \npermanent international criminal court, creates a number of \nundesirable, unprecedented challenges for the people of the United \nStates. The ICC will have the power to investigate and prosecute a \nseries of international criminal offenses such as crimes against \nhumanity, heretofore enforceable only in national courts or tribunals \nof limited application which have broad international support, such as \nthe Nuremberg trials, which Senator Dodd brought up.\n  Obviously, everyone here thinks the Nazis should be prosecuted.\n  We do support, obviously, the tribunal that is trying Milosevic right \nat this moment. The International Court in The Hague is the proper \napproach, which does not impinge upon our sovereignty.\n  Senator Dodd, in arguing against this amendment, did mention he would \noppose the Rome treaty as written if we were going to be voting on it \nat this moment. But if the Senate were to ratify this ill-advised \ntreaty, this International Criminal Court would have the authority to \ntry to punish Americans for alleged offenses abroad or in the United \nStates, and that Court will be entirely unaccountable for its actions.\n\n  This International Criminal Court, in fact, would be in a position to \npunish individual American officials for the foreign policy and \nmilitary actions of the United States and would not offer even minimum \nguarantees afforded in the Bill of Rights to any defendants before it.\n  At the heart of the ICC is an independent prosecutor accountable to \nno one. The international prosecutor is empowered to enforce justice as \nthat prosecutor sees fit. If the international prosecutor believes that \na local trial in our U.S. courts has been inadequate, he or she is \nauthorized to indict an alleged human rights abuser and demand a new \ninternational trial. The international prosecutor may think a local \npardon or an amnesty or a finding of not guilty was improper. That \ninternational prosecutor can ignore that finding.\n  What this authority symbolizes is the theory that all nations, \nincluding constitutional democracies, should surrender their \nsovereignty to the altar of international control.\n  Control of our own courts is one of our most cherished internal \ndecisions about justice and order in our civilization. The United \nStates was founded on the basic principle that the people of the States \nand our country have the right to govern themselves and chart their own \ncourse. The elected officials in the United States, as well as our \nmilitary and citizenry at large, are ultimately responsible to the \nlegal and political institutions established by our Federal and State \nconstitutions, which reflect the values and the sovereignty of the \nAmerican people.\n  The Rome treaty would erect an institution in the form of the ICC \nthat would claim authority superior to that of the Federal Government \nand the States and superior to the American voters themselves. This \nCourt would assert the ultimate authority to determine whether the \nelected officials of the United States as well as any other American \ncitizen have acted unlawfully on any particular occasion.\n  In this, the Rome treaty is fundamentally inconsistent with the first \ntenet of our American Republic, that anyone who exercises power must be \nresponsible for its use to those subject to that power. In our country, \nthe Government derives its just powers from the consent of the people. \nThat is foundational and fundamental.\n  The values of the ICC's prosecutor and judges are unlikely to be the \nsame values of those of the United States. The Rome treaty has been \nembraced by many nations with legal and political traditions \ndramatically different from those of our own. This includes such states \nas Cambodia, Iran, Haiti, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, all of \nwhich have been implicated in torture or extrajudicial killings or \nboth.\n  Even our closest allies, including European states following the \ncivil law system, begin with a very different assumption about the \npowers of courts and the rights of the accused. Nevertheless, if it is \npermitted to be established, the ICC will claim the power to try \nindividual Americans, including U.S. service personnel and officials \nacting fully in accordance with U.S. law and our interests. The Court \nitself would be the final arbiter of its own power, and there would be \nno appeal from its decisions.\n  In 1791, Thomas Jefferson, our country's first Secretary of State, \nsaid:\n\n       No court can have jurisdiction over a sovereign nation.\n\n  Last year this Congress prohibited the use of taxpayers' money to \nsupport the International Criminal Court. I say, let's put another lock \non that door by adopting this amendment, the Craig amendment, and let's \nput a lock on the door to the Preparatory Commission as well.\n  In closing, I quote again from Mr. Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       It is the right of every nation to prohibit acts of \n     sovereignty from being exercised by any other within its \n     limits.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in exercising this right and \nsupporting this amendment to protect the sovereignty of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition \nto the Craig amendment to the International Criminal Court (ICC). While \nI have great respect for the Senator from Idaho, I believe it is \nunnecessary, damaging to the cause of international justice, and would \nfurther erode our standing with our European allies.\n  Even the Bush administration, which has no intention of sending the \nRome treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent, opposes the Craig \namendment.\n  Since the Rome treaty was approved over two years ago, it has been \nsigned by more than 120 nations including all of the European Union \nmembers, all of our NATO allies except Turkey, as well as Israel, and \nRussia.\n  Joining our friends and allies, President Clinton signed the Rome \ntreaty late last year, a decision which I wholeheartedly supported, as \nthe ICC represents a significant step forward in bringing to justice \nthose responsible for committing the most heinous crimes.\n  Throughout the negotiations on the ICC, the United States got almost \neverything it wanted and was able to obtain important safeguards to \nprevent American soldiers from being subjected to politically-motivated \nactions by the Court.\n  There is room for improving the treaty, and that is precisely why I \noppose the Craig amendment. The Craig amendment would prevent our \ndiplomats from being at the table during the ongoing Preparatory \nCommissions on the ICC.\n  While this may make some feel good, the practical effect would be \nself-defeating. It would put us in a far worse position to advance U.S. \ninterests within the ICC and obtain additional protections, ensure that \nthe safeguards we already obtained operate effectively, and make sure \nthat the Court serves its intended purpose of prosecuting crimes \nagainst humanity.\n  I do support the International Criminal Court. But, again, this vote \nis not about whether you support it or not. We already have a \nprohibition against the expenditure of U.S. funds for the ``use by or \nsupport of'' the ICC, unless the U.S. ratifies the treaty, which it is \nnot going to do any time soon.\n  The issue is whether we will participate in discussions on the \nprocedures of the court, or whether we are going to tie the hands of \nthe administration by preventing the United States from even sitting at \nthe table.\n  And, both the Clinton and Bush administrations have stated that they \nwould not submit the Treaty to the Senate for consideration.\n\n  While some may want to ``block'' the treaty, this is very unlikely to \nbe possible. The EU is already engaged in a campaign to obtain the \nratifications that are needed to reach the required number of 60.\n  Blocking the International Criminal Court from coming into existence \nis likely to require a head-to-head confrontation with our European \nallies\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nand over 80 countries outside of Europe that have signed the Treaty but \nnot yet ratified.\n  Because the reality is that the Court will come into existence and \nhave jurisdiction over non-parties, our best strategy is to remain \nengaged with the ICC to shape a Court that best represents our \ninterests and values.\n  Irrespective of one's views on the ICC, it makes no sense to bury our \nheads in the sand and hope for the best. That is precisely what the \nCraig amendment will do and one of the major reasons why I strongly \noppose it.\n  The other reason that I oppose the Craig amendment is the long-term \nharm that it could have on U.S. efforts to prosecute war criminals. \nYear after year, Senator McConnell and myself, alternating as chairman \nand ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, have \nstruggled to find enough money to help support the efforts of the \ninternational tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra \nLeone.\n  Moreover, we may now be asked to contribute millions of dollars to \nsupport a tribunal to prosecute crimes of genocide by the Khmer Rouge \nin Cambodia, if the tribunal there meets international standards of \njustice.\n  The negotiations on these tribunals often takes years and involves \nendless wrangling over costs, over the laws and rules that will be \napplied to the proceedings, and over whether to even establish an ad \nhoc tribunal in the first place.\n  One of the primary goals of the ICC is to have a permanent forum to \nprosecute these heinous crimes wherever they may occur, and our allies \nhave embraced the ICC for precisely this reason.\n  Once the ICC comes into existence, and our allies and the Security \nCouncil will no longer support establishing new ad hoc tribunals--which \nat that point could be unnecessary and duplicative--what will the \nUnited States do?\n  No longer help with the prosecution of war criminals, because we do \nnot support the ICC? That would be ridiculous for a country whose Bill \nof Rights is a beacon of hope for victims of human rights abuses around \nthe world.\n  Clearly, we all want to protect U.S. interests within the ICC. This \namendment does not do that. In fact, it makes things worse by not even \nallowing our negotiators to be in the room while important issues are \nbeing discussed and could ultimately hinder our efforts to prosecute \nwar criminals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I checked with several Senators interested in this \namendment as well as its proponent, Senator Craig. If there is no other \nquestion, we need to move these amendments along as best we can.\n  I think we are ready for a voice vote.\n  I urge the question on the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment in the second degree.\n  The amendment (No. 1537) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I urge the question on the underlying \namendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment, as amended.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated on the amendment in the first degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1536), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair, and thank my \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Virginia.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1215, the Department of Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $38.627 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $26.026 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $38.747 billion in \n2002. The Senate bill is within its Section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and outlays. Once again, the committee has met its \ntarget without the use of any emergency designations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenators Hollings and Gregg, for their bipartisan effort in moving this \nand other appropriations bills quickly to make up for the late start in \nthis year's appropriations process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committees \nscoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  S. 1215, DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATION, 2002\n                      [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             General\n                                                             purpose  Defense  Conservation  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority........................................   37,772       604        251          572    39,199\n  Outlays.................................................   37,885       660        202          581    39,328\nSenate 302(b) allocation:*\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority........................................   37,534       567        440          572    39,113\n  Outlays.................................................   37,913       632        360          581    39,486\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority........................................   37,178       465        284          572    38,499\n  Outlays.................................................   38,016       538        259          581    39,394\n \n             SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:*\n  Budget Authority........................................        0         0       (133)           0      (133)\n  Outlays.................................................        0         0          0            0         0\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority........................................      238        37       (189)           0        86\n  Outlays.................................................

Mr. President, I would like to briefly mention to Senator \nHollings an EDA project that is of significant importance to employment \nin a section of New Hampshire that has traditionally experienced high \nlevels of unemployment. The project is the Mountain View House. This \nproject was inadvertently left out of the Senate Report, but it would \nbe my hope that the Economic Development Administration would consider \nan application for the Mountain View House within applicable procedures \nand guidelines\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nand provide a grant if warranted. Will you join with me in urging the \nEDA to consider this vital initiative in New Hampshire?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would certainly join with the Senator from New \nHampshire in recognizing and supporting the Mountain View House \nproject. I will work with my colleague during conference to include \nthis project in the committee report.\n\n\n                   INS Inspectors at Port of Detroit\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman for \naddressing in this bill the severe INS staffing shortages at certain \nland border ports of entry. I would also like to thank him for \nrecognizing and addressing the severe shortage of INS inspectors at \nDetroit's port of entry on the U.S.-Canadian border, which includes the \nAmbassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. I am pleased this \nbill provides $25,408,000 for 348 additional land border inspectors and \nspecifically indentifies the Detroit bridge and tunnel port of entry as \nbeing understaffed by a whopping 151 people. I appreciate the efforts \nof this Committee to address the significant INS staffing shortages on \nthe Detroit-Canadian border and that a portion of the increase in INS \ninspectors funded by this bill will be allocated to address the Detroit \nshortfall.\n  I wish to seek clarification from the chairman of the Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations Subcommittee as to whether a significant \nportion of the funding provided for additional INS inspectors by this \nbill will be allocated to address the Detroit shortfall. The Ambassador \nBridge is the most heavily traveled bridge and the most heavily \ntraveled tunnel on the U.S.-Canadian border. Total traffic at the \nbridge has nearly doubled over the past 14 years. According to data \ncompiled by the Bridge and Tunnel Operator's Association, in 1999 more \nthan 12,000,000 auto and commercial vehicles crossed the Ambassador \nBridge and more than 9,500,000 auto and commercial vehicles passed \nthrough the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I too would like to express my thanks to \nthe distinguished chairman for increasing INS staffing levels to \naddress the past under funding of land border inspectors, and to also \nseek clarification concerning the Detroit Port of Entry. The committee \nnotes that the Detroit Port of Entry, which includes the Ambassador \nBridge and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, requires a total of 175 \npersonnel yet is currently staffed at only 23 inspectors. That leaves \nthe port understaffed by 151 inspectors, the third worst staffing level \nat a U.S. port of entry as a percentage of total workload. This is a \nserious concern, particularly because the Detroit Port is the nation's \nbusiest northern border crossing, and has resulted in unnecessary \ntraffic congestion and delays. I appreciate the committee having \nrecognizing the Port of Detroit as one of the nation's ports of entry \nmost in need of these additional inspectors and look forward to more \nefficient INS inspections at the Detroit-Canada border once these \nadditional inspectors are in place. Is it the intent of the chairman, \nthat a significant number of these additional INS inspectors would go \nto the Detroit Port of Entry?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senators from Michigan are correct. \nThis committee recognizes the problems faced at the Port of Detroit and \nits shortfall of 151 INS land border inspectors, and it is the \ncommittee's intent that a significant number of these additional INS \ninspectors funded in our bill will help fill that shortfall.\n\n\n                    CLEARMADD, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I have previously brought to your \nattention the important capabilities of the Center for Leadership in \nEducation and Applied Research in Mass Destruction Defense (CLEARMADD). \nThis Center, to be supported by a consortium of institutions including \nthe University of Georgia, the Medical College of Georgia, and the \nSavannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina, has available \nsubstantial expertise regarding the threat posed domestically from \nweapons of mass destruction (WMD). In recent years, concerns have \nincreased about the potential for terrorists or foreign states to use \nbiological, nuclear or chemical weapons to inflict mass casualties in \nthe United States. As a nation, we are only just beginning to develop \nan adequate response capability for such an attack. The consequences of \nthe use of WMD in the United States would be catastrophic, particularly \nin terms of the ability of our health care system to respond. While \nother programs have focused on research and training to assist first \nresponders in the event of a WMD, very little has been done to develop \nproper curriculum and training, including advanced degrees, for medical \nresponders including doctors, nurses, emergency room personnel, \npharmacists, toxicologists, and veterinarians. The experts assembled \nwith CLEARMADD have significant capability to provide such curriculum \ndevelopment and training for these so-called second responders.\n  I understand that a total of $364 million is included in the Senate \nversion of the Fiscal Year 2002 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill for the Office of State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support \n(OSLDPS) of the Department of Justice to assist with training in the \nU.S. to respond to potential terrorist attacks. This is an increase of \nmore than $100 million over funding for Fiscal Year 2001. It is my view \nthat the programs and expertise of CLEARMADD fit well within the OSLDPS \nmission and I believe funds should be found within the Fiscal Year 2002 \nbudget of OSLDPS to take advantage of CLEARMADD's expertise to help \ndevelop model curricula and training programs to assist local health \ncare professionals.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, \nbringing CLEARMADD to my attention. There is a significant need for \ntraining of health professionals in the event of a chemical or \nbiological attack. From what I have learned, CLEARMADD has significant \ncapabilities in this regard, and is clearly a program that could \nprovide significant assistance in helping achieve the mission of the \nOLSDPS. I will continue to work with Senator Cleland to see that the \nDepartment of Justice takes advantage of the expertise within the \nCLEARMADD consortium and finds ways to include CLEARMADD within the \noverall programs of the DOJ anti-terrorism program.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator for his support and attention to \nthis matter and I look forward to working with you in the future on \nthis issue of mutual interest.\n\n\n         hartsfield Atlanta international airport ins officers\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, we have discussed on previous occasions \nthe compelling need for additional Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS) officers assigned to Hartsfield Atlanta International \nAirport. The present staffing of 78 positions to handle 2.8 million \narriving international passengers per year at Hartsfield is \nconsistently generating extremely long lines, and is damaging the \nreputation of Hartsfield as an international gateway. The desired INS \n45-minute processing time limit is being exceeded frequently with lines \noverflowing the inspection hall into the adjoining concourse. The 95 \npassengers per inspector during peak periods do not match the annual \ngrowth rate of 16 percent. As a result of the 1996 Olympics Games, \nHartsfield has more than an adequate number of processing booths. Yet, \ntoday, at least 75 percent of those booths go unused on any given day. \nHartsfield now has more arriving international passengers from Latin \nAmerica and Africa, who require longer processing times, than from \nEurope. Overall, the airport has experienced a 108 percent increase in \ninternational flight arrivals from 1994 to 2000.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Georgia \nbrought this matter to my attention. In fact, the fiscal year 2002 \nCommerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill includes 348 additional \ninspectors for the Nation's newest and busiest airports. These \ninspectors will help alleviate the long lines at several airports, \nincluding airports in the Southeast which have experienced tremendous \ngrowth over the last few years. The airports in my own home state of \nSouth Carolina illustrate this need as airlines and increasing numbers \nof passengers require more flights with fewer delays.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I applaud the chairman's decision to boost the number of \nINS inspectors for this next fiscal year. I would like to bring to the \nSenator's attention that of the 150 new INS inspectors placed at \nvarious points of\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\nentry last year, Hartsfield received no new positions. There are other \nnotable disparities. For example, Atlanta conducts 70 percent more \ninspections than Boston, but has only 30 percent more inspectors. The \nnumber of passengers processed annually per inspector in Atlanta is \n35,782. In comparison, Miami has a higher ratio of inspectors per \npassenger than Atlanta, and, as a consequence, the average inspector in \nMiami processes 10,000 fewer passengers each year. Honolulu inspects \nless passengers than does Atlanta, but has twice as many inspectors. \nAnd because Hartsfield generates between $18 million and $19 million in \nuser fees each year with less than $8 million spent at Hartsfield there \nis concern that the Atlanta Airport is subsidizing inspections at other \nairports in the Nation.\n   In addition, the airlines serving Hartsfield are planning major \nexpansions in their international service. Furthermore, recent census \ndata reflects tremendous population growth in metro Atlanta over the \npast 10 years. This dynamic population increase, second only to that of \nNew York, will cause ever greater demand for international travel. \nGiven the time it takes to hire and train new inspectors, it is \ncritical that INS address the shortfall at Hartsfield now, or we will \nlose our ability to attract international passengers, and the economic \ndevelopment of the region will suffer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I am very aware \nof the increase in the number of flight delays at the Nation's \nairports. We have held numerous hearings on the increase in domestic \nand foreign travel and it is clear that additional INS agents are \nneeded at the Nation's busiest airports. United States airports have \nexperienced significant growth over the last several years and \nadditional INS agents are needed to address the increased demand not \nonly at the Atlanta airport but throughout the Nation's airports, \nincluding in my home State of South Carolina. I will continue to work \nwith Senator Cleland to ensure that the nation's business airports, \nHartsfield Atlanta International Airport, receive the additional INS \nagents that it needs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank you for your support and \nattention to this matter and I look forward to working with you in the \nfuture on this issue of national importance.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS.

Mr. President, on March 26, 2001, my friend Senator \nKennedy and I introduced S. 783, the Crime Victims Assistance Act of \n2001. This legislation represents the next step in our continuing \nefforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime. Among \nother things, it would enhance the rights and protections afforded to \nvictims of Federal crime, establish innovative new programs to help \npromote compliance with State victim's rights laws, and vastly improve \nthe manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved.\n  Senator Kennedy and I first introduced the Crime Victims Assistance \nAct in the 105th Congress, and we reintroduced it in the 106th \nCongress. Like many other deserving initiatives, however, this much-\nneeded legislation took a back seat to the debate over a proposed \nvictims' rights constitutional amendment. I have on several occasions \nnoted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making \nby focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. \nRegretfully, I must note again that the pace of victims legislation has \nslowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been \nsquandered.\n  This year, we have a golden opportunity to make significant progress \ntoward providing the greater voice and rights that crime victims \ndeserve. The Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001 enjoys broad support \nfrom victims groups across the country, including the National Center \nfor Victims of Crime, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, \nand the National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards. \nRegardless of their views on the proposed constitutional amendment, \nthese organizations recognize that our legislation can make a \ndifference in the lives of crime victims right now.\n  When I spoke about the Crime Victims Assistance Act earlier in the \nyear, I expressed the hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters \nand opponents of a constitutional amendment, would join me in advancing \nthis bill through Congress. This should be a bipartisan effort, and in \nthis closely divided Senate, it must be a bipartisan effort. I want to \nthank our eight Democratic cosponsors: Senators Corzine, Daschle, \nFeingold, Harkin, Johnson, Kerry, Murray, and Schumer. And I want once \nagain to urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to step up to \nthe plate and support this important victims' legislation.\n  When it comes to recognizing the rights of victims of crime, there is \nno majority, no minority, and no middle ground. As Americans, we share \nthe common desire to help victims and provide them the greater voice \nand rights that they deserve. The Crime Victims Assistance Act proposes \nsome basic, common-sense reforms to our federal crime victims laws, and \nwould help provide the resources necessary to assist the states in \ngiving force to their own locally-tailored statutes and constitutional \nprovisions. What a shame if this legislation stalls again this year, \nbecause we could not work together on an issue on which we share so \nmuch common ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9246-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9246-S9247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is important to state my \nreasons for voting against S. 149, the Export Administration Act. I do \nso because I think there is too much deference to commercial interests \nat the expense of limiting exports which may threaten national \nsecurity.\n  I cast my vote late in the rollcall when there were 77 votes in favor \nof the bill, which eventually turned out to be an 85 to 14 vote, so \nthat I knew the bill was going to pass by overwhelming numbers.\n  Legislation on this subject is of great importance and is long \noverdue. I was tempted to vote in favor of the bill on the proposition \nthat the best frequently is the enemy of the good. Had my vote been \ndecisive so that it might have been a matter of having a bill which \nvastly improved the current situation, which is the absence of \nlegislation, then I might have voted differently. I think the number of \nnegative votes are important as a protest signal that this subject \nshould be monitored closely and perhaps reviewed sooner rather than \nlater.\n  For example, my concerns about the elevation of commercial interests \nover potential national security risks are illustrated by the foreign \navailability and mass market status this Act provides controlled items. \nThe foreign availability component of the act would make the U.S. \nGovernment unable to control the sale of items that are also \nmanufactured by other countries. Such lack of control would allow U.S. \nfirms to sell anthrax to Saddam Hussein because of anthrax's dual-use \nin vaccine production. Additionally, the mass-market status in this \nbill would enable export of controlled items without a license if the \nitem were mass produced for different industrial uses. An example of \nthis mass-market status would be glass and carbon fibers that can be \nused in the manufacture of both golf clubs and also ballistic missiles.\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\n  These are only illustrations of problems which, I believe, should yet \nbe corrected in conference or in later legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am very pleased that S. 149, the Export Administration \nAct of 2001, passed the U.S. Senate by such an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 85-14. This important law reforms our export controls of dual-\nuse items to reflect the vast geopolitical, technological and \ncommercial changes that have occurred since the old law was enacted \nback in 1979. While we must remain ever-vigilant to protect our nation \nfrom security threats, we must at the same time recognize that our \nsecurity depends in large measure on a vibrant economy, and in \nparticular on our ability to continue innovating in the high technology \nsector. Ensuring that American producers have the ability to \nparticipate in the global marketplace is critical to this effort.\n  The hard work that contributed to the overwhelming support for S. 149 \ncannot be overstated, and I was especially gratified by the spirit of \ncooperation that dominated the discussion. This bill, and the quality \nof its provisions, owe a great deal to the thoughtful participation of \na variety of players on both sides of the aisle. In some cases, too \nmany cooks spoil the broth. In this case, however, a variety of players \nmade very thoughtful improvements to the bill. I extend my thanks and \ngratitude to the core group of sponsors, which included Senator Mike \nEnzi, Republican of Wyoming, Chairman Paul Sarbanes from Maryland, \nSenator Phil Gramm from Texas, and also to so many others contributed \nto an improved final product.\n  In particular, I would be remiss in not mentioning the important and \ndedicated efforts of Senator Mark Dayton, my Democratic colleague from \nMinnesota. Senator Dayton and his staff worked tirelessly to ensure \nthat S. 149 protects the interests of the agricultural community \nrelative to export controls. While there are many legitimate reasons to \nrestrict the export of certain items abroad, especially where the \nexport of such items could pose a threat to America's national \nsecurity, there is to my mind absolutely no acceptable logic for \nimposing restrictions on the export of food.\n  The export of food can never pose a national security threat to this \nNation, and Senator Dayton, along with his Republican colleague from \nKansas Senator Pat Roberts, put together an amendment that eliminated \nthe possibility that this government ever restrict the export of food \nfor a purported national security threat. I look forward to continuing \nto work with Senator Dayton on agricultural issues, and I know that the \nfarm community is grateful to the Senator for his work in this area. I \nalso wish to commend Senator Dayton's staff, in particular Jack \nDanielson, Sarah Dahlin and Lani Kawamura.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a consensus emerged during the 1990s with \nregard to the national security of the United States. That consensus \nwas and remains that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--\nnuclear, chemical and biological--and their means of delivery \nconstitute the most important threat to our national security. There is \nalso widespread acknowledgment that a number of rogue nations, and \nparticularly China, represent the new national security challenge for \nthe United States.\n  Yet, this body, the U.S. Senate, is about to pass with overwhelming \nsupport a major piece of legislation that stands in direct \ncontradiction to the objectives of U.S. national security policy--to \nlimit the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery.\n  This is not hyperbole; it is a simple statement of fact. I \nacknowledge that the administration has endorsed S. 149. A campaign \npledge has been kept. But the long-term ramifications of the vote we \nare about to take should not be underestimated. S. 149 received the \nstrong opposition of the former chairmen, now ranking members, of each \ncommittee and subcommittee with responsibility for national security. \nIt can in no way be considered to represent a prudent balance between \ncommerce and national security. It is, in fact, heavily weighted in \nfavor of the former, with scant regard for the latter.\n  The list of exports with which we have traditionally been concerned, \nthe Commerce Control List, has 2,400 items on it. It is important to \nnote that exports of these items are licensed, not prohibited. Contrary \nto the rhetoric of some, it also is not the shopping list of someone \nmaking a Sunday trip to Radio Shack. It is, rather, a compilation of \nesoteric items that have military applications, including for the \nconstruction of nuclear weapons and ballistic and cruise missiles. The \namount of commerce at issue is minuscule relative both to the amount of \nU.S. exports and to the size of the gross domestic product. \nRestrictions or limitations on the export of items on the Commerce \nControl List do not now, nor have they ever had a deleterious effect on \nthe U.S. economy, or on U.S. competitiveness. They do, however, \nrepresent the regulatory manifestation of our national security \nrequirements and the role our moral values should play in the conduct \nof foreign and trade policies.\n  Some of us who oppose this bill support permanent normal trade \nrelations with China. And, yet, we oppose this bill. We oppose it \nbecause it will, by design, open the door to the export without \ngovernment oversight of the very items and technologies that contribute \nto the threats to our security that justifies a defense budget of over \n$300 billion per year. When we debate national missile defense over the \nmonths ahead, we should not hesitate to reflect on the connection \nbetween what we do here today, and what those of us who support missile \ndefenses hope to do tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9247-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NICS--KEEPING GUNS OUT OF CRIMINAL HANDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Brady law mandated the establishment of \nthe National Instant Criminal Background Check System to allow \nfederally licensed gun sellers to establish whether a prospective gun \nbuyer is disqualified from purchasing a firearm. The NICS system is \nworking. In its first 25 months of operation, more than 156,000 felons, \nfugitives and others not eligible to purchase a gun have attempted to \ndo so and have been denied by an FBI NICS check. At the same time, NICS \nhas not placed unreasonable constraints on law abiding citizens' \nability to buy a gun. In fact, the Department of Justice reports that \nmore than 7 out of 10 NICS background checks are completed immediately \nand 95 percent are completed within 2 hours.\n  But I'm concerned that recent action by Attorney General Ashcroft \ncould limit the effectiveness of NICS and hamper law enforcement \nefforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Regulations issued \nin January allowed the FBI to keep NICS data for 90 days following a \ncheck. The 90-day period is critical to law enforcement's ability to \naudit the NICS system for errors, search for patterns of illegal or \nfalse sales, such as purchasers using fake ID's, and screen for gun \ndealers who may abuse the system. But in June, the Attorney General \nannounced plans to reduce the length of time that law enforcement \nagencies can retain NICS data to 24 hours. The 24-hour period is \ninsufficient and would severely restrain law enforcement's ability to \ntarget illegal purchasers and corrupt gun sellers.\n  After reviewing Attorney General Ashcroft's action, I decided to \ncosponsor S. 1253, a bill introduced by Senators Kennedy and Schumer to \nmaintain the 90-day period for law enforcement to retain NICS data. The \nbill takes a common sense approach to keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals without compromising the privacy rights of law-abiding \ncitizens. It is a good bill and the right remedy to the Attorney \nGeneral's regrettable action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9247-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9247-S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the people \nof East Timor on the success of their recent Constituent Assembly \nelections.\n  On August 30, 2001, the people of East Timor voted to elect a new \nConstituent Assembly. That Assembly will begin meeting almost \nimmediately to adopt a new constitution and to establish the framework \nfor future elections and a transition to full independence next year. \nThe vote was conducted on the second anniversary of the violent 1999 \nindependence referendum. In that earlier referendum, nearly 98 percent \nof eligible voters risked their lives to vote for independence from \nIndonesia. Last week, the people of East Timor demonstrated their \ncontinuing commitment to democracy by turning out again in force to \nelect the women and men who will lead them now to full democracy and \nindependence. Final voter turnout in this recent election was reported \nat more than 91 percent, in a territory-wide poll that was both \npeaceful and orderly.\n  After 25 years of occupation by Indonesia, and a much longer period \nof colonization by Portugal, many ordinary men and women walked for \nhours and lined up before dawn to vote for the first time for their own \npolitical leaders. Clearly, many difficult decisions and fractious \ndebates now lie ahead for the 24 women and 64 men who have been \nentrusted by their election to the Constituent Assembly to establish a \nsound legal framework for independent governance. It is my fervent hope \nthat the same spirit of civic participation and tolerance that guided \nthis most recent election will continue to guide the elected \nrepresentatives of the Constituent Assembly as they establish a new \ndemocratic system to promote the cause of peace, independence, and \nprosperity in East Timor.\n  The United Nations must also be credited for organizing a successful \nelection and establishing a firm foundation for future independent \ngovernance. As U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has noted, it is in \nmany respects the conviction with which the people of East Timor have \nembraced democracy that continues to strengthen the commitment of the \nworld community to their cause. I commend the United Nations \nAdministration in East Timor, UNTEAT, for their dedication in \nimplementing this important mission and for their success in organizing \nthis recent election.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9248-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the Congress of the United \nStates recognizes with extreme pleasure the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps \non its thirty-ninth anniversary of their Congressional Charter of \nSeptember 10, 1962.\n  A non-profit training and education organization for young men and \nwomen, the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps has consistently provided, in \nconjunction with the Navy and Coast Guard, an outstanding opportunity \nfor our country's youth to sample military life and experience the \nchallenges and rewards of the maritime services. Over 8600 Cadets ages \n11 to 17, led by 2,000 adult volunteers, across the United States and \noverseas participate with active forces in a wide variety of maritime \ntraining activities.\n  The Sea Cadet program is applauded in developing not only interest \nand skill in seamanship and aviation, but also instilling in America's \nyoung people a sense of patriotism, personal courage, self-reliance and \nthose qualities which mold strong moral character and self-discipline, \nall in an anti-drug, anti-gang environment. Many of our former and \ncurrent military leaders established their roots and love the Naval \nservices as a Sea Cadet.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the United States Senate and the United \nStates House of Representatives, I offer our heartfelt appreciation and \nrespect to all the members of ``our'' U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps.\n  To Volunteers and Cadets: ``Bravo Zulu''--Well Done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9248-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF HAIFA FAKHOURI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my Senate \ncolleagues to join with me in honoring dedicated activist and respected \ncommunity leader Dr. Haifa Fakhouri. Dr. Fakhouri will be named a Lady \nof Charity by the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME \nMissionaries) at the 43rd Knights of Charity Award Dinner in Dearborn, \nMichigan on October 11, 2001.\n  The Knights of Charity Award is presented each year to men and women \nwho clearly exemplify ``Unity in Family Life with Person-to-Person \nCharity.'' This award is given to those whose words and actions promote \nthe ideals of charity, friendship, love and interfaith and \nintercultural collaboration.\n  Dr. Fakhouri clearly exemplifies these ideals. Since coming to \nAmerica from Jordan in 1968, she has become one of the most respected \nleaders of the Arab-American community. Her most well known and far \nreaching achievement was helping to found, and serve as President and \nCEO of the Arab-American and Chaldean Council (ACC), the largest \ncommunity based human services agency in the nation, serving the Arabic \nand Chaldean speaking population of southeast Michigan. Founded in \nDetroit in 1979, the ACC has quickly grown to offer 36 outreach centers \nand over 50 specialized programs to the Arab/Chaldean community in \nDetroit and the surrounding area.\n  Under Dr. Fakhouri's leadership, the ACC has adopted goals and ideals \nthat closely match those of the Knights of Charity Award. The ACC is \ndedicated to building community cooperation and coordination, \nincreasing cross cultural understanding and raising the level of the \ncommunity's general well-being. Because Dr. Fakhouri has been so \nsuccessful in guiding the ACC towards achieving these goals, she has \nreceived recognition from numerous state and national organizations. \nFor example, she has served as Special Advisor to the United Nations on \nthe role and status of women and population policies in the Middle East \nRegion, and she has received the 1999 Governor's Community Leadership \nAward, the 1999 Michigander of the Year Award and many others.\n  Dr. Fakhouri's leadership, vision and compassion have made her one of \nthe nation's greatest community activists. Her dedication to serving \nothers have made her an invaluable part of the southeast Michigan \ncommunity. I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating her on being named a Lady of Charity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9248-5", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9248-S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORY MUSEUM FOR SPRINGFIELD-GREENE COUNTRY\n\n Mr. BOND.

It is an honor and a privilege to rise today on the floor \nof the United States Senate to recognize this institution's longevity \nand its role in preserving the history of Springfield and Greene \nCounty.\n  Some twenty-five years ago I was able to play a role in the founding \nof this museum while I was serving as Governor of Missouri. The Museum \nwas then called the Bicentennial Historical Museum in honor of our \nNation's 200th birthday. Over the years, the name has changed but the \ngoal and purpose of the museum has remained the same, preserving the \nhistory and heritage of the city of Springfield and Greene County. \nHistory is our window to the past and helps us to remember just how far \nwe have come as a nation and as a community. The museum contains \npermanent exhibits beginning with the earliest settlement in the \nregion, continuing on through the Civil War, and into the twentieth \ncentury. The museum also changes exhibits throughout the year which \nexamine other areas of Greene County's history.\n  The museum is a private, not-for-profit organization that is open to \npublic at no charge. The museum is funded through private \ncontributions, memberships, grants, and gift shop sales. The staff, \nmanagement, and volunteers who operate this facility are to be \ncongratulated for their tireless efforts and innovation which make the \nmuseum an important part of the community. The museum is an invaluable \ntool for students and teachers to learn the historical significance of \nthe area.\n  The History Museum for Springfield-Greene County is a valuable asset \nto the Springfield area. I ask that the Members of the Senate join me \nin recognizing and honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of the History \nMuseum for Springfield-Greene County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9249-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I draw the Senate's attention \nto National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for Assisted \nLiving is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week to \nhighlight the significance of this service and the hope that it can \nprovide seniors.\n  Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need \nmore assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not \nrequire the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing \nfacilities. Approximately one million of our Nation's seniors have \nchosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates \na tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of \nassistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other \nactivities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home.\n  This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``Sharing the \nWisdom of Generations,'' and it is intended to recognize the value of \nsharing insights and experiences between assisted living residents, \ntheir families, volunteers and assisted living staff. I think that it \nis appropriate because it highlights the variety of options assisted \nliving can provide to meet different needs of patients.\n  Oregon has led our Nation in the concept of assisted living. My State \nspends more State health dollars to provide assisted living services \nthan any other in our Nation. Assisted living has taken different \ndirections in different States, and I believe offering these choices \nfor consumers is important to provide security, dignity and \nindependence for seniors.\n  Assisted living will become even more important for seniors and their \nfamilies as our nation experiences the demographic tsunami of aging \nbaby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support options \nthat allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to \nassure that they get the level of care that they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9249-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING LT.

As you may know, the 86 year-old Fraternal Order \nof Police is the world's largest organization of sworn law enforcement \nofficers, improving the working conditions and advocating the safety of \nits 298,000 members in over 2,000 local lodges throughout the United \nStates.\n  I am confident that with his 25 years of membership in the FOP and \nhis current position as a Lieutenant in the Marion Police Department in \nmy State of Ohio, Lt. Young is an outstanding choice to lead the \nNational Fraternal Order of Police. Prior to being named National \nPresident, Lt. Young has proudly and effectively served as both \nNational Vice President and Ohio's State President.\n  Further, he has become something of an expert in helping to ensure \npolice officers' pension plans throughout the country. He also helped \nto create the Ohio Labor Council to improve the effectiveness of \nnegotiations between management and labor in police forces, a model \nthat has since been utilized in 14 other States.\n  I know that Lt. Young will use his new position to further ensure \nfair and equal treatment to our nation's true heroes, police officers, \non the job and to expand the FOP's involvement throughout the Nation. I \nwish Lt. Young the best of luck and extend my congratulations to him \nonce again here before Congress.

Mr. President, the Heart Failure Society of \nAmerica (HFSA) is a non-profit professional organization headquartered \nin St. Paul, MN, that represents the first organized effort by heart \nfailure experts from the Americas to provide a forum for all those \ninterested in heart failure research and patient care.\n  Today, the Heart Failure Society of America is convening here in our \nNation's capital with over 2,000 cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, \ninternists, family practitioners, research scientists, pharmacologists, \nnurses, pharmacists and other allied health care professionals who \ntreat heart failure patients for the HFSA 5th Annual Scientific \nMeeting. At this forum, preeminent professionals will unveil and review \nthe latest developments in heart failure research and clinical \npractice.\n  Heart failure is a progressive condition in which the heart muscle \nweakens and gradually loses its ability to pump enough blood to supply \nthe body's needs and is frighteningly common but underrecognized. Heart \nfailure affects nearly 5 million Americans. As more people survive \nheart attacks and are being left with weakened hearts, heart failure is \nthe only major cardiovascular disorder on the rise. An estimated \n400,000 to 700,000 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year. \nThe number of deaths in the United States from this condition has more \nthan doubled since 1979, averaging 250,000 annually. In comparison, the \ndeath rate from coronary heart disease has dramatically dropped \nstatistically over a similar time period. An estimated $8 to $15 \nbillion is spent each year on the costs of hospitalization due to heart \nfailure, which is twice the amount spent for all forms of cancer. While \nthere is currently no known cure for heart failure, new treatment \napproaches may help patients live more normal and fulfilling lives and \nbenefit from a decreased risk of hospitalization.\n  The HFSA was founded in 1994 by a small, dedicated group of academic \ncardiologists who recognized that heart failure was on the rise, but \nthat there was no venue for researchers, trainees and clinicians to \nshare ideas about combating the disease. We owe them a debt of \ngratitude for providing the impetus for exploring further research and \ntreatment which might not otherwise have occurred. The Heart Failure \nSociety of America is seen by government, industry and the medical \ncommunity as the authoritative organization on heart failure. The \nSenate first commended the HFSA and its work in the area of heart \nfailure in February of last year, designating the week surrounding \nValentine's Day each year as ``National Heart Failure Awareness Week.'' \nthese medical professionals are dedicated to enhancing the quality and \nduration of people's lives.\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\n  We are pleased to welcome this group of distinguished individuals to \nWashington and recognize their extraordinary public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9250-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE DENNIS W.

On October 11, 2001, \nMayor Archer will be inducted as a Knight of Charity by the Pontifical \nInstitute for Foreign Missions (PIME Missionaries) at the 43rd Knights \nof Charity Award Dinner in Dearborn, Michigan. This award is a fitting \ntribute for a man who has dedicated his life to the service of others.\n  The Knights of Charity Award is presented each year to men and women \nwho clearly exemplify ``Unity in Family Life with Person-to-Person \nCharity.'' This award is given to those whose words and actions promote \nthe ideals of charity, friendship, love and interfaith and \nintercultural collaboration.\n  Mayor Archer spent the first five years of his career teaching \nlearning disabled students in the Detroit Public School system. During \nthis time, Mr. Archer was also a student, studying and attending \nclasses after work to earn his law degree. Mr. Archer quickly \nestablished himself as one of the finest legal minds in Michigan and in \n1985 he was appointed Associate Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court \nby Governor James Blanchard. The next year he was elected to an eight-\nyear term, which he served with distinction.\n  Elected Mayor of Detroit in 1993, Dennis Archer soon became known \nnationwide for the innovative approach he brought to city government. \nNearing the end of his second for year term, Detroit under the \nleadership of Mayor Archer has successfully reduced crime, balanced \nbudgets, lowered taxes, improved public services and attracted over $14 \nbillion in new investment, with another $3 billion projected for this \nyear. Mayor Archer has received numerous honors in recognition of his \nachievement, including being named President of the National League of \nCities in 2001, Public Official of the Year in 2000 by Governing \nmagazine, one of the 25 most dynamic mayors in America by Newsweek \nmagazine, President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors and \none of the 100 most Influential Black Americans by Ebony magazine.\n  As a native Detroiter, I can personally attest to Mayor Archer's \nleadership and his commitment to those he serves. Through his hard \nwork, dedication and creativity, he has truly improved the City of \nDetroit and the lives of those who live there. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating Mayor Archer on being named a \nKnight of Charity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9250-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9250-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9250-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:51 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2833.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HAGEL:\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\n  S. 1412. A bill to protect the property rights guaranteed by the \nfifth amendment to the Constitution by requiring Federal agencies to \nprepare private property taking impact analyses and by allowing \nexpanded access to Federal courts; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, America's property owners are increasingly \npressured by more and more burdensome government regulations and \nrestrictions. Federal agencies should comply with state and local laws \non property rights, and ensure that our Nation's policies are \nimplemented with minimal impact on property owners. Today, I am \nreintroducing legislation that would help enforce the U.S. \nConstitution's guarantee of private property rights.\n  The Private Property Rights Act would help protect land owners in two \nways. First, the bill would require the Federal Government to conduct \nan economic impact analysis prior to taking any action that would \ninhibit or restrict the use of private property. For the first time, \nthe government would be forced to determine in advance how its actions \nwill impact the property owner.\n  Second, when government does take private property or restricts land \nuse, the bill would allow landowners to plead their case in a Federal \nDistrict Court instead of forcing them to the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims. This means property owners could appeal any Federal taking of \ntheir property in their home state, rather than Washington, D.C.\n  This bill has won the endorsement of the Nebraska Cattlemen, the \nNebraska Farm Bureau, and the Defenders of Property Rights. Their \nletters of support are being submitted for the Record.\n  The Private Property Rights Act is commonsense legislation that will \nreturn some justice to the system by reining in regulatory agencies, as \nwell as giving the property owner a voice in the process. This is the \nfair thing to do. This is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: The Nebraska Cattlemen applaud you for \n     reintroducing property rights protection legislation, The \n     Private Property Rights Act of 2001, in the 107th Congress. \n     The Association supported similar legislation (S. 246) in the \n     106th Congress and extends their support for your efforts \n     again this year.\n       The Private Property Rights Act of 2001 addresses a \n     phenomenon of federal and state government growth over the \n     past three decades--regulatory programs that creep into areas \n     and activities they were never envisioned to impact at their \n     creation. Wetland regulations and endangered or threatened \n     species designations are just two examples of how \n     ``regulatory creep'' has begun to affect almost every \n     agricultural activity. A little closer to home, recent \n     efforts by EPA to identify the sun as a source of pollution \n     in the Platte River may only be overshadowed by more recent \n     efforts to list the prairie dog as a species threatened with \n     extinction.\n       Considering these examples, it has never been more \n     important for federal agencies to be required to conduct an \n     analysis of the effects of their actions on property rights. \n     As found in The Private Property Rights Act of 2001, agency \n     actions critical to public safety or law enforcement would be \n     exempt from this requirement. Finally, and most critically, \n     the legislation provides affected property owners an \n     opportunity to seek relief form federal agencies whose \n     actions result in a taking of private property rights through \n     a federal district court in their state--instead of forcing \n     them into the Federal Claims Court in Washington, DC.\n       The Private Property Rights Act of 2001 is a solid solution \n     to a growing problem--the increased impact that federal \n     regulations have on property rights guaranteed by the Fifth \n     Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Nebraska Cattlemen \n     support this legislation and thank you for again taking a \n     leadership role on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Greg Ruehle,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Nebraksa Cattlemen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                   Lincoln, NE, September 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: On behalf of the Nebraska Farm Bureau \n     Federation, I would like to offer our strong support for your \n     bill titled ``Private Property Rights' Act of 2001''\n       As Nebraska's largest farm organization, we have been a \n     long time supporter of legislative efforts to protect \n     property rights for landowners. For years farmers and \n     ranchers have seen their property rights erode through \n     various government actions and regulations. The problem is \n     only exacerbated by the fact the government has failed to \n     provide full and equitable compensation for the loss of the \n     use of property due to government actions.\n       Your bill would take a giant step forward by providing some \n     protection for landowners' property rights. By requiring \n     federal agencies to prepare private property taking impact \n     analyses and by allowing expanded access to Federal courts, \n     the bill would certainly help prevent or reduce the loss of \n     private property rights. Government should be forced to \n     determine in advance how its actions would impact the \n     property owner and this bill would put those necessary \n     requirements in place.\n       In Nebraska, the Endangered Species Act and wetland \n     regulations have decreased the use or value on many privately \n     held acres by farmers and ranchers. This legislation would go \n     a long way towards putting some fairness back into the system \n     by making agencies think twice before they act on rules that \n     impact private property rights and by giving property owners \n     a voice in the process.\n       Nebraska farmers and ranchers appreciate your support for \n     private property rights and your introduction of this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Bryce P. Neidig,\n\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Defenders of Property Rights,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 6, 2001.\n     Re: Introduction of the Private Property Fairness Act.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: It has come to the attention of our \n     organization that you are to shortly re-introduce the Private \n     Property Fairness Act of 1999 [formerly S. 246]. As this \n     country's only public interest legal foundation dedicated \n     exclusively to the protection of private property rights, \n     Defenders of Property Rights commends your efforts to pass \n     this valuable piece of legislation. We would be happy to \n     assist you in your efforts to pass this piece of legislation.\n       As you noted when you introduced S. 246 on January 20, \n     1999, ``. . . the law of takings is not yet settled to the \n     satisfaction of most Americans.'' Our membership includes \n     scores of individual property owners across this nation--in \n     courts from coast to coast--whose constitutionally protected \n     rights to ownership, use and enjoyment of property are or \n     have been unconstitutionally denied them, we can attest to \n     the accuracy of your observation. Sadly, Defenders of \n     Property Rights can report that there are fewer `satisfied' \n     Americans now, than when we began our efforts nearly a dozen \n     years ago. We can state without exaggeration that while \n     individual cases of regulatory takings of property without \n     just compensation are increasing, the operative effect of \n     regulations now threatens the very existence of entire \n     regions of rural America.\n       Like you, Defenders of Property Rights acknowledges the \n     need for the rational application of this nation's \n     environmental laws to protect our natural resources. However, \n     when government policy and regulation unconstitutionally \n     deprive individuals or businesses of their private property \n     rights, then just and adequate compensation is \n     constitutionally required. However, as you correctly noted in \n     your January 20, 1999 statement, the cost of bearing too many \n     of the impacts of regulatory takings are shouldered by the \n     few. And, you rightly stated, ``This is not fair.'' We could \n     not agree more. We would also add that it is not \n     constitutional.\n       We believe that enactment of the successor to The Private \n     Property Fairness Act would arrest the continued diminishment \n     of what the Framers of our Constitution considered a \n     fundamental right--property rights. Additionally, we believe \n     that your legislation will impose reasonable restraints on \n     governmental agencies that will add a measure of calculated \n     seriousness to their decisions to destroy private property. \n     Finally, we are encouraged to note that your bill would \n     dramatically increase the forums available to private \n     property owners who seek redress when their property rights \n     are diminished or taken.\n       In short, Defenders of Property Rights is delighted to \n     register its support for your proposed legislation. The \n     fundamental importance of property rights is one of the \n     animating principles of our form of government. Moreover, we \n     are enormously encouraged by your leadership on this \n     important issue. We look forward to working with you on this \n     valuable piece of legislation.\n           Yours truly,\n\n                                           Nancie G. Marzulla,\n\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1413. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to permit borrowers and grantees to use certain rural development \nloans\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\nand grants for other purposes under certain circumstances; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation amending \nthe Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to allow the Secretary \nof Agriculture to approve changes to the original purpose for which a \nUSDA Rural Development grant or loan was made when requested by a \nrecipient.\n  The Rural Community Advancement Program, as established under the Con \nAct, consists of separate accounts to provide funding for rural \ncommunity facilities, rural waste and water utilities, and rural \nbusiness and cooperative development. In the 1996 Farm Bill, we \nprovided State Directors of Rural Development with the authority to \ntransfer up to 25 percent of funds allocated to one of those accounts \nfor a State in a fiscal year to any of the other accounts for which \nfunds were allocated for the State in that fiscal year. This \nflexibility allows a State to adjust funding among the accounts to meet \nchanging circumstances. For example, in a given year a State may have \ngreater demand for financial assistance for rural community facilities \nthan for rural business development, and the authority we granted in \n1996 would allow a State the flexibility to address that change in \ndemand.\n  The flexibility provided by the 1996 Farm Bill, however, extended \nonly to prospective funding. It did not cover changes to loan and grant \npurposes needed by a community after a loan or grant has been made. Any \npost-award change to the grant or loan purpose would require return to \nUSDA of any unspent grant or loan funds, or reimbursement to the \nFederal Government for its proportionate financial interest in any \nproperty acquired with the loan or grant funds.\n  Communities in Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Oklahoma have faced this \ndilemma when they have sought to provide space in grant-funded \nindustrial parks to businesses that were too large to qualify under the \nterms of their Rural Business Enterprise Grant but that otherwise would \nhave been eligible for a Rural Development Business and Industry loan. \nAn Indiana community has unused property in its grant-funded industrial \npark that it now would like to use for a critically needed police \nstation and water tower. USDA has no authority to allow any of these \ncommunities to change the authorized use for the land for which the \ngrant or loan originally was made.\n  The measure I offer today would allow the Secretary to approve these \ntypes of requests. Under the bill, a community could request the \nSecretary to approve a change in the rural development purpose for \npreviously awarded grants and loans to another rural development \npurpose authorized under the Con Act. A change in purpose could be \nrequested only for property acquired with such funds, or for the \nproceeds from sale of property acquired with such funds.\n  This measure would not require the Secretary to approve requests. It \nsimply allows the Secretary to be fair and reasonable in considering \nrequests by communities to alter the original purpose of the grant or \nloan. The beneficiary of such a change would not reap any financial \nwindfall from such a change at the expense of the Federal government. \nThe Federal government would retain its financial interest in any \nproperty used for the new purpose approved by the Secretary.\n  We all know how the needs of communities change over time due to \neconomic development and demographic change. This measure allows the \nSecretary to be fair and reasonable in considering requests by \ncommunities to alter the original purpose of a grant or loan in \nresponse to such changes. I am hopeful my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1414. A bill to provide incentives for States to establish and \nadminister periodic testing and merit pay programs for elementary \nschool and secondary school teachers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parent and \nTeacher Achievement Act of 2001. We spent much of the spring debating \nthe Federal Government's role in education, and in the end we passed a \nbill which gives a lot of money to the education establishment. Now, \nhowever, it is time to work on a policy that addresses what we can do \nfor parents and teachers, and how we can let them keep some of their \nmoney so they can start improving education from the ground up.\n  This bill has many important provisions, but the most important is \nthe tax credit for parents and relatives to use for education expenses. \nThey can use this credit for any expenses they incur when they spend \nmoney on their children's education, such as school supplies, \ncomputers, private tutors, or other such expenses. This credit can also \nbe used by parents who home school as well as to help offset tuition at \nprivate schools. This is not a voucher program nor is it a government \nsubsidy for private schools. This tax credit is simply the Federal \nGovernment recognizing that parents know best how to educate their \nchildren. As education researcher Andrew Coulson has said, ``. . . \nparents have consistently made better education choices for their own \nchildren than state-appointed experts have made on their behalf.'' The \nFederal Government should not penalize them by taxing the money parents \nspend to further that education. It should be pointed out that this \ncredit would also apply to relatives of students if they contribute \nmoney towards educational expenses. We all know that grandparents and \naunts and uncles do a lot to contribute to children's education. It is \nonly appropriate to recognize those efforts, too.\n  The idea of the type of tax credit contained in this bill has been \npicking up steam recently, and many think tanks, such as the Cato \nInstitute, the Mackinac Center, and the Buckeye Institute, have issued \nreports on tuition tax credits which clearly illustrate their benefits. \nA tax credit of this type has also begun to be enacted in the real \nworld. Arizona has had an education tax credit for a few years, and it \nhas proven to be remarkably successful. The Canadian province of \nOntario also recently enacted a tax credit of this type.\n  Of course, a tax credit is only available to people who pay taxes, \nbut my bill also benefits low income individuals. To address the needs \nof these people, I have included a provision in this bill which would \ngive individuals or corporations a tax credit when they donate money to \norganizations which give scholarships to lower income students. This \nwould allow funds to go to private organizations so they award \nscholarships, while avoiding any church/state entanglements which \nconcern so many who oppose vouchers. The state of Arizona has had \nsuccess with this program, too.\n  Another important tax component contained in this bill is one which \nallows teachers to take a credit for money spent on school supplies for \ntheir students. Nobody goes into teaching to get rich; they do it \nbecause they recognize their job is one of the most important in this \nNation, preparing our youth for the future. And though teachers do not \nreceive lavish salaries, many of them spend considerable sums for \nschool supplies for their students. It is only fair that the Federal \nGovernment should not tax this money. The bill also contains a \nprovision that would allow teachers and other school staff a tax \ndeduction for expenses they incur while improving their education or \njob skills. Our teachers need to be the best trained teachers in the \nworld, and we should encourage this all we can.\n  The final section of this bill would empower teachers by allowing the \nSecretary of Education to give grants to States and school districts \nwhich set up merit pay systems in schools and implement teacher testing \nprograms, as long as those states also have a continuing education \nrequirement as part of their teacher certification process. It also has \na provision which clarifies any Department of Education regulations and \nsays that federal funds can be used for merit pay systems and for \nteacher testing programs. If States and school districts find the need \nto use their funds for these programs, the Federal Government should \nnot tie them up in red tape and prevent them from meeting their needs \nas they see them. We all know that local educators have a much better \nview of the needs they encounter, and we in Washington\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\nshould give them as much freedom as possible to meet those needs.\n  By enacting this bill, the U.S. Senate will be making a firm \ncommitment to helping parents and teachers achieve education success. \nParents in this country need to have as much freedom as possible to \nchoose the ways in which their children will be educated, and this bill \nis a modest step in that direction. To complement the efforts of \nparents, though, we need to have teachers who are the most qualified \nand the most able to meet the needs of the children parents send to \nthem every day. Encouraging states to implement merit pay and teacher \ntesting, and allowing teachers to have a credit for their educational \nexpenses, will go a long way towards making this a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance \nbook donations and literacy; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to clarify and enhance the charitable contribution tax \ndeduction for donations of excess book inventory for educational \npurposes. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my good friends \nand colleagues Senators Baucus and Dodd. This proposal would simplify a \ncomplex area of the current law and eliminate significant roadblocks \nthat now stand in the way of corporations with excess book inventory to \ndonating those books to schools, libraries, and literacy programs, \nwhere they are much needed.\n  Unfortunately, our current tax law contains a major flaw when it \ncomes to the donation of books that are excess inventory for publishers \nor booksellers. The tax benefits for donating such books to schools or \nlibraries are often no greater than those of sending the books to the \nlandfill. And, since it is generally cheaper and faster for a company \nto simply send the books to the dump, rather than go through the \ntrouble and cost of finding donees, and of packing, storing, and \nshipping the books, it often ends up being more cost effective and \neasier for companies to truck the books to a landfill or recycling \ncenter.\n  While there are provisions in the current law where a larger \ndeduction is available for the donation of excess books, many companies \nhave found that the complexity and uncertainty of dealing with the \nrequirements, regulations, and possible Internal Revenue Service \nchallenges of the higher deduction serve as a real disincentive to \nmaking a contribution.\n  This is a sad situation, when one considers that many, if not most, \nof these books would be warmly welcomed by schools, libraries, and \nliteracy programs.\n  The heart of the problem is that under the current law, the higher \ndeduction requires that the donated books be used only for the care of \nthe needy, the sick, or infants. This requirement makes it difficult \nfor schools to qualify as donees and also frequently prohibits \nlibraries and adult literacy programs from receiving such deductions. \nThis is because these schools, libraries, and literacy programs often \nserve those who are not needy or are over the age of 18. Further \ncomplicating the issue, the valuation of donated book inventory has \nbeen the subject of ongoing disputes between taxpayers and the IRS. The \ntax code should not contain obstacles that provide disincentives to \ncharitable donations of books that can enhance learning.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today addresses the obstacles of donating \nexcess book inventory by providing a simple and clear rule whereby any \ndonation of book inventory to a qualified school, library, or literacy \nprogram is eligible for the enhanced deduction. This means that \nbooksellers and publishers would receive a higher tax benefit for \ndonating the books rather than throwing them away and would thus be \nencouraged to go to the extra trouble and expense of seeking out \nqualified donees and making the contributions.\n  My home State of Utah, like the rest of the Nation, has a problem \nwith illiteracy. According to the National Institute for Literacy, \nbetween 21 and 23 percent of the adult population of the United States, \nabout 44 million people, are only at Level 1 literacy, meaning they can \nread a little but not well enough to fill out an application, read a \nfood label, or read a simple story to a child. Another 25 to 28 percent \nof the adult population, or between 45 and 50 million people, are \nestimated to be at Level 2 literacy, meaning they can usually can \nperform more complex tasks such as comparing, contrasting, or \nintegrating pieces of information but usually not higher level reading \nand problem-solving skills. Literacy experts tell us that adults with \nskills at Levels 1 and 2 lack a sufficient foundation of basic skills \nto function successfully in our society.\n  While this bill is not a cure-all for the tragedy of illiteracy, it \nwill increase access to books, both for adults and for children. Our \ntax code should not encourage the destruction of perfectly good books \nwhile schools, libraries, and literacy programs go begging for them.\n  The Senate is already on record in unanimous support of this bill. \nDuring the floor debate on the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, I offered this proposal as an amendment, \nwhich was accepted without opposition. Unfortunately, the provision was \ndropped in the conference with the House.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this provision to decrease \nrevenues to the Treasury by $246 million over a ten year period. This \nestimate helps demonstrate the extent of the value of the books that \nare currently being discarded that could be utilized to help America's \nadults and children.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this bill. It is \nwrong for our\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\ntax code to encourage book publishers to send books to the landfill \ninstead of to the library. Let's correct this problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONTRIBUTIONS OF BOOK INVENTORY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to certain contributions of ordinary \n     income and capital gain property) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Special rule for contributions of book inventory for \n     educational purposes.--\n       ``(i) Contributions of book inventory.--In determining \n     whether a qualified book contribution is a qualified \n     contribution, subparagraph (A) shall be applied without \n     regard to whether or not--\n\n       ``(I) the donee is an organization described in the matter \n     preceding clause (i) of subparagraph (A), and\n       ``(II) the property is to be used by the donee solely for \n     the care of the ill, the needy, or infants.\n\n       ``(ii) Qualified book contribution.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term `qualified book contribution' means a \n     charitable contribution of books, but only if the \n     contribution is to an organization--\n\n       ``(I) described in subclause (I) or (III) of paragraph \n     (6)(B)(i), or\n       ``(II) described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax \n     under section 501(a) which is organized primarily to make \n     books available to the general public at no cost or to \n     operate a literacy program.''.\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to contributions made after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues Senator Hatch and \nSenator Baucus to introduce a measure to encourage book publishers to \ndonate excess inventory to schools, libraries, and literacy programs.\n  Currently, because of the TAX CODE's treatment of such donations, and \nthe cost of shipping books to schools and libraries, often it is more \neconomical for publishers to destroy books than to donate them. That is \nas shocking as it is unacceptable.\n  Both the House and Senate versions of the education bills that \ncurrently are in conference authorize nearly $1 billion dollars for \ngrants to State and local educational agencies for pre-reading or \nreading programs for children from pre-kindergarten through 3rd grade. \nI think it goes without saying that programs to teach kids to read \nwon't work unless they can provide kids with access to books. You can't \nlearn to read if you don't have anything to read.\n  That is why measures such as this, and the provision in the Senate's \neducation bill to help school libraries acquire up-to-date books and to \nremain open for longer hours, are essential to the success of the \nreading programs in both bills. This provision will increase children's \naccess to books, introduce them to whole new worlds of knowledge, and \nenable them to read more at school, in libraries, and at home.\n  This is important, because in a recent study of 15 countries, the \nUnited States was 12th in the percentage of 13- year-olds who read for \nfun. Of course, reading for fun is valuable for its own sake, but it \nalso is an important indicator of academic achievement.

Res. 158\n\n       Whereas women should be celebrated for the unparalleled \n     strides made during the 20th century in education, \n     professional careers, legal rights, politics, military \n     service, religion, sports, and self-reliance;\n       Whereas at the dawn of the 20th century, women in the \n     United States were denied their constitutional right to equal \n     protection of the law, including the right to vote;\n       Whereas the women's suffrage movement, the largest \n     grassroots political movement in the Nation's history, \n     involved approximately 2,000,000 women and took more than 70 \n     years of petitions, referenda, speeches, national and State \n     campaigns, demonstrations, arrests, and hunger strikes;\n       Whereas women won the right to vote throughout the United \n     States with the ratification of the 19th amendment to the \n     Constitution in 1920, and by the end of the century women \n     were voting in larger numbers than men in some national \n     elections;\n       Whereas women represent an increasing percentage of the \n     population awarded college and postgraduate degrees;\n       Whereas women are increasingly owning businesses and \n     working to narrow the pay gap between women and men;\n       Whereas in World War I, women were only allowed to serve in \n     the Army as nurses, and approximately 10,000 of the 30,000 \n     women that served in World War I served as volunteers \n     overseas, with no rank and no benefits;\n       Whereas during the 20th century, women served the Nation \n     proudly and capably in the Armed Forces, including duty in \n     World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Libya, the \n     Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, and in supportive roles during \n     all of these conflicts;\n       Whereas women now serve in all ranks and branches of the \n     Armed Forces as pilots, intelligence specialists, drill \n     instructors, specialists, technicians, soldiers, airmen, and \n     marines on the battlefields, and as sailors aboard Navy and \n     Coast Guard ships at sea;\n       Whereas the 20th century saw women in new roles as justices \n     on the Supreme Court, members of the President's Executive \n     Cabinet, and Members of Congress;\n       Whereas women's contributions have become invaluable as \n     Federal, State, and local legislators, Governors, judges, \n     Cabinet officers, county commissioners, mayors, city council \n     members, and directors of Federal, State, and local agencies;\n       Whereas women made significant strides in the 20th century, \n     yet as we enter the 21st century women continue to face \n     inequality;\n       Whereas women are disparately excluded from health care \n     research, clinical trials, and treatment;\n       Whereas women continue to be underrepresented in science \n     and technology careers;\n       Whereas women are often paid only 72 cents for each 1 \n     dollar paid to men for the same work;\n       Whereas women are disproportionately affected by poverty \n     and elderly women are generally more dependent on the social \n     security program under title II of the Social Security Act; \n     and\n       Whereas women can reflect upon the opportunities created \n     during the 20th century and look toward even greater \n     accomplishments in the 21st century: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and commends the accomplishments and unfailing \n     spirit of women in the 20th century;\n       (2) recognizes the crucial roles of women in our \n     communities as mothers, wives, and family caregivers;\n       (3) recognizes the disparity in equality that women still \n     face;\n       (4) reaffirms the need to prevent and punish violence \n     against women so that women may be safe from domestic \n     violence, sexual assault, elder abuse, and violence in the \n     workplace;\n       (5) recognizes that women should have equal access to \n     health care and inclusion in research and clinical trials;\n       (6) recognizes the need for equality in vocational and \n     academic education;\n       (7) recognizes that the pay gap should be closed;\n       (8) commits to preserving the social security program under \n     title II of the Social Security Act and the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of such Act; and\n       (9) pledges to make the 21st century the ``Century of Equal \n     Opportunity for Women''.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the 21st century as the ``Century of Equal Opportunity for \nWomen.''\n  This proposal recognizes that as we enter the 21st century, it is \nessential that we note the great strides made by women in the 20th \ncentury as well as recognizing fundamental inequalities still faced by \nwomen as we begin the 21st century. The need for this resolution comes \nfrom the important requirement to acknowledge past achievements but to \nalso address specific areas where further improvements are needed in \norder to ensure that women are given equal opportunity.\n  Unfortunately, women continue to face challenges and disparities in \nareas like health care and wages. This resolution acknowledges \ninequities such as the pay gap and challenges us to see that these \nissues are addressed so that\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\nwomen may have not just more opportunities, but equal opportunities. \nThe measure is supported by the American Association of University \nWomen. I, along with co-sponsors Senators Clinton, Cochran, and Murray, \nurge our colleagues to support this resolution and recognize the 21st \ncentury as the ``Century of Equal Opportunity for Women.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/10/senate-section/article/S9260-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1533.

Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the Statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the Statute.\n       (3) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (4) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deserve the full protection of the United States Constitution \n     wherever they are stationed or deployed around the world to \n     protect the vital national interests of the United States. \n     The United States Government has an obligation to protect the \n     members of its Armed Forces, to the maximum extent possible, \n     against criminal prosecutions carried out by United Nations \n     officials under procedures that deny them their \n     constitutional rights.\n       (5) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court for national security decisions \n     involving such matters as responding to acts of terrorism, \n     preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     and deterring aggression.\n       (6) The claimed jurisdiction of the International Criminal \n     Court over citizens of a country that is not a state party to \n     the Rome Statute is a threat to the sovereignty of the United \n     States under the Constitution of the United States.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act shall be available for \n     cooperation with, or assistance or other support to, the \n     International Criminal Court or the Preparatory Commission. \n     This subsection shall not be construed to apply to any other \n     entity outside the Rome treaty.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1537.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Infant Crib Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The disability and death of infants resulting from \n     injuries sustained in crib incidents are a serious threat to \n     the public health, welfare, and safety of people of this \n     country.\n       (2) The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure \n     that it is safe to leave an infant unattended for extended \n     periods of time. A parent or caregiver has a right to believe \n     that the crib in use is a safe place to leave an infant.\n       (3) Each year more than 12,000 children ages 2 and under \n     are injured in cribs seriously enough to require hospital \n     treatment.\n       (4) Each year at least 50 children ages 2 and under die \n     from injuries sustained in cribs.\n       (5) The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     estimates that the cost to society resulting from deaths due \n     to cribs is at least $225,000,000 per year.\n       (6) Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs pose a \n     special problem. There are nearly 4 million infants born in \n     this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. \n     As many as 2 out of 4 infants are placed in secondhand, hand-\n     me-down, or heirloom cribs.\n       (7) Most crib deaths occur in secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n     heirloom cribs.\n       (8) Existing State and Federal legislation is inadequate to \n     deal with the hazard presented by secondhand, hand-me-down, \n     or heirloom cribs.\n       (9) Prohibiting the contracting to sell, resell, lease, \n     sublease of unsafe cribs that are not new, or otherwise place \n     in the stream of commerce unsafe secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n     heirloom cribs, will prevent injuries and deaths caused by \n     cribs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to prevent the \n     occurrence of injuries and deaths to infants as a result of \n     unsafe cribs by making it illegal--\n       (1) to manufacture, sell, or contract to sell any crib that \n     is unsafe for any infant using it; or\n       (2) to resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place in the \n     stream of commerce, after the effective date of this Act, any \n     unsafe crib, particularly any unsafe secondhand, hand-me-\n     down, or heirloom crib.\n\n     SEC. 803.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     United States voted against final adoption of the Rome \n     Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the Statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the Statute.\n       (3) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (4) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deserve the full protection of the United States Constitution \n     wherever they are stationed or deployed around the world to \n     protect the vital national interests of the United States. \n     The United States Government has an obligation to protect the \n     members of its Armed Forces, to the maximum extent possible, \n     against criminal prosecutions carried out by United Nations \n     officials under procedures that deny them their \n     constitutional rights.\n       (5) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court for national security decisions \n     involving such matters as responding to acts of terrorism, \n     preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \n     and deterring aggression.\n       (6) The claimed jurisdiction of the International Criminal \n     Court over citizens of a country that is not a state party to \n     the Rome Statute is a threat to the sovereignty of the United \n     States under the Constitution of the United States.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act shall be available for \n     cooperation with, or assistance or other support to, the \n     International Criminal Court or the Preparatory Commission. \n     This subsection shall not be construed to apply to any other \n     entity outside the Rome treaty.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1537.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by her to the bill H.R. 2500, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \nagencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 116, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n                     TITLE VIII--INFANT CRIB SAFETY\n\n     SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Infant Crib Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The disability and death of infants resulting from \n     injuries sustained in crib incidents are a serious threat to \n     the public health, welfare, and safety of people of this \n     country.\n       (2) The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure \n     that it is safe to leave an infant unattended for extended \n     periods of time. A parent or caregiver has a right to believe \n     that the crib in use is a safe place to leave an infant.\n       (3) Each year more than 12,000 children ages 2 and under \n     are injured in cribs seriously enough to require hospital \n     treatment.\n       (4) Each year at least 50 children ages 2 and under die \n     from injuries sustained in cribs.\n       (5) The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     estimates that the cost to society resulting from deaths due \n     to cribs is at least $225,000,000 per year.\n       (6) Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs pose a \n     special problem. There are nearly 4 million infants born in \n     this country each year, but only one million new cribs sold. \n     As many as 2 out of 4 infants are placed in secondhand, hand-\n     me-down, or heirloom cribs.\n       (7) Most crib deaths occur in secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n     heirloom cribs.\n       (8) Existing State and Federal legislation is inadequate to \n     deal with the hazard presented by secondhand, hand-me-down, \n     or heirloom cribs.\n       (9) Prohibiting the contracting to sell, resell, lease, \n     sublease of unsafe cribs that are not new, or otherwise place \n     in the stream of commerce unsafe secondhand, hand-me-down, or \n     heirloom cribs, will prevent injuries and deaths caused by \n     cribs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to prevent the \n     occurrence of injuries and deaths to infants as a result of \n     unsafe cribs by making it illegal--\n       (1) to manufacture, sell, or contract to sell any crib that \n     is unsafe for any infant using it; or\n       (2) to resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place in the \n     stream of commerce, after the effective date of this Act, any \n     unsafe crib, particularly any unsafe secondhand, hand-me-\n     down, or heirloom crib.\n\n     SEC. 803.
