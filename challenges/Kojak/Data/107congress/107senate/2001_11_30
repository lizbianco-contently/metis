Mr. President, I rise today to inform Senators of my \nintention to bring before the Senate at the earliest possible time an \nimportant piece of legislation that I introduced last April along with \n21 of my colleagues.\n  Our bipartisan bill, S. 767, the Gun Show Background Check Act of \n2001, would apply the Brady law to all firearms sales at gun shows, \nthereby closing the loophole that allows criminals to buy firearms from \nprivate sellers at gun shows without a background check. This \nlegislation is identical to the Lautenberg amendment passed by the \nSenate on a bipartisan vote in the 106th Congress.\n  As long as gun violence continues to take the lives of 10 of our \nyoung people every day, and about 30,000 Americans every year, we must \ndo everything we can to prevent convicted felons, domestic abusers, and \nother prohibited purchasers from gaining access to firearms.\n  It has been my intention to bring this legislation to a vote since \nits introduction last spring. We were asked not to offer the bill as an \namendment to the education bill because it was one of the President's \ntop priorities. We were asked not to offer it to the bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform bill because it was non-germane. We were asked \nnot to offer it to the bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights because it \nwas a fragile compromise. We were asked not to offer it to the Defense \nauthorization bill because of the critical importance of moving that \nlegislation. Finally, we are barred by Senate rules from offering the \namendment to the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bills moving through \nthe Senate.\n  By not enacting this legislation, we have, unfortunately, overlooked \none of the most effective tools we can give to law enforcement to \nprevent violent acts against our people, and that is the ability to \nconduct background checks every time a gun is sold at more than 4,000 \ngun shows held in this country each and every year. The time has come \nfor the Senate to consider this legislation. It was important before \nSeptember 11, and it is even more important today.\n  Here are the facts: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nreported to Congress last year that gun shows are a major gun \ntrafficking channel, responsible for more than 26,000 illegal firearms \nsales during a single 18-month period. Gun shows are the second leading \nsource of illegal guns recovered in gun trafficking investigations. The \nFBI and ATF tell us again and again that convicted felons, fugitives \nfrom justice, and other prohibited purchasers are taking advantage of \nthe gun show loophole to acquire firearms.\n\n  Now, more and more evidence is emerging that terrorists also know the \nweaknesses in our gun laws. The Chicago Tribune reported on November 18 \nthat among the ruins of radical Islamic safehouses in Kabul were \ncomputer printouts of Jihad training manuals that emphasized how easy \nit is to obtain firearms, and firearms training, in the United States.\n  Under the heading ``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad,'' the manual \nsays, ``in other countries, for example, some states of the United \nStates or South Africa, it is perfectly legal for members of the public \nto own certain types of firearms. If you live in such a country, obtain \nan assault rifle legally, preferably AK-47 or variations, learn how to \nuse it properly and go and practice in the areas allowed for such \ntraining.'' The manual goes on to advise those training for holy war to \njoin American gun clubs to sharpen their shooting skills, saying,\n\n       There are many firearms courses available to the public in \n     the USA, ranging from 1 day to 2 weeks or more. These courses \n     are good but expensive. Some of them are only meant for \n     security personnel but generally they will teach anyone. It \n     is also better to attend these courses in pairs or by \n     yourself, no more. Do not make public announcements when \n     going on such a course. Find one, book your place, go there, \n     learn, come back home and keep it yourself. . . . Useful \n     courses to learn are sniping, general shooting and other \n     rifle courses. Handgun courses are useful but only after you \n     have mastered rifles.\n\n  We also have new evidence of suspected terrorists using gun shows to \nobtain weapons. On September 10, a jury in Detroit convicted Ali \nBoumelhem, a member of the terrorist group Hezbollah, on charges of \nconspiring to smuggle guns and ammunition to Lebanon. Mixed in with \nauto parts in a container bound for Lebanon, law enforcement \nauthorities found a variety of weapons and accessories purchased at gun \nshows, including two shotguns, 750 rounds of ammunition, flash \nsuppressors for AK-47s, and upper receiver for an AR-15 (the civilian \nversion of the M-16), and speed loaders for 5.56mm ammunition.\n  Ali Boumelhem and his brother, Mohamad, knew the law well, and they \nexploited it over the years. Because Ali is a convicted felon and \ntherefore prohibited from purchasing firearms under the Brady law, the \nconfiscated weapons were purchased from licensed dealers at gun shows \nby Mohamad, who is not a felon. Mohamad was later acquitted of charges \nrelated to this illegal ``straw purchase.'' According to the court \nrecord, he also threatened a confidential informant during the \ninvestigation, saying ``If we cannot get you here we will take care of \nyou in Lebanon.''\n  The investigation also revealed that prior to November 1998, when the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System was implemented under \nthe Brady law, Ali Boumelhem did purchase several shotguns from \nlicensed dealers at gun shows by lying on the required form about his \nfelony conviction. He knew that prior to the establishment of the NICS, \nbackground checks were not required on long guns in many States. We may \nnever know what became of those guns, and, more importantly in terms of \nthe legislation I am discussing today, we will never know whether \nBoumelhem or his brother purchased guns from private sellers at these \ngun shows because there is no record of sale or background check \nrequired for sales by unlicensed sellers at gun shows, then and now. \nWhat we do know is that this Hezbollah member found a large selection \nof weapons there and worked the system to his benefit over time before \nfinally getting caught. We need to close the gun show loophole so that \nwe prevent illegal weapons purchases by terrorists.\n  In another case, the New York Times reported on November 13 that \nConor Claxton, a man accused of being a member of the Irish Republican \nArmy, testified in Federal court in Fort Lauderdale that he and his \nassociates had gone to south Florida gun shows to buy thousands of \ndollars worth of handguns, rifles, and high-powered ammunition to \nsmuggle to Northern Ireland.\n  The Times also reported that on October 30 in Texas, Muhammad Navid \nAsrar, a Pakistani man, pleaded guilty\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\nto immigration violations and illegal possession of ammunition. \nAuthorities said that in the last 7 years Mr. Asrar had bought several \nweapons at gun shows, including handguns and rifles. According to \npolice in Alice, Texas, a Federal grand jury is investigating whether \nhe may be linked to al Qaeda terrorists. The Times reported that he \naroused the authorities' suspicion when he asked employees at his \nconvenience store to take pictures of tall buildings and mail letters \nfor him from Pennsylvania back to Texas.\n  I wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft earlier this month to ask \nwhat steps the Department of Justice is taking to prevent terrorist \nattacks involving firearms, including firearms acquired at gun shows. I \nlook forward to his reply. I also met with officials of the Department \nof Justice and ATF to discuss the role of firearms in their \ncounterterrorism efforts. Let me say that although the Attorney General \nand I may not agree on many issues when it comes to the regulation of \nfirearms, I believe we have a unique opportunity to work together to \nprevent violent acts by terrorists and others, without infringing upon \nthe constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. Not one single, \nsolitary person who is not already prohibited from possessing firearms \nwould be denied the right to purchase firearms by our gun show bill.\n  I know there are those who oppose any new gun laws. They have a right \nto that opinion, but what is their proposed alternative? Should we \nignore the Jihad manuals and the cases of Ali Boumelhem, Conor Claxton, \nand Mohammad Asrar? Do any of us really know what the next terrorist \nattack will look like? I believe we have a clear responsibility to do \neverything we can to prevent terrorists from gaining access to \nfirearms.\n  But even if we set aside the issue of terrorists' access to guns, \nthis legislation is important to bring some sense to our gun laws and \nsave American lives. The chilling reports this week of an alleged plot \nby students at New Bedford High School to kill large numbers of their \nfellow students and teachers reminded us that the threat of gun \nviolence is still very real for our children and families.\n  Two years ago, after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people \nand themselves at Columbine High School with weapons purchased from a \nprivate seller at a gun show, Democrats and Republican in the Senate \njoined together to pass the Lautenberg amendment to close the gun show \nloophole. The legislation I have introduced is identical to that \nSenate-passed amendment. Unlike other gun show bills, it would apply \nthe successful Brady law to every gun sold at gun shows, without \nexception. As under current law, law enforcement would have up to three \nbusiness days to conduct background checks on firearms sales. Our \nopponents will say that we're trying to shut down gun shows by imposing \na ``waiting period'' on gun sales that usually take place on weekends. \nBut that is not the case. There is no ``waiting period.'' The Brady law \ngives law enforcement up to 3 business days to complete a background \ncheck on a prospective gun buyer. In fact, most gun purchases are \nprocessed very quickly by the NICS system. The FBI clears 72 percent of \ngun buyers within 30 seconds. Another 23 percent are cleared within 2 \nhours. That means background checks are completed within 2 hours for 95 \npercent of prospective gun buyers. Nineteen out of twenty have a \ndecision rendered in just 2 hours.\n  But what about that last 5 percent that takes longer than 2 hours? \nAccording to a recent GAO report, those gun buyers are more than 20 \ntimes more likely to be prohibited from possessing a weapon under \nFederal law.\n  For gun buyers in that last 5 percent, potentially disqualifying \ninformation often requires the FBI to access court records--which are \ntypically not available on a weekend; indeed, typically not available \nuntil at least Monday morning--to ensure that the person is not a \nconvict felon or fugitive from justice; those records have to be \nchecked.\n  Yet other gun show bills would make exceptions to the Brady law, \nreducing background checks for many gun show sales to 24 hours, to \navoid inconveniencing the people in that 5-percent category. I believe \nthat would be a serious mistake. We must reject the notion that it is \nbetter to allow a criminal to get gun than to ask a small group of \npotentially high-risk gun buyers to experience a minor inconvenience. \nIf anything, law enforcement needs more time, not less, to conduct \nbackground checks. The FBI reported last year that over an 18-month \nperiod, more than 6,000 firearms were sold to convicted felons and \nother prohibited buyers because the three business days allowed under \nthe Brady law expired before law enforcement could provide a definitive \nresponse. These illegal firearms must then be retrieved by State and \nFederal officer, as dangerous scenario which no one wants to see \nrepeated or multiplied. We are not proposing to lengthen the time for \nbackground checks, but clearly it would be a mistake to shorten it even \nfurther. Instead, we should do the right thing for both law enforcement \nand gun buyers and simply apply current law to all gun show sales. No \nlaw-abiding citizen will be denied the right to purchase a firearm \nunder my legislation. As under current law, if the 3 business days \nexpire before law enforcement identifies a violation that would \nprohibit the gun sale, the sale can go forward.\n  We are not trying to end gun shows, and we are not trying to deny any \nlaw-abiding American the right to purchase a gun. What we are trying to \nend is the free pass we're now giving to convicted felons when they can \nwalk into a guns how, find a private dealer, buy whatever weapons they \nwant, and walk out without a background check.\n  In overwhelming numbers, the American people believe that background \nchecks should be required for all gun show sales. The people of \nColorado and Oregon confirmed this last fall when they approved ballot \ninitiatives to close the guns show loophole. I want my colleagues to \nknow that I will take every opportunity early next year to bring the \nGun Show Background Check Act before the Senate for a vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation so that we can finally close the \ngun show loophole and make sure that convicted felons, domestic \nabusers, terrorists, and other prohibited persons do not use gun shows \nto purchase firearms without a Brady background check.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12221-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12221-S12222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OPEN THE HART BUILDING\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning on behalf of the \nresidents of the Hart Building who have been dispossessed as a \nconsequence of the anthrax incident. I am going to refer to a \nmemorandum of November 27 to all Senators relating to the cleanup of \nthe Senate buildings. The statement goes into some detail relative to \nprocedure. It is from the Senate Sergeant at Arms and it outlines the \nactivity that the various agencies--the Centers for Disease Control, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the FBI--are \ninvolved in in this process. It indicates the Environmental Protection \nAgency is the lead agency on the remediation--the cleanup--of the \nbuilding.\n  It further states that in addition to the extensive environmental \nsampling, the team has--\n\n       . . . finished remediation of common areas in the Hart \n     Building, including the atrium, walkways and the elevator in \n     the Southwest quadrant.\n\n  That is the good news.\n\n       Post-remediation sampling results for those common areas \n     are expected later this week.\n\n  That would have already passed.\n\n       Remediation of areas in the Hart Building which tested \n     positive for trace amounts of anthrax is underway. EPA is in \n     the process of detailing planning for the remediation of \n     affected offices, including those of Senators Feingold, \n     Baucus, Boxer, Corzine, Craig, Feinstein, Graham, Lieberman, \n     Lugar, Mikulski and Specter. EPA, the Sergeant at Arms, \n     and the Secretary of the Senate staff will be discussing \n     these plans with senior staff for the affected offices \n     this week.\n\n\n[[Page S12222]]\n\n\n  My understanding is those offices are in one core and Senator \nDaschle's office is the office where most of the spores were found.\n  They indicate that:\n\n       Senator Daschle's suite is being prepared for the \n     application of chlorine dioxide gas.\n\n  I gather that may be going on sometime this weekend. But:\n\n       According to the EPA's plan, the cleanup of the Daschle \n     suite would take place this weekend. The Dirksen Building and \n     the Hart-Dirksen garage will be closed . . . .\n\n  That is evidently underway today.\n  I also note in here that:\n\n       Following the discovery of an anthrax letter addressed to \n     Senator Leahy, environmental sampling of mail handling areas \n     in both the Russell and Dirksen Senate Office Buildings was \n     conducted on November 17th and 18th. The results of those \n     tests were negative except for trace positive results in the \n     mail handling areas of the offices of Senators Dodd and \n     Kennedy. Those areas were cleaned up on November 24th and \n     November 25th . . . .\n\n  So clearly they have satisfied themselves as to the adequacy of the \ncleanup of at least two offices, those of Senator Dodd and Senator \nKennedy. They have indicated they will reopen for business November 26, \nwhich is the case.\n\n       The Dirksen mailroom has been remediated, but is not yet \n     open for business . . . . Sampling of the off-site mail \n     facility is . . . complete--\n\n  And so forth.\n  There is Medical information.\n  Mail: It suggested mail deliveries will start this week and we will \nhave 5 to 6 weeks of back mail.\n  The interesting thing is it doesn't say a thing about when we are \nlikely to get back in the Hart Building. It is my understanding the \nstacks within the Hart Building are separated and the area of greatest \nconcern is still Senator Daschle's office. In discussing this with some \npeople involved at a level that clearly they have access, a suggestion \nhas been made that, since Senator Daschle's office is the area of \nconcern now, they simply seal that off.\n  Then the conversation went into, how do you seal it off if you have \nthe air ducts and air vents? Those can be blocked as well.\n  It is very inconvenient for those of us who are in the far stack, \nfurthest away from the area of the incident. We have been advised that \nour offices are clean, but we can't go in. Yet they say the common \nareas now are clean.\n  In a meeting with EPA, I asked them if this was really something \nunder consideration for a Superfund site. They looked at me rather \nstartled, as if they hadn't thought about that, but it may be.\n  We have to have someone speak with authority. Frankly, the leadership \nhere is not as inconvenienced as those of us who are not in the \nleadership because they have offices here in the Capitol. But speaking \nfor those of us who have been dispossessed for 5, going on 6 weeks, and \nevery indication is another week or another 2 weeks, we do not seem to \nbe able to get a conclusive decision on when we can get in, when they \nare going to be satisfied it is through--and somebody is going to have \nto sign off on this.\n\n  It seems to me they could simply seal off the office now that is \ndemanding their attention, seal off that air-conditioning or cut that \noff mechanically--you can do it--and let us get into our offices so we \ncan function. It is extraordinarily inconvenient. You can imagine \nwalking out of your office and just having to leave everything there.\n  But the worst part of it is we had been in that building 3 full days, \noperating, after the envelope was opened in Senator Daschle's office.\n  So I urge those responsible to get together and, for Heavens' sakes, \nfind a way to get us back into the rest of the building. If you have to \nseal Senator Tom Daschle's office, then go ahead and do it and get it \ncompleted.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend from Kansas. He and I are going \nto be with you for a while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be a cloture \nvote on this on Monday.\n  I am asking our colleagues to support us being able to get this issue \nbefore the body for a final vote, to vote for cloture on the Lott \namendment so we can get this issue in front of the body and get it \ndecided.\n  These are two critical issues. The issue of energy and our dependence \non foreign oil sources is becoming more and more obvious to people \naround the country and around the world. We are just too dependent on \nother places, places that are not reliable suppliers to the United \nStates.\n  Oil from Iraq, as Senator Murkowski has talked about frequently, is \ncertainly not a reliable supply to the United States. Yet we are \ndependent on it. There are growing questions about Saudi Arabia, about \nthe reliability of Saudi Arabia and the oil resources from there. \nClearly, we should be having an energy policy and an energy strategy to \nremove ourselves from some of the dependency, particularly in the \nPersian Gulf region, for our oil and natural gas supplies. We need to \ndo this energy policy, and do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12222-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12222-S12223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HUMAN CLONING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to particularly address the \nissue of human cloning and the part of the bill that puts forth a 6-\nmonth moratorium on human cloning. I brought up before this body \nseveral times this week a U.S. News & World Report cover story of this \nweek about the first human clone. Advanced Cell Technology out of \nMassachusetts is now saying they have cloned the first human being.\n  We have to address this issue now or we are going to have to expect \nmore stories such as this about the further development of human \ncloning before this body has spoken. The House has spoken and said they \ndon't want to have human clones. They put forth a complete ban, and \npassed it by a large bipartisan majority, a 100-vote margin. The \nPresident said: Let's ban human cloning. We don't want to create humans \nfor destructive purposes or for reproductive purposes in this fashion. \nHe has asked for banning that. This body has failed to act.\n  That is why we are putting forward at this time this request for a 6-\nmonth moratorium: Time out; hold up, so we don't have moratoriums such \nas this while this body takes time to deliberate, hold the committee \nhearings, and do the things it needs to do to consider this issue. We \nare asking for a timeout moratorium for 6 months.\n  I want to make several points and cite various groups that are \nsupporting the moratorium or even the entire banning of human cloning. \nI want to read some important articles which they have put forward. I \nwill make several points over the following days, weeks, and months.\n  One point is that research cloning being sponsored by Advanced Cell \nTechnology requires eggs to be harvested from a woman. Harvesting eggs \nis an invasive and dangerous procedure. Harvesting eggs from women \nmeans the use of super-ovulatory drugs, the\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\nuse of which has been linked to higher risks of ovarian cancer. The \nrisk is one, a woman can take for a variety of reasons; one of them \nbeing to help have children. However, women are being asked to incur \nthis risk to ``donate'' their eggs solely for money. Women who sell \ntheir eggs to firms like Advanced Cell Technology will likely \ndisproportionately be of women who are already somewhat \ndisenfranchised, or of lower income. In fact, it is now known that \nAdvanced Cell Technology paid $4,000 to each woman who ``donated'' her \neggs.\n\n  I would say that is probably more than a donation if you pay $4,000 \nfor the egg. I suggest if this doesn't qualify as exploitation of the \ndisenfranchised for profiteering motives, I am not sure what does.\n  This is not just a pro-life or pro-choice debate. It is not that at \nall.\n  In fact, pro-choice feminist Judy Norsigian and biologist Stuart \nNewman recently commented in a Boston Globe column,\n\n       Because embryo cloning will compromise women's health, turn \n     their eggs and wombs into commodities, compromise their \n     reproductive autonomy and, with virtual certainty, lead to \n     the production of ``experimental'' human beings, we are \n     convinced that the line must be drawn here.\n\n  That is strong language. Experimental human beings, eggs and wombs \nturned into commodities, and compromising women's health.\n  Perhaps that is why this debate is not a debate, as someone \nsuggested, on the issue of abortion. And perhaps that is why we have an \ninteresting coalition forming of groups that are strongly opposed to \nabortion, groups that strongly support abortion, environmentalists, and \nothers. The reason for the broad range of interest is that there is \ntruly something about this issue which should concern all of us.\n  I would like to read a few of the articles appearing in recent months \nfor the benefit of some of my colleagues. The first article is by \nSophia Kolehmainen of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a pro-\nchoice group chaired by Claire Nader. Claire is the sister of Ralph \nNader, the Presidential candidate. She was actively involved in the \nPresidential campaign. This is what their group had to say about human \ncloning. This is the article they put forward. It is entitled ``Human \nCloning: Brave New Mistake.''\n\n       It would be a mistake to develop and use cloning as a \n     technique to replicate human beings. It is questionable \n     whether and what benefits would be gained from the successful \n     creation of a cloned human being, and whether they would \n     justify the radical impact cloning would have on our society. \n     Cloning is not just another reproductive technology that \n     should be made available to those who choose to use it, but \n     is an unnecessary and dangerous departure from evolutionary \n     processes and social practices that have developed over \n     millions of years. As with many other developments in \n     biotechnology, some scientists and commentators are asking us \n     to accept cloning of humans just because it is technically \n     possible, but there are few good reasons to develop the \n     technology, and many reasons not to develop it.\n\n\n                           1. safety concerns\n\n       The most frequently stated argument against cloning is \n     based on safety concerns. At this point in the process of \n     experimenting with cloning, such concerns are important. The \n     production of Dolly required at least 276 failed attempts. No \n     one knows why most of these attempts failed and only one \n     succeeded. From a technical viewpoint, cloning presents \n     different obstacles in every species, since embryo \n     implantation, development, and gestation differ among \n     different species. Human cloning therefore could not become a \n     reality without extensive human experimentation. Though 276 \n     ``failed'' lambs may be acceptable losses, the ethical \n     implications of any failed or only partially successful human \n     experiments are unacceptable.\n\n  Some of their article I don't necessarily agree with, but I am \nreading through their arguments.\n\n                           2. commodification\n\n       Cloning would encourage the commodification of humans. \n     Though industrialized societies commodify human labor and \n     human lives, the biological commodification involved in human \n     cloning would be of a vastly different order. Cloning would \n     turn procreation into a manufacturing process, where human \n     characteristics become added options and children become \n     objects of deliberate design. Such a process of \n     commodification needs to be actively opposed. It produces no \n     benefits and undermines the very basis of our established \n     notions of human individuality and dignity.\n\n\n                              3. diversity\n\n       Cloning would also disrespect human diversity in ethnicity \n     and ability. Though it is, in fact, not possible to produce \n     exact copies of animals or people, inherent in cloning is the \n     desire to do so. The process of cloning would necessarily \n     contribute to genetic uniformity by decreasing genetic \n     variety. A society that supported cloning as an acceptable \n     procreative technique would imply that human diversity is not \n     important. Especially in a multicultural nation like the \n     United States, where diversity and difference are at the root \n     of our cultural existence, any procedure that would reduce \n     our acceptance of differences would be dangerous. It is clear \n     from the tensions that exist in our society that we should \n     encourage processes that increase our appreciation for \n     diversity among individuals, not working to remove \n     differences.\n\n  Dr. Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, put forward \na strong statement in opposition to human cloning. This is a pro-choice \ngroup which put forward a strong statement in opposition to cloning for \nmany of the same reasons that I have put forward.\n  There are other groups that are putting forward clear and convincing \nreasons why we should not do cloning. For those reasons and many \nothers, I ask this body to take up the bill numbered 2505 on Monday, \nand vote for cloture on the moratorium prohibiting human cloning for 6 \nmonths. There is ample reason for us to have a moratorium for 6 months.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12223-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12223-S12224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT REFORM BILL, ENERGY LEGISLATION, AND ANWR\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to address three issues on \nwhich we will be voting in the Senate on Monday: The railroad \nretirement reform bill, the comprehensive energy legislation, and the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge legislation.\n  First of all, I would like to express my support for the railroad \nretirement reform bill. As thousands of Georgians who have contacted my \noffice in support of this legislation will state, action by the Senate \non this legislation is long overdue. I was pleased to support the \ncloture vote that occurred yesterday to move to this legislation.\n  The House of Representatives passed this legislation more than once \nby overwhelming, bipartisan majorities, and the Senate version has 74 \ncosponsors, including my sponsorship. I think this bill should receive \nthe same opportunity for a vote. Not only would current and former \nemployees benefit from this legislation but also the widows and \nwidowers of former employees.\n  This legislation is the result of a long effort by both industry and \nlabor to reform the railroad retirement system. Not often does Congress \nhave the opportunity to vote on a cooperative effort supported by \nvirtually everybody affected in the industry. We have that opportunity \nnow. We should take advantage of it. We would be remiss to ignore it \nand not support it.\n  We have heard from the small numbers of Senators who threaten this \nbill's ability to make it to the President's desk. These same \ncolleagues joined me in support of a tax break package earlier this \nyear which cost more than $1 trillion. At that time, we supported the \ntax legislation because of the potential economic stimulus it could \nprovide. I say reforming the railroad retirement system will also \nprovide such stimulus by freeing up funds that could be reinvested in \nthe economy by the over 1 million active and retired rail workers and \ntheir families and the rail companies.\n\n  This country exploded as the railroads moved west. It was the \nphysical incarnation of manifest destiny. Since the time these initial \ncourageous workers linked this country, hundreds of thousands of \nworkers have followed in their footsteps to maintain and expand their \nwork. These workers and their families would benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and \nprovide long overdue reform to the railroad retirement system.\n  However, this railroad retirement bill is not the appropriate vehicle \nto address comprehensive energy legislation. It is essential that we \npass a comprehensive energy bill that, No. 1, provides consumers with \naffordable and reliable energy; No. 2, increases domestic energy \nsupplies in a responsible manner; No. 3, invests in energy efficiency\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\nand renewable energy sources; and, No. 4, protects the environment and \npublic health.\n  The inclusion of renewable energy sources is vital because I believe \nenergy sources, such as wind, geothermal, solar, hydropower, and \nbiomass, along with energy-efficient technologies, will help offset \nfuel imports, create numerous employment opportunities, and actually \nenhance export markets.\n  Finally, I would like to address my particular concerns about opening \nup the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.\n  Earlier this year, my colleagues who supported ANWR drilling argued \nthat U.S. gas prices were out of control and therefore ANWR needed to \nbe drilled immediately. Since then, gas prices have fallen \ndramatically, despite the war in Afghanistan. In fact, over the \nThanksgiving holiday, I returned to Georgia and I routinely saw gas \nprices in Georgia substantially below $1 a gallon. As a matter of fact, \nI did see some prices at 76 cents a gallon. Those prices have not been \nseen at the pumps in more than a year.\n  Since September 11, the price per barrel of oil has dropped $12 to \nthe current price of $18 per barrel. ANWR does not need to be drilled \nbut rather protected so generations from now can see its beauty as we \nsee it today.\n  I will support efforts to protect ANWR from drilling, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, \nis recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12224-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12224-S12227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DRILLING IN ANWR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to this Chamber--and I am \npleased to do so after the excellent statement by my friend and \ncolleague from Georgia--to speak about the addition of the House energy \nbill to the railroad retirement bill before us. This amendment is the \nwrong amendment offered at the wrong time.\n  The House energy bill, with all due respect, is, in my opinion, an \nunwise proposal that was written really for a different time, as \nSenator Cleland's remarks not only suggest but illustrate quite \nspecifically. The bill proposes to open the Arctic Refuge for drilling, \nwhich is bad environmental policy and bad energy policy.\n  We will soon have the opportunity to give our Nation's long-term \nenergy strategy the thoughtful consideration that it deserves and that \nthe American people deserve. I look forward to the introduction by the \nmajority leader, soon, of his balanced, comprehensive energy bill, and \nI look forward to debating it when we return after the first of the \nyear.\n  We should not be attempting to pass such significant legislation \ndealing with so fundamental and complicated a problem as America's \nenergy needs and systems in such a summary fashion as an amendment to a \nbill of this kind. We should, and I am confident will, give it the \nthorough, thoughtful, balanced debate after the first of the year.\n  We owe it to the American people to determine whether the measure \nbefore us is a responsible and responsive solution to our energy needs \nor simply a distraction. To determine that, we do not need to hold up \npictures of baby caribou or mother polar bears, although I find those \npictures not only attractive but moving. We only need to ask a very \nbusinesslike question: What do we gain and what do we lose from \ndrilling for oil in ANWR?\n  I think, when we work that question back dispassionately to an \nanswer, we see the error of the proposal to drill in the Arctic Refuge \nthat is before the Senate today and will be voted on on Monday, \nprocedurally at least.\n  I can tell you what we gain in probably less than a minute. It would \ntake days to catalog what we lose. I am prepared, if necessary, if the \noccasion arises, to take days to talk about and catalog what we will \nlose as a nation if we drill in the Arctic Refuge.\n  So let me start with what I believe, in fairness, we would gain.\n  Even if oil companies started drilling tomorrow in the refuge--which, \nof course, is never going to happen that quickly--even if we mistakenly \nadopted this legislation, it would take at least 10 years for any crude \nto be delivered to refineries. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates \nthere is, at best, a 6-month supply of economically recoverable oil--a \nyield that would be spread over 50 years.\n  What are the costs?\n  The visible damage, of course, would be substantial: An environmental \ntreasure permanently lost, hundreds of species threatened, \ninternational agreements jeopardized, oil spills further endangering \nthe Alaskan landscape, and an increase in air pollution and greenhouse \ngas emissions, among other costs.\n  The unseen damage of drilling would be just as real: A nation lulled \ninto believing it has taken a step toward energy independence--\narguably, by its supporters, a large step--when, in fact, it has done \nno such thing; a nation believing it is extracting oil in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way, when, in fact, no methods have been \ndiscovered that can avoid damage to this beautiful, untouched \nwilderness area of America; all in all, the American people misled on a \nhost of critical issues. Finally, this plan would threaten something \neven more precious than what I have mentioned; that is, some of our \nmost treasured American values, including the fundamental American \nvalue of conserving, conservation, conserving what the Good Lord has \ngiven us in natural treasures in the 50 American States.\n\n  The first claim that my colleagues make is that drilling in the \nArctic is a necessary part of a balanced, long-term energy strategy. \nBut, respectfully, calling this part of a strategic energy plan is as \nif to call crude oil a beverage; it is literally and figuratively hard \nto swallow. This ill-considered plan will do nothing to wean us from \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  Drilling in the Alaskan national wildlife refuge is, in fact, a \npipeline dream, a decision that will produce just a slight uptick in \nour oil production 10 years down the road and at considerable cost to \nour environment, our values, and our policies. It will create far fewer \njobs than dozens of smarter alternatives which depend on American \ntechnology and American innovation and American industry.\n  The much quoted study indicating that Arctic drilling would result in \n750,000 jobs has since been widely discredited. Even its authors have \nacknowledged that its methodology was flawed. Now the agreed-upon job \ncreation figure is much closer to 43,000, and all of those jobs are \nshort term, as opposed to the permanent jobs that would be created \nthrough the development of other alternative, innovative forms of \nenergy, including conservation.\n  This plan also does not move us one step closer to the very valuable, \ncritical goal of energy independence. First, it will take at least a \ndecade to bring to market any oil that might be discovered in the \nrefuge, making it useless in the context of the current international \ncrisis. Incidentally, there is a conservative estimate from the \nDepartment of the Interior during the administration of former \nPresident Bush that has since been reiterated by many people, including \noil industry executives, and that is the 10-year lead-in time.\n  Secondly, we should realize that Alaskan crude oil is not shipped \neast of the Rocky Mountains, meaning that none of this oil is refined \ninto home heating oil that is used in the entire Northeast and other \nparts of Middle America. Further, oil supplies are not needed for the \nproduction of electricity. Nationwide, only 2 percent of electricity is \ngenerated by oil.\n  Finally, let's realize that increasing our dependence on oil as a \nsource of energy is no way to wean ourselves off foreign oil in the \nlong run. The statistics repeated frequently make it clear that we \ncannot drill our way into energy independence. The United States uses \nabout 25 percent of the world's oil but possesses only 2 percent of its \nreserves. So the way to energy independence is clearly through \nconservation, through using less than 25 percent of the world's oil and \nfor the development of new technologies that will provide genuine \nenergy independence.\n  The most important step, of course, we can take is reducing oil use \nin the transportation sector, which is responsible for over two-thirds \nof the oil consumed in the United States, and it is climbing. We can do \nthat with technological methods that are in reach. Many of them are in \nour grasp already in our vehicles.\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\n  Arctic Refuge oil is simply not the most secure source of energy for \nthe Nation. Of course, I am not suggesting that those who support \ndrilling in the refuge are in any way neglecting our Nation's energy \nsecurity. None of my colleagues would say that of those of us who \noppose drilling in the Arctic Refuge. We all agree that we want to \nachieve energy independence and greater energy security. Our difference \nis about the methods and means for doing so.\n\n  At the same time, we have to realize the irony of the present \nsituation. Just as we enter an age of heightened awareness regarding \npotential security risks at our nuclear plants and our other energy \nproduction centers, many Members of Congress are set on pursuing an \nalternative that, on top of its other liabilities, happens to be less \nsecure than many other options. They are more difficult to secure than \nmany other options. The fact is that the 25-year-old Trans-Alaskan \nPipeline itself is vulnerable to disruption. More than half of it is \nelevated and indefensible. It has already been bombed twice years ago \nand shot at more recently. And the pipeline today is beset with \naccelerated corrosion, erosion, and stress.\n  There is, of course, one other critical reason we oppose this plan, \nand that is the damage it will do to the Arctic Refuge itself. We \nshould not countenance such a blatant broadside on one of the jewels of \nAmerica's environment. This threat, to me, is made even more \nfrustrating by the claim that supporters of drilling have made that the \nrefuge can be opened up to oil exploration in an environmentally \nsensitive manner. The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge is known as \nthe American Serengeti. It is inhabited by 135 species of birds, 45 \nspecies of land mammals. The plain crosses all five different echo-\nregions of the Arctic.\n  It is a very beautiful picture--until you add oil exploration. I urge \nmy colleagues to look very carefully at the suggestion that the result \nof oil drilling in the refuge would just be a small blemish on the \ngrand landscape of the refuge--a little worm hole on a nice red apple. \nFirst, there will be a series of blemishes--dozens of holes that will \nbe connected together by roads, pipelines, and other infrastructure; \nspidering out from these blemishes would be an elaborate additional \ninfrastructure of roads, pipelines, air strips, and processing plants.\n  The web would almost certainly include permanent facilities, such as \nroads, airstrips, docks, staging areas, central processing facilities, \ngathering centers, compressor plants, seawater injection plants, gas \nprocessing plants, power stations, guard stations, housing and \nmaintenance facilities, utility lines, garbage disposal sites, gravel \npits, and more. In the end, it would make a terrible change in this \nrefuge.\n  Mr. President, the House bill, as you know, limited development in \nthe refuge to 2,000 acres. But it is critically important for my \ncolleagues to understand that that figure expressly excludes roads and \npipelines and fails to define the acreage as contiguous. So the \nillusion of minimal impact is just that; it is an imaginary landscape \npainted in oil.\n  Quite simply, we are forced to make a choice between this magnificent \npiece of America and its preservation for all the generations that will \nfollow us as Americans and the development of this refuge for oil. I \nhave made mine, and I believe the American people support it. Why? \nBecause conserving our great open spaces is fundamentally an \naffirmation of our core values.\n  Conservation is not a Democratic or Republican value; it is a \nquintessential American value. The ethic of conservation tells us that \nit is not only sentimentally difficult to part with beautiful \nwilderness, it is practically unwise because in doing so we deny future \ngenerations a precious piece of our common culture.\n  Let's remember, in the aftermath of September 11, that most Americans \nhave been stepping back and asking themselves what is important, what \ndo we value. I believe that millions of our fellow Americans have, \namong other things, come to the conclusion, alongside family and faith, \nthat they value America's great natural resources.\n  Let me recall, finally, the words of the great President Teddy \nRoosevelt, who, back in 1916, seemed to understand this issue very \nclearly. He wrote:\n\n       The ``greatest good for the greatest number'' applies to \n     the number within womb of time, compared to which those now \n     alive form but an insignificant fraction. Our duty to the \n     whole, including the unborn generations, bids us to restrain \n     an unprincipled present-day minority from wasting the \n     heritage of these unborn generations. The movement for the \n     conservation of wildlife and the larger movement for the \n     conservation of all our natural resources are essentially \n     democratic in spirit, purpose, and method.\n\n  I could not say it more eloquently or more directly than the great \nTR.\n  I thank my colleagues. I hope they will vote this amendment down and \nwe will return to a full and wholesome debate of our energy policies \nafter the first of the year.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could enter into a \ncolloquy with my friend from Connecticut.\n  The Senator from Alaska would inquire whether the Senator from \nConnecticut has ever been invited up to the area by the Native people \nof Alaska and the residents of Kaktovik who are in a position where \nthey have 95,000 acres of their own land. They have the village of \nKaktovik, and they don't even have the authority to drill for natural \ngas to heat their homes.\n  I noted in the presentation from the Senator there was no reference \nto the interest of the people who live in the area. And for his \nedification, we have pictures of those communities and those children \nand the hopes and aspirations of those individual Alaskans who are \nlooking for a better way of life, looking for alternative jobs, better \nhealth standards, and better education, and it seems to me that we \nought to have some concern for their livelihood.\n  They support opening this area. Yet all the emphasis seems to be on \nthe environmental issues associated with ANWR. It appears in almost \nevery presentation we have heard on the other side of this issue that \nthe needs of the people are overlooked.\n  This is a picture of the town hall in Kaktovik. We have children on a \nsnow machine and a bicycle. The point of these pictures is that there \nare real people living there. There is very little consideration given \nto their wishes or views.\n  These are the kids going to school. You notice that they are Eskimo \nchildren. They, too, have hopes and aspirations.\n  Now, if I can show you the next chart, perhaps my friend who has \nnever been there can understand this area over here. This undeformed \nand deformed area consists of 1.5 million acres of ANWR. Now I know the \nSenator knows there are 19 million acres in ANWR. So this is the only \narea at risk. But as you see over here, this is the 95,000 acres that \nare owned by the Natives of Kaktovik, but they are precluded; they have \nno access.\n  Now, I would ask the Senator if that is a fair and equitable solution \nto keep any American citizen bound, if you will, by Federal \nrestrictions that don't allow them to develop their own land.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in responding to my friend and \ncolleague from Alaska, it is my conclusion that the Native peoples of \nAlaska are of mixed opinion on this question of drilling for oil in the \nArctic refuge. We have certainly heard testimony here in the Senate \nfrom differing points of view. I hear what the Senator said about this \ngroup of Native people. Obviously, we have heard very eloquent \ntestimony from representatives of the Gwich'in people in the area who \nhave made a different choice and want to preserve what they have \ndescribed as part of not only the beauty of the environment but part of \ntheir spiritual heritage as a source of life in that area.\n  So I would say my judgment is that opinion is mixed, and my opinion \nis that, having made this choice, it would be a shame to have to do the \ndamage that oil exploration would do to the refuge to find adequate and \nuplifting employment for the people to which the Senator from Alaska \nrefers. There ought to be a better way.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would certainly agree there ought to be a better \nway. Perhaps the Senator is not aware of the public opinion on this \nissue and how it has changed rather dramatically.\n  This is a poll that was done by IPSOS-Reid firm, well-known, and the \nhighlights of the poll indicate 95 percent of Americans say Federal \naction\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\non energy is important, and 72 percent say passing an energy bill is a \nhigher priority than any other action Congress might take. Seventy-\nthree percent of Americans say Congress should make the energy bill \npart of President Bush's stimulus plan, and 67 percent of Americans say \nexploration of new energy sources in the United States, including \nAlaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is convincing reason to \nsupport passing an energy policy bill.\n  I would be happy to provide this to the Senator from Connecticut \nbecause I think it provides some reality of the interests of our State \nin reference to development possibilities. Connecticut is a developed \nState, in population and land patterns, and so forth. But if you had \nhad an opportunity to visit Alaska you would get some idea that we are \na pretty big hunk of real estate. We have 365 million acres in our \nState.\n  When you use the phrase ``this huge area at risk,'' I think you are \nbeing a little incomplete in your reference to what Congress has \nalready restricted in this area. The ANWR area is 19 million acres. \nThat is the size of the State of South Carolina. If you look at the \nmap, you will see where it is as far as its makeup in comparison with \nthe entire State. But what we have done, what Congress has done I think \nis a pretty good job of conservation. Out of the 19 million acres, they \nhave made 8\\1/2\\ million acres into a wilderness in perpetuity, and \nthey left this other area untouched by Congress when they set aside the \ncoastal plain specifically for determination back in 1980 because of \nthe prospects for major oil and gas discoveries. Now the footprint \nhere, as you indicate in your statement, under the current bill, H.R. \n4, is 2,000 acres. That is not very much. But when you indicate ``all \nthis development'', this is written obviously by some of the \nenvironmental groups, and they are very much opposed to this because we \nhave an infrastructure already built, 800 miles of pipeline.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut had been here and debated the issue \nof whether or not to open up Prudhoe Bay, we would be dealing with \nexactly the same issues, only some that are more complex, because the \nconcern was: What happens when you build an 800-mile pipeline across \nthe breadth of Alaska? Are the animals going to cross under it, over \nit, or will there be a fence? Will it be a hot pipeline? In permafrost? \nWill it melt, and so forth?\n  This pipeline is owned by the three major oil companies in the \ncountry: Exxon, British Petroleum, and Phillips Petroleum. It is in \ntheir best interest to keep it up. So these allegations that somehow \nthis is unsafe--they continually maintain it. As you know, in any \nindustrial activity, there is a certain amount of wear and tear, and so \nforth. But it is one of the construction wonders of the world. It is \nalready in. So this infrastructure you are generalizing is not going to \noccur.\n  You have the airport here in Kaktovik. You have the residents there, \nbut the technology is different currently because we use ice roads. We \ndon't use permanent roads. That is the technology that is developed. \nThis picture shows the kind of ice road that we do in Alaska. We do it \nall in the wintertime. As consequence, there is no gravel. Most of the \npipeline construction that will take place will be on the surface. But \nif you look at the compatibility of what happens with the pipeline, it \nis very friendly to some of the wildlife.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut perhaps has seen this. This is a \npicture of Prudhoe Bay, and these are not stuffed animals. They are \nreal. Here is another one relative to what the bears are doing to the \npipeline. It beats walking in the snow.\n  So a lot of these generalizations are exaggerated. What is not \nexaggerated is there is no sensitivity to the residents of the area. To \nsuggest somehow the Gwich'ins, who are a population based mostly in \nCanada, are opposed entirely to oil and gas exploration is a bit \nextreme. Three-quarters of the Gwich'ins live in Canada, and the \nGwich'ins in Canada have developed a corporation and are now drilling \non Gwich'in land in Canada, and the Gwich'ins in Alaska for the most \npart are funded by the Sierra Club in their efforts to terminate this. \nI have copies of the leases they signed. The Native village of Ekwok--\nwhich is adjacent to the route of the Porcupine caribou--they have sold \ntheir own leases for oil and gas exploration in Alaska. They are \nlooking for jobs as well. There is more to this than meets the eye.\n  I wonder if the Senator is aware that the Gwich'ins have leased their \nland previously in Alaska, and they leased it specifically for oil \ndevelopment back in, I think it was 1984?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I had not heard that, of course, but I \nam glad to pursue the question. What I have heard is the very fervent \nand, I found, compelling testimony of the Gwich'in people who have come \nto Congress to speak to us against drilling in the refuge.\n  I will say a few words in response, if I may, to what the Senator \nfrom Alaska said. Alaska is a big piece of real estate. I believe those \nwere the words used. Connecticut is a small piece of real estate. It is \nmore developed, although the last time I looked, more than two-thirds \nof our State of Connecticut and the great popular sentiment in the \nState was to limit development, to preserve those natural spaces. For \nthe same reasons, there is a national movement of support for \npreserving the great, very unusual, natural spaces in Alaska.\n  I say also, from the experts I have talked to, the area involved is \nreally unique. The coastal plain is the biological heart of the whole \nrefuge. So it has to be given a special status.\n  I quote from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, that the effects of \ndisturbance and displacement of the Porcupine caribou herd are likely \nto occur more rapidly and at a much greater scale if oil development is \nallowed in the refuge. The accumulative effects of reduced access to \nthe coastal plain habitat caused by industrial development would be a \nmajor adverse impact on the herd. Notwithstanding the pictures we have \nseen, that is the expert judgment given in a letter to our colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  Finally, most every poll I have seen still shows American public \nopinion opposed to drilling in the refuge, even at a time when concern \nabout energy has risen. I suppose this gets to a point that sounds like \nthe old line about economists, that if you lay them end to end across \nthe world, they would not reach a conclusion.\n  I will present other polls. The most recent I have seen taken by the \nMellman Group, based on a national survey of 1,000 U.S. voters that was \nconducted in early October, found that 57 percent of Americans did not \nbelieve drilling in the refuge would reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. An independent poll taken by Gallup from October 8 to 11 showed a \nmajority of Americans, 51 percent, opposed oil exploration in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Beyond the polling, as I said earlier, to me this is a matter of \nnational principles, national values, national policies, what makes \ncommon sense in terms of achieving energy security and energy \nindependence, energy efficiency, which my friend from Alaska and I, and \nI presume all Members of the Senate, have as common goals.\n\n  While public opinion is significant--and I am glad, according to the \npolls I cited, it is on our side in the debate --about whether to drill \nin the Arctic Refuge, ultimately I think we all have to make our \njudgment about what is best for our country. My judgment is that \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge for oil would not be best for our \ncountry.\n  I apologize to my friend from Alaska that I have a previous \ncommitment and I have to leave. I have a feeling we will return to this \ndebate again after the first of the year and probably at length. I have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Alaska, so I look forward to that \ndebate. Hopefully the result will be more knowledge and perhaps even a \nbit of wisdom.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate the comments. I can assure the Senator \nfrom Connecticut that the Senator from Alaska intends to bring this \nmatter up to a vote, as does my Senate colleague, Senator Stevens.\n  The frustrating thing is we are always put in a position of having to \nidentify with detail and rationale the reasons we believe the 1002 Area \ncould be opened safely. Of course, we come from the State and we know \nsomething about the State and the factual information. What we have \nattempted to do over the years is to encourage Members to come and see \nfor themselves so they can make a fair evaluation, because\n\n[[Page S12227]]\n\nthe action taken by the mass will determine what happens in our State.\n  It seems to put us in a position where what is best for Alaska and \nwhat is best for our constituents based on what they tell us they want \nis somewhat overridden by the dictate of those outside the state. We \nhappen to be the only State still under development. We came in with \nHawaii, but obviously we are a State with huge resources. We have 56 \nmillion acres of wilderness in our State. I think somebody figured out \nhow much oil there is in ANWR and the comparison of whether it is a \nviable supply. They did a calculation, and based on 10 billion barrels, \nit would amount to a supply for Connecticut for 126\\1/2\\ years.\n  I see my colleague has had to leave to take a phone call, but I am \ngoing to be answering throughout the day some of his generalizations \nbecause, frankly, they do not hold water, and they certainly do not \nhold oil. He indicated a willingness to proceed on a very studied and \ntimely process he hopes will be reflected in the bill we understand is \ncoming down, not from the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee but, rather, from the majority leader.\n  We have been working on this legislation in committee for several \nyears. We have held extensive hearings. So it is not something that has \nnot had a great deal of forethought, has not had a great deal of \nconsideration. It was removed, through the dictates of the majority \nleader, from the committee of jurisdiction. It has been taken away from \nthe committee, and whatever bill we will be seeing will not be \nrepresentative of a bipartisan effort but strictly the result of \nSenator Daschle and I assume others on their side of the aisle. So we \nwill be right back in the same position we were on the Finance \nCommittee relative to the manner in which the stimulus package was \nsubmitted. It was submitted on one side, and the Republicans had no \ninput into it.\n  The point is this Nation needs a policy, regardless of what poll we \nsee, on the issue of national energy security.\n  There is virtually total support we should have an energy bill.\n  Now the merits of ANWR obviously get us into a discussion, but we \nbelieve that dramatically there has been a turnaround in public \nopinion. One of the reasons that turnaround has occurred is the \nrealization of what happened off Iraq a few weeks ago where we were \nboarding a tanker. We had the U.S. Navy inspecting the tanker for the \nspecific purpose of determining whether Saddam Hussein was exporting \noil above and beyond that of the guidelines of the U.N. They boarded \nthis ship. The ship sank. Two American sailors died. That might not \nhave been necessary had our previous President not vetoed a bill in \n1995 that would have allowed the opening of ANWR because that did pass \nthis body in 1995.\n  These are what ifs, I know, but nevertheless, to suggest somehow we \ncannot do this safely is basically incorrect. That we would not get oil \nfor 10 years is totally incorrect. We will have oil within 18 months to \n2 years because we only have about 60 miles of pipeline. To say it is a \n6-month supply is not accurate because that would presume no other \ndomestic production anywhere in the U.S., and no imports of oil. Under \nwhat realistic circumstance would all other oil production be \nterminated in the United States as well as imports coming in? ANWR is \nestimated to hold between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels. If it is half \nthat, it will be as large as Prudhoe Bay, which has supplied this \nNation with 25 percent of its oil for the last 27 years. Many of the \nopponents who are going to speak against this have not been up there. \nThey have not met with the Native people who are affected. Our people \nin Alaska, as American citizens, deserve that consideration.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator from Alaska and I thank \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Hawaii, who is kind enough to \nstay a couple of moments extra before I take the chair so that I might \nmake a couple of remarks.\n  I compliment and encourage the bipartisan efforts among the \nleadership in meeting with the President to discuss how to best proceed \non an economic stimulus package.\n  The efforts of those negotiators, in the framework set out last night \nwhereby the top elected leadership of both parties in this Chamber will \napproach their efforts with the leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and come to an agreement with regard to a stimulus \npackage and taxes, is clearly a step in the right direction. We do need \na stimulus package. We need it as soon as possible. We need it \noperative by the end of this year.\n  A few days ago, the National Bureau of Economic Research declared the \nU.S. economy has been in a recession since March. Some have responded \nto that announcement by saying since 6 months have already transpired, \nand since our average recession is typically less than 11 months, there \nwas not a need to pass an economic stimulus package. They would say our \neconomy at this point would likely recover on its own.\n  I disagree with those conclusions. That is why I think we ought to \nmove ahead with a stimulus package. That has all the more been brought \nto light by virtue of the announcement made by the administration \nyesterday that indeed the surpluses we were counting on projecting over \nthe next several years are not going to be there. In fact, the sad news \nwas that we were going to be in deficit financing; that is, spending \nmore in any one year than we have had coming in tax revenue.\n\n  How quickly things have changed. Just a few months ago we were still \ntalking about the beneficence of projected surpluses over the course of \nthe next 10 years and how we were going to be able to take care of a \nlot of the spending needs, including--this was prior to September 11--\nthe increased defense costs that clearly were a priority, and still be \nable to have substantial tax cuts and preserve the integrity of the \nSocial Security trust fund surplus so it was untouched. Therefore, that \nsurplus was going to pay off the national debt over the course of the \nnext decade.\n  Now all of that has been knocked in a cocked hat because of the \nslowed economy, the lessened surplus projected over the next decade, \nand then because we enacted a huge tax cut, a tax cut that over 10 \nyears was in excess of $2 trillion. The effect of that has led to the \npresent economic malaise and economic projections so that now the \nadministration is saying we will have deficit spending over the next 3 \nyears.\n  It is with a heavy heart suddenly we have to face these new \nconditions. It is all the more important to have a stimulus package. \nClearly, in my State, the State of Florida, we are feeling the effects \nbig time. We are feeling the effects big time also because of September \n11, the fear factor out there of people not wanting to get on an \nairplane. I have said many times from this desk--and I fly every \nweekend at least twice--I think it is safe to fly. However, there are \nstill a lot of people who do not think it is safe to fly. As a result, \nthey will fly for business reasons, but they will not fly for leisure \nand vacations.\n  There are parts of this country that are highly economically \ndevastated. One such place is the capital city of the State of the \nPresiding Officer, Honolulu. Another is the largest tourist destination \nin the world, Orlando, FL.\n  Another is Miami, with its robust cruise tourism business. Another is \nLas Vegas. We can look at the list of cities that as part of their \neconomy are inextricably entwined with travel and tourism. We can see \nthe economic devastation. When the leisure travelers are not flying, \nthey are not getting into the hotels; when they are not getting into \nthe hotels, they are not going into the restaurants, they are not going \ninto the gift shops, and they are not going to the tourist attractions. \nAs a result, we see the economic devastation.\n  As wartime conditions continue, we should expect to see a continued \nloss of tax revenue due to the precipitous drop in travel and tourism \nand the overall economic activity. While every State has been affected \nto some degree, and travel and tourism is one of the top 3 industries \nin 30 of our 50 States, clearly States such as the State of the \nPresiding Officer and my State of Florida have been uniquely impacted \ndue to the significant presence of the tourism and aviation industries \nin those States.\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\n  For example, since the end of September, the average daily \nunemployment claims for Florida have risen by 55 percent, translating \ninto approximately 50,000 more Floridians applying for unemployment \nbenefits. That is mind-boggling. That is staggering.\n  The unemployment rate in Florida is expected to peak at 6.1 percent \nnext summer. The latest State forecast anticipates 120,000 lost jobs by \nthe end of June, with an additional 115,000 jobs lost in the following \nfiscal year. And that is only in one State, my State of Florida.\n  So these statistics show that we still need help, a tremendous amount \nof it. As we speak today, Florida's State Legislature is meeting in the \ncapital city of Tallahassee once again, trying to rewrite the State \nbudget to make up for more than $1.3 billion in lost revenue, while \nalso trying to fund rising unemployment claims and skyrocketing \nassistance needs of those, the least fortunate among us.\n  So while it is entirely possible that we have already seen the worst \nof our economic drops--I certainly hope that is the case--the \nramifications of these losses will be felt by Florida and many other \nStates for many months and possibly for years to come.\n  There is no time to waste. We must pass a stimulus package as soon as \npossible. The substance of that package is clearly the very sticking \npoint where we have substantive disagreement among lawmakers, not only \nin the Senate but at the other end of the hall in the House of \nRepresentatives. There is significant disagreement between that body \nand this body. Yet there are still many areas on which we can agree: \nincreasing unemployment benefits, helping the unemployed maintain their \nhealth insurance, helping our States ride out a recession with fewer \nFederal spending cuts. At the same time, we must provide assistance to \nour smaller and medium-sized businesses, and to those sectors that have \nbeen hardest hit in these difficult times. Those are the things we can \nagree on, and we ought to come together in the stimulus package and \nmake that happen.\n  Once again, I applaud the continued efforts of the majority leader \nand the minority leader, the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senators Baucus and Grassley, for sitting down again today \nto try to come up with an agreement. Once they come up with that \nagreement, then we can pass it. We can pass it before we adjourn. We \ncan get it into law--the President has said he will sign it--and we can \nstart to take care of our weakening economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12228-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL CONTRACTION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have another potential \neconomic devastation in the State of Florida. Lo and behold, major \nleague baseball has voted to eliminate two teams. The media reports \nsuggest that four teams are on the short list of those that might be \ndissolved. Lo and behold, two of the four are from Florida--the Florida \nMarlins and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays--and the other two that are on the \nlist of four are the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins. If any of \nthe four teams currently under consideration for elimination are \ndissolved--any of those four--the impact to Florida would be \nsignificant. Doing so, especially without input from the communities \nand the regions where the teams are based, would be a mistake.\n  Baseball made promises to communities in my State that were relied \nupon by individuals who then built businesses and other assets around \nthe teams. Both Miami and Tampa Bay have invested millions of dollars \nand years of sweat equity in their teams. Hotels, restaurants, \nconcession vendors, and other hospitality companies, already reeling \nfrom the September 11 tragedy, stand to take staggering losses if \nbaseball fails to honor its obligations. Yet the league has completely \nshut them out of the process, keeping everyone in the dark. The owners \ngot together and made these decisions. They didn't reach out to the \ncommunities and get their input.\n  Take, for example, eliminating the Minnesota Twins, which I suspect \nwould have a great deal of interest to our Senators from the State of \nMinnesota, and the Montreal Expos, that would have considerable \ninterest to the Senators who border that area. Let me tell you, that \nwould be very troubling for Florida as well because both these teams \nhave a significant minor league presence, and they have wonderful \nspring training facilities in the State of Florida. Their dissolution \nwould have a direct negative impact on Lee County, which is Fort Myers \nand Palm Beach County, the city of West Palm Beach where the teams \ntrain and play. Many individuals and small businesses in these areas \ndepend on the teams for their livelihood and would be irreparably \nharmed if the teams folded.\n\n  Florida's attorney general, my good friend, Bob Butterworth, \nexplained the problem best when he said ``the people of Florida are \nentitled to some straight answers about the future of major league \nbaseball in this State.'' That is why I strongly support Attorney \nGeneral Butterworth's decision to send investigative subpoenas to major \nleague baseball. The people of Florida deserve to know what was said \nbehind closed doors. I applaud the attorney general for taking action \nso we can get to the bottom of this problem and take whatever \nadditional steps are necessary, including legal action to keep baseball \nin Florida for many years to come.\n  It is my understanding we are soon going to have a hearing in the \nCommerce Committee, on which I have the great privilege to sit as a \nmember, on this particular subject. To be forewarned is to be \nforearmed. We want some answers in that committee hearing.

Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, for allowing me this \ntime on the floor.\n  First, I do want to say for all of us, and for the record, a special \nthanks to Senator Frank Murkowski for the phenomenal leadership effort \nhe has put into the issue of energy and the development of a national \nenergy policy for our country. He truly has been relentless over the \nlast good number of years, not just starting when the lights went out \nin California but long before that when he and I and others who serve \non that important committee in the Senate began to recognize that if we \ndid not start reinvesting in the energy infrastructure of our country, \nthat our Nation would at some point be in trouble.\n  We have watched, over the last decade, our ramping up of a dependency \non foreign oil sources. We began to see a rapid use of the surplus of \nelectrical energy that was out there a decade ago, as our country, \nthrough the decade of the 1990s, continued to grow 3 and 4 and 5 \npercent. No one was really reinvesting in building new generating \ncapacity on the electrical side.\n  As many know, starting in the mid-1990s we began to encourage the \nClinton administration to come forward with a national energy policy, \none that dealt with this broad range of issues. We called it the market \nbasket of energy: the oil side, the hydrocarbon side, the coal side, \nthe electrical-generation side, the new technology side. We began to \ninvest in new technologies, in wind and in solar. We put money into \nfuel cells.\n  Clearly, over the last good number of years we have advanced many of \nthose technologies, but they are not yet mainstream. They do not yet \nfill up the market basket of energy, and we are still dominantly \nreliant on electricity generated by coal, by nuclear, and by hydro. We \nare still dominantly dependent on hydrocarbons, gases, and, of course, \nthe crude that comes from around the world. We know it is well over 50 \npercent. We are sometimes 60-percent dependent on someone somewhere \nelse in the world being willing to put their product into the market \nfor us to buy.\n  The lights began to go out in California about a year and a half ago. \nIt\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\nwas a major wake-up call to this country. California being our largest \nState and being the largest piece of the American economy, we knew that \nif California faltered and failed it could drag the rest of the economy \ndown with it. I am from Idaho. Our State is part of a regional \nelectrical grid that is dominated by the impact of California action. \nThe State of Oregon, the State of Washington, the State of Montana, \nparts of Nevada, parts of New Mexico, and parts of Arizona were caught \nup in the California episode. I use the word ``episode'' as it relates \nto California.\n  As we watched California restructure its electrical system, there was \nnot an economist out there nor a few reasonable observers who knew \nelectricity who said California was doing the right thing. In fact, \nmost said California was doing the wrong thing, and that at some time \nin the future California would find itself in trouble. That is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  My State of Idaho, being in that grid, began to get in trouble, too. \nWe had the least cost power. We were hydro based. All of a sudden, our \nrates started going up.\n  As a little side note to the rates going up, because we are a hydro-\nbased State and because over the last 2 years the Pacific Northwest has \nbeen in a drought, we were in even worse trouble. The energy issue in \nIdaho became a very strong issue as it grew across this country.\n  A new President was elected last November. While he talked about \neducation and he talked about compassionate conservatism, in one of the \nfirst meetings I had with President George W. Bush, he stood aside \nthose issues and said: The most important issue for our country at this \nmoment in time is the development of a national energy policy and a \nreduction of the dependency of our country and its consumers and our \neconomy on foreign sources of energy, and I am going to assemble a task \nforce headed by Vice President Cheney. We are going to make our \nproposals, and we are going to lead on this issue. We want you to work \nwith us so we can develop a truly national, comprehensive policy.\n  That was the beginning of a strong effort on the part of the House, \nthe Senate, and the administration to work on the issue of energy.\n  There are a lot of side stories and a good many side notes to this \nwhole effort. But there is one thing that is very clear in the minds of \nthe American people: That we are not masters of our own destiny when it \ncomes to energy; that we are a phenomenally dependent economy when it \ncomes to an adequate, abundant supply of energy at a reasonably low \nbase price in that economy; when that fails or when those prices go \nradically up because the market price drives it, our economy is in \ntrouble.\n  About a year ago, Alan Greenspan said the recession was beginning to \nappear as a slowing of the economy, and it was clearly evident that the \nspike in energy costs would take a full percentage point off the \neconomy and would cost millions of jobs in the economy as business and \nindustry offset their profitability or their costs based on an \nunbudgeted, rapid increase in the price of energy.\n\n  All of those scenarios played themselves out. All of them are \nextremely important to this country.\n  The Senate began to work its will. The House began to work its will. \nLots of hearings were held. We were beginning to shape and write a bill \nin the Senate. Frank Murkowski, Larry Craig, and a good many others had \nalready introduced a bill earlier in the year. Chairman Bingaman \nintroduced a bill earlier in the year. There were opposing points of \nview on energy--not dramatically different but different. That is OK. \nThat is fair. That is the way the process works. But all of them were \nintended to come back to the Energy Committee in the Senate.\n  Out of the effort of the Murkowski-Craig bill and the Bingaman bill, \nwe were going to produce a national energy policy bill for the Senate \nwhich we planned to do through the months of September and early \nOctober after coming back from the August recess. The House had already \nworked its will with H.R. 4.\n  The amendment we are offering today is the House product. But it was \ndone before September, during the August recess. The House moved a \nlittle more quickly than we did and built a reasonably comprehensive \nbill to solve the problem I have just in a general way laid out for all \nof us.\n  We came back from the August recess. The Senate began its work in the \nEnergy Committee. Of course, the House had already worked its will and \nsent a very loud message to us, to the President, and to the American \npeople that we could produce a comprehensive bill which included some \nvery controversial but extremely important issues in it, such as \nexploration in northern Alaska as it dealt with broadening and \ndeveloping our oil reserves.\n  All of this is at hand when September 11 occurs--a dramatic and \nhorrible time for our country. That incident and all of the preceding \nevents have clearly reshaped the thinking of the American people about \na lot of things. But very clearly it has reshaped the thinking of the \nAmerican people in their attitude towards energy and energy supply.\n  Let me give you an example. If you polled on the issue of oil \nexploration in northern Alaska before the September recess, a slight \nmajority of the American people would have said: I don't think so. I \ndon't think we ought to do that. After September 11, a substantial \nmajority--from 40-plus to 60-plus--said: Yes, do it. Do it \nenvironmentally safe, but do it because all of a sudden the American \npeople were focused as never before on our weaknesses, our dependency, \nand our inability to stand alone and stand firm. We had been struck. We \nhad been hit. Thousands of Americans had been killed.\n  Guess what. They came out of the Middle East. Guess where the largest \nsupply of oil comes from on which we are dependent. It comes from the \nMiddle East.\n  Americans said: Why should that be so? Can't we be more independent? \nCan't we stand alone more strongly? We shouldn't be at risk. We are at \nrisk. We were just struck on our soil, and thousands of Americans died.\n  That was the thinking, and it was very clear.\n  Here is an example. This is a poll taken on November 14. Ninety-five \npercent of Americans say Federal action on energy is important; 72 \npercent of Americans say passing a bill is a higher priority compared \nto other actions Congress might take these days.\n\n  The American people have elevated the energy policy issue as high as \nthey have elevated airport security, as high as they have elevated \nantiterrorism, as high as they have elevated anti-biological warfare \nand anti-chemical warfare. It has become a national priority.\n  Seventy-three percent of Americans say Congress should make energy a \npart of President Bush's stimulus package, and 67 percent of Americans \nsay exploration for energy in the United States, including Alaska, \nshould be part of a national energy policy.\n  Post-September 11, some pollsters said, was the most significant \nshift in the minds of the American people in the history of modern-day \npolling. I believe that is true because Americans not only were fearful \nof what had happened but they began to reassess their own personal \nsecurity, their families' security, their communities' security, and \ntheir States' security, and said: We are not secure.\n  When I go to the gas pump and I fill my car, I am buying oil from \nSaddam Hussein. It is true--700,000 barrels of oil a day come out of \nIraq, 12 million a day of your consumer dollars. Americans are paying \n$4 billion a year to an enemy so that he can further his weapons of \nmass destruction, so that he can fight a war against us and our friends \nin the Middle East. Yes, that is the reality of what we are doing. We \ndid not do it consciously. We fell into it. We fell into it because \nthis country has rapidly fallen into greater dependency on energy \nsources because we refuse to develop our own in a comprehensive, \nbalanced, and environmentally sound way.\n  Somehow there was this prohibition attitude that said, no, do not go \nthere, even if there is energy there. We will buy it somewhere else. \nThe environment is so valuable you cannot go there, whether it is \noffshore or onshore across America. What it did for us was open our \nsoft underbelly of dependency to foreign interests, and shame on us for \ndoing so. The American people are now saying that, and they are saying: \nCongress, change your attitude.\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\n Change your mind. We want to be stronger. We want to stand on our own \ntwo feet. We want to be able to supply a reasonable amount of energy \nfor us, for our needs.\n  New technologies? Absolutely. Alternative sources? Absolutely. But we \nalso know for the next 25 or 30 years we are going to be dominantly \ndependent on hydrocarbons--gas and oil--we are going to be increasingly \ndependent on nuclear--and we should be; it is clean, and we ought to be \nbuilding more nuclear facilities; we can meet our clean air standards \nif we build nuclear--and we ought to be looking at clean coal \ntechnology, and we have lots of coal. All of those things need to get \ndone. There need not be a rush to judgment. There simply needs to be a \nsystematic, methodical approach for dealing with this crisis.\n  The speech I am giving today is in the backdrop of declining gas \nprices across America. I am sure there are a few of our critics out \nthere saying: Oh, well, now look. They are rushing to judgment once \nagain. There go those doomsdayers.\n\n  What they ought to be saying is, because our economy has fallen \nalmost on its face, there is a lessening demand for energy. We are not \nusing as much in the airlines. We are operating at 60 percent there. \nAmericans are doing less. Industry is doing less. We all know those \nfigures.\n  This week, for the first time, our agencies declared we were in \nrecession. That is a large part of why we have seen declining usage. So \nif we have this moment of opportunity to bring more energy on line and \nlower the costs, it is, and it can be, one of the greatest stimuli to \nthe economy of this country, if we do it and do it right.\n  That is the scenario. That is where we are at this moment. And \nthroughout all of this, something strange has happened. About a month \nago, the majority leader of the Senate, Tom Daschle, picked up the \nphone and called Chairman Bingaman and said: Shut your Energy Committee \ndown. I don't want you to mark up a comprehensive energy bill in \ncommittee.\n  Why did he do that? I believe I know, but he has not told me \npersonally. It was an unprecedented action.\n  In the backdrop of all of this new national attention on the need for \na greater sense of strength and energy, the leader of the Senate \nreaches out to his committee and shuts it down--the very committee that \nwould craft the energy bill. I will tell you why he did it. Times have \nchanged. He was behind the curve. America said explore in Alaska as a \npart of a comprehensive policy, and he had an environmental political \ndebt to pay, and he is going to pay it. The way to do that is not to \nallow that vote on the floor, not to allow that vote, when the American \nfervor of self-reliance is high and when the American fear of foreign \ndependency is higher. We hope that will settle out, I think he thought. \nAnd next year--next year--sometime we will do a national energy policy \nand maybe then we can win the vote on ANWR.\n  What he failed to recognize was that before the crisis in September, \nthe House had already passed a bill with Alaska exploration in it. It \nhas only increased, since September 11, the attitude toward that kind \nof exploration.\n  So because the majority leader of the Senate shut his committee down \nin an unprecedented act and denied them the right to mark up a bill in \nthe appropriate bipartisan way, we are on the floor today, using a \ntactic that is procedural and appropriate but somewhat unprecedented \nwhen it comes to offering up a major national energy policy.\n  The bill we would have produced, the bill that Chairman Bingaman \nwould have produced had he been allowed to, had he not been forced to \nshut down his committee, would have been a much stronger bill and a \nbroader bill than the H.R. 4 bill that we have on the floor today, the \namendment that we are going to try to attach to railroad retirement \nbecause we have been given no other alternative on this critically \nimportant issue.\n  I support railroad retirement. Railroad retirement will be strong if \nrailroads can buy reasonably inexpensive diesel to fuel those big \ntrains out there. But if diesel were to go to $3 or $4 a gallon, \nrailroad retirement and the financial stability of the railroads would \nnot be worth much. That is why it is appropriate to put an energy bill \nthat will keep costs to the rails down and costs to the consumer down \nas it relates to their need for energy and attach it to this \nlegislation.\n  But the reason we are doing it is because the majority leader of the \nSenate has denied us no other approach. In fact, he has denied the \nright of the Senate to work its will, to do what the American people \nwant, what 95 percent of the American people say is now necessary, what \n72 percent of the American people now say is a critical priority that \nought to be included in President Bush's stimulus package to improve \nthe state of the economy.\n\n  And where is our majority leader headed? In the other direction, away \nfrom what the American people are asking for, and what our President is \npleading with us to get done before we leave town for Christmas.\n  The Senator from Texas has come to the Chamber and wants to speak. \nLet me mention just a few other things about a national energy policy.\n  One item in a comprehensive bill deals with exploration in Alaska--\none item--and yet if you listen to the debate or you listen to the \ncritics, you only hear one item: Alaska.\n  Let me talk about a few other things. H.R. 4, the amendment that we \nwant to put on here, that we are going to be voting on on Monday, \nreauthorizes Federal energy conservation programs and directs the \nFederal Government to take leadership in energy conservation with new \nenergy savings goals--produce more but use less. It means you can have \na growth economy and an abundance of energy. It isn't all conservation, \nand we know it. It expands Federal Energy Savings Performance \nContracting authority. It increases Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram--what we call LIHEAP--and Weatherization and State Energy \nProgram authorization levels to meet needs of low-income families. Most \nof us want that and think it is appropriate. That is a part of it.\n  It expands the EPA/DOE Energy Star Program and directs the EPA and \nDOE to determine whether Energy Star labels should be extended to \nadditional products. That is called causing and promoting industries \nout there to produce instruments and equipment and usages for consumers \nthat consume less energy. That is called conservation.\n  It directs DOE to set standards for appliances that are on ``standby \nmode'' energy use. A lot of energy is being used today by the new high-\ntech economy. We are asking--and causing by promotion and credit in the \nmarketplace--that industry, as it grows, that it should produce \nproducts that consume less energy.\n  That sounds like a pretty good idea. It reduces light truck fuel \nconsumption by 5 billion gallons over the next 6 years, improves \nFederal fleet fuel economy, and expands use of hybrid vehicles. That is \nnew technology. Those of our friends who are critics about exploration \non the public and private grounds of Americans say: You can lead out of \nthis with just the new technology. We are saying: Let's do both. Let's \nput the new technologies on line. While the old technologies are being \nreplaced, let the marketplace work and the infrastructure that supplies \nthese new technologies build over time. And it will, as they become \nviable.\n  About a year ago I went to Dearborn, MI. I drove a new Ford fuel cell \nelectric car. It was a beautiful car. I had it out on the racetrack, \nroaring around the track with an engineer. He said: Feel the thrust. He \ndidn't say: Step on the gas, he said: Step on the pedal. There was no \ngas in that car. It was a hydrogen fuel cell car. I kind of slipped on \none corner because it was raining. He said: You better be careful; this \ncar costs $6 million. I had never driven a $6 million car. His point \nwas it was a prototype. It is very expensive. As it comes on line in \nthe market and the market expands, the price will go down dramatically.\n  In order to build an assembly line to produce a hydrogen fuel cell \ncar, it would compete in the market with other cars, but then where \nwould you fuel it? You have to build fueling stations around the \ncountry. The gas station that we drive into today is a product of 70 \nyears of building up an industry to supply an American need. Not \novernight do we replace that with a new industry that could fuel a \nhydrogen fuel cell car.\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\n  That is my point about working to bring new technologies on line \nwhile building the resource of the current technology and the current \nenergy.\n  I could go on through the long list of items that are in H.R. 4. The \npoint is simple. While the public's attention will be directed toward a \nsingle item in a major comprehensive bill, called exploration in \nnorthern Alaska, what the rest of the world needs to hear is that there \nis a lot more to talk about and a lot more to get done.\n  Let me close by saying: Tom Daschle, 95 percent of the American \npeople are asking you to help us produce a national energy policy. The \nPresident and the Republican Senate and 73 percent of the American \npeople are saying: Mr. Daschle, allow it to be a part of the economic \nstimulus package. It is that important. Senator Daschle: Why don't you \nlead us and help us get there instead of blocking us and trying to stop \nus from getting there?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Texas \nis recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me identify myself with the excellent \nremarks of our colleague who just spoke. We are going to have an \nopportunity on Monday to determine whether or not we want to debate \nenergy policy in America and whether we want to deal with the problem \nof human cloning. That will come on the cloture vote. If cloture is \ninvoked on the railroad retirement bill, those two issues will be \nsheared off and we won't get an opportunity to vote on them. If cloture \nis not invoked, we would get an opportunity to vote yes or no on them, \nand then they would go forward as part of the railroad retirement bill, \nif they were adopted. I identify myself with the excellent remarks that \nwere given.\n  I must be getting 300 or 400 calls a day about railroad retirement. I \nam getting lots of letters--I am not getting the letters; they are \ncoming, and I am going to get them some day when we get through with \nthis anthrax business and I will be able to answer them. It frustrates \nme.\n  I would like to try, as briefly as I can today, to explain this issue \non railroad retirement at least as I see it. I will try to present the \nfacts. We are all entitled to our own opinion, but we are not all \nentitled to our own facts.\n  The first way, the best way to start this discussion is to explain \nhow I became involved in the debate. About a year ago, I had \nrepresentatives of the rail labor unions and the railroads come to see \nme to talk to me about a proposal they had to ``reform railroad \nretirement.''\n  I guess other things being the same, I am for reform. But when it \nbecame clear that they were talking about taking the sterile assets \nthat are now sitting in a meaningless IOU in the Federal treasury and \ninvesting it in stocks and bonds and real wealth, out of which they \nwere going to be able to pay benefits to railroad retirees, I think it \nis fair to say that even for an old jaded politician, I was excited \nabout this bill. Into my office came all of these people, representing \nthese major interests, very knowledgeable, very intelligent people who \nwere there to lobby me on behalf of it.\n  I guess it took me about 5 minutes to figure out that something \ndidn't add up. Let me offer a little information to set the predicate \nfor that.\n  As everybody who has not been hiding under a rock somewhere for the \nlast 25 years knows, Social Security is in trouble. We have gone from \n42 workers per retiree, when we started paying Social Security \nbenefits, to 3.3 workers today per retiree. We are in sheer panic--I \nam--about what we are going to do as baby boomers start to retire, and \nwe move from 3.3 workers per retiree to 2 workers per retiree.\n  While I may be the strongest proponent on the planet of taking the \nSocial Security surpluses we have and investing them in real wealth to \nbring in what Einstein called the most powerful force in the universe, \nthe power of compound interest, I have never claimed, nor has anyone \never claimed, that for the next 25 years that even the best investment \nprogram imaginable by the mind of man could enable us to raise Social \nSecurity benefits now, to lower the retirement age for Social Security \nbenefits now, or to cut Social Security taxes now.\n  I have not been here forever, but I didn't just come in on a turnip \ntruck yesterday. I started with this knowledge that in Social Security, \nwith 3.3 workers per retiree, we are looking at dramatic increases in \ntaxes or dramatic reductions in benefits, and maybe both, and that an \ninvestment component could mean less in the way of reductions in \nbenefits and less in the way of increases in taxes. But not by any \nimagination that I have could I have believed that we could with any \nkind of investment program in Social Security raise benefits today and \ncut taxes today knowing that in Social Security there is only 3.3 \nworkers per retiree. And yet these people come to my office and tell me \nthat we can have a railroad retirement investment program and that we \ncan immediately slash taxes that are going to fund railroad retirement. \nWe can immediately increase benefits. We can immediately change the \nretirement age.\n\n  We are in the process now of raising the retirement age for Social \nSecurity from 65 to 67. And in walk these people saying to me: Look, \nwith this little investment program, we can today change the retirement \nage in railroad retirement from 62 to 60.\n  While I wouldn't have believed that for Social Security, let me give \none more set of facts. Today in Social Security we have 3.3 workers per \nretiree. In the railroads, we have one worker per three retirees. The \nrailroad retirement program is in nine times worse shape than the \nSocial Security program. We have three workers per retiree in Social \nSecurity, they have one worker for three retirees in railroad \nretirement. And yet these people, highly paid, highly intelligent \npeople came in to my office. They were lobbyists. I don't begin to act \nas if something is wrong with lobbying. The Constitution guaranteed \nthem the right to come make this pitch to me. But with a straight face, \nthey came in my office and said: If you will let us take $15 billion, \nwe will invest it, we will raise benefits, we will lower the retirement \nage--and I am not talking about way off in the sweet by and by, I am \ntalking about today--we will raise benefits, we will lower the \nretirement age to 60, we will cut taxes on the railroads that fund \nrailroad retirement, and it will just be great.\n  Now, I am sorry to say, I don't know what their pitch was to the 74 \nMembers of the Senate who signed on as cosponsors, but that was their \npitch to me. I didn't believe it. And I was right. I will explain to \nyou why I was right. I didn't believe it because it didn't make any \nsense. And now that we have the railroad retirement board to work out \nall the numbers, let me tell you what the plan is and then show it in \nterms of the numbers and talk about the danger it creates.\n  What must have happened is--and this is just theoretical, but it \nseems to me this is what happened--our railroads have had problems \nreally since their formation because they got lots of assistance from \nthe Government. They negotiated labor agreements that didn't make \nsense. They had massive featherbedding. When they started competing \nagainst trucks in the 1930s, they were forced to reduce their labor \nforce. So they had this huge number of people, they have huge severance \npay packages, and they have very high retirement benefits. So they got \nin financial troubles.\n  I am sure that sometime last year, or the year before, somebody with \nthe railroad said: Look, we have over $15 billion of real assets in the \nrailroad retirement program. You need to realize that railroad \nretirement has never been self-sufficient; the Federal taxpayer heavily \nsubsidizes it, and there is no private retirement program that could \nrun with the benefits it is paying out, with a trust fund as small as \ntheir trust fund. So it has never been self-sustaining; the Government \nhas always been a very heavy contributor to it.\n\n  But what must have happened last year, or the year before, is \nsomebody with the railroad said: Wouldn't it be great if we could get \nsome of that money out of that trust fund? We would like to have it.\n  But they could not figure out, to save their lives, how they could \nraid the railroad retirement trust fund without the unions going \nabsolutely crazy. So it looks to me as if some really smart lawyer, \nlobbyist, economist--somebody--came up with the idea that the\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\nrailroads should go to the unions and say: Look, if you will let us \ntake $7.5 billion out of this retirement fund, we will let you take \n$7.5 billion out of it, and we will leave the Federal Government on the \nhook for paying this benefit.\n  Now that is literally what happened. Today it is typical of the news \ncoverage--and this is an article in the Roanoke Times. I don't know why \nmy clipping service got it. They are talking about my opposition and \nSenator Domenici's and Senator Nickles', and they say we argue that \ntaxpayers would be left holding the bag because the railroads and the \nunions want to take the money out of Government funds and invest it.\n  It is not investing that I am against. It is pilferage that I am \nagainst. If they were investing the money, I would be saying hallelujah \nchoruses right here before Christmas. I am for investing it. It is \nstealing it that I am against.\n  How can I say such a thing? Let me tell you how. It is true. It is \njust that simple. What I have done here is taken the data from the \nrailroad retirement board--and I am not a member; this is not my data; \nthese are the facts. According to this line right here on the chart, \nover the next 25 years the trust fund balance of railroad retirement \nwould look like this under the current system. They are closing in on \n$25 billion now, and that would rise over the next 25 years from about \n$20 billion to about $35 billion--still a very modest trust fund for a \nretirement program the size of railroad retirement. But we rejoice in \nit.\n  Now if you listen to the proponents of this bill, they say: Look, all \nwe want to do is take this money and invest it. They assume--and I \ngrant them the assumption because I believe it is true that over the \nlong term they can get 8-percent return on investment. Currently, they \nare not getting it on government bonds; it is an IOU from the \nGovernment itself. It is not really an investment. Investing it would \nbe a good thing. I am for it. Wouldn't you believe that if you were \ngetting no return now, and you had 8 percent after inflation, the value \nof the trust fund would go up? I mean, what investment can you imagine \nthat--if you were getting an effective zero rate of return today and \nyou started getting 8 percent, don't you think the investment would \ngrow in value? Yes, it should be getting bigger. But what happens, if \nwe adopt this bill, is the trust fund will start falling and will fall \ndramatically until the emergency provisions of the bill kick in and \ntaxes are automatically raised on the railroads.\n  What literally happens--and I want people to listen to these \nfigures--under this bill is that the $15 billion is not invested, it is \npilfered. What happens under this bill is that over the next 17 years, \ndespite the fact that we are getting a higher rate of return on the \nmoney, the balance actually falls by $15 billion.\n  How do you get a higher rate of return and end up with less money? \nYou end up with less money because, before anything is invested, before \none penny is invested, we are going to slash taxes on the railroads \nfrom 16.1 percent to 14.75 percent to 14.20 to 13.1, and we are going \nto lower the retirement age for beneficiaries, we are going to cut the \ntime for vesting in pensions in half, and we are going to raise the \nvalue of many pensions.\n\n  So what we are literally doing is this, if you work out the numbers. \nIf it doesn't smell like a political deal to you thus far, it will when \nI give you the numbers. How much of the $15 billion do you think goes \nto the railroads? How much do you think goes to the employees? You \nwould think, if it were just accidentally distributed by some program, \none might get a penny more than the other and it might be a little bit \ndifferent. Incredibly, over the 17 years, $7.5 billion of this pension \nfund goes to the railroads and $7.5 billion goes to the union members.\n  Now what happens when suddenly you have a program where, despite the \nfact that you are getting interest, which you didn't before, over the \nnext 17 years you have $15 billion less, because before you have \ninvested a penny, you have cut taxes and you have raised benefits--what \nhappens? The program starts having big-time problems. In fact, under \ntheir own numbers, what happens is, while the tax rate on the railroads \ngets down to 13.1 percent by 2004, by 2025, just to cover the portion \nfor which they are liable under this bill, their tax rate would have to \nbe up to 22.1 percent.\n  The reason this trust fund does not go right through the floor is \nthere is a provision in the bill that says if the trust fund is, for \nsome reason, used up, and the reason is pilferage, that while taxes are \nbeing cut on the railroads now and raising benefits now, in the future \ntaxes on the railroads are going to have to be raised to make up the \ndifference, and that tax is capped at 22.1 percent.\n  Imagine when we have been cutting taxes and increasing benefits and \nall of a sudden the railroad retirement program is in dire straits and \nthe railroads have to raise the percentage of wages they put into the \nretirement program from 13.1 percent to 22.1 percent in 3 years, what \nis going to happen? They are going to run to Congress and say, we are \ngoing to go bankrupt. We are going to have to shut down every railroad \nin America. There is no way we can go from 13.1 percent of our wage \nbill going into this retirement program in 2019 to 22.1 percent going \ninto it in 2025.\n  We have let the railroads come in and take $7.5 billion. We have \ngiven the employees $7.5 billion. The Federal Government is \nguaranteeing this retirement program now. We get out to 2022, the \nbottom is falling out of the program, and so the trust fund, which \nwould have been up here, would have been almost $40 billion under the \ncurrent system, but now it is down below $10 billion.\n  Remember, they invested the money. They are getting 8 percent, and \nthe trust fund has gone from almost 40 to below 10? How could that \nhappen? Because they are taking money out of the trust fund and giving \nit to the railroads and giving it to the retirees.\n  To fill up this gap, let me give a figure. The year is 2026, 25 years \nfrom now. Now we have passed a railroad retirement bill that is loved. \nThe railroads are for it. The retirees are for it. The unions are for \nit. It is wonderful. It has this cloak that says we are going to let \nthem invest this money, but when we look at the numbers they are not \ninvesting the money. They are spending the money.\n\n  So 2026 comes. We have a crisis in railroad retirement. The taxpayers \nare guaranteeing it. What kind of payroll tax would there have to be on \nJanuary 1, 2026, to put the system back where it would have been had we \nnever passed this bill that has 74 cosponsors? Listen to this. Hold \nyour hat. We would have to have a payroll tax of 153 percent of wages \non January 1, 2026, to put back the money that has been pilfered out of \nrailroad retirement.\n  In other words, if a person is paid $1,500 a month--or say they are \nbeing paid $1,000 a month. I guess they do not hire anybody at $1,000 a \nmonth, but it makes the arithmetic simple. If somebody is being paid \n$1,000 a month, $1,530 would have to be put into railroad retirement \nfrom the first paycheck in January of 2026 to get the trust fund \nbalance back to where it would have been before the $15 billion was \nstolen.\n  Does anybody believe that on January 1, 2026, the railroads are going \nto be able to pay a payroll tax of 153 percent? Nobody believes that. \nNobody believes they are going to be able to pay the payroll tax of \n22.1 percent, which the bill would require them to pay. Given the \nfigures of the Railroad Retirement Board, if we pass this bill, the \namount of money going into the pension fund from the railroads would go \ndown from 16.1 to 14.75, 14.2, 13.1, and it would be at 13.1 in 2019. \nSo we are right here. The bottom is falling out of the program.\n  The law starts requiring money to be put back. So within a 6-year \nperiod, this payroll tax to fund this program has jumped from 13 \npercent to 22 percent, and we still are nowhere near where we would be \nif we had never passed this bill. In fact, as I noted, we would have to \nhave a 153-percent payroll tax to get us back to where we were if we \nhad never done this.\n  That is not going to happen. Neither one of those payroll taxes are \ngoing to happen. What is going to happen is we are going to pass this \nbill and, boy, it is going to be loved. This is consensus. The \nrailroads are for it. The retirees are for it. The workers are for it. \nIt is true, if one looks at the numbers they are taking $15 billion \nright out of the\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\ntrust fund. But it is a victimless crime, right?\n  In fact, as one of the railroad executives says in the paper today, \n``It is our money.'' It is their money. Well, what if we were taking \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund and giving it away? After \nall, probably the guy who gets it, it would be their money.\n  The point is, however, the Federal Government is on the hook to pay \nthese benefits. There is nowhere near enough in the trust fund today to \npay the benefits. When we give this $15 billion away, we are putting \nthe taxpayer on the hook and come 2019, when the bottom falls out, the \nrailroads--I am not going to be here. I do not know how many people are \ngoing to be here when it happens, but it is going to happen if we pass \nthis bill. When the bottom falls out, the railroads are going to run in \nand say, we cannot operate and pay these kinds of taxes.\n  Nobody is going to say, well, you should have thought about that when \nyou participated in stealing $15 billion out of this trust fund. They \ndo not say that.\n  They are going to say, well, look, we cannot let the railroads go \nbroke. So what we are going to do is we are going to have the Federal \nGovernment pay an even larger share of the cost of this retirement \nprogram.\n\n  That is basically where we are. We have a proposal before us that \nclaims it is reforming the program. It claims it is earning interest on \nthe assets of the railroad retirement program. But if it is earning \ninterest, why are the assets going down instead of going up? Because \nbefore one penny is invested, before one penny is earned, it slashes \nthe amount of revenue going into the pension fund. It vastly increased \nthe benefits being paid out.\n  The railroads are for it because they get $7.5 billion. Railway labor \nis for it because they get $7.5 billion. Who pays the $7.5 billion? The \ntaxpayer.\n  Let me sum up by noting what we ought to do. I want to state a \nparadox. America loves consensus. I have to say when I go to my State, \nthe people are sweeter to me now than they have been in a very long \ntime. I think they are because they sense we are pulling together. We \nhad this terrible thing happen on September 11, and I think for about 6 \nweeks we did have a pretty good consensus, and I was proud of it.\n  Bipartisanship and consensus are not always good things. Let me \nrepeat it because it is a pretty startling statement. Bipartisanship \nand consensus are not always good things. In fact, the Founders \nunderstood checks and balances. When labor and business get together, \nit is not always in the public interest.\n  What we have in railroad retirement is literally a proposal to \npillage $15 billion out of the railroad retirement trust fund over the \nnext 17 years, give half of it to the railroads, half to the union, and \nthe taxpayer ends up in a very deep hole in supporting railroad \nretirement.\n  They will claim when you hear the debate: But when it goes to hell, \nthe taxes on the railroads are automatically raised. They are, but only \nup 22.1 percent. To get back in the year 2026 where we would be if we \nnever let the money be taken out, there must be a payroll tax of 153 \npercent. Obviously, this is not going to happen.\n  What should we do? First of all, nobody wants to hear this stuff. \nWhen all the people came in to our offices, this sounded as if \nChristmas had come early, so 74 Members of the Senate signed onto it \nand gave it a big fat kiss. Now nobody wants to know the problem. \nNobody wants to fix it. Here is how we can fix it and still \ndramatically improve the well-being of the railroad and the retirees. \nTake the $15 billion and invest it; don't pilfer it, invest it. Then \nout of the interest that we earn on the investment, once the money is \nearned, look at strengthening the trust fund, look at these very high \ntaxes railroads have to pay, and look at benefits. But don't go out and \nspend the money first. Invest the money first, earn on the investment, \nand then look at using that to make the system safe and sound, first; \nand then to improve it, second.\n  I would change the program by requiring, before any taxes are cut, \nbefore any benefits are increased, we make the investment and we \nactually have the money in hand. I do believe there is a very real \nproblem of what we are doing--even if you have the money, and it is \nclear you don't.\n\n  Here is another figure: To just fund the new benefits promised, even \nwith the interest rate you could earn by investing the money, you would \nhave to raise payroll taxes by 6.5 percent more. It would have to be \n6.5 percent higher each year, for the next 25 years, just to pay for \nthe lower retirement age, the quicker vesting and the more generous \npensions. We are not raising payroll taxes when we increase the \nbenefit; we are lowering them.\n  We need to fix this bill. We are going to have cloture on it. I hope \nwe have a chance to debate energy, which is a crisis issue, and too \nhuman cloning, because I believe the Senate would vote overwhelmingly \nto at least have a 6-month pause to look at it. That would also give an \nopportunity to come up with a rational way to improve railroad \nretirement. This is almost too good to be true, because it is too good \nto be true. There is no investment scheme that has ever been derived \nthat would let you do what is being done here. If you look at the trust \nfund, it is clear it is too good to be true because it is not true. I \nhope, even at this late date, even though people are signed on to this \nbill, that people will look at it and give us a chance to fix it.\n  I am going to offer a series of amendments. One of them will say \ndon't cut taxes, don't raise benefits until you have made the \ninvestment and earned money to pay it from. Don't just draw down the \ntrust fund, because right now we have a trust fund. Don't use it up now \nso we don't have it when retirees need it.\n  Another amendment I will offer would be to not let the money be taken \nout of the Social Security trust fund to pay for these new benefits. \nThese are things that need to be addressed.\n  I have come today to basically explain how it is possible to be \nagainst this bill. It appears that everybody is for it, but it is a bad \nbill. It is a dangerous bill. It is a bill that puts the taxpayer in \nmortal danger. It is a bill that doesn't make any sense on its face. I \ndon't know how anybody could have ever sold it. I am sure whoever came \nup with this whole deal of giving half of it to labor, half to \nmanagement, and selling it to Congress as a reform based on \ninvestment--even though the trust fund goes down like a rock--I am sure \nwhoever devised this stuff made millions. And they should have.\n  The problem is, this isn't some kind of game. This is real public \npolicy. The idea that we would have a bill that will literally pillage \nthe trust fund of railroad retirement funds is a startling thing. This \nmay pass. It probably will pass. I would rather it not pass on my \nwatch. I am going to vigorously oppose it. I hope my colleagues, even \nat this late date, will look at these things. If somebody wants to \ndebate this, if somebody wants to come over and present their figures, \nif they will let me know, I will come over and debate them on this \nsubject. However, I haven't seen anybody present the argument for the \nother side. I believe there is no argument for the other side.\n  What we are seeing is basically misinformation. The idea that we have \nrailroads saying, ``All we want to do is invest the trust fund,'' when \nbillions of dollars are being taken out of the trust fund despite \ninterest that is supposedly being earned, obviously something is very \nwrong.\n  I urge my colleagues, I urge people that follow these issues, to look \nat these facts, verify what I am saying and raise these issues.\n\n  People writing about this in the media, don't be confused. I am not \nconcerned about investing $15 billion. That is God's work. I am for \ninvesting $15 billion. What is happening, when the trust fund is \nprojected to look like this line, and it is turning out to look like \nthis, that is not investment. That is pillaging. That is taking money \nout of the trust fund.\n  We need people to start asking: Why are we doing this when the \ntaxpayer is liable: If they start asking, maybe we can fix it.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12233-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12233-S12238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me make sure we know where we are \non the legislation before the Senate.\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\n The underlying bill is the railroad retirement bill. We have two \namendments combined as one, one is the adoption of H.R. 4, the House \nenergy bill; the other issue concerns a moratorium on cloning for 6 \nmonths. That is Senator Brownback's legislation.\n  I will speak today on the energy issue because I think it is \nparamount. If we look at the polling information we have, it is obvious \nwhat American public opinion consists of. This survey was done in \nNovember by the IPSOS-Reid Corporation: 95 percent of Americans say any \nFederal action on energy is important; 72 percent of Americans say \npassing an energy bill is a higher priority than any other action \nCongress could take. Mr. President, 73 percent of Americans say \nCongress should make the energy bill part of President Bush's stimulus \nplan. Mr. President, 67 percent of Americans say expiration of new \nenergy sources in the United States, specifically ANWR, is convincing \nreason to support passing an energy policy bill. That is 67 percent.\n  I am not particularly happy with the way the energy bill, H.R. 4, \nwhich we introduced, is here. It is the House bill, which did pass the \nHouse by a substantial margin. I am fearful the vote on Monday at 5 \no'clock will be somewhat convoluted because you will be looking at \nseveral issues at the same time and Members can justify their positions \non perhaps previously having voiced their support for the railroad \nretirement bill, or voiced their opposition against cloning, or been a \nproponent or opponent of the House bill.\n  In any event, the good news is we finally have a energy bill up for \ndiscussion because that has not been the case before, because of the \nmajority leader's refusal to allow us time but, more significantly, the \nrefusal to allow the committee process to work.\n  As we have seen ordinarily around here, the committees do their work \nand report out a bill and the bill comes before an entire Senate. In \nthis particular case, the energy bill was taken away from the committee \nchairman and taken over basically by Senator Tom Daschle. In so doing, \nhe really stripped, if you will, the responsibility of the committee of \njurisdiction. But as the ranking member, all I can do is express my \nfrustration. As a consequence, we still do not have the Democratic bill \nthat we anticipate is coming.\n  I think it is fair to say there has been a deliberate attempt to \ndiscourage the taking up of the House bill before the Senate body, in \nthe manner in which the majority leader has simply exerted his \ninfluence. So the members of the committee of jurisdiction will not \nhave had any input in the development, at least from the Republican \nside, of whatever we are likely to see next week.\n\n  Some have said, what is the importance of this? Is there some reason \nwe are rushing into this? I remind my colleagues, we are not rushing \ninto it. This has been before us for a couple of years. We introduced \nthe bill, Senator Breaux and I, earlier this year. We have had hearings \non it. On the other hand, we were precluded from reporting it out of \ncommittee for the simple reason that we didn't have the votes to report \nit out of committee.\n  This morning we had some discussion with the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman. He made several arguments against one \nportion of the bill and that is the opening of ANWR. I am going to be \nrebutting these over a period of time because that seems to be the only \nway we can focus in on the points and try to counter those points with \nfacts rather than fiction.\n  What he failed to mention earlier today was the rights and interests \nof the Native people of Alaska who live in the 1002 area, the area of \nKaktovik, and their rights to develop their own land in this area. As \nthe chart behind me shows, you can see the ownership of the 95,000 \nacres of land that is private Native land. This is the 95,000 acres of \nNative land that is within the 1002 area. That is the area that would \nbe leased.\n  In the manner in which this land was transferred over to them, while \nthey have the land in fee simple, they have no authority to drill for \ngas for heating their own homes. These are American citizens entitled \nto the same rights as any other American citizen. They do live in the \narea. As a consequence, their rights are certainly thwarted opening up \nthis area where they would have not only access to develop those lands; \nthey would also have access for a route out if they should wish to \ninitiate some exploration.\n  It is important to recognize there is a human element here. The human \nelement is the residents, the kid who lives in Kaktovik. You have seen \nthe picture before. Some people are under the impression that this is \nthe Serengeti of the Arctic. We have views of the Serengeti, but that \nis Kaktovik, and it is a village of less than 400 people. The point is, \npeople live there. The point is, it is a very harsh environment.\n  All through the debate there is no mention of the rights of these \npeople. It is always the environmental community that says we should \nnot support opening ANWR. They come up with no evidence, no suggestion \nwe cannot do it safely. It is just generalities.\n  Throughout this debate what I am going to be doing is countering the \ncomments that have already been made because they are the same tired \narguments you have heard previously. One of the comments is it is only \na 6-month supply. That is a ridiculous argument. How anybody could even \nrepeat it here is beyond me because we all know that could only happen \nif there was no oil production in the United States, it all stopped, \nthere would be no further importation coming into the United States in \nships, and we would only depend on one source. That is a bogus \nargument. I am amazed that intelligent Members of this body would even \nstoop to suggesting that anyone would buy that kind of argument, a 6-\nmonth supply.\n  Clearly, what we are talking about is a significant discovery, \nsomewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels a day. What does that \nmean? That means more oil, more proven oil than in Texas. Texas is \nalways considered to be one of the major oil producing States and it \nis. But from the Energy Information Administration Reports, Texas' \nproven reserves total 5.3 billion barrels. In 1998, the USGS estimated \nthere was a 95-percent chance that more than 5.7 billion barrels would \nbe found in ANWR. That is a 95-percent chance. That is more than the \nproven reserves in Texas today.\n\n  There is a 50-percent chance of more than 10 billion barrels, and a \n5-percent chance of more than 16 billion barrels.\n  I am going to go into this a little bit more because it is something \nthat constantly comes up, because it is something that was coined by \nthe extreme environmental community that is opposed to this: a 6-month \nsupply. Let's look at this on an average. The average would be Prudhoe \nBay.\n  We have some pictures of Prudhoe Bay here. You can see the oilfield \nover there; it is the largest oilfield ever found in North America. It \nwas supposed to produce 10 billion barrels and it is almost to its 13 \nbillionth barrel now. That has been supplying the Nation with about 20 \npercent of its total crude oil for the last 27 years. So it is very \nsignificant.\n  Here is ANWR over here. There is Kaktovik, the village you have seen \nthe pictures of. Then there is the makeup of just what is ANWR. I have \ntold people time and time again, it is a big hunk of real estate. It is \n19 million acres in its entirety. The entire State of Alaska is about \n365 million acres.\n  What we have done is, we have done a little comparison for you to \nshow you that ANWR and South Carolina are about the same size. The only \ndifference in the ANWR 19 million acres, we set aside 8.5 million acres \nas a wilderness in perpetuity. Those are not going to be touched. Nor \nis the balance of the refuge in the darker yellow. Only the green area \nis proposed for lease sale. In the House bill before us, the footprint \nis limited to 2,000 acres. That is the little square you see up in red.\n  That is the proportion. You have the pipeline already in, the 800-\nmile pipeline. The same arguments that were used in the 1970s against \nthe pipeline and the late 1960s are prevailing today. We built that \npipeline. It is one of the construction wonders of the world. It has \nmoved 20, 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country.\n  I know there are some who have, simply, a closed mind to this issue \nbecause they made a commitment to America's environmental community. It \nis our job to make a commitment to do what is right for America, and \nwhat is right for America is to reduce our dependence on imported oil. \nYou do it one\n\n[[Page S12235]]\n\nway. You do it by producing more domestically.\n  You can talk all you want about energy savings, the world moves on \noil. You don't drive out of here on hot air. You don't fly out of here \non hot air. Your ships and your trains don't move out on hot air. They \nmove on oil. I wish we had another alternative, but we do not.\n  We can talk about coal. We can talk about natural gas. We can talk \nabout nuclear and we can make our points, but the world moves on oil \nand we are going to continue moving on oil for some time in the future. \nThat is why it is so important that we develop, here in the United \nStates, an additional supply of significance.\n  Don't tell me about a 6-month supply because, if you do, you are \ndoing a disservice, not only to your other colleagues but to yourself \nbecause you are kidding yourself.\n  If there is no oil there, believe me, it is not going to be \ndeveloped. There is no consideration for the Native people's rights. I \ntalked about that earlier this morning. That distresses me because they \nare my constituents. They have every right as American citizens to \ncontrol their land and develop their land, and they can't even drill \nfor gas to heat their homes.\n  Some say we are rushing through this too fast. We have had hearings. \nHere is the history. Between the 100th and 107th Congresses--this has \nbeen around for a long time--there have been over 50 bills regarding \nthis topic, there have been 60 hearings, there have been 5 markups.\n  Legislation authorizing the opening of ANWR passed the Senate once \nalready--in 1995. Legislation authorizing the opening of ANWR passed \nthe House twice already. The conference report authorizing the opening \nof ANWR passed the Congress back in 1995. It passed the Senate. But, \nunfortunately, President Clinton vetoed it. If we had passed it in \n1995, it could very well be producing oil.\n  Something that should lie in the minds of all Americans is that we \nare starting to lose lives over oil. We lost two U.S. Navy sailors \nbecause a ship sank while being inspected by the Navy. It was sailing \nout of Iraq filled with illegal oil that had gotten beyond the \noversight of the U.N. inspectors. The sailors were on that vessel \ninspecting it, and the ship sank.\n  The point is this: Had this particular legislation not been vetoed by \nthe President in 1995, I am sure we would have had a different \nsituation relative to the situation we see currently in Iraq. I will \ntalk about that a little later.\n  In any event, to suggest this thing be given further study, that is a \ncop-out. We have been at this. We have had hearings. I know the \noccupant of the chair has been on the committee. This has been under \ndiscussion. The obvious road block here is the refusal of the \nDemocratic leadership to allow us to vote it out of committee and to \nhave an up-or-down vote in the committee. They took way the authority \nof Chairman Bingaman and rested it with the majority leader. They do \nnot have a bill yet. Maybe they will have a bill in a day or two, with \nlittle or no Republican input. This has become a very partisan issue.\n  It is similar to what happened on the Finance Committee with the \nstimulus bill. We had no input, and suddenly we went to markup and to \nvoting the bill out and found it was so partisan that we had to start \nthe process again.\n  I don't know what the majority leader's objective is in delaying. But \nwe finally have this up before this body. Again, I am distressed with \nthe manner in which we are forced to tie ourselves in on railroad \nretirement. That should be a separate bill. Nevertheless, we have to \ntake what we can get around here. When you are a small State with a \nsmall population, you don't have a large House membership. As you know, \nwe only have one House Member.\n  Some of the comments from my friend, Senator Lieberman, this morning, \nabout this being an insignificant amount of oil--let me tell you that \nthe estimated 10 billion barrels of oil coming out of ANWR would \nsupport his State of Connecticut for 126\\1/2\\ years based on the \ncurrent petroleum needs of about 216,000 barrels a day. From the \nstandpoint of South Dakota, it would provide oil for South Dakota for \n460 years.\n  We can all throw statistics around. Nevertheless, it is frustrating \nwhen there are suggestions that this is a meaningless, insignificant \npotential and not worth disturbing what they call the Serengeti of the \nArctic.\n  Let me comment a little bit on some of the claims by the Senator from \nConnecticut that we are rushing through the ANWR process. As I \nindicated, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  A conference report authorizing the opening of ANWR passed the \nCongress in 1995. Reviewing the history shows that ANWR has not only \nbeen addressed by this body but it has also been addressed by various \nagencies of the Department of the Interior, the House of \nRepresentatives. The proposal has been before Congress for 14 years.\n  The time to act is long overdue. The issue has been dragged out long \nenough over the years. I think both sides know what is happening to us \nwith the vulnerability associated with our increased dependence.\n  I have some charts that show the actual increase in consumption.\n  Here is the reality of U.S. petroleum consumption from January of \n1990 to September of 1999. You can see that we are currently at a \nlittle over 20 million barrels a day in consumption. We can conserve \nmore. If you want a high-mileage car, you can buy it. Any American can \nchoose, through their own free will, cars that are more comfortable or \ncars that can handle more people.\n  We have some other charts I want to bring up.\n  This is where our imports come from--from the OPEC nations: Saudi \nArabia, Iraq, Venezuela, and Nigeria. We are importing currently about \n56 percent of our total crude oil. I think we have another chart that \nshows just where we have been. In 1997, we were importing 37 percent. \nWe were importing 56 percent in 2001. The Department of Energy \nestimates that we will import 66 percent by the year 2010.\n  What does that do to our national security? I will get into that a \nlittle later. Clearly, it is an issue that should be addressed.\n  Another issue is that of jobs. I have always believed that if anybody \nin this body could identify a singular more important stimulus than \nopening up ANWR, I would certainly like to hear from them. That offer \nis still out there because I haven't heard from them.\n  To give us some idea specifically of what would be initiated by \nopening this Coastal Plain, the development scenario can only take \nplace on 2,000 acres. That is what is in the bill. That is what is in \nH.R. 4.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the realization that we are likely to \nget somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels a day and what it is \ngoing to do for jobs. This is a jobs issue.\n  First of all, the area has to be leased. It is Federal land. There \nwould be a lease proposal. The estimate of the bids that would come in \nby the major oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, Texaco, or Phillips \nPetroleum, and others would be somewhere in the area of $3 billion. The \ntaxpayers would obviously see a generation of funds coming from the \nprivate sales and going into the general fund.\n  Let's talk about jobs.\n  There was a generalization made by Senator Lieberman that the jobs \nissue is insignificant because more jobs could be created, if you will, \nby energy conservation. I wish that were true. I wish we could justify \nthat with some statistical information to prove it, because we are \ntalking about continued dependence on imported oil and how we can \nrelieve that. We are not talking about energy as a whole.\n\n  There are various studies we have seen over the years. According to \nthe Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Association, ANWR development \nshould produce 735,000 jobs in all 50 States. Why? Because we do not \nmake valves; we don't make insulation. These things are made in various \nStates in the United States.\n  In a different study, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated ANWR \nwill produce 250,000 full-time jobs in America. Interestingly enough, \nthis study was contracted out to a Massachusetts firm. This is \nsomething of which the junior Senator from Massachusetts should take \nnote. Let me repeat--he was here earlier; unfortunately, he is not in \nthe Chamber now--a firm in his own State has estimated at least\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\n250,000 jobs will be produced. I am not sure he is aware of that. And \nthis contract was given to a Massachusetts firm.\n  Opponents of drilling in ANWR try to downplay these arguments and try \nto argue the lower numbers. But regardless of whether it is 250,000 or \n735,000, either way, it would still be a step in the right direction as \nfar as stimulus to the economy because where else can you find another \nissue that will employ somewhere between 250,000 and 735,000 jobs and \ndoes not cost the taxpayers one red cent. And it keeps the jobs here at \nhome rather than sending our dollars overseas and importing the oil. \nEvery single new job in this country is important, particularly at a \ntime when we have a recession and a downturn.\n  As a consequence, I think it is important to note that those who know \na lot about job creation wholeheartedly support drilling in ANWR. I am \ntalking about the unions, such as the maritime unions, the Teamsters, \nthe seafarers, and various others.\n  The North Slope oil fields have already significantly contributed \nmore than $300 billion to the U.S. economy.\n  If we go through some recent announcements, let me tell you the \nsignificance of a couple hundred thousand jobs.\n  On November 29, it was announced 1,409 jobs may be lost. IBM \nannounced 1,000 layoffs.\n  On November 28, it was announced 850 jobs may be lost. Ames \nDepartment Stores announced they will close a distribution center in \nOhio, which jeopardized 450 jobs.\n  I could give you a list of the various announced job cuts.\n  Alcoa plans to lay off 6,500 employees and close plants.\n  Chevron announced 550 more job cuts.\n  Every day we have seen news clips to this effect. So we should be \nvery concerned about stimulating the American economy and generating \njobs in the private sector. And this is one of the best ways to do it.\n  My friend, the Senator from Oregon, is the Presiding Officer. I know \nthe activity associated with Alaska's oilfields has traditionally been \nimportant to Oregon, particularly to the shipyards there.\n  It is estimated by the American Petroleum Institute that 19 new \ndouble-hull tankers will be needed if ANWR is opened. All U.S. ships \nwill have to be built at U.S. shipyards and carry the American flag. \nThe analysis predicts that the construction of these tankers will boost \nthe economy of America by producing more jobs in the shipyards. They \nindicate that the new tankers will be needed solely because the old \nNorth Slope tankers are being phased out by 2015 because of the double-\nhull tanker requirements.\n  So more American jobs will be created because the Jones Act requires \nthat the oil that is transported within the United States--namely, my \nState of Alaska down to either Washington or California; but in \nPortland there is a large shipyard that has accommodated these ships \nbefore--must be transported by tankers by U.S.-flagged vessels built in \nthe United States. The analysis correctly assumes that if ANWR passes, \nit will include an oil export ban. So there will be a provision that \nthis oil cannot be exported. It also assumes that the ANWR oil will be \ntransported by tankers to refineries in Washington, California, and \nHawaii. The Oregon area ordinarily does not have the refining capacity.\n\n  The American Petroleum Institute estimates this would pump $4 billion \nalmost directly into the U.S. economy and would create 2,000 \nconstruction jobs in the U.S. shipbuilding industry and approximately \n3,000 other jobs.\n  The API predicts this would compute to more than ``90,000 job-\nyears,'' by estimating that it will take almost 5,000 employees \napproximately 17 years to build the ships necessary to transport this \noil.\n  They predict one ship must be built each year for 17 years in order \nto coincide with the schedule for retiring the existing tankers.\n  To me, this sounds like stimulus. It sounds like a stimulus for \ncreating jobs in shipyards, many of which have been hurting for some \ntime.\n  Another issue is the alleged opposition by Gwich'ins. Most of the \nGwich'ins, we know, live in Canada. I am aware some of them live in the \nArctic village areas, with a population of roughly 117 people. They \nfear that the caribou that they depend on for subsistence will be \ndecimated. They fear the caribou might take a different migration \ndrive, perhaps further from their village; that it would be harder for \nthem to hunt the 300 to 350 they kill each year.\n  But, first, there is no evidence that the oil development--with the \nstrict controls proposed to prevent disruption during the June-July \ncalving season of the Arctic Porcupine herd, to reduce noise, and to \ncontrol surface effects--will harm the herd.\n  I have a picture in the Chamber that shows some caribou activity in \nPrudhoe Bay. I will give you a comparison. Experience over the past 26 \nyears in Prudhoe Bay, where the herd has more than tripled in size and \nwhere the caribou calves----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alaska in morning \nbusiness has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I request as much time as I need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as I announced earlier \ntoday, we need to complete our business by 1:15 today because of the \nproblem at the Dirksen Building. The majority leader wishes to give a \npresentation prior to that time. So if the Senator would maybe take \nanother 10 minutes, would that be appropriate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We are in morning business, and the limitation of time \nin morning business is what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The limitation is 10 minutes for each Senator \nin morning business.\n  Mr. REID. I know you just barely exceeded that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We were talking about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we did 15, that is right.\n  I see Senator Baucus, who wishes to give a statement, is in the \nChamber.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was under the impression we would have plenty of \nopportunity to discuss this today. Might I inquire when we are coming \nin Monday?\n  Mr. REID. We can come in as early as you would like. Two o'clock.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How about 1 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. Would you need more time on Monday than that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. One o'clock would be agreeable because what you are \ntelling me now is basically that I am out of time for today.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Right. I would be happy to talk to the majority \nleader. I am sure we could work that out.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am a little disappointed because I think we are \nbeing kind of squeezed on time on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, if you want to come in \nearlier than 1 o'clock, I would be happy to talk to him. We are not \ntrying to squeeze out anybody. They are closing the Dirksen Building.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Dirksen Building will be closed at 4 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Why don't we come in at noon?\n  Mr. REID. I will do my best. We will do our best. We have presiders, \nand all that. We will come in earlier than 2 o'clock, for sure.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for another 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. I think that will be fine. I say to my friend from Alaska, \nwe certainly are not trying to cut off anybody's right. I don't know \nhow much time the Senator has had, but quite a bit. I understand how \nfervently he feels and how important this is to the State of Alaska, so \nwe want to make sure that you have all the time you need prior to our \nvoting at 5 o'clock on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My understanding is, they will do their best to try to \nsee that we come in at noon. I thank the Chair and thank the majority \nwhip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have talked a little bit this morning about the \n``Serengeti.'' Let me tell you where the ``Serengeti'' of Alaska is. It \nis another\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\narea where all the lakes are, and it is hardly a ``Serengeti'' because \nthe Coastal Plain is all the same.\n  But if you look over at the naval petroleum reserve, that is the area \nwith all the lakes with the concentration of birds. It is not within \nthe 1002 area. That is another misleading argument that is continually \nthrown out.\n  The other one is that it will take as long as 10 years before ANWR \noil is flowing. What they forget is the realization that we already \nhave a good deal of the infrastructure. We have the pipeline. We only \nneed a 70-mile line from the coastal area into the pipeline. And it is \nsuggested once the leases are put up for sale, they will have \nconstruction activity in about 18 months.\n  But more important is the national situation. I am going to close \nwith a reference to that because I think it deserves more of a \nrecognition because of the sensitivity of where we are internationally.\n  We are importing a little over a million barrels a day from Saddam \nHussein. There is no question that there is a great deal of concern as \na consequence of the relationship we have had with Saddam Hussein. We \nfought a war not so long ago. It is kind of interesting to reflect on \nsome of the particulars associated with what happens when we become so \ndependent. We have heard Saddam Hussein in every speech saying ``death \nto America.'' He also says ``death to Israel,'' one of our greatest \nallies over there. Recognizing that he can generate a substantial cash \nflow by our continued dependence, one wonders why it is in the national \ninterest of our country to allow ourselves to be become so dependent on \nthat source.\n  I also wish to highlight an article excerpted from the Wall Street \nJournal of November 28, which kind of sets, unfortunately, the partisan \nsetting this matter is in. I will read from it. It is entitled \n``President Daschle.''\n\n       One of the more amusing Washington themes of late has been \n     the alleged revival of the Imperial Presidency, with George \n     W. Bush said to be wielding vast, unprecedented powers. Too \n     bad no one seems to have let Senate Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle in on this secret.\n       Because from where we sit Mr. Daschle is the politician \n     wielding by far the most Beltway clout, and in spectacularly \n     partisan fashion. The South Dakotan's political strategy is \n     obvious if cynical: He's wrapping his arms tight around a \n     popular President on the war and foreign policy, but on the \n     domestic front he's conducting his own guerrilla war against \n     Mr. Bush, blocking the President's agenda at every turn. And \n     so far he's getting away with it.\n       Mr. Bush has asked Congress to pass three main items before \n     it adjourns for the year: Trade promotion authority, and \n     energy and economic stimulus bills. Mr. Daschle has so far \n     refused to negotiate on any of them, and on two he won't even \n     allow votes. Instead he is moving ahead with a farm bill the \n     White House opposes, and a railroad retirement bill that is \n     vital to no one but the AFL-CIO.\n       Just yesterday Mr. Daschle announced that ``I don't know \n     that we'll have the opportunity'' to call up an energy bill \n     until next year. One might think that after September 11 U.S. \n     energy production would be a war priority. In September alone \n     the U.S. imported 1.2 million barrels of oil a day.\n\n  This is at a time when we were being terrorized in New York and at \nthe Pentagon.\n  Furthermore, on the 1.2 million barrels of oil a day we are getting \nfrom Iraq, whom we soon may be fighting--imagine that, fighting Iraq \nand we are talking about not passing an energy bill--the 1.2 million \nbarrels per month is the highest rate of imports since before Saddam \nHussein invaded Kuwait.\n  Continuing from the article:\n       But Mr. Daschle is blocking a vote precisely because he \n     knows Alaskan oil drilling has the votes to pass; earlier \n     this autumn he pulled the bill from Senator Jeff Bingaman's \n     Energy Committee when he saw it had the votes. So much for \n     the new spirit of Beltway cooperation.\n       We're not so naive as to think that war will, or should, \n     end partisan disagreement. But what's striking now is that \n     Mr. Daschle is letting his liberal Old Bulls break even the \n     agreements they've already made with the White House. Mr. \n     Bush shook hands weeks ago on an Oval Office education deal \n     with Teddy Kennedy, but now we hear that Mr. Kennedy wants \n     even more spending before he'll sign on. Mr. Daschle is \n     letting Ted have his way.\n       The same goes for the $686 billion annual spending limit \n     that Democrats struck with Mr. Bush after September 11.\n\n  I will not refer to the rest of the article, but it simply says that \nwhat we are seeing here is a conscious effort by the majority not to \nallow us to have a clean up-or-down vote on the issue.\n  As we wind up today's debate, I encourage my colleagues to think a \nlittle bit about their obligation on these votes. Is it their \nobligation to respond to the extreme environmental community that has \nlobbied this so hard, that regards this as an issue to milk with all \nthe authorities, somewhat like a cash cow, and are going to continue to \nuse it? This bill covers reducing the demand, increasing the supply, \nand it enhances infrastructure and energy security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article in the Wall Street Journal \nof November 28 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           President Daschle\n\n       One of the more amusing Washington themes of late has been \n     the alleged revival of the Imperial Presidency, with George \n     W.

Mr. Daschle is \n     letting Ted have his way.\n       The same goes for the $686 billion annual spending limit \n     that Democrats struck with Mr. Bush after September 11. \n     That's a 7% increase from a year earlier (since padded by a \n     $40 billion bipartisan addition), and Democrats made a \n     public fanfare that Mr. Bush had endorsed this for fear \n     some Republicans might use it against them in next year's \n     elections. But now Mr. Daschle is using the issue against \n     Mr. Bush, refusing to even discuss an economic stimulus \n     bill unless West Virginia Democrat Bob Byrd gets his \n     demand for another $15 billion in domestic spending.\n       Mr. Byrd, a former majority leader who thinks of Mr. \n     Daschle as his junior partner, may even attach his wish list \n     to the Defense spending bill. That would force Mr. Bush to \n     either veto and forfeit much needed money for defense, or \n     sign it and swallow Mr. Byrd's megapork for Amtrak and \n     Alaskan airport subsidies.\n       All of this adds to the suspicion that Mr. Daschle is only \n     too happy to see no stimulus bill at all. He knows the party \n     holding the White House usually gets most of the blame for a \n     bad economy, so his Democrats can pad their Senate majority \n     next year by blaming Republicans. This is the same strategy \n     that former Democratic leader George Mitchell pursued in \n     blocking a tax cut during the early 1990s and then blaming \n     George H.W. Bush for the recession. Mr. Mitchell's \n     consigliere at the time? Tom Daschle.\n       It is certainly true that Republicans have often helped Mr. \n     Daschle's guerrilla campaign. Alaska's Ted Stevens is Bob \n     Byrd's bosom spending buddy; he's pounded White House budget \n     director Mitch Daniels for daring to speak the truth about \n     his pork. And GOP leader Trent Lott contributed to the \n     airline-security rout by letting his Members run for cover.\n       The issue now is whether Mr. Bush will continue to let \n     himself get pushed around. Mr. Daschle is behaving badly \n     because he's assumed the President won't challenge him for \n     fear of losing bipartisan support on the war. But this makes \n     no political sense: As long as Mr. Bush's war management is \n     popular, Mr. Daschle isn't about to challenge him on foreign \n     affairs.\n       The greater risk to Mr. Bush's popularity and success isn't \n     from clashing with the\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\n     Daschle Democrats over tax cuts or oil drilling. It's from \n     giving the impression that on everything but the war, Tom \n     Daschle might as well be President.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Finally, I hope as Members reflect on their \nresponsibility, they recognize that we are at war. This war may expand \nand extend itself. The continued exposure based on our dependence on \nimported oil and the likelihood that the flow of oil imports might be \ndisrupted mandates that we have an energy policy and that we have it \ndone in a timely manner. Let's recognize the obligation that we have in \nvoting on this. Is it a vote to respond to the demands of America's \nenvironmental community, or is it a vote to do what is right for \nAmerica?\n  We have already lost two sailors as a consequence of our dependence \non oil from Iraq. I don't want to stand before this body and say I told \nyou so, but if we don't pass an energy bill that will reduce our \ndependence on Iraqi oil, we are doing our country a grave injustice. It \nis contrary to the majority of public opinion in this country. Seventy-\nsix percent of public say we should be taking up and passing an energy \nbill over any other bill. That includes the farm bill and the Railroad \nRetirement Act. If we ever get to the stimulus, I hope somebody would \nsearch their minds and memories to see if they can come up with a \nbetter stimulus than the proposal associated withholding up ANWR.\n  I am somewhat disappointed we were not able to have more time today. \nHopefully, the leadership can work out coming in at noon on Monday.\n  I thank the Chair for its courtesy.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the words spoken \nearlier this morning by my very good friend and colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed. Earlier this morning, Senator Reed announced his \nintention to bring S. 767, the Gun Show Background Check Act, to the \nSenate floor this year.\n  At the outset, I deeply respect the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nthink he is a very fine public servant, one of the brightest and most \ndedicated with whom I have had the privilege to serve. I respect his \nconcerns about guns generally and guns in America. I do not believe, as \nhe stated, that instituting background checks at gun shows will correct \nthe concerns he raised. The events of September 11 and the ensuing \nconcerns about terrorist threats have led to a resurgence by some for \nstricter gun laws. But with all due respect, responding to terrorism by \ncalling for background checks at gun shows is not an effective tool for \nmaking this country safer.\n\n  The hijackers of September 11 were not armed with guns. The tragic \ndeaths of thousands in New York didn't involve a single bullet. The \nanthrax that arrived in the office of my next door neighbor, Majority \nLeader Daschle, had nothing to do with background checks. The acts of \nthe terrorism on America to date have not been related to guns in any \nform.\n  I am not trying to deny the risks and dangers that we face from \nweapons in the hands of terrorists. But I do not believe that terrorist \norganizations are buying their weapons one pistol at a time from \nAmerican gun shows, nor do I believe that closing the so-called gun \nshow loophole will result in fewer guns in criminal hands.\n  I strongly support the actions our law officials have taken to make \nour country a more secure place since September 11. And I thank them \nfor their dedication and hard work. They have worked so hard and in \nmany cases overtime, extra hours, no vacation. It is amazing and \ninspiring. But while we tighten our borders and patrol our country, we \nmust remember the balance between protecting our safety and protecting \nour civil rights.\n  Restricting our citizen's access to firearms chips away rights \nprotected by the Constitution. Cloaked in the mantle of eliminating \nterrorism, bills such as ``The Gun Show Background Check'' restrict the \nsecond amendment and make it more difficult for law abiding citizens to \npurchase guns.\n  My State of Montana has a heritage based on hunting and enjoying the \ngreat outdoors. Gun shows are events typically held in town meeting \nhalls on weekends. They are very well attended. They are big events. \nYou would be astounded at all the people there going to and fro and \ntalking and exchanging information. People come together and meet \nneighbors and possibly purchase a rifle to be used on a hunting trip. \nIn addition, gun shows simply are not set up with the technology to \nmake background checks feasible. They are temporary events, and they \nare not able to be connected to the NICS system for background checks. \nIt is technically impossible.\n  I appreciate deeply my colleague's concerns, but I do not believe \nthat gun show checks begin to address terrorism or gun violence. We \nhave safeguards in place to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands \nand focusing on guns when talking about terrorism is missing the bigger \npicture.\n  Let's move on to getting an economic recovery bill passed to boost \nour economy and prove to the terrorists that their actions cannot stop \nAmerica's progress. Let's get our aviation security bill implemented so \nour citizens can get back up in the air with complete confidence. Right \nnow, it is the big picture on which we must focus. Gun shows aren't \npart of the problem, and background checks at the gun shows are not \npart of the solution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, every December first since 1988, World \nAIDS Day has been a day dedicated to sending messages of compassion, \nhope, solidarity, and understanding.\n  Commemorating this day is a small but important gesture, and it is \nthe least we can do in the face of the worst pandemic mankind has ever \nknown. Yesterday, UNAIDS and the World Health Organization released a \njoint report that illustrates the enormity of the AIDS pandemic. The \nnumbers are so staggering that they are almost incomprehensible. There \nare now 40 million people living with AIDS. Two point seven million of \nthem are children. In the past year, there have been 5 million new HIV \ninfections and 3 million AIDS deaths.\n  Many countries are seeing their future--embodied in their young \npeople--ravaged by this disease. People under the age of 25 represent \nhalf of all new HIV infection cases, and there are now 10 million \npeople between the ages of 15 and 24 living with HIV/AIDS. Every \nminute, five more young people are infected with HIV. As I have argued \nbefore, this is not just a humanitarian issue, it is also an economic \nand national security issue.\n  The International Labor Organization reports that by 2020, AIDS will \nreduce national workforces so much that countries with the highest \nrates of prevalence will see their GDPs drop by as much as 20 percent \nin the next 20 years. How can companies in these nations afford the \nincreased costs for insurance, benefits, training, and illness in his \nenvironment?\n  The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that 7 million farm \nworkers have died from AIDS-related causes since 1985, and 16 million \nmore are expected to die in the next 20 years. How can these countries \nmaintain--let alone increase--agricultural output under these \ncircumstances?\n  The United Nations reports that in 1999, 860,000 students in sub-\nSaharan Africa lost their teachers to AIDS. How can countries educate \ntheir children with these losses? These numbers are a disturbing \nsnapshot of the epidemic today. Tragically, they may only be the tip of \nthe iceberg.\n  Experts tell us that the epidemic in many parts of the world is still \nin its early stages. Globally, most people infected are unaware they \ncarry the virus. Many millions more know nothing about HIV and how to \nprotect themselves against it. If we are ever to staunch the AIDS \nepidemic, we must continue--and increase--our efforts at prevention.\n  Since the 1980s, the United States has found prevention efforts such \nas school-based education, perinatal prevention programs, and screening \nthe blood supply, to prove effective. As a member of the family of \nnations, we have to do a better job of promoting and supporting \ninternational prevention and education programs. We were able to take a \npositive step in the foreign operations appropriations bill, where the \nSenate added significant funds to invest in prevention programs around \nthe globe.\n  I am hopeful the final bill will include those funds, but prevention \nand treatment must go hand in hand, because without treatment options, \nat-risk individuals have no incentive to submit to testing or to \npractice prevention. We have taken some positive steps in treating HIV/\nAIDS, but much more needs to be done. We have worked hard to invest \n$300 million for the U.N. Global Trust Fund on AIDS, TB, and Malaria. \nWhile it is not nearly enough for this challenge, it is a significant \nfirst step.\n  As that fund is developed, we have to make sure that its resources \nare dedicated to fighting this disease on all fronts--including \ntreatment. While there is pressure to limit the focus of the fund to \nprevention alone, that would be a mistake--and it would limit our \nability to develop a comprehensive agenda to confront this pandemic.\n  The theme designated for this year's World AIDS Day is simply: ``I \ncare. Do you?'' While our words today are important, it is our action \nevery day--on all fronts, in all nations--that are the true measure of \nour caring. On this day, let us recommit ourselves to fighting, and \nultimately defeating, this scourge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We would have tried to do it sooner, but with the \ncloture petitions pending Senators had until 1 p.m. today to file their \namendments. We wanted to really wrap this up. The Dirksen Building is \ngoing to be closed off. In fact, the process is beginning now. By 4 \np.m., it will be wrapped up.\n  I have a few things to do when the two Senators complete their \nstatements, and then we will close the Senate. We did not ask for a \nunanimous consent this morning, thinking something such as this might \nhappen, but we appreciate the cooperation and look forward to the \nstatements of the two Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Mexico be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from Oklahoma for 12 minutes, and \nthat I be recognized to close the Senate following those statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first I say to the occupant of the \nchair, the junior Senator from New Jersey, when he came to the Senate \nhe brought with him a rather distinguished career in investment \nbanking, as I understand it, with a specialization in bonds. Whatever \nthe case may be, he brought with him a tremendous expertise with \nreference to the American economy. Therefore, it makes me doubly proud \nthat the idea many people suggested to me, that ends up being called a \nSocial Security withholding tax holiday for 1 month, is supported by \nthe occupant of the chair, because I give a lot of credit to somebody \nwho comes to the Senate from the business world, talks with the \nbusiness world, talks with labor union people and comes up with an \nanalysis of what will, indeed, be the best economic stimulus of those \nthat have been presented that could be adopted before Christmas and be \neffective, regardless of the arguments, during the next 4 to 5 months. \nIt clearly could be in full effect.\n  First, those who have supported me from the standpoint of business \nare in pretty good company. So whatever we hear from some, that this \ncannot be implemented and that maybe it is not a good idea, let me \nintroduce a letter which I received on November 30. It is a very \ncurrent letter. It is from the Business Roundtable. Now, the Business \nRoundtable has a lot of American business members. This letter comes \nfrom the president, John Castellani--good Italian American name. We had \nnot spoken in advance of my amendment, but this letter, so everybody \nwill know, is an unequivocal enforcement of the holiday as being the \nbest economic stimulus and the best news to provide confidence in the \nAmerican people and that will move the economy ahead in terms of what \nit needs to give it a jump start in these very difficult times.\n  We all know we ought to do two big things. One, we ought to pay for \nall the military needs of our country in a very good appropriations \nbill. The President has told us what he needs. We need to do that. I \nunderstand it will be done next week. That is good.\n  The other thing we have to do is pass a stimulus package. We do not \nhave to pass a package that has a ``stimulus'' label on it. We have to \npass one that could be sent out to the business community, to the \nothers who know what is happening in the American marketplace, and ask \nthem, will this actually\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\nstimulate the economy? Then we could say ``stimulus,'' and those who \nknow say it will stimulate. It is not a bill to meet a commitment.\n  This letter ends up saying, because there are some who say it will \ntake too long, I say to the occupant of the chair, to implement, that \nsome express concern about the ability of companies as a practical \nmatter to implement this on short notice. We have surveyed our \ncompanies to see how quickly the payroll reduction could be \nimplemented. These companies, some of the Nation's largest employers, \nhave said it would be implemented in a range of a couple of days to a \nmaximum of 3 weeks if it is kept simple. We have some leeway as to how \nto implement that holiday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Business Roundtable,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: The Business Roundtable believes \n     that an economic stimulus is needed, and needed now. \n     Moreover, we believe the stimulus should focus on enhancing \n     consumer confidence and spending; that broad-based and \n     significant incentives are needed to spur business demand; \n     and both should be of a size and duration to change spending \n     behavior in the near term.\n       To that end, the members of The Business Roundtable believe \n     two measures would work quickly and effectively to improve \n     cash flow and stimulate demand and productivity. First, we \n     recommend an immediate reduction in the payroll tax. This \n     action, more than any other proposal, will put money into the \n     hands of those who need it and will spend it. A payroll tax \n     reduction diversifies the stimulus on both the demand and \n     supply sides. It also focuses assistance on lower-income \n     individuals. Reducing both the employee and employer portions \n     will reduce pressure on labor costs, and give both employers \n     and employees more cash as soon as the next payday, thus \n     relieving financial pressures on both. Your proposal for a \n     withholding tax ``holiday'' certainly meets these criteria.\n       We continue to believe that enhancing business demand is \n     essential for achieving a quick recovery. Again, the business \n     incentives should be broad-based and of such a magnitude that \n     they change business behavior by accelerating spending that \n     is now being deferred. We also believe that any business \n     stimulus must deal with existing tax provisions, such as \n     Alternative Minimum Tax, which would act to negate the impact \n     of the stimulus.\n       We also understand there has been some concern expressed \n     about the ability of companies, as a practical matter, to \n     implement a payroll tax reduction on short notice. We have \n     surveyed our companies to see how quickly a payroll tax \n     reduction can be implemented. These companies, some of the \n     nation's largest employers, have said it could be implemented \n     in a range of a couple of days to a maximum of three weeks if \n     it is kept simple, and we have some leeway how to implement \n     the tax holiday.\n       If we can provide further information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               John J. Castellani.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope those talking will at least put this letter \namong the things they consider in terms of the reality of the impact on \nthe American consumer, the American buyer and seller, the American \nworker, and the American employer. This says an awful lot about many \nemployed people. I don't know how many million American employees are \nrepresented by this group, but it is an awful lot.\n  Having said that, I understand there is some concern about the Social \nSecurity recipients of our country. Nobody will disagree the best thing \nfor the Social Security trust fund and the best thing for you, Social \nSecurity recipients of the future, is for this economy to get going \nsooner rather than later. If we had a little time, we could debate and \nshow graphs about what will happen to Social Security if this American \neconomy stays in the tank for another year or for 2 years and what will \nhappen if it comes out in 6 months. If we can get it out quick and get \nit growing, every Social Security recipient of today and those planning \non it in the future will know the best thing we can do is pass the \nstimulus package. That will start the economy. There is no harm to the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  We are already using it because we are in the red. All we are saying \nis, as soon as we take it out, we replenish it, day by day, hour by \nhour, and nothing can happen to the fund. If you want to talk about \nprotecting it, that is all well and good, but the reality is the best \nway to protect it is to do it and pass this stimulus. That will help \nthe Social Security recipients the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12240-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12240-S12242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RAILROAD RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I congratulate and compliment my friend \nand colleague, Senator Domenici, for his statement and also for his \nleadership and his innovation. He has come up with an idea to help \nstimulate the economy that is far superior than some of the proposals \nbeing discussed, one of which is to give $300 per individual or $600 \nper family if they did not get a check last year.\n  Last year, we gave checks to people who paid taxes. Some people were \nsaying, ``Give money to people that did not pay taxes,'' \nnotwithstanding the fact they were eligible for the earned-income tax \ncredit, which, in many cases, was worth 3 or 4 times whatever payroll \ntaxes they might have paid. The position of the Senator from New Mexico \nis far superior.\n  I happen to be one concerned about deficits and I am concerned about \nrunaway spending. I contacted some individuals and said, we have agreed \nto 13.3 percent spending growth for next year, but many others say that \nis not near enough; we need to do more. So I will state a few facts.\n  Last year's spending--the spending we completed in September of 2001, \ntotal discretionary spending, the spending we control by \nappropriations, that fluctuates, whatever we appropriate--was $640 \nbillion, 9.6 percent more than the previous year, which was at $584 \nbillion.\n  The President's budget for 2002, which we have just started for the \nfiscal year, was to grow at 6.1 percent. He agreed in a bipartisan \nagreement to throw in a few billion more for education, and there was \nan agreement with the appropriators to increase that figure to $686 \nbillion. That calls for a growth rate of 7.1 percent. That was agreed \nto in October. Some of our colleagues almost insulted the President, \nsaying they wanted it in writing. The President gave it in writing, in \na letter in October, that all the appropriated accounts would be at \n$686 billion, a growth rate of 7.1 percent.\n\n  With the tragedy of September the 11th, the President agreed we had a \nbipartisan agreement to increase that level. Originally, it was $20 \nbillion, and at the last day that was doubled, from $20 billion to $40 \nbillion, due to requests in New York, New Jersey, and other places. \nThere is, again, bipartisan agreement that was adopted unanimously in \nthe Senate.\n  Adding the $40 billion on top of the $686 billion, it is $726 \nbillion, an increase of 13.3 percent. That is where we are now. That is \na lot. It is several times the rate of growth of inflation. But the $40 \nbillion is extraordinary, so maybe we should not count that, but we \nhave a lot of other things happening. We still need budgets. Senator \nDomenici, former chairman of the Budget Committee, used to hammer on \nfiscal discipline, and we are acting as if fiscal discipline does not \nmatter.\n  A few other things have happened. We have passed an airline \nassistance or the airline bailout bill. The cost of that, most people \nbelieve, is $15 billion. It is not really. There was a $5 billion cash \noutlay and $10 billion in loan guarantees. Hopefully, the $10 billion \nin loan guarantees will not cost that much; it will be significant \ncost.\n  We have also passed a victim's compensation fund. I know the occupant \nof the care has to be familiar with this because he has constituents \ninvolved. There is a lot of liability dealing with the victim's \ncompensation funds. We passed that as part of the airline bill. I \nopposed it because I didn't think we had enough time to consider how to \ncompensate victims from the September 11 disaster. A lot of people were \nkilled and a lot of people injured. How do we compensate them? We \ncreated a special master. The President appointed a special master. I \ncompliment him. The special master has one of the toughest jobs \nanywhere. I compliment him. He is doing it pro bono. It is a big \nchallenge. He will try to meet deadlines, in months, to come up with a \nfair and equitable compensation system for victims. It could cost the \nGovernment billions of dollars. No one has a clue how much that will \ncost. That is already the law of the land.\n\n[[Page S12241]]\n\n  We don't know how much the insurance companies are going to pay. \nHopefully, most of the money comes from insurance proceeds. Again, that \nis out there. It is a liability. And there are other items. Many that \nwe are considering will be resolved in the next couple of weeks. One is \nthe railroad retirement bill, with an outlay of $15 billion. We will \nwrite a check.\n  I am embarrassed for the House, saying this doesn't count, this check \nwe will write does not count; we will not score it. I can't remember \never doing that, certainly not to the tune of billions of dollars. It \nis shameful and disgraceful, and it should not happen. I will work to \nsee it does not happen. I predict I will be successful.\n  If it passes, we might as well throw away the budget. If we are going \nto put in language, ``this doesn't count toward the budget; ignore it; \ndon't count it or score it,'' then why have a budget? There is no sense \nwhatever. The cost of that bill is $15 billion.\n\n  Also, when Senator Domenici was speaking, he came up with an idea for \na payroll tax holiday. His idea was not written by lobbyists. The \nrailroad retirement bill was not written by Congressmen or Senators. I \ncannot remember in my 21 years in the Senate ever having a bill totally \nwritten by special interest groups that cost billions of dollars that \nnobody even touched. Nobody had a hearing. There was no hearing in the \nHouse or in the Senate.\n  I have been working on pensions for a long time in my own company, \nand when I was in the State senate, I was on the retirement committee. \nMy first trip to Washington, DC, was on ERISA, Employee Retirement and \nIncome Security Act. I know a bit about pensions. Nobody is looking at \nit. I will look at it a lot more since we will be on that next week.\n  My point today is some are willing to commit another $15 billion. All \nof this adds to the deficit, all of this adds to the publicly held \ndebt. Some people have suggested there is no cost involved. We are \nmoving from government to government debt, or government IOU in a fund \nthat does not cost us an outlay, real outlay. Now we are moving it to \npublicly held debt where the Federal Government will have to write a \ncheck, where taxpayers have to pay $1 billion in interest expense for \nthe $10 billion.\n  That is not the only spending program we have going. We would have \nthe stimulus package. Senator Baucus had a bill from the Finance \nCommittee. There was over $2 in spending for every $1 of tax cuts. I \nwill have this printed in the Record so people can see it.\n  There were tax cuts of $19.4 billion, but the rest of it is \nspending--maybe using, in some cases, the Tax Code, like supplemental \nrebate checks. We would give people checks even if they did not pay \ntaxes. How can you call that a tax cut? That is a check. We are writing \nchecks. It doesn't have anything to do with cutting taxes.\n  There is expansion of unemployment benefits, which I am sure we will \nprobably agree to a significant expansion of unemployment benefits, \nprobably a 50-percent expansion in time eligibility, going from 26 \nweeks to an additional 13 weeks. I expect that will be agreed upon.\n  Most of this is $66.8 billion, with the compensation of $19 billion; \nthe rest of it is spending. There is over $2 in spending for every \ndollar in tax decrease. So I am adding that spending under the spending \nwe have already had. If that were included, and hopefully most will not \nbe, we have a lot of spending in that capacity.\n  We have the farm bill. If our colleagues have not looked at the farm \nbill--and I heard there may be a motion to move to the farm bill before \ntoo long--I hope they will look at it. I am from a farm State. I am \nembarrassed for the farm bill that came out of the Agriculture \nCommittee. I am embarrassed for it. I was embarrassed when we had the \nstimulus package and I noticed there were several billion dollars for \nagriculture for subsidies for bison and cranberries and items that we \nnever had in an agricultural program, and now we are looking at the \nfarm bill and talking about subsidies in the billions of dollars. We \nare talking about raising the price of milk 26 cents a gallon for \neverybody in America.\n\n  This farm bill goes the wrong way and it spends a whole lot of money. \nI don't know if people are trying to harvest the Government or what, \nbut the net result of that farm bill is people are going to make more \nmoney from the Government than they will ever make from agriculture. \nThe sad point is 10 percent of the farmers are going to get over half \nthe benefit. We are going to have to discuss that for a while. We are \ngoing to have to change it. The Senate is the place to change it. I \ndon't care if we do it this year or do it next year--that is the \nmajority leader's call--but we are going to spend a little time on that \nbill. It needs to be improved. It costs a lot of money and that is the \nessence of my comments today.\n  Who writes the budget? Where is the Budget Committee chairman? Where \nis the fiscal discipline? We are now in the red. Granted, we had \nbipartisan agreement to go to increases of spending to 7.1 percent. \nThen we all agreed, let's have another $40 billion to deal with the \ndisaster. But there are lots of other proposals. I didn't mention \nSenator Byrd had another proposal for another $15 billion for homeland \nsecurity. I think a lot of that can be financed out of the $20 billion. \nWe have not even finished spending the second $20 billion of the $40 \nbillion that is now added to the Department of Defense bill. We have \nnot finished that. Yet some say we have to add $15 billion on top of \nit.\n  If I look at the spending package submitted by Senator Baucus, I am \nlooking at spending that is close to $50 billion. Since they add \nSenator Byrd's package to it--or at one time it was over, it was $60 \nbillion in spending and $19 billion in tax cuts.\n  Then we have the farm bill, and I see the farm bill will cost \nbillions and billions of dollars. I think that is grossly \nirresponsible. I am looking at the farmers in my State. How much are \nthey making? I have farmers in my State making millions of dollars a \nyear from taxpayers. These are millionaires in the first place. I love \nthem, but I don't think we should have to be writing them a check--just \nas I don't think we have to write major investment companies a $4,800 \ntax credit for every employee they employ in New York City. I want to \nhelp New York City, but what are we doing giving them almost a $5,000 \ntax credit? If they have 100 employees, we are going to give them a \n$500,000 tax credit? For what? Let's help people who need help.\n  I think it is running away. I think spending has gotten out of hand. \nI think we are going to have to draw the line. I think we are going to \nhave to show some fiscal discipline. We have not been showing it \nlately.\n  President Bush has actually drawn the line and said: I am going to \nstay with this amount. He said: I will come back to Congress and work \nwith Governor Ridge and make additional submissions when we really know \nexactly what we need and we will do that next year. He has the votes to \nsupport him in the Senate. I hope we do not say we will try to run over \nhim and come up with a higher amount and defy him to veto it. He said \nhe will veto it. We have the votes to sustain the veto so let's not \nwaste our time. Let's act together, start acting as if we have a budget \nand not pass bills that say this $15 billion doesn't count. That would \nbe the height of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's start showing a little fiscal discipline. \nLet's start totaling up what we have done so far on the spending side \nand make sure we do not build ourselves into such a fiscal posture that \nthe new base of spending is such we will never be able to climb back \ninto a surplus.\n\n  I notice my friend and colleague from Nevada is here. Let me conclude \nwith a couple of requests.\n\n\n                             CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  I have had the pleasure of working with the Senator from Nevada for \n20-some years. I think the world of him. He and I are both engaged in \ntrying to help people get confirmed. I urge my colleague, in every way \nI possibly can, to help us confirm Gene Scalia. Gene Scalia, who \nhappens to be the son of Justice Scalia, was nominated by President \nBush in April to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor--Secretary \nChao's Department of Labor. Secretary Chao talked to me. She needs Gene \nScalia. She needs a Solicitor. That is one of the most important \npositions in any agency and certainly in the Department of Labor. She \nneeds Gene Scalia. She asked me numerous times: Please, will you \nconfirm Gene\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\nScalia. I told her I would do everything I could.\n  There are two other nominees I urge my colleague to assist us with, \ntwo nominees for the court of appeals. One is Miguel Estrada, a \nHonduran native, Hispanic. When he came to the United States he \ncouldn't even speak English and graduated in the top of his class at \nHarvard. He is an outstanding individual. We have letters of support on \nMiguel Estrada from everybody, prominent Democrats and others who say \nhe will be an outstanding jurist.\n  One other individual is John Roberts, Jr., who is also nominated to \nthe Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. He argued, I think, 30-\nsome-odd cases before the Supreme Court. He is an outstanding \nindividual. Both of these individuals were nominated by President Bush \nin May and they have not even had a hearing.\n  We have a lot of vacancies in the circuit court. The circuit courts \nare extremely important. These two individuals are extremely qualified. \nI do not know that you could find two more qualified individuals \nanywhere in the country than Miguel Estrada and John Roberts, Jr. So I \nurge my friend from Nevada and the majority leader, and Senator Leahy, \ngive us hearings on these two individuals. I can assure you if they \nhave hearings they will have overwhelming votes in both the committee \nand the Senate. They will be confirmed overwhelmingly. I feel more than \nconfident that will be the case.\n  I also urge my colleague to give us a vote. Gene Scalia is on the \ncalendar. Give us a vote on Gene Scalia as Solicitor for the Department \nof Labor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my feelings are just as strong. My affection \nfor the Senator from Oklahoma is just as strong as he has expressed \nregarding me. I have not heard of John Roberts. I have heard of Miguel \nEstrada. From all I know about both of them, they are fine individuals. \nI see no reason they should not be sitting on the DC Court of Appeals. \nBut that is the extent of my knowledge. I will do what I can to make \nsure there are hearings scheduled.\n  As I said to my friend on a number of occasions, people deserve \nhearings. We are going to do everything we can to live up to what \nSenator Daschle and I have said. Senator Leahy reported nine out \nyesterday, including one circuit court judge. We expect to have votes \non those shortly. He is going to have hearings again next week. It is \nmy understanding--I do not know if there is going to be hearings but he \nsaid he would report out at least four or five more. So that is 13 or \n14 judges we would have.\n  I was talked to yesterday about Sansonetti; the Judiciary Committee \ndid report him out yesterday. There has been some controversy over \nthat. I see no reason, now that he has been reported out, that we \ncannot move forward.\n  I don't know Mr. Scalia. I never met him. I am only speaking for \nmyself, and certainly not Senator Daschle, nor the rest of the \nSenators. I think the situation with Mr. Scalia may be a little more \ndifficult. A number of Members have spoken to me. No one questions his \nintegrity or his credentials, that I know of, or that he is a competent \nlawyer. I think the question is whether this is the right place for \nhim. If he were chosen to be the solicitor of any department other than \nthe Department of Labor, I think his nomination would fly through. But \nbecause of very strong anti-labor comments he made, a number of Members \non my side have come to me to express some real concerns.\n  Being as candid as I can with my friend, I think that may be a little \nmore difficult but something on which we can work.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, Gene Scalia was \nreported out of the Labor Committee on October 17. He has been on the \ncalendar. I urge that we have a vote. There is not an anti-labor bone \nin his body. If anybody questions that, I urge them to talk to him. \nSome people are trying to hold up his nomination because he had some \nquestions about ergonomics. The Senator from Nevada, I know, had \nserious questions about ergonomics. In their proposed regulations, the \nClinton administration tried to almost legislate a Federal workers \ncompensation system without going through Congress.\n  Again, I think Gene Scalia is an outstanding nominee. I think the \nSecretary of Labor is entitled to a solicitor, and he is certainly \nentitled to a vote to find out where the votes are. I urge my \ncolleagues to help us make that happen, to give him a vote and a day in \nthe Senate, and not keep him in limbo indefinitely.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12242-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the \noutstanding accomplishment of Cuba, Missouri on becoming the official \nRoute 66 Mural City as declared by the Missouri State House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Cuba, Missouri is located along Interstate 44 and highway 19 near the \nMeramec River State Park and the Huzzah river in Crawford County. Also, \nlocated near by is the beautiful Mark Twain National Forrest offering a \ngreat deal of hunting, fishing and water recreation. Cuba is a \nbeautiful city and has much to offer its citizens and those who visit.\n  Located along the historic Route 66 and established in 1857, Cuba has \nwitnessed and been a part of many historical events. Through local \nartisans, Cuba, MO has taken the incitive to remind its citizens and \nthose who visit of its storied past through three murals on local \nbuildings. The three murals currently displayed on the buildings depict \nthe early history of the town, and present us with a reminder of its \nbeautiful apple orchards, the six residents who lost their lives \ndefending this great nation during World War Two, and the original \nPeoples Bank building. These murals also are a reminder of the history \nthat not only shaped Cuba, but our great state as well. Although the \npopulation of Cuba is only about 3,200 people, the city continues to \ngrow and prosper. I commend them on taking the incitive to remember our \nhistory and educate those who visit this great city by this beautiful \ndisplay of art work.\n  There are plans to finish ten murals along historic Route 66 by the \nyear 2007. Cuba was the first community to take the initiative to paint \nthese murals and now serves as the center for development for these \nmurals, including obtaining a trademark on Route 66 Murals. Again, I \ncongratulate them on such a wonderful project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12242-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12242-S12243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOD BLESS AMERICA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Wisconsin State Council of \nVietnam Veterans of America, part of the congressionally chartered \nVietnam Veterans of America, have been steadfast\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nadvocates for Wisconsin's veterans and their families. They have asked \nme to have printed in the Record the following editorial from The \nBadger Veteran, the newsmagazine that they produce.\n  The editorial follows.\n\n                         May God Bless America\n\n       The men and women of the Wisconsin State Council of Vietnam \n     Veterans of America understand all too well the horrors of \n     war. Until September 11th, our nation was blessed to have 136 \n     years without a life being lost on America's mainland to war. \n     Our sense--our collective illusion--of invulnerability was \n     shattered forever by acts of terror in New York, Washington \n     and Pennsylvania on the 11th of September.\n       Our national security must never again be treated as an \n     afterthought. It must not be placed on hold in the name of \n     inconvenience not compromised because it might have some \n     limited impact on the bottom line of our country's economy.\n       A generation ago, we sent millions of Americans to fight a \n     protracted war in Southeast Asia. The vast majority of \n     Americans had the luxury of turning out that war simply by \n     tuning off their TVs whenever they grew tired of it or found \n     it too depressing. It is a luxury no American will ever have \n     in our war against terrorism.\n       Today, America has once again been drawn into a war--one \n     not of our making. It will be protracted. It will be very \n     costly--in dollars and, tragically, as in any war, in more \n     lives, including more American lives. As veterans, we \n     understand there is nothing fair or good about any war. And \n     we know Americans will no doubt find themselves debating the \n     conduct of this war in the halls of Congress and in homes and \n     byways throughout our nation. There is nothing wrong with \n     free and open debate. It is the American way. But Americans \n     are also an impatient people who like quick resolution of \n     events that disrupt their lives. This war promises no quick \n     fixes. It will take more time than we will have patience. But \n     patience is something for which Americans must collectively \n     and continually search our very beings as the frustrations of \n     a protracted war begin to take their toll on our resolve. And \n     patience will have to be found time and again if we are to \n     prevail.\n       We urge the people of Wisconsin and the United States to \n     stay the course until we cripple the world's terrorist \n     networks. We urge President Bush and our national leaders to \n     be mindful of the lessons of the Vietnam War, the Soviet-\n     Afghanistan War and the Powell Doctrine with respect to \n     committing U.S. ground troops to foreign battlefields. And we \n     ask and expect that criticisms of this war and its policies \n     will be directed at our government and our leadership who are \n     responsible for the policies and never again at the men and \n     women our government sends into harm's way on behalf of our \n     nation.\n       This is also a time for remembering, for coming together. A \n     time to heal while being vigilant. A time to remind our foes \n     that when threatened or attacked, we will respond with a \n     ferocity that they shall regret unleashing. As President Bush \n     stated, we are a good, peace loving nation. Our enemies \n     proceed at their peril whenever they infer from our nature \n     that we will turn the other cheek when attacked.\n       This will also be a time for the vast majority of \n     Americans--especially young Americans--to learn about the \n     importance of some ``old fashioned'' values that have lost \n     relevance to too many for too long. Values like duty, honor \n     and country, with an increased appreciation for a simple, \n     compelling fact: Despite all of America's flaws and \n     shortcomings, we have the privilege of living in the greatest \n     nation on earth.\n       On behalf of the members of Vietnam Veterans of America in \n     Wisconsin and ourselves, we rededicate the Wisconsin State \n     Council's commitment to our Founding Principle, ``Never again \n     will one generation of veterans abandon another.'' And we \n     promise to continue our efforts to make VVA's motto, ``In \n     Service to America,'' an ongoing reality.\n       May God bless the United States of America.

STEVEN HYMAN\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with genuine regret that I \nlearned about the planned departure of Dr. Steven Hyman as Director of \nthe National Institute of Mental Health at the NIH. Steve is a Harvard-\ntrained psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has impressed me with his \ndeep understanding that mental illnesses are very real disturbances \noccurring in the brain, the most complex structure in the known \nuniverse. Steve used his expertise as a scientist, along with his \nremarkable ability to make science readily understandable to lay \npersons, to convey a simple but profound message to us and to the \nAmerican public, that there is no scientific or medical justification \nfor treating mental illnesses differently than any other illness.\n  Dr. Hyman has been at the helm of NIMH with a commitment to \nencouraging and supporting the basic research that will enable us to \ndevelop exciting new treatments, based on an understanding of the \ndisease process itself. Although our current treatments get \nincreasingly better, they are not perfect, they need to be more \ntargeted and rational because as good as these treatments are, those \nwith mental illness desperately need treatments that are more \neffective. We need to know how these medications are going to work in \npatients living in the real world, with real work problems because \npeople suffering from severe mental illness often have very complex \ncomplicating factors that contribute to the mental illness.\n  I want to express my sincere appreciation for Steve Hyman's forceful \nvoice of reason, explaining patiently and constantly that, while we \ndon't understand mental illness completely, thanks to magnificent new \ntechnology and scientific knowledge, the brain is unlocking its \nsecrets, and the future is bright. This, in turn, I believe has helped \nconvince our colleagues, and the American public--that there must be \nparity for mental health now.\n  Steve will be missed, but he has accomplished much during his tenure \nat the National Institute of Mental Health; his success in bringing \nresearch on mental disorders to the forefront of public consciousness \nwill be a strong foundation that his successor must build upon. Nancy \nand I wish Steve and his family great success and happiness as he \nbegins his new duties as Provost at Harvard University.\n\n\n  a transition for one of our nation's foremost mental health leaders\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nextraordinary achievements of Dr. Steve Hyman as Director of the \nNational Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of \nHealth, and to acknowledge his departure as he moves forward to become \nProvost of his alma mater, Harvard University. As we strive to maintain \nthe recent Senate victory passing mental health parity legislation, I \nam reminded again about how fortunate it was to have Steve's leadership \nduring these critical years. His expertise and remarkable ability to \nconvey complex scientific information to the public and to Congress \nhave brought us so much further in the struggle to reduce stigma and to \nrecognize as a society that mental illnesses are real and treatable. \nThe basic scientific facts of mental illness are straightforward, but \nthe difficulties encountered by those who want to eliminate the cruel \nand unjust stigma that surrounds diseases like schizophrenia, \ndepression, bipolar disorder and others have been monumental. Mental \nillnesses represent a major portion of the disease burden in the United \nStates and worldwide; depression is the leading cause of disability in \nthe U.S. and throughout the developed world. And yet, our efforts to \nreduce stigma and provide fair treatment for people with mental illness \nare still needed. Parity for mental health treatment is a civil rights \nissue, and the fight for the rights of those with mental illness will \nnot be stopped.\n  When Steve first came to NIMN, he immediately stated unequivocally \nthat there is no scientific basis for treating mental disorders any \ndifferently than other illnesses with respect to insurance coverage. \nThat was his objective and straightforward view as a distinguished \nneuroscientist. I have watched Steve for these last 5\\1/2\\ years at the \nhelm of NIMH, and he has clearly taken the scientific study of mental \nillness very far. His leadership and his extraordinary talents as a \nscientist, communicator, and teacher have made him a major force in \nadvancing the public's awareness of the brain and its dysfunctions. \nAlthough stigma still exists, these are very few who dare to challenge \nthe scientific record that mental illnesses are very real disorders of \nthe brain, often disrupting that which makes us most human, our \nbehavior.\n  I am particularly pleased that Steve has been at the forefront of the \nefforts to include the voices of patients and families in the overall \nplanning process at the NIMH. He has sponsored public, participatory \nmeetings in various areas\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nof the country, not only to bring information about the latest \nscientific breakthroughs, but also to seek input from people who live \nin diverse cultures. To his credit, Steve understood that this process \nwas necessary so that we ensure that the NIMH addressed questions that \nare relevant and important to all Americans, and to include this \ninformation in planning the future of NIMH's research agenda. Steve \nalso enthusiastically supported the effort to include public members as \npart of the scientific peer review panels that review grant \napplications. Steve believes, as I do, that the views of patients and \nfamily members are crucial because they offer a unique view of \nresearch. They ask, Steve often said, the ``so what'' questions that \nare critical to the real lives of people: Will this research help those \nwho are suffering? Will it make a difference?\n  As he departs, I know that many of my colleagues join me in wishing \nhim well and thanking him for all he has done to further scientific \nresearch and treatment of mental illness. I am confident that Steve has \nplaced the NIMH on a course that promises to build on the remarkable \nachievements already achieved, one that will take full advantage of \nscientific opportunities and the extraordinarily challenging public \nhealth needs that we as a country are now facing. Dr. Steve Hyman will \nbe sorely missed, but I know he will continue to be a major force for \nthe improvement of mental health care worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12244-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12244-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12244-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3210.

A bill to enhance the border security of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Brownback, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Kyl, Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and other \ncolleagues in introducing legislation to strengthen the security of our \nborders,\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\nimprove our ability to screen foreign nationals, and enhance our \nability to deter potential terrorists. Senator Brownback and I have \nworked closely with Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl over the last \nmonth to develop a broad and effective response to the national \nsecurity challenges we face. The need is urgent to improve our \nintelligence and technology capabilities, strengthen training programs \nfor border officials and foreign service officers, and improve the \nmonitoring of foreign nationals already in the United States.\n  In strengthening security at our borders, we must also safeguard the \nunobstructed entry of the more than 31 million persons who enter the \nU.S. legally each year as visitors, students, and temporary workers. \nMany others cross our borders from Canada and Mexico to conduct daily \nbusiness or visit close family members.\n  We also must live up to our history and heritage as a nation of \nimmigrants. Continued immigration is part of our national well-being, \nour identity as a Nation, and our strength in today's world. In \ndefending America, we are also defending the fundamental constitutional \nprinciples that have made America strong in the past and will make us \neven stronger in the future.\n  Our action must strike a careful balance between protecting civil \nliberties and providing the means for law enforcement to identify, \napprehend and detain potential terrorists. It makes no sense to enact \nreforms that severely limit immigration into the United States. \n``Fortress America,'' even if it could be achieved, is an inadequate \nand ineffective response to the terrorist threat.\n  Enforcement personnel at our ports of entry are a key part of the \nbattle against terrorism, and we must provide them with greater \nresources, training, and technology. These men and women have a \nsignificant role in the battle against terrorism. This legislation will \nensure that they receive adequate pay, can hire necessary personnel, \nare well-trained to identify individuals who pose a security threat, \nhave access to important intelligence information, and have the \ntechnologies they need to enhance border security and facilitate cross-\nborder commerce.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service must be able to retain \nhighly skilled immigration inspectors. Our legislation provides \nincentives to immigration inspectors by providing them with the same \nbenefits as other law enforcement personnel.\n  Expanding the use of biometric technology is critical to securing our \nborders. This legislation authorizes the funding needed to bring our \nports of entry into the biometric age and equip them with biometric \ndata readers and scanners.\n  We must expand the use of biometric border crossing cards. The time \nframe previously allowed for individuals to obtain these cards was not \nsufficient. This legislation extends the deadline for individuals \ncrossing the border to acquire the biometric cards.\n  The USA Patriot Act addressed the need for machine-readable \npassports, but it did not focus on the need for machine-readable visas \nissued by the United States. This legislation enables the Department of \nState to raise fees through the use of machine-readable visas and use \nthe funds collected from these fees to improve technology at our ports \nof entry.\n  Our efforts to improve border security must also include enhanced \ncoordination and information-sharing by the Department of State, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies. This legislation will require the President to \nsubmit and implement a plan to improve access to critical security \ninformation. It will create an electronic data system to give those \nresponsible for screening visa applicants and persons entering the U.S. \nthe tools they need to make informed decisions. It also provides for a \ntemporary system until the President's plan is fully implemented.\n  We must also strengthen our ability to monitor foreign nationals in \nthe United States. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation mandating the \ndevelopment of an automated entry/exit control system to record the \nentry of every non-citizen arriving in the U.S., and to match it with \nthe record of departure. Although the technology is currently available \nfor such a system, it has not been put in place because of the high \ncosts involved. Our legislation builds on the anti-terrorism bill and \nprovides greater direction to the INS for implementing the entry/exit \nsystem.\n  We must improve the ability of foreign service officers to detect and \nintercept potential terrorists before they arrive in the U.S. Most \nforeign nationals who travel here must apply for visas at American \nconsulates overseas. Traditionally, consular officers have concentrated \non interviewing applicants to determine whether they are likely to \nviolate their visa status. Although this review is important, consular \nofficers must also be trained specifically to screen for security \nthreats.\n  Terrorist lookout committees will be established in every U.S. \nconsular mission abroad in order to focus the attention of our consular \nofficers on specific threats and provide essential critical national \nsecurity information to those responsible for issuing visas and \nupdating the lookout database.\n  This legislation will help restrict visas to foreign nationals from \ncountries that the Department of State has determined are sponsors of \nterrorism. It prohibits issuing visas to individuals from countries \nthat sponsor terrorism, unless the Secretary of State has determined \nthat the person is not a security threat.\n  The current Visa Waiver Program, which allows individuals from \nparticipating countries to enter the U.S. for a limited period without \nvisas, strengthens relations between the United States and those \ncountries, and encourages economic growth around the world. Given it's \nimportance, we must safeguard its continued use, while also ensuring \nthat a country's designation as a participant in the program does not \nundermine U.S. law enforcement and security. This legislation will only \nallow a country to be designated as a visa waiver participant, or \ncontinue to be designated, if the Attorney General and Secretary of \nState determine that the country reports instances of passport theft to \nthe U.S. government in a timely manner.\n  We must do more to improve our ability to screen individuals along \nour entire North American perimeter. This legislation directs the \nDepartment of State, the Department of Transportation, the Department \nof Justice and the INS to work with the Office of Homeland Security to \nscreen individuals at the perimeter before they reach our continent, \nand to work with Canada and Mexico to coordinate these efforts.\n  We must require all airlines to electronically transmit passenger \nlists to destination airports in the United States, so that once planes \nhave landed, law enforcement authorities can intercept passengers who \nare on federal lookout lists. United States airlines already do this, \nbut some foreign airlines do not. Our legislation requires all airlines \nand all other vessels to transmit passenger manifest information prior \nto their arrival in the United States.\n  When planes land at our airports, inspectors are under significant \ntime constraints to clear the planes and ensure the safety of all \ndeparting passengers. Our legislation removes the existing 45 minute \ndeadline, and provides inspectors with adequate time to clear and \nsecure aircraft.\n  In 1996, Congress established a program to collect information on \nnon-immigrant foreign students and participants in exchange programs. \nAlthough a pilot phase of this program ended in 1999, a permanent \nsystem has not yet been implemented. Congress enacted provisions in the \nrecent anti-terrorism bill for the quick and effective implementation \nof this system by 2003, but gaps still exist. This legislation will \nincrease the data collected by the monitoring program to include the \ndate of entry, the port of entry, the date of school enrollment, and \nthe date the student leaves the school. It requires the Department of \nState and INS to monitor students who have been given visas, and to \nnotify schools of their entry. It also requires a school to notify the \nINS if a student does not actually report to the school.\n  INS regulations provide for regular reviews of over 26,000 \neducational institutions authorized to enroll foreign students. \nHowever, inspections have\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\nbeen sporadic in recent years. This legislation will require INS to \nmonitor institutions on a regular basis. If institutions fail to comply \nwith these and other requirements, they can lose their ability to admit \nforeign students. In addition, this legislation provides for an interim \nsystem until the program established by the 1996 law is implemented.\n  As we work to achieve stronger tracking systems, we must also \nremember that the vast majority of foreign visitors, students, and \nworkers who overstay their visas are not criminals or terrorists. It \nwould be wrong and unfair, without additional information, to \nstigmatize them.\n  The USA Patriot Act was an important part of the effort to improve \nimmigration security, but further action is needed. This legislation is \na needed bipartisan effort to strengthen the security of our borders \nand enhance our ability to prevent future terrorist attacks, while also \nreaffirming our tradition as a Nation of immigrants. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the terrorist attacks of September 11 \nhave unsettled the public's confidence in our Nation's security and \nhave raised concerns about whether our institutions are up to the task \nof intercepting and thwarting would-be terrorists. Given that the \npersons responsible for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon came from abroad, our citizens understandably ask how these \npeople entered the United States and what can be done to prevent their \nkind from doing so again. Clearly, our immigration laws and policies \nare instrumental to the war on terrorism. While the battle may be waged \non several fronts, for the man or woman on the street, immigration is \nin many ways the front line of our defense.\n  The immigration provisions in the anti-terrorist bill passed earlier \nthis month, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, represent an excellent first \nstep toward improving our border security, but we must not stop there. \nOur Nation receives millions of foreign nationals each year, persons \nwho come to the United States to visit family, to do business, to tour \nour sites, to study and learn. Most of these people enter lawfully and \nmean us well. They are our relatives, our friends, and our business \npartners. They are good for our economy and, as witnesses to our \ndemocracy and our way of life, become our ambassadors of good will to \ntheir home countries.\n  However, the unfortunate reality is that a fraction of these people \nmean us harm, and we must take intelligent measures to keep these \npeople out. For that reason, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleagues Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and others, legislation that looks \nspecifically toward strengthening our borders and better equipping the \nagencies that protect them. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act of 2001 represents an earnest, thoughtful, and bipartisan \neffort to refine our immigration laws and institutions to better combat \nthe evil that threatens our Nation.\n  This legislation recognizes that the war on terrorism is, in large \npart, a war of information. To be successful, we must improve our \nability to collect, compile, and utilize information critical to our \nsafety and national security. This bill requires that the agencies \ntasked with screening visa applicants and applicants for admission, \nnamely the Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, be provided with the necessary law enforcement and \nintelligence information that will enable these agencies to identify \nalien terrorists. By directing better coordination and access, this \nlegislation will bring together the agencies that have the information \nand those that need it. With input from the Office of Homeland \nSecurity, this bill will make prompt and effective information-sharing \nbetween these agencies a reality.\n  In complement to the USA PATRIOT Act, this legislation provides for \nnecessary improvements in the technologies used by the State Department \nand the Service. It provides funding for the State Department to better \ninterface with foreign intelligence information and to better staff its \ninfrastructure. It also provides the Service with guidance on the \nimplementation of the Integrated Entry and Exit Data System, pointing \nthe Service to such tools as biometric identifiers in immigration \ndocuments, machine readable visas and passports, and arrival-departure \nand security databases.\n  To the degree that we can realistically do so, we should attempt to \nintercept terrorists before they reach our borders. Accordingly, we \nmust consider security measures not only at domestic ports of entry but \nalso at foreign ports of departure. To that end, this legislation \ndirects the State Department and the Service, in consultation with \nOffice of Homeland Security, to examine, expand, and enhance screening \nprocedures to take place outside the United States, such as \npreinspection and preclearance. It also requires international air \ncarriers to transmit passenger manifests for pre-arrival review by the \nService. Further, it eliminates the 45-minute statutory limit on \nairport inspections, which many feel compromises the Service's ability \nto screen arriving flights properly. Finally, since we should \nultimately look to expand our security perimeter to include Canada and \nMexico, this bill requires these agencies to work with our neighbors to \ncreate a collaborative North American Security Perimeter.\n  While this legislation mandates certain technological improvements, \nit does not ignore the human element in the security equation. This \nbill requires that ``terrorist lookout committees'' be instituted at \neach consular post and that consular officers be given special training \nfor identifying would-be terrorists. It also provides special training \nto border patrol agents, inspectors, and foreign service officers to \nbetter identify terrorists and security threats to the Unites States. \nMoreover, to help the Service retain its most experienced people on the \nborders, this bill provides the Service with increased flexibility in \npay, certain benefit incentives, and the ability to hire necessary \nsupport staff.\n  Finally, this legislation considers certain classes of aliens that \nraise security concerns for our country: nationals from states that \nsponsor terrorism and foreign students. With respect to the former, \nthis bill expressly prohibits the State Department from issuing a \nnonimmigrant visa to any alien from a country that sponsors terrorism \nuntil it has been determined that the alien does not pose a threat to \nthe safety or national security of the United States. With respect to \nthe latter, this legislation would fill data and reporting gaps in our \nforeign student programs by requiring the Service to electronically \nmonitor every stage in the student visa process. It would also require \nthe school to report a foreign student's failure to enroll and the \nService to monitor schools' compliance with this reporting requirement.\n  While we must be careful not to compromise our values or our economy, \nwe must take intelligent, immediate steps to enhance the security of \nour borders. This legislation would implement many changes that are \nvital to our war on terrorism. I therefore urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nBrownback, and Kyl in introducing the Enhanced Border Security and Visa \nEntry Reform Act of 2001. We submit this legislation with 16 sponsors.\n  This legislation represents a consensus, drawing upon the strengths \nof both the Visa entry Reform Act of 2001, which I introduced with my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and the Enhanced border Security \nAct of 2001, which Senators Kennedy and Brownback introduced.\n  I believe the legislation we are introducing today will garner \nwidespread support from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  September 11 clearly pointed out the shortcomings of the immigration \nand visa system. For example: All 19 terrorist hijackers entered the \nU.S. legally with valid visas. Three of the hijackers had remained in \nthe U.S. after their visas had expired. One entered on a foreign \nstudent visa. Another, Mohammed Atta had filed an application to change \nstatus to M-1, which was granted in July. However, Mr. Atta sought \nadmission and was admitted to the United States based on his then \ncurrent B-1 visitor visa.\n  Most people don't realize how many people come into our country; how \nlittle we know about them; and whether they leave when required.\n\n[[Page S12250]]\n\n  Consider the following: The Visa Waiver Program: 23 million people \nfrom 29 different countries; no visas; little scrutiny; no knowledge \nwhere they go in the U.S. or whether they leave once their visas \nexpire. The INS estimates that over 100,000 blank passports have been \nstolen from government offices in participating countries in recent \nyears.\n  Abuse of the VISA Waiver Program poses threats to U.S. national \nsecurity and increases illegal immigration. For example, one of the co-\nconspirators in the World Trade Center bombing of 1993 deliberately \nchose to use a fraudulent Swedish passport to attempt entry into the \nU.S. because of Sweden's participation in the Visa Waiver Program.\n  Foreign Student Visa Program: more than 500,000 foreign nationals \nentering each year; within the last 10 years, 16,000 came from such \nterrorist supporting states as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, and Syria.\n  The foreign student visa system is one of the most under-regulated \nsystems we have today. We've seen bribes, bureaucracy, and other \nproblems with this system that leave it wide open to abuse by \nterrorists and other criminals.\n  For example, in the early 1990s, five officials at four California \ncolleges, were convicted of taking bribes, providing counterfeit \neducation documents, and fraudulently applying for more than 100 \nforeign student visas.\n  It is unclear what steps the INS took to find and deport the foreign \nnationals involved in this scheme.\n  Each year, we have 300 million border crossings. For the most part, \nthese individuals are legitimate visitors to our country. We currently \nhave no way of tracking all of these visitors.\n  Mohamed Atta, the suspected ringleader of the attack, was admitted as \na non-immigrant visitor in July 2001. He traveled freely to and from \nthe U.S. during the past 2 years and was, according to the INS, in \n``legal status'' the day of the attack. Other hijackers also traveled \nwith ease throughout the country.\n  It has become all too clear that without an adequate tracking system, \nour country becomes a sieve, creating ample opportunities for \nterrorists to enter and establish their operations without detection.\n  I sit as the Chair of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nTechnology, Terrorism and Government Information. Last month, we held a \nhearing on the need for new technologies to assist our government \nagencies in keeping terrorists out of the United States.\n  The testimony at that hearing was very illuminating. We were given a \npicture of an immigration system in chaos, and a border control system \nrife with vulnerabilities. Agency officials don't communicate with each \nother. Computers are incompatible. And even in instances here \ntechnological leaps have been made, like the issuance of more than 4.5 \nmillion ``smart'' border crossing cards with biometric data, the \ntechnology is not even used.\n  Personally, I am astonished that a person can apply for a visa and \ngranted a visa by the State Department, and that there is no mechanism \nby which the FBI or CIA can raise a red flag with regard to the \nindividual if he or she is known to have links to terrorist groups or \notherwise pose a threat to national security.\n  In the wake of September 11, it is unconscionable that a terrorist \nmight be permitted to enter the U.S. simply because our government \nagencies don't share information.\n  Indeed, what we have discovered in the aftermath of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks was that the perpetrators of these attacks had a \ncertain confidence that our immigration laws could be circumvented \nwhere necessary.\n  The terrorists did not have to steal into the country as stowaways on \nsea vessels, or a border-jumpers evading federal authorities. Most, if \nnot all, appeared to have come in with temporary visas, which are \nroutinely granted to tourists, students, and other short-term visitors \nto the U.S.\n  Let me talk about the legislation that I cosponsored with Senators \nKennedy, Brownback, and Kyl.\n  First, a key component of this solution is the creation of an \ninteroperable data system that allows the Department of State, the INS, \nand other relevant Federal agencies to obtain critical information \nabout foreign nationals who seek entry into or who have entered the \nUnited States.\n  Right now, our government agencies use different systems, with \ndifferent information, in different formats. And they often refuse to \nshare that information with other agencies within our own government. \nThis is not acceptable.\n  When a terrorist presents himself at a consular office asking for a \nvisa, or at a border crossing with a passport, we need to make sure \nthat his name and identifying information is checked against an \naccurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive database. Period.\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act would require \nthe creation of this interoperable data system, and will require the \ncooperation of all U.S. government agencies in providing accurate and \ncompatible information to that system.\n  In addition, the interoperable data system would include \nsophisticated, linguistically-based, name-matching algorithms so that \nthe computers can recognize that ``Muhamad Usam Abdel Raqeeb'' and \n``Haj Mohd Othman Abdul Rajeeb,'' are transliterations of the same \nname. In other words, this provision would require agencies to ensure \nthat names can be matched even when they are stored in different sets \nof fields in different databases.\n  Incidentally, this legislation also contains strict privacy \nprovisions, limiting access to this database to authorized Federal \nofficials. And the bill contains severe penalties for wrongful access \nor misuse of information contained in the database.\n  Second, this legislation includes concrete steps to restore integrity \nto the immigration and visa process. including the following: The \nlegislation would require all foreign nationals to be fingerprinted \nand, when appropriate, submit other biometric data, to the State \nDepartment when applying for visa. This provision should help eliminate \nfraud, as well as identify potential threats to the country before they \ngain access.\n  We include reforms of the visa waiver program, so that any country \nwishing to participate in that program must begin to provide its \ncitizens with tamper-proof, machine-readable passports. The passports \nmust contain biometric data by October 26, 2003, to help verify \nidentity at U.S. ports of entry.\n  Prior to admitting a foreign visitor from a visa waiver country, the \nINS inspector must first determine that the individual does not appear \nin any ``lookout'' databases.\n  In addition, the INS would be required to enter stolen passport \nnumbers in the interoperable data system within 72 hours after \nreceiving notification of the loss or theft of a passport.\n  We would establish a robust biometric visa program. By October 26, \n2003, newly issued visas must contain biometric data and other \nidentifying information, like more than 4 million already do on the \nSouthwest border, and, just as importantly, our own officials at the \nborder and other ports of entry must have the equipment necessary to \nread the new biometric cards.\n  We worked closely with the university community in crafting new, \nstrict requirements for the student visa program to crack down on \nfraud, make sure that students really are attending classes, and give \nthe government the ability to track any foreign national who arrives on \na student visa but fails to enroll in school.\n  The legislation prohibits the issuance of a student visa to any \ncitizen of a country identified by the State Department as a terrorist-\nsupporting nation. There is a waiver provision to this prohibition, \nhowever, allowing the State Department to allow students even from \nthese countries in special cases.\n  We require that airlines and cruiseliners provide passenger and crew \nmanifests to immigration officials before arrival, so that any \npotential terrorists or other wrongdoers can be singled out before they \narrive in this country and disappear among the general populace.\n  The bill contains a number of other related provisions as well, but \nthe gist of the legislation is this: Where we can provide law \nenforcement more information about potentially dangerous foreign \nnationals, we do so. Where we can reform our border-crossing system to \nweed out or deter terrorists or others\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\nwho would do us harm, we do so. And where we can update technology to \nmeet the demands of the modern war against terror, we do that as well.\n  As we prepare to modify our immigration system, we must be sure to \nenact changes that are realistic and feasible. We must also provide the \nnecessary tools to implement them.\n  Our Nation will be no more secure tomorrow if we create new top-of-\nthe line databases and do not see to it that government agencies use \nthem to share and receive critical information.\n  We will be no safer tomorrow if we do not create a workable entry-\nexit tracking system to ensure that terrorists do not enter the U.S. \nand blend into our communities without detection.\n  And we will be no safer if we simply authorize new programs and \ninformation sharing, but do not provide the resources necessary to put \nthe new technology at the border, train agents appropriately, and \nrequire our various government agencies to cooperate in this effort.\n  We have a lot to do but I am confident that we will move swiftly to \naddress these important issues. The legislation Senators Kennedy, \nBrownback, Kyl, and I introduce today is an important, and strong, \nfirst step. But this is only the beginning of a long, difficult \nprocess.\n  In closing, I would like to respond to concerns that this bill is \n``anti-immigrant.'' We are a nation of immigrants. Indeed, the \noverwhelming percentage of the people who come to live in this country \ndo so to enjoy the blessings of liberty, equality, and opportunity. The \noverwhelming percentage of the people who visa this country mean us no \nharm.\n  But there are several thousand innocent people, including foreign \nnationals, who were killed on September 11 in part because a network of \nfanatics determined to wreak death, destruction, and terror exploited \nweaknesses in our immigration system to come here, to stay here, to \nstudy here, and to kill here.\n  We learned at Oklahoma City that not all terrorists are foreign \nnationals. But the world is a dangerous place, and there are peopled \nand regimes that would destroy us if they had the chance.\n  We are all casualties of September 11. Our society has necessarily \nchanged as our perception of the threats we face has changed. The \nscales have fallen from our eyes.\n  It is unfortunate that we need to address the vulnerabilities in our \nimmigration system that September 11 painfully revealed. The changes we \nneed to make in that system will inconvenience people. We can ``thank'' \nthe terrorists for that.\n  Once implemented, however, those changes will make it easier for law-\nabiding foreign to visit or study here, and for law-abiding immigrants \nwho want to live here. More important, once they are here, their \nsafety, and ours, will be greatly enhanced.\n  We must do everything we can to deter the terrorists, here and \nabroad, who would do us harm from Oklahoma City to downtown Manhattan, \nwe have learned just how high the stakes are. It would dishonor the \ninnocent victims of September 11 and the brave men and women of our \narmed forces who are defending our liberty at this very instant, if we \nflag or fail in this effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support us on this legislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein \nand I join together to introduce the Enhanced Border Security and Visa \nEntry Reform Act of 2001. This bill represents the merging of counter-\nterrorism legislation recently introduced by Senator Feinstein and I \nand separately by Senators Kennedy and Brownback. This bipartisan, \nstreamlined product, cosponsored by both the chairman and ranking \nRepublican of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will significantly \nenhance our ability to keep terrorists out of the United States and \nfind terrorists who are here. I also want to reiterate my appreciation \nto Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and Brownback, and especially to their \nstaffmembers, for their hard work and cooperation in developing this \nbill. I am hopeful that we can work together toward the bill's passage, \nand signature into law, before the 107th Congress adjourns for the \nyear.\n  Last month the President signed into law anti-terrorism legislation \nthat will provide many of the tools necessary to keep terrorists out of \nthe United States, and to detain those terrorists who have entered our \ncountry. These tools, while all important, will be significantly \nenhanced by the bill we introduce today.\n  Under the Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001, the \nHomeland Defense director will be responsible for the coordination of \nFederal law enforcement and intelligence communities, the Departments \nof Transportation, State, Treasury, and all other relevant agencies to \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive, interoperable electronic data \nsystem for these governmental agencies to find and keep out terrorists. \nThat system will be up and running by October 26, 2003, 2 years after \nthe signing into law of the USA Patriot Act.\n  Under our bill, terrorists will be deprived of the ability to present \nfake or altered international documents in order to gain entrance, or \nstay here. Foreign nationals will be provided with new travel \ndocuments, using new technology that will include a person's \nfingerprint(s) or other form of ``biometric'' identification. These \ncards will be used by visitors upon exit and entry into the United \nStates, and will alert authorities immediately if a visa has expired or \na red flag is raised by a federal agency. Under our bill, any foreign \npassport or other travel document issued after October 26, 2003 will \nhave to contain a biometric component. The deadline for providing for a \nway to compare biometric information presented at the border is also \nOctober 26, 2003.\n  Another provision of the bill will further strengthen the ability of \nthe U.S. Government to prevent terrorists from using our ``Visa Waiver \nProgram'' to enter the country. Under our bill, the 29 participating \nVisa Waiver nations will, in addition to the USA Patriot Act Visa \nWaiver reforms, be required to report stolen passport numbers to the \nState Department; otherwise, a nation is prohibited from participating \nin the program. In addition, our bill clarifies that the Attorney \nGeneral must enter stolen passport numbers into the interoperable data \nsystem within 72 hours of notification of loss or theft. Until that \nsystem is established, the Attorney General must enter that information \ninto any existing data system.\n  Another section of our bill will make a significant difference in our \nefforts to stop terrorists from ever entering our country. Passenger \nmanifests on all flights scheduled to come to the United States must be \nforwarded in real-time, and then cleared, by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service prior to the flight's arrival. All cruise and \ncargo lines and cross-border bus lines will also have to submit such \nlists to the INS. Our bill also removes a current U.S. requirement that \nall passengers on flights to the United States be cleared by the INS \nwithin 45 minutes of arrival. Clearly, in some circumstances, the INS \nwill need more time to clear all prospective entrants to the United \nStates. These simple steps will give appropriate officials advance \nnotice of foreigners coming into the country, particularly visitors or \nimmigrants who pose security threats to the United States.\n  The Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act will also provide much \nneeded reforms and requirements in our U.S. foreign student visa \nprogram, which has allowed numerous foreigners to enter the country \nwithout ever attending classes and, for those who do attend class, with \nlax or no oversight of such students by the Federal Government. Our \nbill will change that, and will require that the State Department \nwithin 4 months, with the concurrence of the Department, maintain a \ncomputer database with all relevant infromation about foreign students.\n  In the past decade, more than 16,000 people have entered the United \nStates on student visas from states included on the Government's list \nof terrorist sponsors. Notwithstanding that Syria is one of the \ncountries on the list, the State Department recently issued visas to 14 \nSyrian nationals so that they could attend flight schools in Fort \nWorth, TX. United States educational institutions will be required to \nimmediately notify the INS when a foreign student violates the term of \nthe visa by failing to show up for class or leaving\n\n[[Page S12252]]\n\nschool early. Our legislation will prevent most persons from obtaining \nstudent visas if they come from terrorist-supporting states such as \nIran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, and Syria, unless the Secretary of State and \nAttorney General determine that such applicants do not pose a threat to \nthe safety or national security of the United States.\n\n  For the first time since the War of 1812, the United States has faced \na massive attack from foreigners on our own soil. Every one of the \nterrorists who committed the September 11 atrocities were foreign \nnationals who had entered the United States legally through our visa \nsystem. None of them should have been allowed entry due to their ties \nto terrorist organizations, and yet even those whose visas had expired \nwere not expelled.\n  Mohamed Atta, for example, the suspected ringleader of the attacks, \nwas allowed into the United States on a tourist visa, even though he \nmade clear his intentions to go to flight school while in the United \nStates. Clearly, at the very least, he should have been queried about \nwhy he was using his tourist visa to attend flight school.\n  Another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, was here on a student visa that had \nexpired as of September 11. Hani Hanjour never attended class. In \naddition, at least two other visitor visa-holders overstayed their \nvisa. In testimony before the Terrorism subcommittee of which I am the \nranking member, U.S. officials have told us that they possess little \ninformation about foreigners who come into this country, how many there \nare, and even whether they leave when required by their visas.\n  America is a nation that welcomes international visitors, and should \nremain so. But terrorists have taken advantage of our system and its \nopenness. Now that we face new threats to our homeland, it is time we \nrestore some balance to our consular and immigration policies.\n  As former chairman and now ranking Republican of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Terrorism Subcommittee, I have long suggested, and strongly \nsupported, many of the anti-terrorism and immigration initiatives now \nbeing advocated by Republicans and Democrats alike. In my sadness about \nthe overwhelming and tragic events that took thousands of precious \nlives, I am resolved to push forward on all fronts to fight against \nterrorism. That means delivering justice to those who are responsible \nfor the lives lost on September 11, and reorganizing the institutions \nof government so that the law-abiding can continue to live their lives \nin freedom. It is extremely important that we pass the Border Security \nand Visa Entry Reform Act before we adjourn for the year. To all of the \nSenators who worked on this bill, including Senators Kennedy, \nFeinstein, Brownback, and Hatch, Snowe, Cantwell, Bond, Sessions, \nThurmond and others I again want to express my appreciation. This bill \nwill make a difference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 1750. A bill to make technical corrections to the hazmat \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLING. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senators \nMcCain, Breaux, and Smith in introducing the Hazmat Endorsements \nRequirement Act. We introduce this legislation today to improve the \nimplementation and effectiveness of Section 1012 of H.R. 3162, The \nUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism, (USA PATRIOT), Act of \n2001, [Public Law 107-56], enacted on October 26, 2001.\n  The legislation we are introducing today primarily addresses \ntechnical corrections to Section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act. Due to \nprocedural agreements, the Senate consideration of H.R. 3162 did not \nprovide for any amendments. I did however, engage in a colloquy with \nChairman Leahy to state my concerns with section 1012 and my desire to \naddress my concerns over substance, scope and procedure in subsequent \nlegislation. The changes in legislation assume continuation of the \nbasic framework of section 1012 requiring that one, States request \nsecurity checks from the Attorney General for driver license applicants \nwho would transport certain hazardous materials; second, the Attorney \nGeneral conduct checks of relevant information systems and then provide \nthe results to the Department of Transportation; and third, the \nDepartment of Transportation notify requesting States whether \napplicants pose a security threat.\n  Our bill does the following: clarifies the definition of hazardous \nmaterials and gives the Secretary the ability to expand the list as \nnational security issues require; defines disqualifying offenses that \nwould result in the denial of a hazardous materials endorsement; \nprovides for an appeals process in the event an individual is denied a \nhazardous materials endorsement based on the results of a background \ncheck; extends the requirement for background checks to Canadian and \nMexican drivers who drive commercial vehicles carrying hazardous \nmaterials in the United States; establishes penalties for fraudulently \nissued or obtained licenses; and requires the Department of \ntransportation to report back to the Congress on security improvements \nthat can be made in the transport of hazardous materials.\n  Approximately 10 million drivers have commercial drivers licenses and \nalmost 2.5 million of those drivers have hazardous materials \nendorsements. The law has not required criminal background checks for \napplicants seeking CDLs. However, section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act \nnow requires any driver of a commercial motor vehicle who transports \nhazardous materials to have a criminal background check prior to being \nissued a commercial drivers license (CDL). That requirement became \neffective upon the enactment of that law in October.\n  Since the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, we have worked to address \nthe concerns raised by all interested parties involved in this issue, \nincluding the administration, the States, public safety officials, \ncommercial motor vehicle drivers, and motor carriers. While everyone \nhas supported the concept of performing background checks, it has not \nyet been implemented because the infrastructure for conducting \nbackground checks does not exist. We believe the provisions contained \nin this legislation will aid the administration, the State licensing \nagencies, and all interested parties by providing a clear understanding \nof the requirements associated with granting a license permitting a \ndriver to transport hazardous cargo.\n\n  Senator Breaux chaired a hearing on October 10, 2001, on bus and \ntruck security and hazardous materials licensing for commercial \ndrivers. Of particular concern were reports that terrorists may have \nbeen seeking licenses to drive trucks with hazardous materials. On \nOctober 4, 2001, a Federal grand jury in Pittsburgh indicted 16 people \non charges of fraudulently obtaining commercial driver's licenses, \nincluding licenses to haul hazardous materials. Other incidents include \na report that in September the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, \narrested a man, Nabil Al-Marabh, linked to an associate of Osama bin \nLaden, who had a hazardous materials drivers license. Al-Marabh had a \ncommercial driver's license issued by the State of Michigan.. That \nlicense, issued on September 11, 2000, allowed Al-Marabh to operate \nvehicles weighing 100,000 pounds or more. Additionally, Al-Marabh \nobtained what is called an ``endorsement'' the same day that allowed \nhim to transport hazardous materials. He took a test and paid the fee \nto obtain that endorsement.\n  During that hearing, many options for increasing the security of \nhazardous materials shipments were discussed, including requiring \nbackground checks for drivers of commercial vehicles carrying hazardous \nmaterials. As chairman, I am committed to working with Senators McCain, \nBreaux, and Smith to introduce a more comprehensive legislative \nproposal next year which will reauthorize the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act, HMTA. Reauthorization of the HMTA addresses \ntraining, emergency response, safety and security concerns for all \nmovements of hazardous materials.\n  Annually, more than four billion tons of hazardous materials, an \nestimated 800,000 hazardous materials shipments daily, are transported \nby land, sea, and air in the United States. While hazardous materials \ntransportation invoices all transportation modes, truck transport \ntypically accounts for the\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\nmajority of all hazardous materials shipments, although the tonnage \ntransported is more equally divided between truck and rail.\n  There are 3.12 million tractor-trailer drivers in the United States. \nThe entire trucking industry employs more than 9 million people. Trucks \nannually transport 6 billion tons of freight, representing 63 percent \nof the total domestic tonnage shipped. There are 540,000 trucking \ncompanies in the U.S., and 80 percent of those have 20 or fewer trucks. \nThe types of vehicles carrying hazardous materials on the Nation's \nhighways range from cargo tank trucks to conventional tractor-trailers \nand flatbeds that carry large portable tank containers.\n  In 2000, there were 17,347 hazardous materials incidents related to \ntransportation in the United States, 14,861 via highway transportation. \nThese incidents are mostly minor releases of chemicals; only 244 \nincidents caused injuries, and there were 13 deaths.\n  Since the events of September 11, 2001, a number of legislative \nproposals have been introduced to address terrorism and the prevention \nof terrorist acts within the United States. I am pleased to report that \nthe Commerce Committee has addressed security concerns in a bipartisan \nmanner in all modes of transportation. On November 19, 2001, the \nPresident signed into law S. 1447, the Aviation Security Act, P.L. 107-\n71. On August 2, 2001, the Commerce Committee favorably reported S. \n1214, the Port and Maritime Security Act, and on October 17, 2001, the \nCommerce Committee unanimously approved S. 1550, the Rail Security Act. \nBoth of these measures are awaiting consideration by the Senate.\n  This legislation which addresses the important issue of the safety of \nhazardous materials transportation on our Nation's highways. This \nlegislation should be considered as soon as possible. We must ensure \nthe hazardous materials transported over our Nation's roads are carried \nby qualified drivers. Our legislation accomplishes this in a manner \nthat provides clear and consistent requirements for licensing with \nminimum bureaucratic red tape and delay in the issuance of licenses to \neligible drivers.\n  I would request that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hazmat Endorsement \n     Requirements Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON ISSUANCE OF HAZMAT LICENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 313 of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 31318.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nHollings, Breaux, and Smith in introducing the Hazmat Endorsements \nRequirement Act. The legislation we are introducing today is in large \npart a technical correction proposal to address Section 1012 of the USA \nPATRIOT Act, enacted October 26, 2001. Today's bill is designed to fill \nin a few of the gaps of the new law with respect to commercial drivers \nlicenses and hazardous materials endorsements and to provide guidance \nto the Department of Transportation and the States on how to implement \nthe new requirements.\n  The safe transport of hazardous materials is of critical importance \nto both our nation's economy and public safety. The events of September \n11 have led to an even greater awareness of the necessity of ensuring \nhazardous cargo is transported in a manner that provides the highest \nlevel of safety and security possible. This bill would help improve the \nsafety and security of hazardous materials transported on our roads and \nhighways by ensuring the driver of such loads is not a risk to national \nsecurity.\n  Annually, more than four billion tons of hazardous materials, an \nestimated 800,000 hazardous materials shipments daily, are transported \nby land, sea, and air in the United States. While hazardous materials \ntransportation involves all transportation modes, truck transport \ntypically accounts for the majority of all hazardous materials \nshipments, although the tonnage transported is more equally divided \nbetween truck and rail. The types of vehicles carrying hazardous \nmaterials on the nation's highways range from cargo tank trucks to \nconventional tractor-trailers and flatbeds that carry large portable \ntank containers. The shipped materials are used in thousands of \ncommercial manufactured products and they include: chlorine for water \ntreatment; ammonia for fertilizers; plastics; home siding materials; \nbattery casings; leather finishes; fireproofing agents for textiles; \nand, motor vehicle gasoline.\n  The hazardous materials industry has a notable safety record, in \nlarge part due to the safety efforts of the individuals and companies \ninvolved in transporting hazardous materials. On average, only 10 to 15 \nfatalities are attributed annually to releases of hazardous materials \nin transportation.\n  The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 was enacted in an \neffort to ensure that drivers of large trucks and buses are qualified \nto operate such vehicles and to remove unsafe and unqualified drivers \nfrom the highways. The 1986 Act, which created the Commercial Driver's \nLicense Program, retained the state's right to issue a driver's \nlicense, but established minimum national standards which states must \nmeet when licensing commercial motor vehicle, CMV, drivers.\n  The CDL program places requirements on the CMV driver, the employing \nmotor carrier and the States. Drivers who operate special types of \nvehicles or who transport passengers or hazardous materials need to \npass additional tests to obtain specific endorsements to permit such \ntransport on their CDL.\n\n[[Page S12255]]\n\n  Since 1986, over 10.5 million drivers have obtained a CDL, and almost \n2.5 million of those drivers have received hazardous materials \nendorsements. The law has not required criminal background checks for \napplicants seeking CDLs. However, section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act \nnow requires any driver of a commercial motor vehicle who transports \nhazardous materials to have a criminal background check prior to being \nissued a commercial drivers license, CDL. That requirement became \neffective upon the enactment of that law in October.\n  Both Senator Hollings and I strongly support the intent of the \nbackground check requirement. Unfortunately, the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee, with jurisdiction over the CDL \nprogram and hazardous materials transportation, did not have an \nopportunity to offer our recommendations to the provision in the USA \nPATRIOT Act due to procedural agreements at the time that legislation \nwas approved by the Senate. Therefore, the measure we are introducing \ntoday provides technical modifications to section 1012 and would ensure \nthe Department of Transportation, the States, and the drivers of \ncommercial motor vehicles have a very clear direction with respect to \nthe requirements associated with a hazardous materials endorsement.\n  Through Senator Hollings leadership, we have sought input on this \nissue from all interested parties, including the administration, the \nstates, public safety officials, commercial motor vehicle drivers, and \nmotor carriers. We believe the provisions contained in this legislation \nwill aid the administration and all interested parties by providing a \nclear understanding of the requirements associated with granting a \nlicense permitting a driver to transport hazardous cargo.\n  I urge my colleagues' timely consideration of this important \nlegislation. We should take expeditious action to ensure the hazardous \nmaterials transported over our nation's roads is provided by qualified \ndrivers. This must be accomplished in a manner that provides clear and \nconsistent requirements for licensing with minimum bureaucratic red \ntape and delay in the issuance of licenses to eligible drivers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bunning, \n        and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1751. A bill to promote the stabilization of the economy by \nencouraging financial institutions to continue to support economic \ndevelopment, including development in urban areas, through the \nprovision of affordable insurance coverage against acts of terrorism, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Enzi, \nBennett, Bunning, and Allard, in introducing the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act of 2001. This legislation will effectively, and in a \nstraightforward way, address a crisis before us.\n  The crisis of which I speak is, like a tidal wave, currently away \nfrom the shore. Its movement is little noticed until it reaches the \nshore, when its consequences will be disastrous. That is, the \nconsequences will be disastrous unless we prepare for them now. This \nlegislation will do that.\n  Tidal waves are started by major seismic, earth shaking events. The \nearth shaking event that set this tidal wave in motion took place on \nSeptember 11. Our Nation has responded admirably to the very visible \nproblems caused by that day. We need to act just as admirably and \neffectively to address this hidden wave.\n  This hidden wave nearing our shores is the unavailability to \nterrorism risk insurance, an unavailability that will strike a little \nmore than one month from now. Already we are receiving signs from all \nacross the country that terrorism risk insurance is becoming increasing \nhard to get, in many cases it is not available at all even today. That \nis because insurance companies have to be able to estimate and measure \nrisk in order to be able to provide for it, in order to be able to \nspread the risk, and to do that so that the insurance is affordable. \nRight now, in the short term, they cannot do that. If they cannot do \nthat, they cannot offer the coverage without jeopardizing the solvency \nof their companies and the value of all their other insurance policies.\n  I want to make it clear that the problem before us is not one of the \nweakness of our insurance industry. It is a strong and vibrant \nindustry. The industry needs no help, no bail out, no government \nassistance. And our bill would not give them any assistance, not one \npenny. Our bill addresses the needs of the insurance customers, the \ncustomers who, without this short term program, will not be able to \nfind affordable insurance coverage against terrorism risks.\n  What does that mean for the economy? It means that without insurance, \nbanks will not make loans where there is an uncovered risk, a risk that \nwhat they are lending the money for might be destroyed or harmed by a \nterrorist. It means that simple, ordinary, everyday business \ntransactions that rely upon the security of underlying insurance \ncoverage will not take place. That means that, without this \nlegislation, come January 1 and the weeks leading up to it a brand new \nweight will be placed upon our economic recovery just as it starts to \nget going.\n  Will the insurance industry be able to figure out how to price this \ncoverage? Yes. But history tells us that they will not figure it out \nright away. It will take a few months, maybe a couple of years.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a program that will work \nto solve this problem in the mean time. It has been put together in \nclose consultation with industry, with the consumers of insurance \nproducts and with the insurance companies. It has been put together in \nclose consultation with the White House and the Treasury Department, \nand it enjoys their support.\n  This bill will not create any new, forever government program. It is \nshort term in structure and intent. It is limited in its extent. It is \ndesigned to force the insurance industry to develop its own capacity to \nhandle this new risk in a shortened period of time. From our \ndiscussions with the industry, with the state regulators, with \ninsurance consumers, we believe that the industry will be up to the \ntask.\n  Central to our proposal is that this legislation would not provide \none penny of federal assistance to the insurance industry. No insurance \ncompany will get a penny out of this program. All of the benefits of \nthis program would go to victims of terrorist activities.\n  The structure of our program is, for a two-year period that may be \nextended by the Secretary of the Treasury for only one additional year, \nto divide the terrorism risk with industry. We say to industry, here, \nyou take the first risk. It is all yours. But we will define what that \ninitial risk is so that you can price it. We will put limits on it. We \nwill, for the period of this program, take over the currently unknown \nrisk, the cataclysmic risk, while you develop the means for dealing \nwith that new risk as well, as the industry always has.\n  Under our program, in the first two years, the industry has sole \nresponsibility for the first $10 billion of risk from terrorist events. \nThe industry then has ten percent of the risk above that to encourage \nthem to manage and become familiar with managing the catastrophic risk, \nwhile the Federal Government will carry ninety percent of that \ncatastrophic risk. If a third year is added, then the industry will \nhave the sole responsibility for the first $20 billion of risk.\n  I believe that this is the most effective way not only to deal with \nthis tidal wave approaching our shores but in fact to ward it off. The \nprogram is simple and understandable. The program does not have the \nvictims of terrorism paying any extra premiums to the government for \nthe coverage provided by the government. We don't make the suffering \npay yet again. But we also do not expose the taxpayer to liability for \nfrivolous lawsuits that might follow a terrorist event.\n  With the Federal Government providing this insurance benefit, we do \nnot also want to open the Treasury doors to frivolous or predatory \nlitigation. But these limitations are narrow, and they are limited to \nthe life of the program. They end when the Federal program ends. The \nlimitations are similar to the limitations in place today against \nlawsuits brought against the federal government. We cannot expose the \ntaxpayer to punitive damages at\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\nthe same time that he is providing generous assistance to the victims \nof terrorism.\n  There are a few things that we need to do before adjournment of the \nCongress this year. I believe that this legislation, that addresses \nthis very serious problem, should be on that sort list of things that \nwe need to do.\n  I ask that the text of the bill and a summary of its highlights be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property and casualty insurance firms are important \n     financial institutions, the products of which allow \n     mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial \n     resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain \n     stability, while responding to a variety of economic, \n     political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of \n     disruption;\n       (2) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain \n     property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable \n     prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and \n     catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban \n     development, and the construction and maintenance of public \n     and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United \n     States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly \n     interconnected world;\n       (3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the \n     unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of \n     terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the \n     recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the \n     stability of the economy;\n       (4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and cost of future terrorist events, and \n     therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism;\n       (5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal \n     with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and \n     casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events, \n     or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for \n     risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could \n     seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property \n     acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic \n     increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity; \n     and\n       (6) the United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of \n     national crisis, while the financial services industry \n     develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs \n     necessary to create a viable financial services market for \n     private terrorism risk insurance.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent \n     system of shared public and private compensation for insured \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism in order to--\n       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and \n     ensure the continued widespread availability and \n     affordability of property and casualty insurance for \n     terrorism risk; and\n       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets \n     to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build \n     capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State \n     insurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n     SEC. 3.

TERMINATION OF PROGRAM; DISCRETIONARY EXTENSION.\n\n       (a) Termination of Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Program shall terminate, on December \n     31, 2003, unless the Secretary--\n       (A) determines, after considering the report and finding \n     required by this section, that the Program should be extended \n     for one additional year, until December 31, 2004; and\n       (B) promptly notifies the Congress of such determination \n     and the reasons therefore.\n       (2) Determination final.--The determination of the \n     Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be final, and shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n       (3) Termination after extension.--If the Program is \n     extended under paragraph (1), this Act is repealed, and the \n     Program shall terminate, on December 31, 2004.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 18 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to Congress--\n       (1) regarding--\n       (A) the availability of insurance coverage for acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (B) the affordability of such coverage, including the \n     effect of such coverage on premiums; and\n       (C) the capacity of the insurance industry to absorb future \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, taking into account \n     the profitability of the insurance industry; and\n       (2) that considers--\n       (A) the impact of the Program on each of the factors \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (B) the probable impact on such factors and on the United \n     States economy if the Program terminates on December 31, \n     2003.\n       (c) Finding Required.--A determination under subsection (a) \n     to extend the Program shall be based on a finding by the \n     Secretary that--\n       (1) widespread market uncertainties continue to disrupt the \n     ability of insurance companies to price insurance coverage \n     for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, thereby \n     resulting in the continuing unavailability of affordable \n     insurance for consumers; and\n       (2) extending the Program for an additional year would \n     likely encourage economic stabilization and facilitate a \n     transition to a viable market for private terrorism risk \n     insurance.\n       (d) Continuing Authority to Pay or Adjust Compensation.--\n     Following the termination of the Program under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary \n     to ensure payment, reimbursement, or adjustment of \n     compensation for insured losses arising out of any act of \n     terrorism occurring during the period in which the Program \n     was in effect under this Act and as to which a determination \n     has been made in accordance with the provisions of section 4 \n     and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n       (e) Study and Report on Scope of the Program.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary, after consultation with the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners, \n     representatives of the insurance industry, and other experts \n     in the insurance field, shall conduct a study of the \n     potential effects of acts of terrorism on the availability of \n     life insurance and other lines of insurance coverage.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Congress on the results of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 7 PRESERVATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect the jurisdiction or \n     regulatory authority of the insurance commissioner (or any \n     agency or office performing like functions) of any State over \n     any participating insurance company or other person--\n       (1) except as specifically provided in this Act; and\n       (2) except that--\n       (A) the definition of the term ``act of terrorism'' in \n     section 3 shall be the exclusive definition for purposes of \n     compensation for insured losses under this Act, and shall \n     preempt any provision of State law that is inconsistent with \n     that definition, to the extent that such provision of law \n     would otherwise apply to any insurance policy relating to \n     terrorism risk in the United States;\n       (B) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and ending on December 31, 2002, rates for terrorism \n     risk insurance covered by this Act and filed with any State \n     shall not be subject to prior approval or a waiting period, \n     under any law of a State that would otherwise be applicable, \n     except that nothing in this Act affects the ability of any \n     State to invalidate a rate as excessive, inadequate, or \n     unfairly discriminatory; and\n       (C) during the period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     this Act and for so long as the Program is in effect as \n     provided in Section 6 (including any period during which the \n     Secretary's authority under Section 6(d) is in effect), books \n     and records of any participating insurance company shall be \n     provided, or caused to be provided, to the Secretary or his \n     designee upon request by the Secretary or his designee \n     notwithstanding any provision of the laws of any State \n     prohibiting or limiting such access.\n\n     SEC. 8. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the insurance industry \n     should build capacity and\n\n[[Page S12258]]\n\n     aggregate risk to provide affordable property and casualty \n     coverage for terrorism risk.\n\n     SEC. 9.

REPEAL OF THE ACT.\n\n       This Act shall be repealed at the close of business on the \n     termination date of the Program under section 6(a), but the \n     provisions of this section shall not be construed as \n     preventing the Secretary from taking, or causing to be taken, \n     such actions under sections 4(c)(4), (5), sections 5(a)(1), \n     (c), (e), section 6(d), and section 9(d) of this Act and \n     applicable regulations promulgated thereunder. Further, the \n     provisions of this section shall not be construed as \n     preventing the availability of funding under section 4(d) \n     during any period in which the Secretary's authority under \n     section 6(d) is in effect.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Key Provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2001\n\n       All property and casualty policyholders are covered, \n     including those insured under workers compensation policies \n     and those with business interruption coverage.\n       Federal tax dollars will be paid as compensation to insured \n     victims of terrorist attacks, not to insurance companies.\n       The insurance industry would fully cover losses arising \n     from certified acts of terrorism, up to $10 billion in each \n     year. The government will provide compensation for 90 percent \n     of losses exceeding $10 billion, with the insurance industry \n     continuing to pay for 10 percent of the losses.\n       The program is temporary, expiring after two years. The \n     Treasury Secretary has the option to extend the program for \n     one additional year.\n       The Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the \n     Secretary of State and the Attorney General, will determine \n     whether an event qualifies as a terrorist attack.\n       In order for property and casualty insurers to participate \n     in the program, insurers are required to offer terrorism \n     coverage to all of their policyholders under terms that are \n     consistent with their other property and casualty policies.\n       Insurance companies are required to disclose to customers \n     which portion of their premiums they are paying for terrorism \n     risk coverage, apart from other property and casualty \n     coverages.\n       Careful, narrow restrictions on lawsuit liability are \n     included to protect taxpayer funds from being exposed to \n     opportunistic, predatory assaults on the U.S. Treasury.\n       The State system of insurance regulation is preserved with \n     very few exceptions. First, the definition of an ``act of \n     terrorism'' under the bill will become the definition in \n     every state. Also, the small number of states that require \n     pre-approval of rate will be restrained from doing so far \n     terrorism risk coverage during the first year. This does not, \n     however, preempt a state insurance regulatory's ability to \n     review and revise the rates once they are in effect. Finally, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury would have access to the books \n     and records of participating insurers in all States.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Gramm, Bunning, \nand Bennett in introducing legislation that provides a temporary \npublic-private partnership for terrorism insurance in the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. This bill provides a joint partnership between \ninsurance companies and the Federal Government for the next 3 years in \ncases of terrorist attacks.\n  September 11 has proven to be the most expensive disaster to ever \ntake place on American soil. With cost estimates ranging from $40 to \n$60 billion, the attacks have drained the capital reserves of some of \nthe largest insurance companies in the world. In addition, as we know \nall too well, the risk for future attacks is very high. In the absence \nof this legislation, the insurance industry would be unable to pay the \npotentially extraordinary costs, and the Federal Government would \nlikely be responsible for the entire costs. This is preemptive \nlegislation.\n  I believe this legislation strikes the right balance between what the \nresponsibilities should be between the insurance industry and the \nFederal Government. In each of the first 2 years, the insurance \nindustry is responsible for the first $10 billion of any attack. By \nplacing a $10 billion initial retention for the insurance industry, we \nensure that the Federal Government does not get involved unless it is \nabsolutely necessary.\n  After that, we agree the Federal Government should pay 90 percent of \nthe remaining costs up to a $100 billion threshold. After the first 2 \nyears, the Secretary of the Treasury will decide whether the industry \nis prepared to once again begin offering this type of coverage. If he \nbelieves they are not prepared, he may extend the program for 1 \nadditional year.\n  This legislation also includes special provisions for small \nbusinesses which might be affected by terrorist attacks. A small \nbusiness that is located in a building that is destroyed requires \ndifferent treatment than a global corporation. Whereas a large, \nmultinational corporation has offices all over the world with different \nlines of revenue, a small business could be eliminated by a single \nincident that would likely destroy all their equipment, possibly kill \npersonnel, and virtually make it impossible for the business to \ncontinue. This bill allows for small businesses to recover lost profits \nand receive funding for business interruptions due to an attack.\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues have heard from their State \ninsurance regulators the same as I have. My State insurance \ncommissioner informs me that few, if any, of the new policies being \nsubmitted for next year's coverage offer terrorism insurance. With \ninsurance being primarily regulated by the States, this has caused a \nbacklog of filings from being approved and paperwork is quickly \naccumulating at the State level. We must act quickly to alleviate this \nbacklog that will lead to uncertainty in the marketplace.\n  The legislation also includes very targeted liability provisions. \nThese\n\n[[Page S12259]]\n\nprovisions are extremely narrow and directed only at this specific \nprogram. Without these limitations, we would open the Federal \nGovernment's checkbook to every trial lawyer in America, and the \nAmerican taxpayers would have unlimited liability. The trial lawyers \nwere committed to not pursuing frivolous claims that resulted from \nSeptember 11, and I certainly hope that they would continue their \ncommitment if America is attacked again.\n  In closing, I would only like to add that I believe the insurance \nindustry should be commended for the way in which they've handled the \nSeptember 11 crisis. Despite losing many employees in the bombing, they \nwere one of the first groups at the front of the line offering their \nassistance and support for the victims. To my knowledge, not a single \ncompany has attempted to withhold payment from this disaster. They have \nbeen most cooperative in working through the myriad proposals that have \nbeen circulated and their support has expedited this process.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nbefore we adjourn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Leahy, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1752. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto facilitating the development of microbicides for preventing \ntransmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Microbicides Development Act of 2001. I am very pleased to be \nintroducing this bipartisan bill along with my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Cantwell, Dodd, Leahy, and Murray. I extend my gratitude to \nSenator Cantwell, in particular, for her support and assistance in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. Additionally, I applaud the efforts of \nmy colleague in the House of Representatives, Republican Congresswoman \nConnie Morella of Maryland, for her leadership on this important issue. \nWe all believe this initiative is vital to the pursuit of combating the \nglobal HIV/AIDS crisis.\n  As you know, tomorrow, December 1, is World AIDS Day. Twenty years \nago, the Centers for Disease Control became aware of a virus that was \nclaiming the lives of thousands of gay men in the United States. \nThroughout most of the 1980s, we thought of AIDS purely as a gay men's \ndisease. Twenty years later, we find that we couldn't have been more \nwrong, as we have seen this disease spread globally to women, children, \nand heterosexual men, infecting and killing millions.\n  Today, women and children are being impacted by this epidemic at \nalarming rates. Every day, 6,300 women worldwide become infected with \nHIV. In fact, women now represent the fastest growing group of new HIV \ninfections in the United States. AIDS is the fourth leading cause of \ndeath among women aged 25 to 44 in this country. Unfortunately, I have \nseen the devastation that this disease is having on women, as New \nJersey has the Nation's fourth highest HIV/AIDS infection rate among \nwomen, and the second highest infection rate among all adults.\n  Despite this growing trend, however, there exists absolutely no HIV \nor STD prevention method that is within a woman's personal control. \nCondom use must be negotiated with a partner. We are all aware that for \ntoo many women, particularly low-income women in the developing world \nwho reply upon a male partner for economic support, there is no power \nof negotiation. We know these women are at risk, yet, we expect them to \nprotect themselves without any tools.\n  Today we have the opportunity to invest in groundbreaking research \nthat can produce these tools, and ultimately, empower women. \nMicrobicides are self-administered products that women could use to \nprevent transmission of STDs, including HIV/AIDS. I say ``could,'' \nbecause due to insufficient research investments, no microbicides have \nbeen brought to market. This legislation would encourage federal \ninvestments for microbicide research through the establishment of \nprograms at the National Institutes for Health, NIH, and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC.\n  In addition to investing new resources in microbicide research, the \nMicrobicides Development Act will expedite the implementation of the \nNIH's 5-year strategic plan for microbicide research, as well as expand \ncoordination among Federal agencies already involved in this research, \nincluding NIH, CDC, and the United States Agency on International \nDevelopment, USAID. The bill also establishes Microbicide Research and \nDevelopment Teams at the NIH. These teams will bring together public \nand private scientists and resources to research and development \nmicrobicides for the prevention of HIV and STD infection.\n  The Microbicides Development Act of 2001 has the potential not only \nto save millions of lives, but also to save billions in health care \ncosts. Every year, 15 million new HIV and other STD infections occur \namong Americans aged 15 and older. The direct cost to the U.S. economy \nof STDs and HIV infection is approximately $8.4 billion. When the \nindirect costs, such as lost productivity, are included, that figure \nrises to an estimated $20 billion.\n  While new therapies are being developed to prolong the lives of \nindividuals infected with HIV/AIDS--and we must continue developing new \ntherapies--only prevention can truly ensure the safety and health of \nthose vulnerable to infection. If we do not pay a small price now to \ninvest in new prevention methods, we will pay a much higher price \nlater.\n  Federal support for microbicide research is crucial. Numerous small \nbiotechnology companies and university researchers are actively engaged \nin microbicide research, but they are almost totally dependent on \npublic-sector grants to continue their work and to test their products. \nExisting public sector grants for microbicides, however, are too small \nand too short-term to move product leads forward. According to the \nAlliance for Microbicide Development and other health advocates, in \norder to bring a microbicide to market within the next 5 years, current \nFederal investments in microbicide research should be increased to $75 \nmillion this year. The NIH currently invests only $25 million a year, \nor 1 percent of its total HIV/AIDS budget, in such important research.\n  This legislation will make microbicide research the priority it \nshould be, a priority the Federal Government must have if it expects to \nsave the lives of women and their children worldwide, who, 20 years \nafter the first AIDS death, will otherwise become victims of a \npreventable disease.\n  In closing, I would like to request that an opinion piece written by \nUnited Nations' Secretary General Kofi Annan that appeared in the \nWashington Post yesterday be included in the Record. In his comments \nrecognizing World AIDS Day, Secretary Annan reiterates the importance \nof investing in new prevention methods as we continue to fight against \nAIDS.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         No Letting Up on AIDS\n\n                            (By Kofi Annan)\n\n       Every day more than 8,000 people die of AIDS. Every hour \n     almost 600 people become infected. Every minute a child dies \n     of the virus. Just as life--and death--goes on after Sept. \n     11, so must we continue our fight against the HIV/AIDS \n     epidemic. Before the terrorist attacks two months ago, \n     tremendous momentum had been achieved in the fight. To lose \n     it now would be to compound one tragedy with another.\n       New figures, released in advance of World AIDS Day, Dec. 1, \n     show that more than 40 million people are now living with the \n     virus. The vast majority of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     where the devastation is so acute that it has become one of \n     the main obstacles to development. But parts of the Caribbean \n     and Asia are not far behind, and the pandemic is spreading at \n     an alarming rate in Eastern Europe.\n       For too long, global progress in facing up to AIDS was \n     painfully slow, and nowhere near commensurate with the \n     challenge. But in the past year, for much of the \n     international community the magnitude of the crisis has \n     finally begun to sink in. Never, in the two long decades that \n     the world has faced this growing catastrophe, has there been \n     such a sense of common resolve and collective possibility.\n       Public opinion has been mobilized by the media, \n     nongovernmental organizations and activists, by doctors and \n     economists and by people living with the disease. \n     Pharmaceutical companies have made their AIDS drugs more \n     affordable in poor countries, and a growing number of \n     corporations have created programs to provide both prevention\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\n     and treatment for employees and the wider community. \n     Foundations are making increasingly imaginative and generous \n     contributions, both financial and intellectual--in \n     prevention, in reducing mother-to-child transmission, in the \n     search for a vaccine.\n       In a growing number of countries, effective prevention \n     campaigns have been launched. There has been an increasing \n     recognition, among both donors and the most affected \n     countries, of the link between prevention and treatment. \n     There has also been a new understanding of the particular \n     toll AIDS is taking on women--and of the key role they have \n     in fighting the disease.\n       The entire United Nations family is fully engaged in this \n     fight, working to a common strategic plan and supporting \n     country, regional and global efforts through our joint \n     program, UNAIDS. Perhaps most important, a new awareness and \n     commitment have taken hold among governments--most notably in \n     Africa.\n       Last June the membership of the United Nations met in a \n     special session of the General Assembly to devise a \n     comprehensive and coordinated global response to the AIDS \n     crisis.\n       They adopted a powerful declaration of commitments, calling \n     for a fundamental shift in our response to HIV/AIDS as a \n     global economic, social and development challenge of the \n     highest priority. They reaffirmed the pledge, made by world \n     leaders in their Millennium Declaration, to halt and begin to \n     reverse the spread of AIDS by 2015. And they set out a number \n     of further ambitious but realistic time-bound targets and \n     goals. Among them were commitments to reach, by 2005, an \n     overall target of annual expenditure on AIDS of $7 billion to \n     $10 billion per year in low- and middle-income countries; to \n     ensure, by 2005, that a wide range of prevention programs are \n     available in all countries; and to support the establishment \n     of a fund to help finance an urgent and expanded response to \n     the epidemic.\n       Only seven months after I proposed this new international \n     facility to support the global fight against AIDS and other \n     infectious diseases, pledges to the fund stand at more than \n     $1.5 billion. The fund cannot be the only channel of \n     resources for a full-scale global response to AIDS. But what \n     is most heartening is the range of pledges that have been \n     made: from the world's wealthiest nations--starting with the \n     founding contribution from the United States last May--but \n     also from some of its poorest, as well as from foundations, \n     corporations and private individuals.\n       It is clear that we have the road map, the tools and the \n     knowledge to fight AIDS. What we must sustain now is the \n     political will. Life after Sept. 11 has made us all think \n     more deeply about the kind of world we want for our children. \n     It is the same world we wanted on Sept. 10--a world in which \n     a child does not die of AIDS every minute.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nCorzine and Snowe to introduce the Microbicides Development Act of \n2001, and to recognize tomorrow, December 1, as World AIDS Day. As we \nreflect on the last 20 years of battling this disease, we need to \nremember the thousands of people here in the United States and the \nmillions worldwide afflicted by HIV and AIDS.\n  It is hard to believe that it has been 20 years since we first \nlearned of the disease that would come to be known as Acquired Immune \nDeficiency Syndrome or AIDS. In those 20 years medical and \npharmaceutical advancements have made HIV/AIDS more manageable for \nsome, but a cure is yet to be found. And in those 20 years since we \nfirst learned of AIDS we have begun to see a changing face of AIDS \nacross the country, as well as in my home State of Washington.\n  Consider these facts.\n  Twenty years ago, HIV infections attributed to sex between gay men \naccounted for nearly all HIV/AIDS cases in the country. Today, more \nthan half-- 54 percent--of HIV infections are in different population \ngroups: straight or bisexual women, or straight men. In fact, between \nthe beginning of the AIDS epidemic and today, the proportion of women \nnewly infected with HIV more than tripled-- from 7 percent to 23 \npercent.\n  Twenty years ago, HIV infections were primarily appearing in \nCaucasians. Today, HIV/AIDS is disproportionately affecting communities \nof color. Approximately two-thirds of all women and over 40 percent of \nall men reported with AIDS were black. Although Hispanics represent 13 \npercent of the population, they accounted for 19 percent of new HIV \ninfections in 1999.\n  And one in four Washingtonians infected with HIV is under aged 22. \nHalf are under 25. These are people that have grown up with the \ndisease--they should be educated on prevention and they should know how \nto take care of themselves. But somehow complacency--whether from the \nnew drugs and medical treatment--or from disease ennui--has replaced \nthe message we want to be sending.\n  We have long known that the only way to stop the advance of this \nterrible disease is through a coordinated and comprehensive approach to \neducation, prevention and treatment. As a community we need to refocus \nour efforts and not allow complacency--especially among populations not \ntraditionally associated with HIV/AIDS --to dictate the future. There \nmust be a continued commitment to he eradication of this terrible \ndisease.\n  Before the end of today, several hundred people will become infected \nwith AIDS. In these days of fear of Anthrax and discussions of \nbioterrorism we should not loose sight of the worst natural pandemic in \nhuman history. Twenty years after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention first identified AIDS, I am afraid that this vast \ntragedy has become a little too familiar, and we may have become a \nlittle too complacent.\n  The HIV/AIDS epidemic rages on, from Asia and Eastern Europe to the \nCaribbean and most tragically Africa. As AIDS has become an \ninternational crisis, its face has become that of humanity itself. I \nfear that AIDS may become the single greatest obstacle to global \ndevelopment humanity has ever faced.\n  And while it is easy to become discouraged in the face of such a \nhuge, heartbreaking calamity--the truth is we know how to stop the \nspread of AIDS. Through a coordinated and comprehensive program of \neducation, prevention and treatment, we know that the epidemic can be \ngreatly reduced in scope.\n  To that end, I'm proud to join Senator Corzine in sponsoring the \nMicrobicides Development Act of 2001. This bill increases authorization \nof funding for microbicide research at the National Institutes of \nHealth and the CDC.\n  Microbicides represent a novel and virtually unexplored area in STD/\nHIV research. Microbicides can kill or inactivate the bacteria and \nviruses that cause STDs and AIDS. Despite their huge potential, \nmicrobicide research is underrepresented in the federal HIV research \nportfolio. Currently, Microbicide development represents only one \npercent of federal research in HIV/AIDS.\n  Microbicides are unique in that they are under development as topical \nproducts--a cream or gel. This gives them a high degree of versatility \nand user control. This is especially important for women who are unable \nto or cannot ask their partner to use a condom to prevent spreading \nHIV. Development of a dependable, affordable and easy to use \nmicrobicide would represent a major breakthrough in AIDS prevention--\nallowing populations like commercial sex workers to have more control \nover their own bodies. It is extremely important to prevent HIV \ntransmission and serve women, a population increasingly at risk for HIV \ninfection.\n  Microbicide development is a fertile but unexplored anti-HIV research \narea. Pharmaceutical companies have generally concentrated on high \nreturn disease treatments and government-sponsored vaccine programs. \nWhile there are potential microbicides in the research and development \npipeline, this bill encourages the pursuit of these promising compounds \nby increasing authorization for the current federal investment in \nmicrobial research in the next fiscal year.\n  Through this bill, we will emphasize the work at the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nto develop products to prevent the transmission of AIDS for women. I \ncan think of no new direction in AIDS prevention that has a larger \npotential--we know that the best preventatives must be easy to use and \ncontrolled by the user. I expect that microbicides will fill a new role \nin preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS. I thank Senator Corzine for \nhis leadership on this issue and I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1753. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ninclude medical assistance furnished through\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\nan urban Indian health program operated by an urban Indian organization \npursuant to a grant or contract with the Indian Health Service under \ntitle V of the Indian Health Care improvement Act in the 100 percent \nFederal medical assistance percentage applicable to the Indian Health \nService; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Campbell and Cantwell entitled the ``Urban Indian Health \nMedicaid Amendments Act of 2001'' would raise the Medicaid matching \nrate to 100 percent for Medicaid-covered services provided to Medicaid-\neligible American Indians and Alaska Natives at urban Indian health \nprograms.\n  The legislation eliminates the discrepancy in current law that \nprovides for a higher matching rate to states for care delivered in an \nnon-urban outpatient facility operated by the Indian Health Service, or \nIHS, or by a tribe or a tribal organization under contract with IHS \ncompared to the lower matching rate to an urban Indian program funded \nby the IHS to deliver services to Medicaid-eligible Native Americans \nresiding in urban areas.\n  The bill would not alter current policy toward facilities operated by \nthe IHS or by tribes or tribal organizations. As under current law, the \nFederal Government would continue to pay 100 percent of the cost of \ntreating Medicaid-eligible American Indian or Alaska Natives at an IHS \nhospital or tribal clinic. Similarly, the bill would not alter the \namounts paid to IHS hospitals or tribal clinics for treating Medicaid \npatients.\n  Instead, the bill simply extends the 100 percent federal matching \nrate to the costs of treatment of Medicaid-eligible Native Americans in \nurban Indian health programs and corrects the inconsistency in \ntreatment under current Medicaid law.\n  The urban Indian health program was first authorized in 1976 in Title \nV of the ``Indian Health Care Improvement Act.'' According to a report \nentitled ``Urban Indian Health'' by the Kaiser Family Foundation that \nwas released this month, ``The purpose of the Title V program is to \nmake outpatient health services accessible to urban Indians, either \ndirectly or by referral. These services are provided through non-profit \norganizations, controlled by urban Indians, that receive funds under \ncontract with the IHS.''\n  In fact, the Federal Government, through the IHS, currently funds 36 \nurban Indian health programs in 20 states: Arizona, 3; California, 8; \nColorado, 1; Illinois, 1; Kansas, 1; Massachusetts, 1; Michigan, 1; \nMinnesota, 1; Montana, 5; Nebraska, 1; Nevada, 1; New Mexico, 1; New \nYork, 1; Oklahoma, 2; Oregon, 1; South Dakota, 1; Texas, 1; Utah, 1; \nWashington, 2; and Wisconsin, 2.\n  These programs are nonprofit organizations that provide outpatient \nprimary care services, and in some cases, just referral services, to \nurban Indians, many of whom are eligible for Medicaid. In FY 2001, \nCongress appropriated $29.9 million, or just 1 percent of the Indian \nHealth Service budget, in discretionary funding to these programs. \nThese programs are expected to supplement this direct funding with \nrevenues from third party payers, such as private insurance and \nMedicaid.\n\n  Urban Indian health programs may participate as providers in their \nstate's Medicaid program and receive payment for services covered by \nMedicaid that are furnished to Medicaid-eligible urban Indians. \nWhatever amount the state pays the urban Indian program for a Medicaid \npatient visit, the Federal Government will match the State's \nexpenditure at the State's regular Federal Medicaid matching rate, or \nFMAP.\n  In contrast, if an American Indian or Alaska Native who is eligible \nfor Medicaid receives primary care services covered by Medicaid at an \noutpatient facility operated by the IHS or by a tribe or a tribal \norganization under contract with the IHS, the Federal Government will \npay 100 percent of the cost of the service.\n  The policy rationale for this enhanced matching rate is that because \nIndian health is a Federal responsibility, states should not have to \nshare in the costs of providing Medicaid services to Native American \nbeneficiaries receiving care through facilities operated directly by \nthe Federal Government's IHS or by tribes or tribal organizations on \nbehalf of the IHS. This same rationale applies to Medicaid-covered \nservices provided by urban Indian programs funded by the IHS to deliver \nservices to Medicaid-eligible Native Americans residing in urban areas. \nUnfortunately, the Medicaid statute does not reflect this policy. This \nlegislation would address this inequity.\n  Moreover, as a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation entitled \n``Urban Indian Health'' released this month adds, ``Extension of this \n100 percent matching rate to services provided by Title V providers to \nMedicaid-eligible urban Indians may give State Medicaid programs an \nincentive to treat these `safety net' clinics more favorably in both a \nfee-for-service and managed care context.''\n  The proposal would simply amend the third sentence in section 1905(b) \nof the Social Security Act to read as follows (new language in italic):\n\n       Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, the \n     Federal medical assistance percentage shall be 100 per centum \n     with respect to amounts expended as medical assistance for \n     services which are received through an Indian Health Service \n     facility or program whether operated by the Indian Health \n     Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization or by an \n     urban Indian health program (as defined in section 4 of the \n     Indian Health Care Improvement Act).\n\n  The amendment would be effective for Medicaid services furnished on \nor after October 1, 2001. Under this language, the enhanced 100 percent \nmatching rate would apply only to services furnished directly \n``through'' an urban Indian health program, not by referral. Note that \nthe amendment would not determine the particular amount the state \nMedicaid program pays an urban Indian health program for a particular \nservice, such as a patient visit. The language only affects the Federal \nGovernment's share of that payment amount.\n  Despite the fact that recent Census figures indicate that 57 percent \nof the 2.5 million people that identify themselves solely as American \nIndian and Alaska Native live in metropolitan areas, including 17,444 \nin Albuquerque, New Mexico, the IHS budget only provides 1 percent of \nits funding to urban Indian health programs. We should and must begin \nto take steps to eliminate such dramatic discrepancies.\n  As a result, within the Medicaid program, just as the Federal \nGovernment reimburses States 100 percent for the costs of services \ndelivered to Native American beneficiaries receiving care through \nfacilities operated directly by the Federal Government's IHS or by \ntribes or tribal organizations on behalf of the IHS, the same should \napply to urban Indian health programs. This simple, yet important bill \nwill eliminate the disparity and I urge its swift passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1753\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office for fiscal years 2002 through 2007, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Hatch, \nReid, and Bennett in the introduction of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\nAuthorization Act of 2002. Senator Hatch and I, as leaders of the \nJudiciary Committee, have had great success in working together to \nprotect America's innovators and to protect our patent and trademark \nsystem.\n  This bill is another example of our bipartisan effort to strengthen \nAmerica's future. By joining with Senators Reid and Bennett, this bill \nwill send a strong message to America's innovators and inventors that \nthe Congress intends to protect and enhance our patent system. The PTO \nserves a critical role in the promotion and development of commercial \nactivity in the United States by granting patents and trademark \nregistrations to our nation's innovators and businesses.\n  The costs of running the PTO are entirely paid for by fees collected \nby the PTO form users, individuals and companies that seek to benefit \nfrom patent and trademark protections. However, since 1992 Congress has \ndiverted over $800 million of those fees for other government programs \nunrelated to the PTO.\n  This bill sends a strong message that Congress should appropriate to \nthe PTO a funding level equal to these fees. The reason for this is \nsimple: the creation of intellectual property by Americans, individuals \nand businesses, is a massive positive driving force for our economy and \nis a huge plus for our trade balance with the rest of the world. In \nrecent years, the number of patient applications has risen \ndramatically, and that trend is expected to continue. Our patent \nexaminers are very overworked, and emerging areas such as biotechnology \nand business method patents may overwhelm the system.\n  If fully implemented as intended, this bill can greatly assist the \nPTO in issuing quality patents more quickly which means more \ninvestment, more jobs and greater productivity for American businesses. \nSimilarly, early federal registration of the name, logo, or symbol of a \ncompany or product is necessary to protect rights and avoid expensive \nlitigation. Section 2 of the bill thus authorizes Congress to \nappropriate to the PTO, in fiscal years 2002 through 2007, an amount \nequal to the fees estimated by the Secretary of Commerce to be \ncollected in each of the next five fiscal years. The Secretary shall \nmake this report to the Congress by February 15 of each such fiscal \nyear.\n  Section 3 of the bill directs the PTO to develop, in the next three \nyears, an electronic system for the filing and processing of all patent \nand trademark applications that is user friendly and that will allow \nthe Office to process and maintain electronically the contents and \nhistory of all applications. Of the amount appropriated under section \n2, section 3 authorizes Congress to appropriate not more than $50 \nmillion in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for the electronic filing system.\n  Third, the bill requires the PTO to develop a strategic plan to set \nforth for the methods by which the PTO will enhance patent and \ntrademark quality, reduce pendency, and develop an effective electronic \nsystem for the benefit of filers, examiners, and the general public \nregarding patents and trademarks.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues in the other body, Congressmen Coble \nand Berman, have introduced similar legislation. I am very concerned \nthat the Bush Administration budget for FY 2002 planned to divert $207 \nmillion in PTO fees to programs outside the PTO. This diversion takes \nfees paid by inventors and businesses to secure patents or trademarks \nand uses them to promote unrelated programs. It does this at a time \nwhen the number of patent and trademark applications has increased by \n50 percent since 1996, and while the ``waiting period,'' or pendency \nperiod, has increased 20 percent 1996. Even worse, the PTO estimates \nthat the patent pendency period could increase to 38 months by 2006.\n\n  The bill also contains two sections which will clarify two provisions \nof current law and thus provide certainty and guidance to the PTO and \nfor inventors and businesses.\n  Section 5 expands the scope of matters that may be raised during the \nreexamination process to a level which had been the case for many \nyears. Let me explain the background. Congress established the patent \nreexamination system in 1980 for three purposes: to attempt to settle \npatent validity questions quickly and less expensively than litigation; \nto allow courts to rely on PTO expertise; and, third, to reinforce \ninvestor confidence in the certainty of patent rights by affording an \nopportunity to review patents of doubtful validity.\n  This system of encouraging third parties to pursue reexamination as \nan efficient method of settling patent disputes is still a good idea. \nHowever, by clarifying current law this bill increases the discretion \nof the PTO and enhances the effectiveness of the reexamination process. \nIt does this by permitting the use of relevant evidence that was \nconsidered by the PTO, but not necessarily cited. Thus, adding this \nsentence to current law, which only allows for reexaminations when \n``substantial new questions of patentability exist'', will help prevent \nthe misuse of defective patents, especially those concerning business \nmethod patents.\n  It permits a reexamination based on prior art cited by an applicant \nthat the examiner failed to adequately consider. Thus, this change \nallows the PTO to correct some examiner errors that it would not \notherwise be able to correct.\n  Section 6 of the bill modestly improves the usefulness of inter \npartes reexamination procedures by enhancing the ability of third-party \nrequesters to participate in that process by allowing such a third \nparty to appeal an adverse reexamine decision in Federal court or to \nparticipate in the appeal brought by the patentee. This may make inter \npartes reexamination a somewhat more attractive option for challenging \na patent in that a third party should feel more comfortable that the \ncourts can be accessed to rectify a mistaken reexamination decision. \nThis section should increase the use of the reexamine system and thus \ndecrease the number of patent matters adjudicated in federal court.\n  I again want to express my appreciation to the co-sponsors of this \nbill, Senators Hatch, Reid, and Bennett and look forward to working \nwith other Senators on these matters.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Leahy, \nReid,  and Bennett in the introduction of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice Authorization Act of 2002. As Senator Leahy mentioned, he and I, \nas leaders of the Judiciary Committee, have enjoyed a productive \nrelationship working together to protect America's innovators, and to \nstrengthen our intellectual property laws as well as the agencies that \nadminister and enforce them.\n  One of the issues we have long worked on is strengthening the ability \nof the United States Patent Office, ``USPTO'', to do its important work \nin reviewing and granting intellectual property rights to inventors \nseeking the patents that drive our high-tech economy or those \nbusinesses that seek to protect the trademarks that consumers rely on \nto find the goods and services they want. For those inventors and \nbusinesses to succeed in using those patent or trademark rights, the \nUSPTO needs to do a quality and timely job in reviewing and granting \nthose rights.\n  However, over the past few years, the USPTO has been under mounting \npressure on three fronts, increased filings, increased complexity in \nthe filings, and increased difficulty retaining valuable and \nexperienced examiners in the face of more lucrative offers in the \nprivate sector. These pressures, if unaddressed, can lead to delays for \napplicants of months or years, or to reduced quality and reliability of \nthe determinations that issue from the USPTO. Indeed, the USPTO \nestimates that the patent pendency period could rise to 38 months by \n2006. I hate to think that innovative products could sit on the shelf \nfor more than three years awaiting government review. This is \nespecially troubling when we realize that in many high-tech sectors the \nshelf life of a product is often less than half that time. Such \nincreased waiting periods and lower quality decision-making means \nslower innovation, less competitiveness, higher costs, and greater risk \nfor those seeking patents or trademarks. And, consequently, the rest of \nus and our economy could see slower recovery and weaker growth. \nAddressing these challenges will require leadership, of course, which I \nbelieve can be provided by the President's nominee to head the USPTO, \nformer Congressman Jim Rogan. But, to be realistic, we\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nmust admit that surely it will also require resources.\n  As many in this body know, the costs of running the USPTO are \nentirely paid for by fees collected from applicants, individuals and \ncompanies that seek to benefit from patent and trademark protection. \nHowever, since 1992 Congress has diverted an amount estimated at over \n$800 million from those fees for other government programs unrelated to \nthe USPTO.\n  At a time when our economy needs support, it seems doubly wrong to \nlevy what amounts to a tax on innovation, a tax imposed by taking a \nportion of the fees America's innovators and businesses pay to secure \nprotection for their economy-generating products and services and \nspending it on unrelated government programs. I believe that fees paid \nto secure patent and trademark rights should be used to process those \napplications faster with better reliability precisely because getting \nthe products of American ingenuity to market faster helps grow \nour economy faster.\n\n  That is why I am glad to join my colleagues in introducing this bill \nwhich takes the position that Congress should appropriate to the USPTO \na funding level equal to the fees applicants pay. I agree with my \ncolleagues that if fully implemented as intended, this bill can greatly \nassist the USPTO in issuing quality patents more quickly, which in turn \ncan lead to more investment, job creation, and productivity for \nAmerican businesses.\n  In addition to establishing the principle that user fees collected by \nthe USPTO should be used to serve those who pay them, the bill makes \nadditional improvements to the way the USPTO does business, further \nenhancing its ability to serve American companies and inventors. Among \nthese improvements are the requirement that the USPTO develop a user-\nfriendly electronic system for the filing and processing of all patent \nand trademark applications, and that the PTO to develop a strategic \nplan to enhance patent and trademark quality, reduce pendency, and \notherwise improve their systems and services for the benefit of \napplicants, examiners, and the general public. The bill also contains \ntwo sections which will clarify two provisions of current law regarding \nreexamination of patents to provide greater guidance to the USPTO and \nits customers about the scope and availability of the reexamination \nprocess. Both of these changes should help streamline and reduce the \ncosts of post-grant patent decisions.\n  I again want to express my appreciation to Senator Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, for this leadership, and to the \nother co-sponsors of this bill, Senators Reid and Bennett. I look \nforward to working with them and my other colleagues on this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12263-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12263-S12264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 185--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE \n      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF KOREAN IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. ALLEN (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Biden, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Gramm) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with \nthe Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, the \nVice Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Warner, and the Vice \nChairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. Campbell, and many of our \ncolleagues, a Senate resolution recognizing the historical significance \nof the 100th anniversary of Korean-Americans' immigration to the United \nStates in 2003.\n  In December of 1902, 56 men, 21 women and 25 children traveled from \nKorea across the Pacific Ocean on the S.S. Gaelic and landed in \nHonolulu, HI, on January 13, 1903, marking the first entry of Korean \nimmigrants to the U.S. territories. The year 2003 will be the 100th \nAnniversary of that immigration. With that anniversary looming, \ninterest in this historic centennial celebration is growing in Korean \ncommunities in the United States and worldwide, including events within \nthe vibrant Korean-American communities in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia.\n  A century is more than a convenient marker for Korean-Americans: It \ncelebrates Koreans' prominent place in the broad narrative of America. \nJudging by their achievements over these past 100 years, theirs is an \nAmerican story that confirms the opportunity for individual initiative, \ncreativity, hard work and success in these free United States.\n  Both individually and as a community, Korean-Americans have much to \ncelebrate in 2003. In such diverse areas as commerce and finance, \ntechnology, medicine, education, and the arts, Korean-American \ncontributions are being widely acknowledged and recognized. Even the \nKorean culture, uniquely shaped, inspired, and nurtured by life in \nAmerica, is becoming part of the vernacular. From Hawaii to California \nto New York, and in Annandale in Fairfax County, VA, Korean-American \ncommunities are vibrant and vital leaders throughout the United States.\n  It is worth noting that apart from the many achievements by Korean-\nAmericans, unique among all immigrant communities in the United States, \nthe early Korean-American community was united around the common goal \nof attaining freedom and independence for their colonized mother \ncountry. Like many immigrant groups, Korean-Americans embraced the \nbasic principles of democracy in our Constitution. It is a goal that \ncontinues to this day, when one considers\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\nthat one out of four Korean-Americans still has relatives and other \nloved ones trapped in North Korea.\n  Starting in the early 1950s, thousands of immigrants, fleeing from \nwar, poverty and desolation came to the United States seeking \nopportunities. Without knowing the language and without great wealth, \nbut with strong family ties, caring community support and many hours of \nhard work, Korean-Americans, like waves of immigrants before them, have \ntaken root and thrived in our free American soil.\n  Crucial to Korean-Americans' success was their ability to organize \nthemselves for mutual support and assistance through associations, \nchurches and other organizations. This success has translated itself, \naccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, into 135,571 businesses owned and \noperated by Korean-Americans across the country with gross sales and \nreceipts of $46 billion. These businesses employ 333,649 men and women \nwith an annual payroll of $5.8 billion.\n  The contributions to this country by early Korean-Americans include \nthe invention of the first beating heart operation for coronary heart \ndisease, the development of the nectarine and a four-time Olympic gold \nmedallist. In the modern era, there have been notable achievements by \nengineers, architects, doctors, actors, singers, sculptors and \nnovelists, among others. With more than 100 communities throughout the \nUnited States preparing to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Korean-\nAmerican immigration to the United States, it is appropriate and \ndeserving to recognize the historical significance of this milestone.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will encourage appreciation, \npride, and self-awareness among Korean Americans, and I encourage \nschools, organizations, and Federal, State, and local governments to \nplan activities and programs together with the many Korean-American \norganizations that are currently preparing for this wonderful \nanniversary of the living American Dream.\n  I respectfully ask for the support of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for this resolution, and urge the Senate to pass this \nhistoric resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12264-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 87--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n          REGARDING THE CRASH OF AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 587\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (referred to \n     in this title as the ``NBAC'') has reviewed the scientific \n     and ethical implications of human cloning and has determined \n     that the cloning of human beings is morally unacceptable;\n       (2) the NBAC recommended that Federal legislation be \n     enacted to prohibit anyone from conducting or attempting \n     human cloning, whether using Federal or non-Federal funds;\n       (3) the NBAC also recommended that the United States \n     cooperate with other countries to enforce mutually supported \n     prohibitions on human cloning;\n       (4) the NBAC found that somatic cell nuclear transfer (also \n     known as nuclear transplantation) may have many important \n     applications in medical research;\n       (5) the Institute of Medicine has found that nuclear \n     transplantation may enable stem cells to be developed in a \n     manner that will permit such cells to be transplanted into a \n     patient without being rejected;\n       (6) the NBAC concluded that any regulatory or legislative \n     actions undertaken to prohibit human cloning should be \n     carefully written so as not to interfere with other important \n     areas of research, such as stem cell research; and\n       (7)(A) biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n     in and affect interstate commerce;\n       (B) the services provided by clinical facilities move in \n     interstate commerce;\n       (C) patients travel regularly across State lines in order \n     to access clinical facilities; and\n       (D) biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n     scientists, doctors, and other staff in an interstate market, \n     and contract for research and purchase medical and other \n     supplies in an interstate market.\n\n     SEC. ____03. PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this title to prohibit any attempt to \n     clone a human being while protecting important areas of \n     medical research, including stem cell research.\n\n     SEC. ____04.

Res. 23\n\n       Whereas Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, throughout his \n     distinguished career of more than half a century as an \n     educator, civil and human rights leader, and public \n     theologian, has inspired people of all races throughout the \n     world by his persistent commitment to excellence;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays persevered, despite the frustrations \n     inherent in segregation, to begin an illustrious career in \n     education;\n       Whereas as dean of the School of Religion of Howard \n     University and later as President of Morehouse College in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, for 27 years, Benjamin Mays overcame \n     seemingly insurmountable obstacles to offer quality education \n     to all Americans, especially African Americans;\n       Whereas at the commencement of World War II, when most \n     colleges suffered from a lack of available students and the \n     demise of Morehouse College appeared imminent, Benjamin Mays \n     prevented the college from permanently closing its doors by \n     vigorously recruiting potential students and thereby aiding \n     in the development of future generations of African American \n     leaders;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays was instrumental in the elimination \n     of segregated public facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, and \n     promoted the cause of nonviolence through peaceful student \n     protests during a time in this Nation that was often marred \n     by racial violence;\n       Whereas Benjamin Mays received numerous accolades \n     throughout his career, including 56 honorary degrees from \n     universities across the United States and abroad and the \n     naming of 7 schools and academic buildings and a street in \n     his honor; and\n       Whereas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest \n     civilian honor in the Nation, was established in 1945 to \n     appropriately recognize Americans who have made an especially \n     meritorious contribution to the security or national \n     interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or \n     other significant public or private endeavors: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should award the Presidential Medal of Freedom \n     posthumously to Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays in honor of his \n     distinguished career as an educator, civil and human rights \n     leader, and public theologian and his many contributions to \n     the improvement of American society and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/30/senate-section/article/S12272-5", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACTION VITIATED--H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.J. Res. 71 and \nthe Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the joint resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 71) amending title 36, United \n     States Code, designating September 11 as Patriot Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge adoption of H.J. Res. \n71, which designates September 11 as ``Patriot Day.'' This resolution \nalso calls on all Americans to observe a moment of silence to remember \nall those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack of September 11, \n2001. I am the Senate sponsor of this bill along with Senators Schumer \nand Specter.\n  The events of September 11 have forever changed the lives of all \nAmericans. We have all experienced a renewed sense of community and a \nsense of patriotic vigor that are the best of America. So many lives \nwere touched by the terrorist attack--not only the thousands of heroes \nwho lost their lives but also those they left behind. I am certain that \nfew Americans will remain untouched by the devastation of our citizens \nthat we saw in downtown New York, in the Pennsylvania countryside, and \nat our Pentagon.\n  These terrorists killed innocent Americans from every part of the \ncountry. We were so saddened to learn that Mary Alice Wahlstrom and her \ndaughter, Carolyn Beug, of Kaysville, Utah, were struck down by this \nsenseless violence. Mary Alice's husband of 52 years, Norman, described \nMary Alice as the ``happiest lady you'll meet.'' As one of the \n``kids,'' she joined with her only daughter to help her twin 18-year \nold granddaughters settle in at art school on the East Coast. In this \ntime of grief, we join Norman, her four sons, and 18 grandchildren in \nhoping that our love and faith will continue to sustain each of us \nduring this tragedy.\n  The grief all Americans feel today is barely speakable. I, for one, \ncannot express in words the sorrow I feel for the thousands of families \nprofoundly shattered by the acts of war perpetrated against us on \nSeptember 11th. I commend my colleagues who have spoken so eloquently \nat such a great moment of national tragedy.\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, our grief is leavened by the \ncountless stories of sacrifice and heroism. Heroes such as the \npolicemen, firemen and emergency personnel who rushed to the buildings \nand entered them in a race against collapse, a race that they \nunfortunately lost. I hope that every American who sees a fireman or a \npoliceman today thinks of the sacrifices that these every day \nindividuals are prepared to make for the good of our society, for the \ngood of ourselves, every day.\n  There is no calamity America will withstand that will not be met with \nand overwhelmed by the decency, courage and selflessness of Americans \ncoming to the aid of their own. It will be years before we can collect \nall of these stories and it will be impossible to measure the courage \nand bravery of these countless everyday heroes. As John says in the \nBible, ``Greater love hath no man than this; that a man lay down his \nlife for his friends.''\n  I also commend my colleagues for their unanimous support for the \nAdministration of President George W. Bush. Americans are not partisan \nwhen we are to face a common foe, nor are their representatives.\n  We will face this foe together, and together we will prevail.\n  We must never forget the attack on America and the mighty resolve of \nthe American spirit that has never shown brighter than after September \n11. This resolution before us today will ensure that we will never \nforget the events of September 11, 2001.\n  I commend my colleagues in the House for adopting this resolution and \nurge my Senate colleagues to adopt this important measure tonight. \nElaine and I offer our prayers for the victims and their families, as \nwell as the thousands of brave rescue workers, including Utah's Urban \nSearch and Rescue team. The team consists of fire department personnel \nfrom Salt Lake City and County. Our prayers go to the member of our \narmed forces, the greatest defenders of freedom a nation has ever \nknown. And our prayers go to President Bush and his Administration, who \nare dedicated to peace and must now respond to war.\n  May God Bless America.\n  Mr. REID.
