Mr. President, I had a chance to speak before the \nNational School Board Association yesterday. Sometimes it is only when \nyou speak that you realize how strong your conviction is on an issue. I \nhave come to the floor of the Senate to make an appeal to all Senators, \nstarting with Democrats.\n  The President, in his inaugural speech, talked about leaving no child \nbehind. And the President, in his education proposal, also spoke about \nleaving no child behind. I think that is a wonderful value and a \nwonderful vision for our country. That, by the way, is the mission of \nthe wonderful organization called the Children's Defense Fund headed by \nMarian Wright Edelman.\n  If we look at the arithmetic of the President's tax cut he is \nproposing this week for the country, and if we are to stay true to the \ntheme of accountability--the President in his education proposal called \nfor accountability--I would like to hold the administration accountable \non the floor of the Senate, and with amendments and with debate, in \nwhat I think is going to be a historic debate.\n  The non-social Security surplus--putting the Social Security trust \nfund aside--is $3.1 trillion. President Bush calls for $1.6 trillion in \ntax cuts. The argument is: There is $1.5 trillion left. What is the \nproblem?\n  The problem is, first of all, when you look at the $1.6 trillion and \nwhen you look at the $3.1 trillion surplus, it is not really that, \nbecause we all know the Medicare trust fund money will be kept \nseparate, and now all of a sudden $3.1 trillion in surplus becomes $2.6 \ntrillion. When you add to that the tax extenders--the tax credits that \nwe all know will be extended--and the payments that will go to farmers \nand other groups of citizens in our country, we are now down to $2 \ntrillion. And when you understand that there will be Social Security \ntrust fund solvency issues, which, if we do not deal with those issues, \nwill mean that either benefits are cut or the age eligibility goes up, \nit may be less than $2 trillion. That is $2 trillion.\n  On the other side of the equation, the $1.6 trillion in tax cuts--\nonce you now understand that we will no longer be paying down part of \nthe debt, and interest payments go up--becomes $2 trillion--$2 trillion \nand $2 trillion--$2 trillion in tax cuts, only really $2 trillion in \nsurplus; and there will be no resources for our investment to leave no \nchild behind. There will be no resources.\n  So the only thing you have is a proposal, A, with vouchers, which I \nthink is a nonstarter and I think ultimately will be discarded. Then \nwhat you have is telling States and school districts: You do tests \nevery year, starting at age 8--third grade--all the way up to eighth \ngrade. But we are setting the schools and the children and our teachers \nup for failure because we are not providing any of the resources to \nmake sure that all of those children will not be left behind and will \nhave an opportunity to achieve.\n  Fanny Lou Hamer is a great civil rights leader from the State of \nMississippi. She once uttered the immortal words: I'm sick and tired of \nbeing sick and tired.\n  I am sick and tired of symbolic politics with children's lives. Where \nin this budget, where in the arithmetic of the tax cuts and the \nsurplus, will there be the investment to make sure that no child is \nleft behind?\n  Two percent of all the children who could benefit from Early Head \nStart, 2 years of age and under, benefit today. That is all we have \nfunded.\n  With only 50 percent of Head Start, only 10 percent for good child \ncare for low-income families, much less middle-income families, when \nare we going to fully fund the IDEA program, which we made a commitment \nto school districts and States to do? Not in this budget. Not in this \nbudget.\n  I say to Senators and, in particular, since the majority leader is on \nthe floor, to Democrats, it is extremely important that we have a civil \ndebate, but it should be a passionate debate. We ought not to believe \nthat in the call for bipartisanship, we should not as Senators speak up \nfor the values and the people we represent. On present course, the best \nwe are going to get is a decade; if we fold and if we do not challenge \nthe tax cut proposals and the plan of this administration, the best we \nwill get is not one dollar for investment in children, in education, in \nhealth care, in prescription drug costs; and the worst we will get is \ndeficits going up again.\n  I would like to, as a Democratic Senator from Minnesota, make three \nsuggestions:\n  A, we should hold the President and this administration accountable \nfor the words, ``leave no child behind.'' I take that seriously. I \ndon't let anybody get away with saying my goal and my value and my \nvision is to leave no child behind, when I see only a pittance, if \nthat, of investment in the health and skills and intellect and \ncharacter of our children so we leave no child behind.\n  B, Democrats ought to be able to present a set of tax cuts which do \nnot provide the vast majority of the benefits to the top 1 or 5 percent \nof the population. A lot of what President Bush is unfolding this week \ndoesn't add up. You have the waitress, the single parent, making \n$23,000 a year with two children. She is not helped, because the tax \ncuts are not refundable. These tax cuts overwhelmingly go to the most \naffluent and powerful citizens. We should be able to present a clear \nalternative.\n  Finally, I would be willing to debate anybody, anywhere, anytime, \nanyplace over tax cuts that go to the very wealthy versus prescription \ndrug costs for elderly people. You don't do that on the cheap. I would \nbe willing to debate anybody on tax cuts that go to wealthy, high-\nincome citizens versus expanding health care coverage for the 44 \nmillion people who have no health insurance at all. I would be willing \nto debate anybody over tax cuts going primarily to wealthy people \nversus doing more for children, so when they come to kindergarten they \nreally are ready to learn.\n  If we can't stand for these values and can't have this debate, then \nwhat in the world do we stand for? One more time, I summarize: The $3.1 \ntrillion becomes about $2.6, $2.7 trillion right away, because we are \nnot going to touch the Medicare trust fund money, nor should we. Then \nwe all know we are going to extend the tax credits. So all of a sudden \nit is about $2 trillion. And the $1.6 trillion in tax cuts \nautomatically, once we understand we now have to pay the interest that \nwe wouldn't have paid if we were paying down the debt, goes to $2 \ntrillion.\n  Where is going to be the investment in the children? Where is going \nto be the investment in education? Where is going to be the investment \nso that we make sure no child is left behind? When are we going to do \nsomething about the fact that we have the highest percentage of poor \nchildren among all the western European and all the advanced economies \nin the world? When are we going to do something about the fact that \nsingle elderly women also are among the poorest citizens in our \ncountry? Where is going to be the investment\n\n  You don't proclaim the goal of leaving no child behind and then \nexpect to do this on a tin cup budget. That is all we are getting from \nthis President and his priorities. It is time for debate on the floor \nof the Senate about the priorities of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the time is reserved for the next \nhour or 40 minutes or so for the Democratic leadership. Since there is \nno Democrat seeking recognition at this point, I yield myself time out \nof my leader time to make some brief remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1028-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1028-S1029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I look forward to the debate the Senator \nfrom Minnesota was discussing. I agree; just because we should and will \nhave a civil debate doesn't mean we should not have that debate and lay \nout our differences of opinion very aggressively and passionately. I \nlook forward to doing that.\n  The good news today, while there is a lot of gloom and doom in \ncertain corners, is that tax relief is on the way for working \nAmericans. They deserve it. We have a tax surplus, $5.6 trillion in \noverpayment by the American people.\n  Now, we will argue over exactly how that $5.6 trillion tax surplus \nshould be\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nused. We agree that Social Security should be set aside, put in a \nlockbox. If you listened to the campaign debate last year, you would \nhave thought Vice President Gore came up with that idea. He needs to \ncheck with Senator Domenici and others who actually came up with the \nidea of having a lockbox on Social Security.\n  We should continue to pay down the debt in an orderly way, as was \nsuggested by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, \nover a period of years, and we can eliminate it earlier than was \nindicated. We ought to do that on a steady basis. We can have \nadditional investment in areas where we really need it--in education, \nin health care, even in defense.\n  To the President's credit, he is saying in the defense area, let's \ntake a look and see what our needs may be in defense; let's look and \nsee if there might be someplace where we can save some money in defense \nwhile we clearly are going to have to do more in terms of having \nreadiness and modernization and quality of life for our men and women \nin the military. We need to assess what we are going to need in \nthe future. He is going about it in an orderly fashion. That is a good \nidea.\n\n  There is no question that working Americans need some tax relief. You \ntalk about breaks for the wealthy. What about the single educated young \nwoman making $30,000 a year in the 28-percent bracket? That is not \nrich. We have these brackets now that force people into higher and \nhigher brackets at very low income levels. That is fundamentally \nunfair. We are talking about tax relief for all Americans across the \nboard. It is very fair to do it that way.\n  I thought we had fundamental agreement last year that we need to do \nsomething about reducing the marriage penalty. The President proposes \nthat we double the child tax credit. I don't believe there are a lot of \nDemocrats who are going to speak against that. He encourages more use \nof charitable contributions without being first penalized with taxes \nwhen you take some of your savings and put it into charity. He has a \nwhole package of good ideas, and it is a very fair proposal because it \nis across-the-board rate cuts.\n  There is another benefit here. We are not just talking about the \nfairness in the Tax Code; we are talking about the need for some \neconomic growth incentives. Look at what President Kennedy did, what \nPresident Reagan did, and how much their tax relief was as a percentage \nof GDP. As a matter of fact, President Bush's proposals are actually \nbelow what the Kennedy-Johnson package provided for way back in the \n1960s. In each case, we had economic growth; we had an increase of \nrevenue coming into the Federal Government.\n  The problem was, in the 1980s, we had an insatiable spending appetite \nby the Democratically-controlled Congress that kept pushing up \nspending. Unfortunately, we could not convince President Reagan to veto \nmore of those bills. I hope President George W. Bush will press \naggressively for his proposal on tax relief. I know he is doing it. He \nis going today to have an event with a young woman in business to show \nhow this tax relief would help her.\n  As a matter of fact, we checked on a lady who was here a couple years \nago, expressing concern about Government mandates and regulations and \ntaxes, named Harriet Cane from the Sweetlife, a small restaurant in \nMarietta, GA. She had eight employees. She was struggling to make ends \nmeet. She was doing more and more herself. She did the mopping, the \npreparation.\n  Well, we checked with her to see how she is doing. Guess what. She is \nout of business. She said: What drove me out of business was a lot of \nthings, but Government mandates and regulations and taxes contributed \nmightily to it. When she heard what President Bush is talking about, \nshe said: That certainly would have helped me. For the young \nentrepreneur, this tax relief will be very positive.\n  There is a fundamental difference. There are people here who think \nthat any money we can take from people to bring to Washington, we have \nthe brilliance on how it should be spent.\n  I have a fundamental faith in the people to decide what they should \ndo with their own money that they worked hard to earn. Now they are \npaying 28 percent, 15 percent, 33 percent, 36.5 percent. When you add \nit all up, you still have people in this country paying 40, 50 percent \nof everything they earn for taxes, to bring it to Washington so the \nbrilliant Members of Congress and the bureaucrats can decide how they \nthink it should be spent.\n  I don't agree with that. I think the family can decide how to best \nspend money for their children's needs, whether it is buying clothes or \na refrigerator, a different car, or a tutor for education. The same \nthing is true in education.\n  States such as Minnesota put a lot of money into education. Other \nStates don't put as much into education. Quality education is not \nconsistent across this country, between States and within States, \nincluding my own State.\n  My State has put a high priority on education. We are beginning to \nmake progress. We are going to be paying teachers more. Our \nuniversities have been competing more aggressively for research money \nin physics, acoustics, and polymerscience.\n  I still believe education should be run at the local level and \ndecisions should be made there. I think we should have a program that \nleaves no child behind; we should improve reading, but we should also \nimprove math and science skills.\n  The Federal Government can help with that. By the way, not everybody \neven agrees with that. My predecessor--a Democrat, I might add--in the \nHouse and in the Senate thought there was a great concern about the \nFederal dollar and Federal control following the Federal dollar. I \ndon't agree. I think we have a role to play in early childhood \neducation and elementary and secondary and in higher education. We have \nbeen doing a better job in higher education than in elementary and \nsecondary.\n  I think money should be given to the States and the localities, local \neducation administrators and teachers and parents, with flexibility so \nthey can decide how to spend it. People in Washington don't like it. \nThey want to tell you to spend it here, there, or somewhere else. \nPascagoula, MS, might have different needs from Pittsburgh, PA. We may \nneed more teachers, or maybe we need more remedial reading programs, or \nmaybe we need to fix a leaky roof. But the Federal Government doesn't \nknow what the priority is.\n  We are going to have a good debate. I look forward to it. When I \ncheck with my constituents, the people working, paying taxes, pulling \nthe load, people out in the forests who are being told, ``By the way, \nyou can't cut trees anymore and you can't have roads to get to those \ntrees,'' and people working in the shipyards or oil refineries, they \nare wondering what will happen. They don't have to have a national \nenergy crisis. The problem is we haven't been producing more energy \nbecause we want to shut down our resources--coal, oil.\n  Let's debate education and energy policy and we will get a result. I \nbelieve the American people will be better off when we get those done.\n  If we don't have a budget plan of how to use this tax surplus, it \nwill be spent by the Washington Government. That is a mistake. I think \nthe working people deserve help. Should we be concerned about low-\nincome needs? Yes. We should address that in a variety of ways, and we \nare going to do that.\n  Yes, I think it is time to get on with the debate. I commend the \nPresident for what he proposed. He will bring it up to the Congress \nThursday. We will have a chance to study it. I am pleased that he said \nlet's make the income tax cuts retroactive to the first of the year. I \nthink that will be even more positive for the economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1029-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1029-S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NOMINATION OF ROBERT ZOELLICK\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Our closest neighbor, perhaps our best friend in the \nworld, and we cannot get them to live up to the trade agreement we have \nwith them. While we see increased trade in Mexico and Central America, \nthat is good. We have certain problems with Mexico, too. In Europe, for \nheavens' sake, the first two decisions that the WTO made the Europeans \nbasically have thumbed their nose at. I suggested to Mr. Zoellick, to \nquote a former great Senator from Georgia, Richard Russell, ``I think \nwe ought to have an American desk at the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice.''\n  Somebody needs to speak for America and quit quaking in our boots \nabout the diplomatic impact it would have with Canada if we say enforce \nthe law. Enforce the law.\n  I made that statement to Mr. Zoellick privately and in the Finance \nCommittee hearings, and I am going to do so when he is confirmed. I \nthought Charlene Barshefsky of the previous administration was a good \nU.S. Trade Representative up until the last year. Then I think she was \noverrun by the election year and the State Department and all kinds of \nother people. I think she was tougher than most Trade Representatives. \nOverall, she did a good job, particularly in the high-tech area.\n  In agriculture, she was not quite so good. But I am worried. I have \nsupported all of these trade agreements we voted on over the years--\nGATT, NAFTA, Africa and CBI trade, and China PNTR. But I am getting \nreally fed up with the way we are being treated by our trading \npartners. I am even more fed up with the way our administrations don't \ninsist on the laws being enforced. So I have urged Mr. Zoellick to do \nthat. I believe he will. I hope he will. If he does not, I can assure \nhim and this administration and our trading partners that a strong \nletter to follow and action will be taken to be commensurate with how I \nfeel about this issue.\n  We have to have some change in how we deal with our trading partners. \nNow is the time, at the beginning of a new administration. Without \nbeing overly critical, it has been both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations. It is time we look after American interests in the \ntrade area as well as in the diplomatic, economic, and military areas.\n  I know others will say things such as this, and in the Finance \nCommittee some of my friends on the Democratic side were surprised to \nhear me say this and liked it. I don't mean to sound as if I am some \nsort of a traditional protectionist, but fair is fair. I don't think \nour trading partners are dealing with us fairly right now.\n  I support this nomination, and I will urge a vote for his \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1030-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will say to the majority leader that \nI think his last set of remarks may be the basis of bipartisanship \nbetween the two of us. We will keep this civil.\n  I will also say to the majority leader and others that I can't wait \nfor the debate because he focuses on the $30,000-a-year family. But \nanybody who looks at the distribution of benefits of President Bush's \ntax cut plan will see--I don't know--40 percent of the benefit going to \nthe top 1 percent of the top 5 percent, which is ridiculous. It is like \nRobin Hood in reverse. Yes, we will make sure there is a set of tax \ncredits to go to middle-income and working-income families. Absolutely.\n  I will point out one more time--and I didn't hear the majority leader \nrespond to this at all--I want to hold President Bush accountable for \nthese numbers--a $3.1 trillion non-Social Security surplus becomes 2.6 \nwhen you put Medicare trust money aside, which we will do. It becomes \n$2 trillion when extending tax credits, and we also provide payments to \nfarmers and other people, which we will do without doubt. The tax cuts \ngo from $1.6 trillion to $2 trillion, when you now have to pay the \ninterest on the debt, when you are not paying the debt down, in which \ncase I want to know where are the resources to leave no child behind.\n  I say to the majority leader that I am more than willing to debate \nafter we provide tax cuts for middle-income working families, whether \nor not we, in fact, provide some benefits so elderly people can afford \nprescription drugs versus tax cuts for the wealthy, whether we can \nexpand health care coverage versus tax cuts, or whether or not we will \nlive up to the words of leaving no child behind and make investment in \nchild care and in Head Start and in our schools and fund the IDEA \nprogram versus tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  I think the message President Bush is trying to convey and the \nmajority leader echoes to the people in the country--I all of a sudden \nfind myself being a fiscal conservative--is that we can do it all. \nThere is no free lunch. We can't do it all. We can't have tax cuts \ndisproportionally to the wealthy, erode the revenue base, and at the \nsame time say we are going to leave no child behind; we are going to \nmake an investment in education; we are going to make an investment in \ncovering prescription drugs for the elderly. We can't do both. The \npeople in the country are smart enough to figure that out, and I hope \nDemocrats will engage this administration. The sooner the better. I \ndon't think we need to wait one more day to have this debate.\n  Senators and President Bush: You cannot proclaim the vision and the \nvalue of leaving no child behind and keep this on a tin cup budget. If \nwe are real about this, we will make the investment in the intellect, \nthe skills, and the character of our children.\n  This budget is not real.

Mr. President, a key principle of economic competition \ntoday is that one big merger begets another. Known as copycat mergers, \nthese deals are made when the companies that did not merge first felt \nforced to copy the initial merger. If those left behind do not merge, \nthen they just can't keep up with the Joneses.\n  This morning, I am going to focus for a few minutes on competition in \nthe airline industry. I want to begin by saying that when it comes to \ncopycat airline mergers, this country has reached the point where there \nare virtually no more cats.\n  This weekend, Americans opened their newspapers to learn that Delta \nAirlines, the nation's third largest carrier, and Continental, have \nbegun merger discussions. The Associated Press says that Delta and \nContinental don't even really want to merge. But you guessed it--they \nsay other major airline mergers might drive them to it.\n  The latest round of airline merger reports comes on the heels of the \nproposed United-U.S. Airways merger and American's proposed deals with \nTWA and United.\n  In my opinion, if nothing is done in the face of these proposed \nairline mergers, our country is headed down a runway of no return. If \nthis lineup of mergers takes off, it will destroy the last remnants of \ncompetition in the airline history.\n  The trend toward concentration in the airline industry did not begin \nin the last few weeks. More than 20 consecutive airline mergers were \napproved in the 1980s.\n  I believe much of the problem we are seeing today stems from that \nhuge array of airline mergers that took place in the 1980s. In fact, I \nthink the merger between TWA and Ozark sets in motion the trend that \nbegan in the 1980s. I come to the floor this morning to say I believe \nit is time to change course.\n  The central problem stems from the fact that the major proponents of \nderegulation have not been willing to simultaneously and vigorously \nenforce the antitrust laws. As a result, our country gets the worst of \nboth worlds: dominant companies with a choke hold on the market, and \nnobody setting rules to make sure they don't run\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\nroughshod over the American consumer--the flying public.\n  The Justice Department, which has been run by officials from both \npolitical parties since concentration in the airline industry \naccelerated, has not fully utilized the antitrust tools at its \ndisposal. As a result, I want to make a proposal this morning: Before \nthe Justice Department clears one more major airline merger, the \nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) should have to make a public report \ndemonstrating that the merger will not have negative long-term \nimplications for consumers and the economy. The FTC should dig in, hold \npublic hearings to examine these deals, and get to the bottom of the \nlong-term consequences of these airline mergers. It is time to make \nsure that these mergers don't strand any more airline passengers with \ntoo few choices and too many headaches.\n  The real question is: Is competition in the airline industry working \ntoday? In my view, there certainly aren't enough competitive forces in \nthe airline industry to force companies to compete now to improve \nservice.\n  Actually, some of our constituents report to us that they are left \nout on the runway for hours with a glass of water. Is it any wonder \nconsumer complaints are at record high levels and some fliers call the \ndeparture board at our airports the ``delay board''? I think not. I \nthink those problems stem from the lack of competition we are seeing in \nthe airline sector today. This Congress should not stand idly by while \na chain reaction of mega-mergers squeezes out whatever competitive \njuices remain in the airline industry. As I make my proposal for \nairline mergers this morning, I want to make clear that I am not one \nwho believes that all the mergers taking place in America are bad. Many \nof the mergers our country is watching have not only not been harmful, \nthey have been beneficial. They have resulted in more efficient \ncompanies that ultimately benefit consumers with better service and \nlower prices.\n\n  When it comes to the big airlines, it doesn't look like that's the \ncase. These airline mergers seem to permanently reduce competition. So \nI believe it's time for Congress and the executive branch to take a \ntime out on airline mergers and assess the long term implications of \nwhere the airline industry is headed. The shape of the airline industry \ncreated today is one America will have to live with for a long time, \nand we ought to know what we are getting into. Competition in the \nairline industry is too important to too many people, who fly to \nconduct their business and their personal affairs.\n  Slowing up this airline merger frenzy to look at the long-term \nconsequences, as I propose this morning, is a modest step that the U.S. \nCongress ought to take now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Friday morning we had an issues \nconference with the Democratic caucus at the Library of Congress, just \nacross the street from this building. Those of us in the Democratic \ncaucus in the Senate--and there are 50 of us in a 100-person Senate--\nspent the day talking about the issues we want to raise during this \nCongress.\n  We invited President Bush to come by this issues conference, which I \nbelieve was unprecedented. As chairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee, I recommended we invite the new President. He came and made \na very short presentation to us--very general and very cordial. We \nasked a series of questions, and then he departed. We were very pleased \nhe did come by to our issues conference.\n  One of the things he said in discussing issues with the Democratic \ncaucus was that when he campaigned for the Presidency, he campaigned on \ncertain issues, and he said: I intend to pursue those issues as \nPresident, and there will be time when we disagree, but we should be \nable to do that without being personal and without being disagreeable. \nHe understands that there are times we will disagree as a matter of \npublic policy, and that is the way democracy works.\n  There is an old saying that when everyone in the room is thinking the \nsame thing, no one is really thinking very much. That is certainly true \nin public policy. The ability in this kind of a setting to have a good \naggressive debate on public policy issues, especially controversial \nissues, benefits the American people. Then we get the best of what \neveryone has to offer. So let's begin this debate.\n  The President has proposed that we have a $1.6 trillion tax cut in \nthis country over the next 10 years. That was not a surprise to us. He \ncampaigned on that throughout this country. That election ended in a \ndead-even tie, but the members of the electoral college cast their \nvotes, and he is now President. There is not necessarily a mandate for \nthis tax cut, at least one for $1.6 trillion.\n  I make the point that this President campaigned on it and yesterday \nhe announced it, and we will in this Congress now begin to discuss and \ndebate the advantages or disadvantages of that particular plan.\n  There are a lot of reasons for us to say that now is the time to \noffer a tax cut to the American people. We do have a budget that is now \nin surplus, and that surplus exists in a measure that will allow some \nof that money to be sent back to the American taxpayers. That is the \nway it should happen. There are other uses for that money as well, and \nwe ought to include them.\n  We ought to pay down the Federal debt with part of it. If during \ntough times we run up the Federal debt, during good times we ought to \npay it down. Not all of that surplus ought to go to tax cuts; some \nought to go to reduce the Federal debt. Yes, some ought to go to tax \ncuts, and then some ought to be used to improve life in this country--\ninvest in education, invest in health care, prepare for the needs of \nSocial Security and Medicare in the future. There is a range of needs \nand a range of priorities, and that is what I want to talk about today.\n  Twenty years ago, we had a new President come to this office, \nPresident Ronald Reagan. He proposed in 1981 a very large tax cut. In \nfact, one of the contestants for the Presidency was Republican Senator \nHoward Baker who called the economic plan that President Reagan brought \nin 1981 a ``riverboat gamble.''\n  President Reagan said we should cut taxes substantially and double \nthe defense budget, and the concurrence of those two policies--cutting \ntaxes and doubling the spending on defense--would result in a balanced \nbudget. In fact, the plan backfired. It did not result in a balanced \nbudget. It resulted in long-term, abiding, deep Federal budget deficits \nthat kept growing and growing. And $3 trillion was added to the Federal \ndebt in a very short period of time because the plan did not add up--\nwith annual budget deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n  I make that point only because it has taken years of struggle to try \nto deal with those annual budget deficits that kept growing like a \ncancer in our budget. But we did deal with it. Through a\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nseries of public policies and private initiatives, those budget \ndeficits are gone and replaced now by surpluses.\n  How did they disappear? One, we changed the direction of fiscal \npolicy early in the last decade. We cut some spending and increased \nsome taxes. Some did not like it. It was very controversial. Some of my \ncolleagues said, if we do this, it will throw the country into a \nrecession and throw people out of work. Of course, it did not. It gave \nthe American people confidence that we were going to be on the right \ntrack and that finally Washington was serious about getting rid of \nFederal budget deficits. The result: We had unprecedented economic \ngrowth. We then had, as well, diminishing Federal budget deficits to \nthe point where deficits turned into surpluses.\n  So finally, after 20 years, the accumulated deficits are gone. But we \nstill have a substantial amount of Federal debt that resulted from \nthose annual deficits.\n  President Bush says, let us decide to cut the Federal tax load by \n$1.6 trillion over the coming 10 years. What is wrong with that? Aren't \ntax cuts always good? Don't the American people always want tax cuts--\nthe bigger the better?\n  Let me read something written by Allan Sloan, who is a thinker and a \njournalist that I really respect. This was in today's paper. He \ndescribes what is wrong with it, from my perspective. I am quoting \nAllan Sloan:\n\n       There are weeks when you have to wonder whether the \n     American economic attention span is longer than a sand \n     flea's. Consider last week's two big economic stories: The \n     Congressional Budget Office increased the projected 10-year \n     budget surplus by $1 trillion, and the Federal Reserve Board \n     cut short-term interest rates another half-percentage point \n     to try to keep the economy from tanking.\n       To me, the real story isn't either of these events; it is \n     their connection. The Fed is cutting rates like a doctor \n     trying to revive a cardiac patient because as recently as \n     last fall, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't foresee what \n     today's economy would be like. Meanwhile, although it is now \n     clear that even the smart, savvy, data-inhaling Greenspan \n     couldn't see 4 months ahead, people are treating the 10-year \n     numbers from the Congressional Budget Office as holy writ.\n       Hello? If Greenspan missed a 4-month forecast, how can you \n     treat 10-year numbers as anything other than educated \n     guesswork? Especially when the CBO has for years devoted a \n     chapter in its reports to ``The Uncertainty of Budget \n     Projections''?\n\n  Should we really be talking about 10 years, $1.6 trillion?\n  Abe Lincoln once gave a speech, and he said that an Eastern monarch \nonce charged his wise men to invent for him a sentence to ever be in \nview and which would be true and appropriate in all times and \nsituations. Working on the problem, they finally presented the \nfollowing words: ``This, too, shall pass away.'' Abe Lincoln said: \n``How much that expresses. How chastening in the hour of pride and how \nconsoling in the depths of affliction, this, too, shall pass away.''\n\n  Because we have turned deficits into surpluses, what has happened in \nthis town is that we have people who believe that this kind of economic \ngrowth and opportunity will continue for 10 years unabated.\n  I thought the definition of a conservative was to be reasonably \ncautious about things. That, apparently, is not the case. Let's lock in \nvery large tax cuts that have the danger of throwing us right back into \nthe same deficit ditch we were in for so very long.\n  Let me say this. I believe there is room for a tax cut. I do not \nbelieve we ought to lock in large tax cuts for the next 10 years. I do \nnot happen to believe the kind of tax cuts proposed by this President \nare the kind of tax cuts that we should lock in, in any event. I do not \nhappen to believe that you ought to just say, the tax burden in this \ncountry represents the income tax burden people pay, and whatever else \nthey pay is irrelevant. The fact is taxpayers paid over $600 billion in \npayroll taxes in this country last year, and that is relevant because \nthree-fourths of the American people pay more in payroll taxes than in \nincome taxes.\n  But this plan proposed by President Bush says: Ignore that. That is \nnot a tax burden that counts. All we are concerned about is giving back \nsome income tax. And, by the way, we will give it back on the basis of \nwho paid it, and so our giveback plan is that the largest payers get \nback the largest refunds.\n  I do not think that is good policy. I do not think it is \nconservative. I do not think it is good for this country.\n  Let me go through just a couple of charts that describe the choices \nwe are going to make.\n  These are budget choices and tax choices: Should we risk slipping \nback into big deficits or should we move forward and build on recent \neconomic successes? I think almost everyone would say that is a choice \nwhich is very simple: Let's build on these economic successes.\n  If that is the case, then what are the risks of the fiscal policy we \nchoose? What are the risks of deciding that we can see 10 years out? \nEveryone here knows that is not the case. That is foolhardy. We cannot \nsee 6 months, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, or 7 years out. We can't see \nthat far. We do not know what is going to happen.\n  Does anyone in their own family budget think they have the \nopportunity to understand what is going to happen 7 years or 10 years \nfrom now? They don't. Yet that is exactly what we are being told by the \nPresident and his economic advisers: Lock in a $1.6 trillion tax cut \nbecause we know what is going to happen for the next 10 years. That is, \nin my judgment, very risky for this country.\n  The Congressional Budget Office does an analysis of what might or \nmight not happen.\n  Let's look at the difference in optimistic versus pessimistic \npresumptions. If you want to take an optimistic view of things, if you \nwant to always look for a pony in a manure pile--you always think there \nis good news just around the corner--you can ride on this top line. But \nwhat if it is wrong? What if it is this bottom line? What does that \nmean for the country? What does it mean for kids going to schools in \ndisrepair? What does it mean for kids going to school in classrooms \nwhere there are 32, 34 kids in a classroom? What does it mean for a \nwoman who has diabetes or heart trouble and can't pay for her medicine \nbecause Medicare does not cover it?\n  If you make the wrong choice--and we have a huge tax cut that lasts \n10 years, when the economy is soft, and we are back into deficits, it \nmeans there is no money for education, no money for prescription drugs \nin Medicare, and no money for health care.\n  The President proposes that we can see 10 years out, and with the \nsurplus that we expect for 10 years out we can propose massive tax \ncuts. Eighty-five percent this is the $2.2 trillion that people say \nreally is the cost of what the President says his tax cut is--and there \nis very little money left for debt reduction, which, in my judgment, \nought to be a priority. It seems to me, one of the things that ought to \nrank high here is reducing the Federal debt during better times. If you \nrun it up during tough times, reduce it during good times.\n  Prescription drugs in Medicare, we ought to do something in that. We \nknow of the challenges in education. They say that defense is going to \nneed more money. This administration has talked about substantially \nmore money for defense. You also have agriculture, Medicare reform, \nSocial Security reform. And how about a rainy day fund. Should there be \nsomething set aside in case something goes wrong with our economy? Yes, \nI believe so.\n  Those are some of the considerations. And President Bush's plan is a \ntax cut that has a relatively small cut in the first year but \npermanently is backloaded with huge tax cuts in the 10th year. What \nthat does is, it puts us right back in the same circumstances that we \nfound ourselves in in to the 1980s, in my judgment.\n  Some say, this public debt is all coming down. Let me take a look at \nthis chart. We have a long way to go to reduce public indebtedness, and \nit ought to be a priority. What better gift to America's children, to \nremove that yoke of indebtedness around their shoulders. It ought to be \na priority. It is, in my judgment, a conservative ethic to decide one \nof the priorities is to reduce debt.\n  Finally, let me make the point that we are going to discuss this at a \ntime following the longest economic expansion in this country's \nhistory, when we see a weakening of the economy.\n  Let me hasten to add, this is not a surprise. Seven months ago, Alan \nGreenspan decided the American economy was too strong. He and his \nbrethren at the Federal Reserve Board\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nlocked their door because they are the last place in town that locks \ntheir door to keep the public out. It is the last American dinosaur in \nour Government. They locked their door. They make secret decisions. And \n7 months ago they said: Our economy is too strong. It is growing too \nfast. We have to slow it down. We are going to increase interests \nrates.\n  Seven to eight months later, where are we? Planned job cuts at \nMontgomery Ward, Daimler Chrysler, Lucent Technologies, Sara Lee, and \nGeneral Electric--potentially 80,000. This morning EToys is broke. This \neconomy is softening far beyond the imagination or expectation of the \nFederal Reserve Board. But no one should be surprised by that. The Fed \ninsisted that the economy was growing too rapidly, and they wanted to \nslow it down some. Don't call this economic slowdown anything other \nthan Federal Reserve Board strategy.\n  Having both studied economics and taught economics in college, it is \nuseful to ask the question, notwithstanding the Federal Reserve Board \naction, has anyone really repealed the business cycle, that cycle in \nwhich you have economic expansion and contraction? It is inevitable. We \nhave economic stabilizers to try to even it out a bit more, but has \nanyone been able to repeal the business cycle? The answer is no. As a \nresult of that, we have economic contractions, notwithstanding what the \nFed does. When those contractions exist, we will hope they are minor.\n  But the point of all of that is, we should not decide to lock in very \nlarge tax cuts for a 10-year period when we can't see out 2 years. The \nFed can't see out 7 months. It is risky for this country, risky for our \neconomy and our children, to do that.\n  Some, I suppose, can't help it; it is just habit forming. There is a \nstory about how elephants with circuses are able to be tied to the \nlittle metal posts. If you ever to go to a circus, you see the \nelephants. They have a metal cuff around their leg and a chain. The \nchain goes to a little metal stake pounded into the ground. You wonder, \nhow can that stake hold an elephant that weighs thousands and thousands \nof pounds?\n  The answer is that in Thailand, when they catch the elephants, what \nthey do is they put that cuff around the elephant's back leg with a \nchain, and they tie the other end to a big banyan tree. That elephant, \nfor a week or two or more, will pull with all of his might and all of \nhis energy to get away. But he can't shake that banyan tree. Finally, \nthe elephant simply discovers: With that cuff on my leg and that chain, \nI can't move. They take the other end off the banyan tree and put a \nlittle stake in the ground, and the elephant never moves. He is chained \nby his habit. He can't move, so he doesn't move.\n  There is a lot of that in this policy we see these days. This is a \npolicy born of habit. The minute you have some good economic news, you \ndecide you are going to offer a very big tax cut and it doesn't matter \nwhat the consequences are.\n  I mentioned when I started that there are a lot of ways to provide a \ntax cut. I happen to believe there is room to have a tax cut in this \ncountry now. But people pay income taxes, and they pay payroll taxes. \nThey pay a range of taxes, income and payroll being the two largest. \nThe President's proposal, like a lot of others, says the only taxes \nthat really count are the income taxes and we will give you a portion \nof them back.\n  What about the people at the bottom of the economic ladder who pay \npayroll taxes? Three-fourths of the American people pay more in payroll \ntaxes than in income taxes. Yet no one ever talks about giving them \nsomething back. Why not? How about those who work at the bottom rung of \nthe economic ladder, many of whom pay no income taxes because they \ndon't earn enough income? How about giving them something back in terms \nof the heavy payroll taxes they pay? How about making sure that when \nyou provide a tax cut, the tax cut is fair across the board, not just \nprovide very large tax cuts to the people making three, four, five \nhundred thousand, and more, millions a year, and then just small crumbs \nto the people at the bottom, if any at all.\n  This economic engine of ours works because a lot of people are out \nthere working, some at the top, some at the bottom. Don't diminish the \nefforts of those at the bottom. They pay taxes, too. They get up in the \nmorning. They work hard all day. They pay taxes. They pay the same rate \nof payroll taxes as the richest Americans pay on their salaried income. \nSo how about some help for those folks.\n  What I would prefer we do in a tax cut plan would be to propose a 2-\nyear tax cut plan for this country, and, at the end of 2 years, to \nevaluate: Do we have continuing surpluses? Is our economy good and \nstrong? And if so, then we should continue those tax cuts. What I would \nsuggest is that we provide a tax cut over the next 2 years that \nrepresents a percentage cut in income taxes paid, plus payroll taxes \npaid. Add those burdens together and take a percentage of that and \nprovide a tax cut for 2 years based on that. That recognizes then that \npeople at the bottom who are paying payroll taxes also ought to get a \npercentage of that back.\n  I am not saying we should eliminate money from the trust fund. Let \nthat go into the trust funds. I am saying that when you measure the \nburden of taxes, measure the Federal income taxes paid and the payroll \ntaxes paid and provide a percentage of that and give it back. And I \nwould have a maximum of perhaps $1,000. That is a way to give a tax cut \nin a manner that is fair and in a manner that makes sense.\n  Second, as we talk about taxes, there is one other thing we ought to \ndo. I have been working on this for a couple years. I have introduced \nit with a couple of my colleagues. It is called the FASST plan--the \nFair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan. Over 70 million Americans can pay \nincome taxes in the future, if we adopt this plan, without ever having \nto file an income tax return. Your withholding at work is your actual \ntax liability. Check a few additional boxes on your W-4, one of which \nsays I am a homeowner, yes or no, and your actual withholding becomes \nyour actual tax liability. No waiting in line on April 15 at the post \noffice. No more audits. Over thirty countries have return-free tax \nfiling systems for most of their taxpayers. We could, and we should.\n  Seventy million Americans can avoid having to file income tax returns \nin the future if we pass the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan I \npropose. That also can be done in a way that reduces taxes, because in \norder to do that, you would eliminate taxes on the first increment of \ninterest, dividend and other investment income that families have.\n  I won't go into all of the details of my plan, but it makes sense, if \nwe are talking about substantial changes in our Tax Code, to consider \nsimplifying the Tax Code at the same time. Those are a couple of things \nI think we should do. We ought to recognize that payroll taxes count as \nwell. That is part of the tax burden. We ought to do something that \nrecognizes that.\n  Finally, let me talk for a moment about the alternatives. If we \ndecide to lock in a 10-year tax cut, a very sizable proportion, there \nwill not be any money left to pay down the Federal debt, which, as I \nsaid, I think ought to be a priority, and, second, to make needed \ninvestments which we know are necessary.\n  I have talked before about a couple of people. I will do it again. We \nknow it is a priority to provide a prescription drug benefit in \nMedicare.\n  I was in Michigan, ND, one evening. A woman came up to me after a \ntown meeting, and she grabbed hold of my arm. She was perhaps in her \nlate seventies, early eighties. She began to speak to me about the \nprescription drug medicine she had to purchase. Then her chin began to \nquiver, her eyes filled with tears, and she said: I can't afford to buy \nthese prescription drugs. I don't have the money. I know I need them. \nThe doctor says I must take them, but I don't have the money. Her eyes \nwere filled with tears, and she turned away from me. That goes on all \nacross this country, people who need prescription drugs, living on \nMedicare, but they don't have the money.\n  Do we have needs to respond to in those areas? You bet your life we \ndo. That ought to be a priority.\n  I have talked about Rosie Two Bears, a third grader in a school that \nis dilapidated, in a school where kids sit at desks 1 inch apart in \ncrowded classrooms in a school, part of which has been condemned, in a \nschool that has\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nclassrooms where they have to evacuate because the sewer gas comes up a \ncouple times a week. And little Rosie Two Bears says to me: Mr. \nSenator, are you going to build me a new school?\n  I can't build her a new school. I don't have the money to build her a \nnew school. She and so many others around this country need a school \nthat is renovated and modern and capable. When she walks through that \nclassroom door, we do her and others a disservice by not having a \nfirst-class facility for her to be educated in. Is that a need for us? \nYes, that is a need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have many needs and many priorities, one of which is, \nyes, let's provide a tax cut. Let's make it fairer.\n  Second, let's not have a 10-year tax cut locked in so that we put \nthis country's economy at risk and throw us back into Federal deficits.\n  Third, let's also pay down the Federal debt while we have some \nsurpluses. What better gift to our children than paying down the \nFederal indebtedness we ran up during tougher times.\n  Fourth, let's not provide a tax cut that is so large, the bulk of it \nwill go to the upper income people, in a way that would prohibit us \nfrom having the resources we need for education, health care, and other \nareas that we know need additional investment in this country. Those \nought to be our priorities.\n  I say to the new President, I am interested in working with him and \nothers. Having an aggressive, good debate about fiscal policy is not \npersonal, and it shall never become personal. We have different ideas \nabout the priorities in this country. We need to debate that in the \ncoming months. I intend to talk about that because I believe so \nstrongly that we ought to do all of the things I have described in \norder to give us an economy that will continue to grow, prosper, and \nprovide opportunities for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I have been here on the floor listening to \nthe debate. I am very pleased that we are engaging in a real debate \nabout the possibility of meaningful tax relief. I have worked since I \nwas elected to Congress, about 8\\1/2\\ years ago, to try to reform the \nTax Code. I hope our debate over reducing taxes does not cause us to \nlose sight of the fact that we have to ultimately reform our Tax Code. \nTaxes are not only too high but too complicated, and the cost of simply \ncomplying with the Tax Code is a burden the people must see removed.\n  Tax relief. Why are we debating so much about tax relief right now? \nWhat is the thing that caused us to come together? It is the fact that \nPresident Bush has been elected and has followed through on his \ncampaign commitment to propose a $1.6 trillion tax cut to the American \npeople.\n  I want to go through what it is President Bush has proposed. We have \nhad a lot of debate about whether it is good or bad to have a tax cut, \nbut not a lot of details about what President Bush is proposing we do. \nThe President's tax relief proposal is fair and responsible. It \nprovides a typical American family at least $1,600 in relief. They get \nto keep at least $1,600 of their own money that they are now sending to \nWashington with these skyrocketing surpluses, which I will talk about \nin a moment, which are growing. The typical American family is defined \nin this context as a family of four with one wage earner who earns \n$50,000 annually. I will give you more statistics about what this means \nfor other types of situations.\n  For example, the President's proposal gives a tax cut to every single \nfamily in America who pays income taxes. What does it do? It reduces \nthe current five-rate tax structure to a four-rate tax structure and \nreduces every tax rate. Every taxpayer who is in any tax rate--in any \ntax bracket--will receive relief. Right now, he is proposing that we \nmove to a 10-percent, a 15-percent, a 25-percent, and a 33-percent tax \nbracket.\n\n  For those of you who don't follow tax brackets, currently the lowest \nis 15. So if you are in the lowest income category, paying the lowest \nrates of income taxes, you will see your tax rates go from 15 percent \nto 10 percent--a 33-percent reduction for that tax bracket alone. The \ntax reductions are lower as the rates go higher, in terms of percentage \nof income.\n  It doubles the child tax credit to $1,000. It reduces the marriage \ntax penalty.\n  I think we ought to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. I have \ncosponsored legislation which does that. Many of us will be trying to \nsee if that total elimination of the marriage tax penalty can be worked \ninto this package.\n  It eliminates the death tax and expands the charitable tax deduction.\n  What does this mean? It means that one in five families with children \nnow who are paying taxes will no longer pay any tax at all. Six million \nfamilies, those at the lower income levels, will be totally eliminated \nfrom the tax rolls. A family of four making $35,000 would get a 100-\npercent tax cut. A family of four making $50,000 would receive about a \n50-percent tax cut. A family of four making $75,000 would receive about \na 75-percent tax cut. The marginal income tax rate on low-income \nfamilies will fall by over 40 percent.\n  The current Tax Code is unfair to a single mom paying $25,000 a year. \nShe pays a higher marginal tax than somebody making $250,000 a year. \nThat will be changed under this tax proposal. Federal taxes today are \nthe highest they have ever been in peacetime America. Americans pay \nmore now for taxes than they spend on food, clothing, and housing \ncombined. Americans work more than 4 months out of every year just to \npay their tax bills. The current high tax rates are keeping low-income \ntaxpayers out of the middle class.\n  Recent business layoffs show that the economy needs a boost quickly. \nThose layoffs are not a reason not to have tax relief; they are a \nreason we need tax relief.\n  The critics--and there are always critics--are throwing everything \nthey can at this tax relief proposal. I am in my ninth year in \nCongress, with 6 years in the House and almost 3 years in the Senate. \nDuring the entire time I have served in Congress, we have fought for \ntax relief. We have put forward bill after bill. We have put forward \nevery kind of idea you can think of to get the President and the \nadministration and those who oppose tax relief in this city to support \nsomething.\n  Every time in the last 8\\1/2\\ years, whatever we have proposed, \nwhatever it is, has been attacked as a ``tax cut for the wealthy.'' I \nstart to wonder if anybody who pays taxes is defined as wealthy. When \nwe get a proposal such as this one that benefits everybody in America \nand gives higher percentages of relief for those at the lower income \nlevel, it is attacked as what? A tax cut for the wealthy.\n  It seems there is not ever going to be a tax cut that is acceptable \nto those in this country who want to keep taxes high so they can keep \nspending high. That is what this debate is about. Make no mistake about \nit; We are now seeing that the record levels of spending by this \nFederal Government are not enough to those who want to see spending \nincreased even more. We have projections of $5.6 trillion of surplus in \nthe next 10 years, and that is not enough.\n\n  We have to say that a $1.6 trillion tax cut is going to threaten our \ncountry. The reason it is a threat is that there are those who believe \nthat from cradle to grave this Federal Government must take care of \nyou. In order to do so, it has to have your tax dollars. Spending at \nthe Federal level is the ultimate objective.\n  Let's talk about that surplus. The latest projections are for a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus. One of the battles we have won in the last 8 years \nsince I have been in Congress is that we have stopped the Federal \nGovernment from robbing the Social Security surplus and spending Social \nSecurity dollars, masking excess spending. We don't allow that to \nhappen anymore, and we won't here.\n  If you take out the Social Security part of the surplus and the other \noff-budget portions of the surplus, that is about $2.5 trillion, \nleaving somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.1 trillion of non-Social \nSecurity on budget surplus\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nover the next decade. President Bush is proposing that we give tax \nrelief for $1.6 trillion of that.\n  You have heard the argument made that it is risky; we can't project \n10 years and be accurate. That is true. In the 8 or 9 years I have been \nhere, I can't remember a year when we got it exactly right. But I can \nremember that every year we got it low. We used conservative estimates. \nWe have built in downturns in the economy. Frankly, if we find that \neven these conservative estimates are not too low--and I will note that \nthey are upgraded every month now, showing that they are low--we can \nadjust things as we move along. To scare people out of a tax cut by \nsaying we don't know for sure is simply another argument by those who \nnever want to see taxes cut.\n  We have an opportunity to reduce taxes in a significant way, and we \nought to take it.\n  Let's talk a little bit about what the positive effect of tax relief \nwill be. Tax relief is going to have the immediate effect of helping \nfamilies, businesses, and communities save and invest more while moving \nin a direction toward reforming the Tax Code. Prompt action will also \nimprove the economic environment and strengthen consumer confidence.\n  By the way, those projections we use are what we call static \nprojections. As we project, we are not allowed to assume reduced taxes \nwill stimulate economic activity. We have to assume that every dollar \nof taxes that we cut is a dollar of lost revenue to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Experience shows us that in many of the areas where we reduce taxes \nthe increased stimulation to the economics of the country actually \ngenerate increased revenues. Every time so far that we have cut the \ncapital gains tax, the revenues from the capital gains tax have gone \nup--not down--because it has allowed more capital transactions to take \nplace in this country. We are not allowed to take any of that into \nconsideration. But tax relief will--mark my words--allow for more \ninvestment, will allow for more safety, will strengthen consumer \nconfidence, and will stimulate and strengthen our economy.\n  Recently Alan Greenspan was emphatic about the superiority of tax \ncuts to spending increases. He said: If long-term fiscal stability is \nthe criterion, it is far better, in my judgment, that the surpluses be \nlowered by tax reductions than by spending increases.\n  That is what the debate is about. This debate is not about whether to \npay down the debt or to reduce taxes. This debate is about whether to \nkeep taxes high so this Government can continue its increasing appetite \nto spend Federal dollars and pull control over the economy and over \npeople into Washington. The argument is made that we should reduce the \nFederal debt first. Frankly, I agree with that.\n  I strongly believe that our highest priority should be to pay down \nthe Federal debt. Alan Greenspan pointed out that with the surpluses we \nare seeing now we are paying down the Federal debt at a rate about as \nfast as we can.\n  There are certain instruments out there that go beyond the 10-year \ntimeframe with which we are dealing--public debt instruments--and if we \nbuy those down early, we will actually have to pay a premium in order \nto do so.\n  His point was that if we continue our current rate of paying down the \nnational debt, we can do so and have this tax relief.\n  We have already reduced the national debt by $360 billion. We reduced \nit last year by $224 billion. Even assuming this tax relief package \ngoes into place, in 5 years we will have paid off more than half the \nFederal debt, and in 10 years we can pay off most of it--still working \non both areas where we have debt instruments that are out there beyond \nthe 10-year time cycle.\n  Make no mistake about this either. We are committed to paying down \nthe national debt, and we will pay down the national debt. But stopping \na tax relief package is not going to accelerate that process. Stopping \nthe tax relief package is simply going to accelerate the opportunity \nfor Federal spending sprees as we go into our appropriations cycles in \nthis Congress.\n  I think it is important that we get this debate in its proper \nperspective. Our goal here is to improve the quality of life for all \nAmericans. The argument has been made about this tax package that, \nwell, it is going to stop us from being able to make needed investments \nin areas that we have to invest.\n\n  Remember those budget surplus numbers I talked to you about earlier. \nEven if they are not adjusted up anymore, we are going to have \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years \nafter the tax relief package; after saving all the Social Security \nsurplus and other off-budget surplus dollars to use for strengthening \nthings where we have legitimate needs for Federal spending.\n  For example, America's failing schools still fail to deliver a world-\nclass education; and President Bush has proposed to make sure not one \nstudent is left behind.\n  Our national security needs some strengthening. We can assure that we \nhave an effective defense against ballistic missile attacks; that our \nmilitary's aging equipment and personnel shortages are addressed; Our \nhealth services and programs for the elderly are out of date and need \nreform and strengthening.\n  Those things can happen. We can address the needs of this country \nwithout being caused, by the politics of fear, to think we don't have \nan opportunity for tax relief right now. That is what it ultimately \ngets down to.\n  This time, as well as every time in the last 8 years, we will try to \ntalk America out of a tax cut. They will use what I call the politics \nof fear. They will say we can't protect you if you do not let us have \nthese tax dollars; that we can't do what is needed to make sure that \nyour life is made safe; and that if you allow this tax relief package \nto go through, then all kinds of terrible things are going to happen to \nthe economy.\n  The truth is, this is a modest tax relief proposal given the \npotential surpluses we see growing; and as we move forward this country \nwill be strengthened--not weakened--by a resolve to reduce the tax \nburden paid by the American families.\n  Again, we pay the highest rates of taxes today than we have paid in \npeacetime America. We have some of the highest surpluses ever. We can \nprotect Social Security and strengthen our country, and we can do so if \nwe will properly address the issue of tax relief.\n  I encourage us to move forward quickly to pass this tax package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume up to 15 minutes. I may not use all 15 minutes, if there are \nother speakers waiting to come to the floor.\n  I have been asked by the manager of this bill to accommodate Senator \nDurbin by adding 11 minutes at the end of the time of morning business \nfor Senator Durbin, and in the process of my doing that for Senator \nThomas, I need to apologize to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, because she asked to do the same thing. I guess we weren't at \nthat point so accommodating because I said I would accommodate her at 3 \no'clock this afternoon. I apologize to Senator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this morning, and a lot of times during \nthis debate over the next 4 or 5 months on tax legislation, we will \nhear a lot of economic arguments. I don't want to detract from those \neconomic arguments as not being good arguments, but I think they are \ntailored to fit the pattern of people who have a political philosophy \nthat believes more money running through the Federal budget, and \nthrough the Federal Treasury, as a percent of our gross domestic \nproduct is a better thing to do.\n  They believe that a political decision made by Senators and \nCongressmen and a President on the distribution of goods and services \nwithin our country is better than leaving the money in the pockets of \nthe men and women who are working in America to pay those taxes to \ndecide how that money should be spent. We may not talk about it enough, \nbut our philosophy for those of us who are fighting for tax relief for \nevery taxpayer in America is that we believe there is more economic \ngood done for America--and creating jobs in America and having a better \nlife in America--if the money does not come through the Federal \nTreasury; or at least if less of it comes through the\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nFederal Treasury and more is spent and invested by individual working \nmen and women, entrepreneurs, and people who create jobs; or even if \nthe money is spent by consumers. We believe that by having the \nmarketplace and willing buyers and sellers make that determination of \nhow the money should be divided creates more jobs, and turns over many \nmore times in the economy than if the money comes through the Federal \nTreasury, and there is a political decision on how it should be \ndistributed.\n  Those are honest political and philosophical differences between our \npolitical parties. They are honest differences, but one has great faith \nin government to make decisions; the other one, mine, has great faith \nin individuals to make decisions. My philosophy will create more jobs. \nSince government does not create wealth, government distributes wealth \nor expends wealth, there aren't as many jobs created in the process. \nWhen the government actually creates a job, it is a job that consumes \ntaxpayers' money, not creating wealth.\n\n  These economic arguments are very good, but I feel more comfortable \napplying a little basic common sense to the whole argument of a tax \ncut; a little common sense to offset a lot of Washington nonsense. It \nis common sense that we have a tax surplus. We haven't had a tax \nsurplus except in the last 4 or 5 years. Before that, I have to admit, \nCongress was very fiscally irresponsible with budget deficits. We had \nsome tax surplus in the Social Security account, and we still have it, \nbut it was meant to cover up irresponsible spending on the other side. \nThat is behind us now that we have had a new Congress for the last 6 \nyears, going on 7. We have not only budget surpluses, but surpluses \nbeyond budget surpluses; those are tax surpluses.\n  It has reached a point, because of automatic bracket creep, where \npeople earn more and they are put in higher brackets. That money is \ncoming in at historically high levels of taxation. Automatic bracket \ncreep comes because people get put in a higher bracket and there isn't \nenough reduction in the tax brackets through the inflationary \nadjustment to offset that. Consequently, we have automatic tax \nincreases on people without a vote of Congress. As a result of bracket \ncreep as well as other enacted tax increases, taxes are now at 20.6 \npercent of gross domestic product, whereas over a 50-year period of \ntime it was somewhere between 18.5 and 19.5. Historically, the economy \nhas adjusted itself to that level of taxes. I think the people have \naccepted it as a reasonable rate of taxation. But they don't accept \nthis historical high of 20.6 percent. That is why we are having the \ndemand for tax relief for every taxpayer.\n  Common sense dictates if we are going to keep this level of taxation \nup, that it is going to be burning holes in the pockets of Senators, \nCongressmen, and even Presidents to get spent. Those expenditures are \ngenerally on a continuing basis and an obligation always on the Federal \nTreasury. We want to discourage the level of expenditures growing as it \ndid over the last 3 years, an average of 6 percent, twice the rate of \ninflation; or last year, 11.9 percent, three times the rate of \ninflation. That is not sustainable because taxes aren't coming in at \nthat level. Even if they were coming in at that level, we would not \nwant to have the level of expenditures that high because sometime there \nwill be a downturn in the economy, and when that income goes down, \nexpenditures don't go down to adjust to the income of the Federal \nTreasury.\n  Common sense dictates we have to take some money out of Washington, \nDC, and leave it in the pockets of the taxpayers of America so we \naren't the overtaxed nation that we are, that we are more where the \nhistorical level of taxation has been for 50 years.\n  Now is the time to do that, to make up for the real bracket creep we \nhave had, these automatic tax increases we have had, where we have \nreached the point where the average taxpayer is spending more on food, \nclothing, and shelter than they are spending on taxes. We will give tax \nrelief to working men and women, to taxpayers in America, because of \nthis high level of taxation, because we don't want money burned up in \nWashington, DC. We want to keep the money out of Washington, DC, \nleaving it in the taxpayers' pockets.\n\n  There is 50 years of common sense behind that because that has been \nthe level of taxation, 18 to 19 percent of the gross national product.\n  We need to understand the taxpayers trust themselves with the money \nmore than they trust the Internal Revenue Service. We will hear the tax \nrelief that I am talking about is labeled a risky scheme. The only \nscheme is Washington's insatiable appetite for more and more of the \nworking men and women's hard-earned tax dollars.\n  There is a threat, we are told, that we can't continue to pay down \nthe national debt. We can continue to pay down the national debt. We \nwill continue to pay down the national debt. We are going to continue \nto pay down the national debt until we get to that point where Chairman \nGreenspan has advised that you can't pay down any more national debt \nbecause there is about $1 trillion of the national debt that is held by \nindividuals who want the security of the Federal Treasury for their \nsavings. They have bought 30- year Treasury bonds, and about $1 \ntrillion of those are not callable. In about 6 or 7 years, we are going \nto reach the point where there is money coming into the Federal \nTreasury, that if these bonds are not callable, you don't pay down the \nnational debt anymore, you start having the Federal Government invest \nin the stock market, buying other bonds, buying other stock, or at the \nvery least, as the law requires now, to invest in federally insured \nfinancial institutions and then have an inordinate political impact \nupon the economy when that enormous transfer of billions and billions \nof dollars is put into the private banking system. That caution is not \nurged by Senator Grassley. That caution is urged by Chairman Greenspan.\n  I assure people we are going to continue to pay down on the national \ndebt. Taxes are so high we have reached the point where a two-wage-\nearner family, particularly if they are middle-income or below, one-\nwage earner is working to put food on the table and a roof over the \nhead and just to provide for the family; the other one is working to \npay for the Washington bureaucracy. That isn't how a family gets ahead.\n  For a family with a $50,000-a-year income--this will probably be a \ntwo-wage-earner family; it wouldn't have to be but it could be--but for \na $50,000 income family of four, their taxes now are about $4,000, on \naverage. Under the President's proposal they drop down to $2,000. \nConsequently, that will leave in the pockets of those working men and \nwomen income for them to decide on their own how that money can be \nbetter used, whether it is saved for college education, pay more down \non credit card debt, pay more down on the house mortgage. They may want \nto spend it, but that family making a determination of how to spend it \nis going to do more good for the entire U.S. economy than anything \nelse.\n\n  We have also been urged this morning: Don't get locked into a tax \ncut--this is where the trigger mechanism comes in--and that maybe we \nought to have automatic increases in taxes for 4 or 5 years down the \nroad in case something unpredictable happens.\n  We do not need to worry about that. Common sense tells me that it is \neasier for Congress to increase taxes than to decrease taxes. We do not \nhave to have an automatic trigger. It is not good for the economy to \nhave it anyway because working men and women are going to perform \naccording to the predictability of the Tax Code, and we should make \nsure it is predictable.\n  My time is up. I assure my colleagues, we do not have to worry about \ntriggers because we have only had two tax decreases in 20 years, but we \nhave had Congress vote tax increases in 1982, 1984, 1986, 1990, and the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the country under President \nClinton in 1993. So we do not need an automatic trigger. If we need to \nincrease taxes, Congress can do it, and common sense tells me that we \nwill do it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, it is always an exciting \nday when an accountant gets to talk about taxes.\n  The American people have had some concerns over taxes for a long \ntime. If you were to throw that into a list of things about which they \nare concerned,\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\nit would probably come out at the top. Do they think there is going to \nbe tax relief?\n  I ran into a song written by a guy named Roger Miller that sums up \nthe trust people have in the Federal Government giving them some tax \nrelief, and it goes something like this:\n\n     Well, you dad-gum gov'ment\n     You sorry so 'n' so's\n     You got your hands in every pocket of my clothes\n     Well, you dad-gum, dad-gum, dad-gum gov'ment.\n     Well, you dad-gum gov'ment\n     You sorry rackafratchits\n     You got yourself an itcha\n     And you want me to scratch it\n     Well, you dad-gum, dad-gum, dad-gum gov'ment.\n\n  The President is coming through with relief on the burden of every \ntaxpayer--every taxpayer. I am in support of President Bush's relief \nproposal. It is time to ax the tax and cut the burden down to size.\n  I applaud President Bush in acknowledging that surplus revenue is a \ntax overcharge. It is time to stop the overcharge. It is time to return \nthe money to the American people. It is time to relieve the burden on \nall the taxpayers.\n  Americans deserve tax relief. Right now Federal taxes are the highest \nthey have been in America during peacetime. Americans pay more in taxes \nthan they spend on food, clothing, and housing combined. Most people \nwork more than 4 months each year just to fund their government. It is \ntime for the Federal Government to get its hands out of the pockets and \nallow them to keep more of their own money.\n\n  President Bush has proposed tax relief for every taxpayer. That is \nright; if you pay taxes now, you will receive tax relief under \nPresident Bush's proposal. As an example, a family of four who earns \n$50,000 a year will receive tax relief of $1,600. That is a 50-percent \nreduction for those families.\n  Right now I can tell you $1,600 will go quite far in my home State of \nWyoming. For most folks, that will pay for 1 or even 2 months of \nmortgage payments. It will cover a year's worth of gasoline for two \ncars. It will cover the cost of a year's tuition at many of the \ncommunity colleges. It will cover the cost of groceries for 4 months \nfor many people in my State.\n  Most importantly, President Bush and the Republican Congress trust \nthe American people themselves to spend their own money as they see \nfit.\n  President Bush's tax relief will simplify the code while providing \nrelief for all Americans. That is another place where we have a huge \nburden: The amount of time that it takes to get the information \ntogether to see if you owe or if the country is going to give you back \nsome of what you paid.\n  This plan replaces the current five rates with four lower rates of \n10, 15, 25, and 33 percent. As such, this tax rebate legislation takes \nan important step in simplifying our terribly complex code, while \nallowing all taxpayers to keep more of their own money.\n  Instead of attempting to pick winners and losers--beware of the tax \nplan that starts out with: Don't give any money to the rich; just give \nit to the poor. You will find that under the definition of ``rich,'' \nanyone who pays taxes is considered rich and will not get money back. \nWatch the wording. Watch the details.\n  We cannot have a bill that attempts to pick winners and losers and \nmakes tax relief a lottery, particularly including those who do not \npay.\n  The President's tax plan honors the contribution of all Americans and \nrecognizes they can spend their own money better than the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In addition to a simplified lower tax structure, President Bush's tax \nproposal will benefit families by doubling the child credit from $500 \nper year to $1,000 a year. It lowers the marriage penalty. It kills the \ndeath tax.\n  This is a tax policy that puts its money where its mouth is. The \ncurrent Tax Code punishes marriages and savings. The Bush proposal \nrewards marriage, rewards parents, rewards savings. This plan \nrecognizes the enormous burdens that many parents are under and \nprovides some hard-earned relief for each and every taxpaying family in \nthe United States by returning to them part of the tax overcharge that \nhas made this historical surplus possible.\n  While this tax relief proposal will benefit all taxpaying Americans, \nit especially helps middle-class families who are the backbone of our \neconomy. Those receiving the largest percentage reduction in their \nFederal income taxes will be those in the middle class.\n  For example, a family of four earning $75,000 a year will see their \nFederal taxes reduced by 25 percent. The same family of four earning \n$50,000 a year will benefit from a 50-percent reduction. If a family of \nfour earns $35,000 a year, they will pay no Federal income taxes under \nPresident Bush's proposal.\n  This tax proposal is part of a three-prong strategy to save Social \nSecurity, pay down the debt, and return a portion of the tax \noverpayment to the people responsible for it: the American taxpayers.\n  For decades, the Democrat-controlled Congress spent the Social \nSecurity surplus on a variety of programs. Under a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress, the Social Security surplus is being protected so \nthat it will be there for present and future retirees. It is now time \nto return a portion of the non-Social Security tax overcharge to the \nAmerican people.\n  There are those on the Democratic side of the aisle who say we cannot \nafford tax relief for Americans because we need to spend the money to \npay down the Federal debt. If I really thought they were serious about \nthis, I would be more inclined to listen. The problem is, in the 4 \nyears I have been here, I have not seen their actions back up this \nrhetoric.\n  I have been working with my colleagues, primarily Senator Allard and \nSenator Voinovich, to actually implement a policy that ensures we pay \noff the entire publicly held debt regardless of whether all the budget \nsurplus numbers materialize. We have tried at least six different \napproaches. Guess how many Democratic cosponsors we have had on any of \nthose proposals? Zero.\n  Our Democratic friends love to talk about debt reduction, but when it \ncomes time to vote on a tax cut, when it comes time to vote on debt \nreduction, their enthusiasm disappears as soon as the next \nappropriations bill hits this floor; and they envision 1,000 ways to \nspend that same surplus. They say: Don't lock us into $1.6 trillion of \ntax relief. Don't lock us into that.\n  Do you know what spending does? Spending locks the American taxpayer \ninto an eternal debt. Do you ever see us stop a program? Do you ever \nsee us hold a program at the same level? Every program continues; every \nprogram gets an increase.\n  We talk about how the cost of living is going up, and we better spend \nmore on that program to cover the additional costs of that program for \nthe cost of living. Then we expect to increase it on the basis of \nwhether it is a good program. The evaluation isn't whether it is good \nor bad. We lock things in. Every time a dime of the American taxpayer's \nmoney is spent on a new program, that dime is obligated, year in and \nyear out, for their generation and generations to come.\n  Tax relief isn't locked in quite that well, as people have noticed \nwhen they have had their taxes raised in previous years.\n  A tax raise can happen. Tax raises happen more often than spending \ncuts. So don't talk about locking in a tax cut, particularly with the \nhope of being able to put it into new programs.\n  There is also talk about the need to reduce payroll taxes. The Bush \nplan reduces payroll taxes. It reduces that portion of the payroll \ntaxes that are income taxes. It does not yet deal with that portion of \nthe payroll tax that is Social Security or Medicare. Those are two \nprograms funded separate from the Federal income tax. Those are two \nprograms that must be reformed. To make statements on the floor that we \nare going to reduce those payroll taxes without putting reform in place \nsays that we do not care about the future of Social Security and \nMedicare. We do. We need the reform. The payroll taxes that are \ninvolved with Medicare and Social Security have to be taken into \nconsideration as part of that reform.\n  And the rich versus poor: That is an attempt to start class warfare. \nThe idea is to relieve the tax burden of every taxpayer.\n  You will see things thrown into the rhetoric that will give tax \nrelief to those who do not pay taxes. To me, the surplus is a tax \novercharge. That is like going to the store and buying something and \nbeing overcharged.\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n When that happens--and somebody discovers it, and somebody is honest \nenough to pay that back--I kind of expect them to pay it back to me. I \ndo not expect them to pay it back to somebody who just happened to walk \nthrough the store. That is what we are talking about with some of the \nproposals that are being put out there.\n  We need to remember that the surplus is not some magical pot of money \ncreated by those in Washington. It is an overpayment of taxes by the \nAmerican people. It is only fair that we return a portion of that \novercharge to those who gave us this surplus in the first place.\n  My experience has been that if we do not give a large portion of this \nsurplus back, we will see it disappear in the waning days of this \nCongress, as we feed the unquenchable appetite of the ravenous \nappropriations bills. How does that affect you? When we are voting on \nappropriations, we are spending a very small part of the American \ntaxpayer's money on each and every proposal. I think the American \ntaxpayer realizes, if you spend enough quarters, you have used all of \ntheir tax money. That is about what they put into a program--25 cents. \nSome people are more than willing to put 25 cents into a new program. \nBut they ought to be able to pick which programs themselves and not \nrely on the beneficence or the unique knowledge that 100 of us have \nhere and 435 have on the other end of the building. If they want to \ngive, they should be able to give. They should get credit for giving, \nbut they should be able to select what they want to give. They should \nbe able to select what they want to buy. That is what the tax package \ndoes.\n\n  We also have a unique opportunity to simplify. Complexity is a tax \nburden. It is a tax burden for individuals. That is the No. 1 thing the \nNational Taxpayer Advocates have pointed out: Complexity is the No. 1 \nproblem. The No. 2 problem is complexity for small business, where a \nlot of individuals are trying to earn a living out there.\n  It is time to ax the tax and cut the burden down to size. We do need \ntax relief, and we need it now. President Bush's tax proposal is fair, \nresponsible, and will benefit all American taxpayers. This tax plan \nwill create jobs, it will spur economic growth, it will mean jobs for \nus and our kids, and it will support families in the essential task of \nraising children.\n  Let's return the tax overcharge and give the American people tax \nrelief now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Wyoming \nfor his very strong, clear, and forceful statement supporting tax \nrelief for the American people.

Mr. President, I also applaud President Bush for his \nleadership on the tax relief issue. He has come forward with a plan \nthat I think will have the support of the American people and will \nprovide them much needed relief.\n  Senator Enzi very correctly called the huge surplus that is projected \nover the next 10 years a tax overcharge. That is precisely what it is. \nThe CBO has estimated the Federal surplus will total $5.6 trillion over \nthe next 10 years. Setting aside Social Security surplus revenues, the \nFederal surplus will total $3.1 trillion. So if you take away the \nSocial Security--put it in that lockbox--you still have $3.1 trillion \nover that same period.\n  Our country and our Government has experienced a surplus for the last \n3 years running, and we have paid down the national debt now by over \n$363 billion. It is clear, we have to continue that path of fiscal \nresponsibility. We have paid down the public debt $363 billion.\n  President Bush has pointed to a very real problem that exists, and \nthat is the increase in personal debt, consumer debt, in this Nation. \nOne of the imperatives for providing tax relief to low- and middle-\nincome working Americans is that that increasing personal debt, \nconsumer debt, in this country can be addressed while we simultaneously \naddress the problem of the national debt.\n  The Government also has an obligation to the American taxpayer who is \nnow paying more in taxes than the Government is spending every year. \nThe Federal tax burden is the highest ever during our peacetime \nhistory. Americans, as Senator Enzi pointed out, pay more in taxes than \nthey spend on food, clothing, and housing.\n  Instead of growing Government bureaucracies, and devising new Federal \nprograms on which to spend that surplus, it is incumbent on Congress to \ngive taxpayers back some of the money they have overpaid because it is, \nin fact, their money.\n  President George W. Bush has proposed that we give back about one-\nquarter of the projected surplus, which allows us to pay down the \nnational debt, protect Medicare, and ensure the viability of Social \nSecurity, and not touch the Social Security trust fund--all at the same \ntime--and give back to the American people one-quarter of the tax \novercharge, of the surplus.\n  I think that is extremely prudent. It is a smaller tax relief package \nthan that which was proposed under President Reagan a number of years \nago.\n  If, in fact, we do not return that money to the American people, the \ntemptation will be so great in Washington, DC, that we will most \nassuredly spend it; every day politicians are devising means by which \nwe can spend that surplus. So while you will hear those who are opposed \nto broad-based tax relief, no one will say they are opposed to tax cuts \ncompletely. They are all couching it and saying: I favor tax relief, \nbut we want to target it to those who need it most.\n  That is Washington-speak for those who really don't want to provide \ntax relief for every taxpayer and who really believe that wisdom \nresides within the District of Columbia and that we can better decide \nwhere those precious resources should be expended than the American \npeople.\n  The fundamental question is, when it comes to a tax relief package: \nWhom do you trust more? Do you trust the American people? Do you trust \nAmerican families or do you believe that it is wiser and smarter for us \nto collect the tax revenues and then, in our sense of priorities, \ndecide where those revenues will go?\n  We can prevent the tax relief debate from degenerating into a class \nwarfare debate, and we can keep the focus on: Whom do you really trust, \ndo you want to return the surplus to the American people, or do you \nwant to keep it in Washington where we will divide it up and decide who \nare the winners and who are the losers and what programs should be \nstarted and what programs should be increased? That will be the debate \nwe ought to have before the American people, and on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  President Bush has a number of key reforms in the plan with which he \nhas come forward. He replaces the current five-rate tax structure with \nfour lower rates--10, 15, 25, and 33.\n  I agree with George W. Bush: No American taxpayer should be required \nto give more than one-third of their income in Federal income taxes.\n  There was a time, back before Ronald Reagan was elected President, \nwhen the top rate for some Americans was 70 percent. That was obscene. \nFrankly, 33 percent is too high. No American ought to pay more than a \nthird of their income in Federal taxes. President Bush simplifies it by \nreplacing the five-rate tax structure with four lower rates.\n  The most common complaint about the current Tax Code is its \ncomplexity. While this isn't a panacea and it is not going to fix all \nof the problems in the Tax Code, at least it is a step toward greater \nsimplification. I applaud that. It doubles the child tax credit to \n$1,000. I was the original sponsor, when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, of the $500-per-child tax credit which eventually was \nsigned into law. President Bush says we must go further; we need to \ndouble that $500-per-child tax credit. He is right.\n  Americans who have the greatest burden from our tax system are those\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\nwho are trying to rear their children, trying to pay for their clothes, \ntrying to keep food on the table, and trying to plan for college \ntuition. Those Americans facing the greatest economic challenges \ndeserve that commitment to the American family that the child tax \ncredit provides.\n  When the per-child deduction was originally passed and put into the \nTax Code, the goal was, the statement was, that our Tax Code was to say \nfamilies are important. And they are important. But over time, the \neffects of inflation so eroded tax deduction that it became less than \nsignificant. The $500-per-child tax credit is a move in the right \ndirection, and doubling it, as President Bush has proposed, is a big \nstep in providing relief for American families. He reduces the marriage \npenalty. And he eliminates the death tax altogether.\n\n  This has been an effort of Senators and Congress men and women on \nboth sides of the aisle for years. It is a provision in our Tax Code \nthat is widely recognized as being inequitable and anti-American: \nPenalizing savings, penalizing investments, penalizing the American \ndream of passing on part of what you accumulate in your life to your \nchildren and to your grandchildren. I applaud the fact that that death \ntax would be pulled up by the roots to no longer be a part of our \nAmerican tax system.\n  He expands the charitable tax deduction. This is very much needed as \npart of the faith-based initiative the President came forward with and \nwill unleash charitable giving in this country.\n  Contrary to the claims of critics that the Bush plan only benefits \nthe rich, in fact low- and middle-income families will receive the \ngreatest reduction in the amount of taxes they must pay each year \nrelative to their income.\n  There are going to be a lot of linguistic games played. It is true \nthat those in higher income brackets may see a greater relief in terms \nof dollars because 5 percent of wage earners in this country pay 40 \npercent of the taxes. Even though President Bush's plan is highly \nprogressive, it is going to benefit low- and middle-income taxpayers \nmore in percentage terms, in raw dollar terms, because they pay so much \nmore of the tax revenues of this country, they will receive more of the \nbenefit. But every American taxpayer will receive relief. And those in \nlow- and middle-income brackets are going to receive the highest \npercentage of relief relative to their income.\n  A family of four making $50,000 a year would receive a 50-percent tax \ncut, which means an extra $1,600 in their pockets every year, enough \nmoney to pay the average monthly mortgage payment, depending upon where \nyou live, or several months' worth of grocery bills for an average \nfamily. A family of four making $75,000 a year would receive a 25-\npercent tax cut, and a family of four making $35,000 a year would have \na 100-percent tax reduction.\n  Yet you will hear time and time again echoed on the floor of this \nbody, as we debate this issue in the coming weeks, that this is a tax \ncut for the rich. You tell that to the family making $35,000 a year who \nwill owe zero in their Federal tax liability; you tell that to the \nfamily of four making $50,000 a year who will see their tax burden cut \nin half, that this is a tax break for the rich.\n  President Bush's tax plan would use approximately one-fourth of the \nsurplus for tax relief while reserving a portion for debt reduction, \nMedicare, and for Social Security preservation. The Bush plan would \ndecrease total Federal revenue by no more than 6.2 percent each year.\n  By comparison, President Reagan's tax plan reduced Federal revenues \nby over 18 percent. My favorite Democrat, President Kennedy's tax \nproposal would have cut Federal revenue by over 12 percent. He saw the \nvalue of what tax relief would mean not only to the American people but \nto the economy itself.\n  President Bush is proposing fair and responsible tax relief. The \nsurplus doesn't belong to the Federal Government; it belongs to the \nhard-working Americans who pay taxes every year. I wholeheartedly \nsupport the President's plan and look forward to seeing it passed very \nmuch intact.\n  May I inquire, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to take a few minutes to \nrecognize the contributions of a patriot, a leader, and a good friend \nof this institution who has departed Government service to return to \nlife as a private citizen.\n  During, his 4-year tenure as Under Secretary, Acting Secretary, and \nSecretary of the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters had led his service to \nnew heights of achievement, and the world is better for it. At a time \nwhen the global security environment became less predictable with each \npassing day, Whit Peters understood the need for the Air Force to \nbecome more responsive, more versatile, and more powerful--all at the \nsame time. With boundless energy and enthusiasm, he set out to help the \nU.S. Air Force do those things and more.\n  As the leading architect of aerospace power, Whit Peters drove a \nfundamental re-examination of the relationship between air, space, and \ninformation systems. As a result, the cold war Air Force he inherited \nis well on its way to becoming a modern, integrated aerospace force, \ndesigned to meet the challenges of a new millennium.\n  During Secretary Peters' tenure, in the troubled skies over Serbia, a \nwar was won using the strengths of our military--and we did it without \nlosing a single American to enemy action.\n  Today, despots and dictators hesitate to act because they know \nAmerica's Air Force can bring power to bear at the point of decision in \na matter of minutes or hours. And, millions of people, the world over, \nlive better lives because of the humanitarian missions undertaken by \nour U.S. Air Force in the last 4 years.\n  While busy guiding the evolution of the Air Force's operational \ncapabilities, Secretary Peters also directed significant improvements \nin acquisition, logistics, and sustainment programs to ensure the best \npossible use of defense resources. He presided over the development of \nthe Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle--a revolutionary pairing of \nRussian propulsion technology with the best United States commercial \nspace-launch capabilities--which will drastically lower the cost of \nplacing commercial and defense payloads in earth orbit. He led the \nconsolidation of five Air Force aircraft depots into three, reducing \ndepot over-capacity by 40 percent and saving the taxpayers over $377 \nmillion a year. And, he arrested a 10-year drop in aircraft readiness \nrates by putting 2 billion dollars' worth of additional spares on the \nshelf where they will be useful to aircraft maintainers. He was \ninstrumental on an issue critical to my home State of Arkansas--his \ncommitment secured Little Rock Air Force Base as the Nation's C-130 \nschoolhouse and the Center of Excellence for future generations.\n  Most important, Whit Peters took care of his people. As every Member \nof this body knows, he fought hard for improved pay, housing, and \nmedical benefits for every member of America's Air Force. He fought for \nbetter re-enlistment bonuses for people in hard-to-fill skills such as \nair traffic control, computer network administration, and over a \nhundred others. He pushed relentlessly for better child-care facilities \nto meet the demands of working families, and today 95 percent of all \nAir Force child care centers meet federal accreditation standards, \ncompared to just 10 percent of child care facilities nationwide.\n  No wonder the enlisted men and women of the Air Force honored him \nwith their most prestigious recognition: Induction into the Air Force \nOrder of the Sword. In the 53-year history of America's youngest \nservice, no other Air Force Secretary has even been so honored. Nor has \nany service secretary been so respected by the men and women he leads.\n  Like the men and women of the Total Air Force--the Air National \nGuard, the Air Force Reserve, and the Regular Air Force--we hate to see \nWhit Peters go, and I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him \nthe fondest of farewells. I have rarely known someone with greater \ncommitment, greater work ethic, or a greater zeal for life than Whit \nPeters displayed. He is a rare\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nleader and an even rarer person in this town: a true gentleman who \ncares more about others than himself. As the Air Force slogan says, \n``No one comes close.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, before I say anything about how necessary \nI believe the President's tax cut is at this time in our Nation's \nhistory, I want to also point out to my colleagues on the Senate floor \nanother way we can save dollars, save on Government expenditures, \nanother way we can make money available for tax cuts, another way we \ncan begin to do more to pay down the debt: voluntarism. Senators who \nare here in this body are going to have a great opportunity on March 7 \nto volunteer for a very worthwhile project, Habitat for Humanity. \nMembers of the Senate are sponsoring a home, where staffs, spouses, and \nMembers of the Senate can actually go out and help construct a home for \na family who is struggling and needs assistance. This is an excellent \nalternative to a Federal program. I encourage Members of the Senate to \nparticipate in this volunteer program.\n  I am also pleased to join my colleagues in the Senate in calling for \ntax cuts for all Americans. I support tax cuts for the people who work \nhard every day. Everyone paying taxes should receive tax relief. I \nagree with my colleague from Arkansas who earlier spoke very eloquently \nabout the need for tax cuts, that people have a better idea how they \nwould like to spend their dollars than any bureaucrat in Washington or \nany Member of this Senate. I think it is time we have a tax cut now \nthat we have unprecedented revenues coming into the Federal Government.\n  Many people I see here on the floor arguing against tax cuts, \nwillingly and excitedly spend more money in the appropriations process. \nTheir argument against tax cuts is that we need to have the money to \npay down the debt. But when we get toward the end of the session, we \nhave a spending binge. In the final 6 months of last year, we spent \n$561 billion--the biggest tax spending binge in this country's history \nin peacetime. I don't think we should allow that to happen because in \nthe long-term we are dealing with some very big liabilities. To \nincrease programs and increase spending at this time just means it is \ngoing to get worse. We should work to pay down the debt, and we did a \ngood job toward paying down the debt. Ninety percent of our surplus \nwent toward debt repayment last year. I am proud of our efforts in \ndoing that.\n  I think the other solution is that we need to have a tax cut. We need \na plan to pay down the debt, and we need to have a plan to reduce the \ntax burden on the American people. I happen to agree with what the \nPresident recently said, that we need to make tax cuts retroactive. Why \nnot? In the past, Congress has instituted tax increases and made them \nretroactive. So if we see a need to keep the economy from slowing down \ntoo much, or if we have excess surpluses, then I think we ought to go \nahead and have tax cuts that are actually retroactive rather than \nincrease spending.\n  We frequently discuss the budget surplus, and I believe it is \nactually more accurate--and I want to emphasize this--to talk about it \nas a tax surplus. The surplus represents an overpayment by taxpayers. \nThese overassessed taxpayers should not have to send the money to \nWashington in the first place. My colleague from Arkansas pointed out \nthat it gets distributed on the whims and wishes of the bureaucracy and \nMembers of the Congress. I think it is better to empower local \ntaxpayers to spend that money as they see fit. Allowing people to keep \ntheir own money makes sense to me. They are in a better position to \nknow what they need. I believe in people's priorities, not Washington \npriorities.\n\n  Rather than addressing the basic question of whom we should trust \nwith the taxpayers' money--the taxpayers or Washington--some have \nattempted to shift the focus, claiming they can't afford tax cuts. In \nfact, tax cuts don't jeopardize debt repayment or the Government's \nother obligations.\n  I think my record here on the Senate floor is clear. I am known as a \nbudget and debt repayment hawk. I want to see the debt paid down as \nfast as possible. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a \nrecent Budget Committee hearing, which I attended, that based on the \ncurrent projections, there is room in the surplus for both debt \nrepayment and a tax cut. He stated repeatedly before many different \ncommittees that the least desirable option is to use surplus money for \nnew spending--exactly what the Congress did in the final 6 months of \nthe last Congress.\n  On July 1, 2001, CBO delivered an encouraging fiscal forecast. They \nsaw that the foreseeable budget surplus would allow the Government to \nreturn a major portion of the surplus to its rightful owners. That \nmeans a tax cut. They saw that the surplus would allow continued \nefforts to pay down our national debt. It continues to make good on a \nRepublican promise to protect the Social Security surplus.\n  To put it simply, CBO's baseline assumptions for 2001 to 2011 project \nsurpluses large enough to allow the Federal Government to retire all \navailable debt held by the public.\n  Surpluses from this year through 2011 are projected to approach \nbetween $5.6 trillion and $6 trillion--nearly four times the amount \nneeded to fund the Bush tax cut.\n  The Bush tax cut plan is an important first step towards returning \nthe tax surplus by lowering taxes. It will mean on the average $1,600 \nmore for each American family. That is real money. It can be used for \nsuch things as buying a home, paying for a college education, \npurchasing a computer to help kids in school, buying a car, or paying \nthe energy bill.\n  I support the Bush tax cut because it offers real tax relief for \nevery American taxpayer.\n  First, the Bush plan cuts and simplifies the current tax rate \nstructure. Rather than five marginal tax rates President Bush proposes \nfour new, lower rates. In effect, this simplifies the Tax Code and also \nprovides tax relief where it is really needed. I think that all \ntaxpayers should have a tax break. The current tax rate brackets, which \nrun from 15 percent to 39.6 percent, will be replaced by four new \nbrackets at 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, and 33 percent. Those \nat the lower end will receive the highest percentage of relief. I want \nto repeat that. Those at the lower end--that is the 10 percent range--\nwill receive the highest percentage of relief. In fact, one in five \ntaxpaying families with children will no longer pay any tax at all. \nThis means 6 million families will receive complete tax relief.\n  The Bush tax cut will also provide important tax relief for families \nby reducing the marriage tax penalty.\n  In meeting with my constituents at town meetings, I have heard \nrepeatedly that the people of Colorado want marriage penalty relief. I \nam one who takes my responsibilities seriously, and I hold a town \nmeeting in every county in Colorado every year. You can imagine how \nmany people stood up and made that very important statement on behalf \nof their family.\n  The statistics show why. In the State of Colorado, over 400,000 \ncouples pay additional, unfair taxes simply because they are married. \nNationally, this amounts to more than 21 million couples paying on \naverage another $1,400 per year in taxes; again, just because they are \nmarried.\n  The Bush tax cut will go a long way towards eliminating this \ndisparity.\n  The penalty runs counter, in my view, to common sense. Marriage is a \npractice that should be encouraged rather than discouraged.\n  This penalty really hits young married couples hard. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Housing, I am constantly reminded of the increasing \nscarcity of affordable housing for young couples. This tax relief would \ngo a long way towards helping working families afford a home.\n  President Bush also proposed that the child tax credit be doubled \nfrom $500 per child to $1,000 per child.\n  Again, this is money in the pocket of hard-working American \nfamilies--particularly young American families just\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\ngetting started. Undoubtedly, it would be especially helpful to lower \nincome families.\n  I am particularly pleased to support the provision to eliminate the \ndeath tax. I share the President's belief that the tax should be \neliminated. I have already introduced legislation to do just that, as \nhave a number of other Members in the Senate.\n  The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in the \nworld, and top estate tax rates can reach over 55 percent. This is \nmoney that was already taxed when it was earned. Frankly, the estate \ntax--or death tax--can destroy a family business. This has been called \nto my attention a number of times in the State of Colorado. One of the \nmore recent examples happens to be a ranch in the Aspen area--a pretty \naffluent area experiencing a lot of growth.\n  A family happened to have an unexpected death. They had to sell off \nthe family ranch to pay the estate tax. As a result, open space will be \ndeveloped, contrary to what many people in that area wanted to see \nhappen. They wanted to see more open space instead of more development.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would certainly benefit the economy. Without \nthe estate tax, greater business resources can be put toward productive \neconomic activity.\n  I think the President's proposal to expand education savings accounts \nwill also give parents more flexibility in determining what is best for \ntheir children.\n  There is a lot more to the President's tax plan. But the fact is that \nI do think we need to move forward. Americans are spending more than \never on taxes, and we need to reduce that tax burden.\n  I strongly support the President's comments that we should make it \nretroactive. In other words, we ought to address the problem now and \nnot wait. I offer my strong endorsement of the President's proposed tax \ncut, and I look forward to a swift enactment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about President \nBush's tax relief plan and what I hope will be congressional approval \nof tax relief for hard-working Americans.\n  It is very clear we are going to have a bigger surplus than we ever \neven dreamed would be possible when we passed the Balanced Budget Act. \nIt is estimated now at $5.6 trillion. The President's plan takes \napproximately 25 percent of this huge surplus and says the people \ndeserve to keep more of their money. This is an income tax surplus. \nPeople are sending more to Washington than Washington needs to do its \nresponsibility to cover the costs of Government, to the tune of $5.6 \ntrillion. Doesn't it make sense to cut back on the amount people have \nto send to Washington? We think so.\n  The President's plan gives a tax cut to every American who is paying \ntaxes. It replaces the current five-rate tax structure with four lower \nrates: 10, 15, 25, and 33. It doubles the child tax credit to $1,000, \nreduces the marriage penalty, which we have been trying to do now for 4 \nyears, eliminates the death tax, expands the charitable tax deduction, \nand makes the research and development tax credit permanent.\n  What happens when this is passed? Who are the biggest winners? One in \nfive taxpaying families with children will no longer pay any income tax \nat all. One in every five families who pay taxes and have children will \npay no income tax. It will remove 6 million American families from the \ntax rolls. A family of four making $35,000 will get a 100-percent \nFederal income tax cut. A family of four making $50,000 a year will \nreceive a 50-percent tax cut, receiving at least $1,600 in tax relief. \nA family of four making $75,000 a year will receive a 25-percent tax \ncut. The marginal income tax rate on low-income families will fall by \nmore than 40 percent. That is the effect this tax relief will have on \nAmerican families.\n  The current code is not fair, and it is taking too much. What we need \nis balance in our system. What this approach will do is pay down the \ndebt, protect Social Security, increase spending for priority needs, \nand give hard-working Americans more in their pocketbook.\n  Mr. President, you are going to hear a lot more about this in future \nmonths because I believe Congress is going to work with the President \nto give the tax relief he is seeking. I look forward to the discussion \nbecause I cannot think of any reason hard-working Americans should not \nhave the money they earn in their pocketbooks rather than sending it to \nWashington for a program of which they have never heard.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, during the last hour and a half Senators have come to \nthe floor to talk about the President's proposed tax cuts. Of course, \nwe are all interested in finding out what the details are on that tax \ncut because it is true, the devil is in the details. We need to know \nexactly what the President is proposing, the impact it will have on our \nbudget, first, certainly on our economy, and on the families of this \nNation.\n  I guess two of the most magic words for politicians are ``tax cut.'' \nCan you think of anything more popular to say to an audience? I think \nwe have learned over history that if you just focus on the term ``tax \ncut,'' and you do not fill in the details, you can find yourself in a \npretty terrible predicament.\n  When President Reagan was elected in 1980, he was dedicated to a tax \ncut. He said that was the highest single priority. Of course, he \nenacted that tax cut. We all understand what happened after that tax \ncut was enacted. We totaled up the biggest run of deficits in the \nhistory of the United States. We created such a monster that many of my \nRepublican friends who were faithful supporters of President Reagan \ncame to the floor and said: We are going to have to amend the \nConstitution now; there is no other way to stop this mess between the \nPresident and Congress; we have to give the Federal courts the \nauthority through a constitutional amendment to stop Congress from \nspending and stop the President from spending.\n  Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed. Leadership came on the scene \nthat changed the dynamics of this debate dramatically. In 1993, under \nPresident Clinton, we passed a deficit budget reduction plan, and \nseveral years later we passed a bipartisan plan. Between the two of \nthem, we have finally reached the point in our history where we are no \nlonger laboring with annual deficits adding to the national debt but we \nare dealing with surpluses.\n\n  The obvious question is, What is the responsible thing to do?\n  First we have to ask ourself this question: How big is the surplus? \nHow much money do we have to spend either on tax cuts or for programs \nor for some other purpose? I have to say, quite honestly, that is where \nI have some difficulty with this whole debate.\n  Let me give one illustration. Seventy percent of all the surplus we \nare talking about for tax cuts does not appear for 5 years. Thirty \npercent of it starts to show, but then 70 percent of it is in the last \n5 years of the economists' estimates.\n  Think about that for a second. We are pinning our hopes on \nstatistical projections starting 5 years from now as to what America is \ngoing to look like, what the economy is going to look like.\n  I have a very limited education in economics, and I do not consider \nmyself an expert, but I will tell you, I have worked with some of the \nreal experts on economics here in Washington, and they miss by a \ncountry mile trying to guess where we are going to be 5 months from \nnow, let alone 5 years or 10 years from now.\n  Allow me to use one example. If the 5-year projection is where we \nreally start coming into surpluses, it is reasonable to step back and \nask: What were the economists in America saying 5 years ago about \ntoday? Let's take a look.\n  They projected that today in America we would be running a $320 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\ndeficit. Guess what. They were wrong. We are running a $270 billion \nsurplus. They missed it by $590 billion 5 years ago. They did not have \na clue. They were clearly guessing based on assumptions that were just \nplain wrong.\n  I think one can understand the skepticism of many of us who say, if \nwe are going to build on America's future, let us do it with \nassumptions that are honest, that are accurate, and on which we can \ncount. When one starts off with the premise that we are going to have \nthis fantastic surplus 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years from now, I say take \ncare, be careful, because if we are wrong, if we commit ourselves to \nspending tax cuts we cannot cover, we will find ourselves not only \nputting our toe but our whole leg back into that red-ink deficit pool. \nI do not want to see that happen.\n  Keep in mind, the mortgage we now have on America, our national debt, \nis substantial. We owe over $5.7 trillion for things we have done in \nthe past--roads we have built, decisions we have made, programs we have \nfunded. That $5.7 trillion national debt costs American families, \nbusinesses, and individual taxpayers $1 billion a day in interest. We \ncollect that much in your taxes and mine to pay interest on old debt. \nThat $1 billion a day does not educate a child, does not buy a computer \nfor a school, does not provide a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare to a soul in America, nor does it buy us a new tank, a new \nplane, or pay for a new soldier--nothing. It is money paid on interest \nservicing old debt.\n  I believe if we have any surplus, the first thing we should dedicate \nit to is eliminating the national debt. Can you think of a better thing \nto leave our children than to say to them: We paid off our mortgage, \nkids; it's your America; dream your dreams and you won't be saddled \nwith our debt. It seems pretty basic to me.\n\n  Will there be room for a tax cut if we do that? I think there will \nbe, but I think we ought to take care that that tax cut is one that \nmakes sense. This is where Democrats and Republicans really part \ncompany. I am sorry we get back to this debate, but the President made \nhis choice, and now we will return to that debate: Who deserves a tax \ncut in this country? If we want to pick out a group of Americans who \nreally need a helping hand in reduced taxes, where should we turn \nfirst?\n  Forty-three percent of the tax cut that President Bush is proposing \ngoes to the top 1 percent income earners in this country, people making \nover $300,000 a year. Take a look at this chart which gives an idea \nabout what I am talking. This is President Bush's tax plan and the \nimpact it has on people in different income categories in America.\n  The top 1-percent income--people making over $300,000 a year, \nincidentally, have an average income of $915,000. For people who are \nmaking over $25,000 a month in income, the President wants to give them \n$46,000 in tax cuts.\n  Then take a look down the list at how this number starts diminishing \nas you get closer to working families and middle-income families. It \nstarts off with $42 for those in the lowest income categories, the \nlowest 20 percent. It goes up to $187 if you are making $24,000; $453 a \nyear if you are making $39,000 or less.\n  What a disparity: That if we are going to give a tax cut in America \nto the people most deserving, the people who need the most help, it is \nthose who are making over $300,000 a year.\n  Yesterday at a press conference in Springfield, IL, about an issue \nthat is near and dear to people in Springfield, IL, and I think \nnationally--it goes back to a telephone call I received a month or so \nago from my consumer advocate in Illinois. Her name is Loretta Durbin. \nShe is my wife. She called me and said: I just got the gas bill, \nSenator. What is going on here?\n  People across America are getting heating bills and electric bills \nthat are absolutely stopping them in their tracks. These are working \nfamilies, by and large, who have seen their bills doubled and tripled, \nand they are calling my office and saying: What can you do to help us?\n  There is a limited amount we can do, but one thing we can consider \nand I support is providing some tax relief to these families struggling \nto pay their heating bills. I do not think that is an unreasonable \nidea. Senator Harkin has a proposal, which I think makes sense, to give \na tax credit to people for the increase in their heating bills over \nthis last year. Do you know what the people are going to do with it? \nThey will pay their bills or they will replenish their savings \naccounts, or they will decide, yes, we can go ahead and make an \nimportant purchase for our family. I think that is the kind of tax cut \nthat really is reasonable in America.\n\n  Can you imagine the people making over $25,000 a month having \nhusbands calling wives, saying: Our heating bill is up to $400 this \nmonth. I don't think so.\n  But I can tell you, if you are making $25,000 a year, a $400 heating \nbill, or more, is something of which you would take notice. That is why \nI hope if there is going to be a tax cut, that it be sensible, based on \nthe real surplus, and that it be after we have dedicated funds to \nbringing down this national debt, the debt that costs us so much, and \nraises interest rates on everything across America and, finally, a tax \ncut that really zeros in on the people who need it the most.\n  I am worried, too, that the President's proposal, when you take a \nlook at it, takes 85 percent of our surplus and dedicates it to a tax \ncut, leaving precious little for things which we value.\n  I just left a meeting of the heads of Illinois school boards. I think \nthose are some of the best public servants in America, people who serve \non school boards. It is a tough job. In Illinois, they are trying to \nmake sure they serve the needs of the children. And, of course, they \nare responsible to the taxpayers. They have talked to me about the \nneeds of education in my State, which would be the same in many other \nStates: crumbling schools, areas where they need new schools, teachers \nneeding training, schools that have a hookup now to the Internet but \nneed new computers and new access to new technology. They are saying to \nme: Senator, if there is a surplus, for goodness' sake, can't we have a \npiece of this for education? Isn't that important to our Nation? I \nthink it is. But if you take 85 percent of our surplus and spend it on \ntax cuts, it leaves so little to consider any money for education.\n  In the last campaign, both candidates talked about a prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare. We know what seniors are facing now in \ntrying to pay for their drug bills. We have not had a conversation \nabout this in 3 or 4 months. Since all of the hoopla of November 7, \npeople have not talked about it. But President Bush does not leave the \nmoney aside to take care of that necessity, as far as I am concerned, \nfor seniors and disabled people.\n  There are important programs in education, in health, and in national \ndefense that will cost us as a nation. I think we have to be prepared \nto look at the surplus honestly, to make certain if there is a tax cut, \nit is fair, and to make certain that we do keep money aside for \nimportant national priorities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1042-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time for debate \non the nomination shall be limited to 2 hours equally divided between \nthe chairman, Mr. Grassley, and the ranking member, Mr. Baucus.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today we are taking up the nomination of Robert Zoellick to be United \nStates Trade Representative. Mr. Zoellick appeared before the Finance \nCommittee exactly one week ago, and I am pleased that we have been able \nto schedule this vote so quickly. I support this nomination, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join in supporting his confirmation at the end of this \ndebate.\n  Trade has never been as important to the American economy as it is \ntoday. The import and export of goods and services is equivalent to 27 \npercent of America's gross domestic product, as compared to only 11 \npercent in 1970. Opening and expanding markets around the world for our \nmanufactured goods, our agricultural commodities, and our services is \ncritical for our economy to grow and for the creation of good quality \njobs at home. Expanded trade is also critical for global economic \ngrowth.\n  For that reason, I was very pleased that President Bush, when \nannouncing the selection of Robert Zoellick to be USTR, stressed that \nMr. Zoellick would be a member of the Cabinet and would report directly \nto the President. Trade must have a prominent and equal place at the \ntable when we make decisions about our Nation's global affairs.\n  Last year, the Congress and the Administration worked together on \ntrade policy. We had a number of significant accomplishments. We passed \na bill to extend permanent normal trade relations status to China, \nPNTR, once it accedes to the WTO, a monumental achievement. We passed \nlegislation on expanding trade with Africa and enhancing CBI, the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative. We changed the structure of the Foreign \nSales Corporation. And we passed a Miscellaneous Tariffs Act.\n  This year, we have a full trade agenda. We must build on the progress \nwe made last year. We must make sure that we are not left behind as \nother nations make new trade arrangements with each other. Let me \nstress that our trade policy and our efforts at further trade \nliberalization must be carried out in the proper way.\n  Our first priority must be to rebuild the consensus on trade in this \ncountry. Further progress on trade liberalization and opening markets \nrequires a political consensus, and that means a public consensus. We \nmust demonstrate to all our citizens that trade and expanding markets \ncontribute to their prosperity. We must address legitimate labor and \nenvironmental concerns in our trade agreements. We must aggressively \nenforce our trade laws. And we must ensure that we provide new \nopportunities to those who have been left behind by globalization.\n  One focus of discussion during Mr. Zoellick's confirmation hearing \nwas whether it was appropriate to include labor and environmental \nissues in trade negotiations. In fact, this has dominated much of the \ntrade policy debate over the past decade.\n  I must confess to a good deal of frustration. Trade-related labor and \nenvironmental issues were addressed in NAFTA, the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, and in the U.S.-Jordan FTA. The United States \nconcluded a historic agreement with Cambodia in cooperation with the \nInternational Labor Organization that tied increased access to the \nUnited States market to Cambodian observance of basic labor rights. Our \nlaw on the Generalized System of Preferences, GSP, as well as the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative, CBI, also include labor provisions.\n  Labor and environmental issues were on track to be included in free \ntrade agreements with Singapore and Chile that the Clinton \nAdministration was negotiating in its closing days.\n  Labor and environmental issues have been discussed under the aegis of \nthe world trading system. In the last several years, a number of \nimportant WTO disputes have directly involved environmental matters. \nThe WTO has created a Committee on the Environment.\n  And the interest in labor and environment is not limited to the \nUnited States. In developing the European Union, the countries of \nEurope addressed these issues. As they work on their own free trade \narea, some of our neighbors in Latin America have also recognized the \nneed to address labor and the environment.\n  In short, like it or not, environment and labor issues are firmly on \nthe trade agenda. Unfortunately, at least in some circles, the debate \nin the United States goes on as if none of these things had happened, \nas if the issues will just go away if we do not talk about them.\n  I fear that a major reason for the disappearance of the public and \npolitical consensus in the United States is our refusal to acknowledge \nthese important issues. I don't pretend to know all the answers about \nhow to deal with these complex questions, but I do know that it is long \npast time for us to acknowledge them and to begin to address them.\n  For this reason, I have made it clear that I will vote against fast \ntrack trade negotiating authority, and work to defeat it, unless labor \nand environmental issues are meaningfully addressed.\n  I welcome the fact that, in his confirmation hearing, Mr. Zoellick \nexpressed a willingness to address these issues. In that spirit, let me \nissue a challenge to him and to the Bush Administration on three \nspecific labor and environmental issues related to trade.\n  First, I call on Mr. Zoellick to endorse the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement and work for prompt congressional passage. Among other \nprovisions, this agreement calls upon Jordan and the United States to \nadhere to their own labor and environmental laws. Because of this, the \nagreement has been endorsed by many labor and environmental groups.\n  Some have asserted that the Jordan agreement would open our labor and \nenvironmental laws to challenge or would block us from making any \nchange in our own laws. This is simply untrue.\n  The agreement only requires that each country enforce its own laws \nand not make changes designed to distort trade. The agreement states \nexplicitly that each country has the right to establish its own \ndomestic labor and environmental standards and laws.\n  I cannot imagine how these modest provisions can credibly be seen as \na threat. I can only conclude that those making the charges have not \nread the agreement. I refer them to the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  Second, I call on Mr. Zoellick to implement rigorously the Executive \nOrder requiring an environmental assessment of all trade agreements. \nThese assessments help to focus discussion, identify issues, and avoid \nneedless problems. We should be doing these assessments for all future \ntrade agreements.\n  Finally, I call on Mr. Zoellick to appoint an Assistant USTR for \nLabor. This position was created last year and has never been filled. A \ntrade official focused on labor could ensure that labor issues are not \nignored and serve as an important point of contact between our trade \nnegotiators and the labor community. This position should be filled \nbefore the April Ministerial meeting that will discuss the Free Trade \nArea for the Americas, the FTAA.\n  By taking these three steps, Mr. Zoellick and the Bush Administration \nwould demonstrate that the commitments to work together in a bipartisan \nfashion are real and not just rhetoric. It would help set the stage for \ngranting fast track authority and go a long way toward establishing \ntrust between the Congress and the administration on trade policy.\n  As Mr. Zoellick sends his deputies to the Finance Committee for \nconfirmation, I plan to review his progress in meeting these three \nchallenges that I have set out today.\n  Let me now discuss a number of other trade issues that will be before \nthe Administration and the Congress in the coming months.\n  I have already discussed the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. Jordan \nis a critical partner in our effort to promote lasting peace in the \nMiddle East. This agreement will help bring our two nations even closer \ntogether.\n  Second, the Administration should send the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral \nTrade\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\nAgreement to the Congress soon. We have made significant progress in \nour economic and political relationship with Vietnam over the past \ndecade, and this agreement builds on that. The agreement requires major \nliberalizing changes in Vietnam's economic and trade structure. The \nagreement paves the way for Vietnam's eventual application to join the \nWTO. The agreement will provide American business and agriculture with \npredictability and stability in Vietnam's market. We need to approve \nthis agreement, and we need to look at how to deal with legitimate \nlabor and environmental issues.\n  Third, President Bush will attend the Summit of the Americas in \nQuebec in April, where the major topic will be progress on completing a \nFree Trade Area for the Americas. I support trade liberalization in \nthis hemisphere. I will support fast track negotiating authority for \nthe FTAA, so long as it properly accommodates legitimate labor and \nenvironmental concerns. I hope that President Bush will tell the \ngathering of leaders in Quebec that he plans to work closely with \nCongress, business, labor, and environmental groups over the coming \nyear so that he can succeed in enactment of this negotiating authority.\n  Fourth, the U.S.-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement expires on March \n31. Today, the U.S. lumber industry is in dire straits. The price of \nlumber is less than in 1995. Many timber operations in Montana, and \naround the nation, have closed as a result of the depressed lumber \nmarket--displacing workers and devastating communities. The Canadian \nsoftwood lumber industry receives over four billion dollars in stumpage \nand other subsidies annually. There is considerable evidence that they \nare dumping lumber into the United States. To make matters worse, the \nabsence of adequate environmental laws in Canada clearly provides an \nunfair advantage to Canadian firms. It contributes to over-cutting in \nCanada's forests and damages the environment, with significant \nimplications for our own forests and environment. We need to resolve \nthis issue quickly and, I hope, avoid lengthy and costly litigation.\n  Fifth, the agriculture crisis. Commodity prices remain near record \nlow levels. Agriculture is Montana's largest industry. Over 60 percent \nof Montana's grain and meat products are exported, so the farmers and \nranchers in my state depend on new and growing markets. We need to \nexpand agricultural exports from Montana and from the entire country. \nThat means:\n  Opening agricultural markets around the world.\n  Attacking the massive agricultural export subsidies of the European \nUnion that distort food trade world-wide.\n  Getting Europe to end its decade-old ban on U.S. hormone-treated \nbeef.\n  Taking measures to end the trade distorting activities of the \nCanadian and Australian wheat boards, including completion of the \nSection 301 investigation of the anti-competitive practices of the \nCanadian Wheat Board.\n  Ensuring that China fully implements its WTO obligations, as well at \nthe U.S.-China bilateral agreement on agricultural cooperation.\n  Abandoning unilateral embargoes, including the embargo on Cuba that \nhas closed that market to our food producers.\n  Ensuring that our domestic agriculture industry is insulated against \ndevastating surges of imports, such as has happened with lamb.\n  Sixth, the survival of America's steel industry is in jeopardy. Over \nthe next few months, Congress, the Administration, the steel companies, \nand the United Steelworkers of America must work together on a program \nto prevent irreparable damage to this important sector of our economy.\n  Finally, we need to develop a comprehensive approach to monitoring \nand compliance of trade agreements. This includes bilateral agreements \nas well as multilateral commitments of our trading partners. China's \naccession to the WTO will present further new challenges to our ability \nto ensure full compliance. We need an early assessment of the \nmonitoring activities in the Executive Branch to ensure that we are \nusing them as effectively as we can. I welcome Mr. Zoellick's statement \nat his confirmation hearing that justice delayed is justice denied. We \ntake a double hit when we fail to ensure full compliance with trade \nagreements. First, our businesses, workers, and farmers don't receive \nthe benefits we negotiated. And then, our credibility as a nation is \ndamaged, and our future negotiating ability is hampered. We must be \nmore aggressive on monitoring and compliance.\n  This is a full agenda for a short period of time. I look forward to \nworking closely with Bob Zoellick as we try to rebuild the consensus \nfor trade so that we can enhance the benefits to America of opening \nmarkets and expanding trade liberalization.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I apologize to Senator Baucus because I was not here to hear his \nstatement. I am glad he was able to go ahead and proceed with his \nopening statement. I also appreciate Senator Baucus' cooperation during \nthe hearing and, more importantly, to be able to bring this nomination \nto the floor without our committee meeting.\n  Obviously, I am going to support President Bush's nomination of \nRobert Zoellick to the position of U.S. Trade Representative. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased to report to my \ndistinguished colleagues that Robert Zoellick is uniquely qualified to \nrepresent the United States in an extremely important position--\nimportant because the trade negotiations that will take place in the \nyear 2001. As far as the trade negotiations that are ongoing, similar \nto the China wall, they never stop.\n  They just go on and on.\n  I want to go into some detail about Mr. Zoellick's impressive \nprofessional qualifications for a very demanding and highly sensitive \nCabinet post. One of the questions I asked him in the private meeting \nin my office was whether or not he was prepared to spend this much time \naway from home. There is much time away from family because there is a \ntremendous commitment to travel with this job besides the policymaking. \nYou get the impression that these people who do our trade negotiations \njust never have any private time whatsoever. Obviously, when he takes \non a demanding job such as this, we know he is committed to doing what \nneeds to be done.\n  Before I go into his impressive professional background, I would like \nto say a word about his performance at his Senate Finance Committee \nnomination hearing. That was on January 30.\n  I think it is fair to say that Members on both sides of the aisle \nwere highly impressed with Mr. Zoellick's thorough command of complex \ntrade issues, with his broad visions of America's historic leadership \nrole in the whole international trade regime, and with his \nunderstanding of the close cooperation required between the legislative \nand executive branches of government in crafting and implementing an \neffective U.S. trade policy.\n  The nature of trade issues Congress will deal with this year clearly \nrequires that a person of Mr. Zoellick's stature and ability be the \nU.S. Trade Representative.\n  In regard to working closely with Congress, understand that Congress \nhas the authority to regulate international, or what you call \ninterstate, and foreign commerce. We guard this very jealously. We have \nto, in the process of doing that under the practicality of 535 Members \nof Congress and negotiating with 138 different countries in the World \nTrade Organization on the issues of reducing tariff and nontariff trade \nbarriers or settling any sort of dispute. From time to time, Congress \nhas given the President of the United States the authority to do that \nin negotiation. But we do it with a very tight rein. I suppose in the \nfuture it will be even more of a tighter rein. That requires a person \nin Mr. Zoellick's position as U.S. Trade Representative to work very \nclosely with the Congress, particularly the Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee, consulting with us on a regular \nbasis. That consultation,\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\nas I have seen in the past, has made the executive branch of government \nresponsive to Members of Congress; more importantly, respectful of our \nconstitutional rights as we guard them. It is our responsibility to do \nthat not only for the economic interests of our constituents but for \nthe sole fact that we take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I will mention a few of the challenges that face Mr. Zoellick, and \nthen I will go into why Mr. Zoellick is ideally suited to deal with \nthem.\n  One important trade challenge right around the corner is the free \ntrade area of the Americas negotiations.\n  The objective of these talks, which are supposed to conclude in 2005, \nis to create a single free trade zone of nearly 700 million people, \nstretching from the Arctic Ocean in the North, to Tierra del Fuego in \nthe South.\n  The free trade area is the single most important economic initiative \nwe have undertaken with Latin America since President Kennedy launched \nthe Alliance for Progress in 1961.\n  Latin America is our fastest growing regional trade partner. Roughly \n46 percent of all the goods manufactured in this country are exported \nto our own hemisphere. We export large amounts of our agricultural \nproducts to the FTAA countries as well.\n  Our continued prosperity, and our leadership in world trade, clearly \nrests on the success of these talks.\n  But when you see the concentration of trade in the Western \nHemisphere, you know why these talks are singularly important.\n  Yet despite the obvious importance of the FTAA, there is little \nagreement on the major issues under discussion. It's time to get these \ntalks moving again. And it's time for the United States to resume its \nleadership in trade not only in the Western Hemisphere but in all \nareas.\n  The FTAA Ministerial Conference is coming up in Buenos Aires in the \nfirst week in April. Two weeks after the FTAA Ministerial, the United \nStates will attend the Third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.\n  Mr. Zoellick knows how important U.S. leadership is in getting the \nFTAA talks headed in the right direction.\n  And more importantly, he has the skills and the background to get the \njob done.\n  What about these skills?\n  For example, while serving in the former Bush administration, Mr. \nZoellick played a key role in the NAFTA process. At one point during \nthe NAFTA negotiations, when the talks weren't going well, Mr. Zoellick \nserved as a special channel with then President Salinas of Mexico to \nkeep the negotiations on track.\n  Also during the former Bush administration, Mr. Zoellick served as \nCounselor of the Department of State, and Under Secretary of State for \nEconomics. At the State Department, he helped launch APEC, the Asia \nPacific Economic Cooperation group for advancing trade and prosperity \nin that region.\n  The creation of APEC was a tremendous achievement. It is a highly \nsuccessful international trade and economic forum. APEC's main agenda \nis to dismantle trade and investment barriers in the region, to \nstrengthen an open, multilateral trading system, and to encourage \nconstructive interdependence by encouraging the flow of goods, \nservices, capital, and technology.\n  Mr. Zoellick's central role in launching APEC clearly demonstrates \nhis deep commitment to the principle of international cooperation that \nis at the heart of America's leadership in promoting global free trade.\n  It also demonstrates his broad vision, and his ability to accomplish \nbig things.\n  In recognition of his outstanding service to his country, Mr. \nZoellick received the Distinguished Service Award, the State \nDepartment's highest honor.\n  Another important trade challenge this year is to launch a new round \nof multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO Ministerial to be held \nlater this year in Qatar.\n  The failure of the Seattle WTO Ministerial was a terrible \nembarrassment for the United States, and a major setback for trade \nliberalization around the world than we now realize 18 months later.\n  The collapse of the Seattle talks was also a major setback for \nAmerican agriculture. Without a comprehensive new round of global trade \nnegotiations, it will be extremely difficult for American agriculture \nto gain access to new markets, and to get rid of the trade-distorting \nsubsidies and barriers that shut our agricultural producers out of \nforeign markets.\n  If we lose the momentum for the liberalization of world agricultural \nmarkets that we gained with the successful conclusion of the Uruguay \nRound of trade negotiations, we may never be able to recover.\n  Here too, Mr. Zoellick's experience demonstrates that he is the right \nperson for the job of U.S. Trade Representative.\n  In 1992, when it looked like the fundamental disagreement between the \nEuropean Union and the United States over agricultural trade \nliberalization would end the Uruguay Round in failure, Mr. Zoellick \nhelped forge the Blair House Accord, the compromise agriculture \nagreement that broke the negotiation logjam, and saved the Uruguay \nRound, not just for agriculture but for other segments of the economy \nthat was held by them.\n  Thanks to Mr. Zoellick's efforts in crafting the Blair House accord, \nnegotiators then immediately were able to clear the political hurdles \nthat brought about an agreement.\n  As a result, the World Trade Organization agreement on agriculture \nrepresents the first serious step toward reform of the international \nrules governing trade in agricultural products. That agreement is now \nthe spring board for current efforts to further liberalize world \nagricultural trade. Other trade challenges beyond agriculture that Mr. \nZoellick and the Congress will be dealing with include the United \nStates-Jordan Free-Trade Agreement, the United States-Vietnam Trade \nAgreement, we have the Singapore free-trade negotiations, and on \nDecember 5th of last year we began the Chile free-trade negotiations. \nThose latter two are on the table. We would expect perhaps some \nconclusion shortly.\n  Mr. Zoellick's record of achievement clearly demonstrates he has the \nability to handle those which might be called lesser issues because \nthey are bilateral but still very important.\n  During his distinguished career, he has led various bilateral trade \nnegotiations with the European Union, with Korea and other nations, but \nmost importantly they involved the structural impediment initiative \nwith the country of Japan.\n  I will say a word about another tough trade challenge, one that will \ninvolve, hopefully, this Congress. As chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I can help move it along. We had discussions with Senator \nBaucus about that, even this week, about how he and I can get together \nand try to solve some of the things involved with giving the President \nnegotiating authority; in other words, that authority which allows a \nPresident to move forward and finalize a multilateral or WTO-involved \ntrade agreement. It is very important to have that even for bilateral \nagreements but perhaps less important for bilateral than for the \nmultinational, multilateral negotiations. It will be very difficult to \nwrite this legislation. We shouldn't have any illusions that it will be \neasy to accomplish. I can't think of a single thing more important to \nrestoring America's leadership in trade and to preserving America's \nnegotiating credibility.\n  It is certainly true, as many have pointed out, that the United \nStates can start negotiations without the President having trade \nnegotiating authority. We know this from our experience during the \nUruguay Round when it took 2 years to get legislation renewing the \nPresident's trade negotiating authority through Congress after the \nUruguay Round started. But doing it that way misses the point. The \nPresident--not just this President, any President--needs negotiating \nauthority from Congress because his negotiating credibility is \ndiminished, sometimes a little, most often a lot, without that grant of \nauthority from Congress. That is as true at the start of formal trade \nnegotiations as it is at the conclusion--maybe a little less at the \nbeginning than at the end.\n  We would all be better off if we could have the President go to the \ntable with Congress saying here is what we want you to do for us; here \nis how we want\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nyou to keep in touch with us so we can represent the people, our \nconstituents, and the leeways that we might give on final negotiations \nwhen we get something we can pass.\n  This is sometimes referred to as fast track. It is innovation. We all \nremember from history, designed in large part as a response to the \ndiminished U.S. negotiation credibility that resulted from the failure \nof Congress to implement some of the trade agreements concluded during \nthe Kennedy Round. Here again I think Mr. Zoellick can play a very \nimportant role. I think he has a record that speaks for itself.\n\n  Other than U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, Mr. Zoellick spent \nmore time with the Congress than any other administration official to \nget fast track authority passed in 1991. I have confidence in Mr. \nZoellick's ability to work with Congress, to get a bill renewing the \nPresident's trade negotiating authority through Congress. We need to at \nleast start that process, even though it is a very difficult process, \nand do it soon. That is the conversation that Senator Baucus and I have \nhad to this point.\n  I conclude with why I view Mr. Zoellick's nomination with enthusiasm. \nIt is a very extraordinary record and has some length. I have looked \ncarefully at what he has done during the past 20 years in promoting \nAmerica's trade interests. That record tells me Mr. Zoellick \nunderstands that trade matters to every American. It matters to the \nfarmers in my hometown of New Hartford, IA, who want to sell his or her \ngrain in the international markets. It matters to the Caterpillar \nworkers in Illinois who make tractors for sale in Asia, Europe, and \nAmerica. It matters to John Deere workers in Waterloo, IA. One out of \nfive jobs on that assembly line are related to export. These are very \ngood jobs and on average, jobs connected with trade, pay 15 percent \nabove the national average.\n  It matters to the Boeing employees in the State of Washington who \nmake state-of-the-art aircraft for every major world aircraft maker. It \nmatters to the radio workers who make avionics in Cedar, IA, that go \ninto these Boeing airplanes. It is going to involve their jobs, as \nwell. Trade is very important in almost every State. But 40 percent of \nour agricultural products are exported. I don't have a dollar value on \nthat, but I know for manufacturing and services, the dollar value of \nthose exports is many times what it is for agriculture. Perhaps most \nimportantly, open international markets increasingly matter to millions \nof very small entrepreneurs as well. These are the people who compete \nfor business every day, wherever they find it, anywhere in the world.\n  Bob Zoellick understands that all of these Americans, whether they \ntoil on the farm, whether they punch the time clock at the assembly \nline, or whether they work in the high-tech new economy, are able, \nthrough these jobs, which are better jobs because of international \ntrade, to pay their mortgage; they are able to support their families; \nand they are able to make their communities better places to live.\n  I believe Mr. Zoellick has already shown himself to be an eminent \npublic servant with an outstanding record of leadership in trade policy \nwho has already served his country well. I have come to know him and to \nrespect him. I know that my distinguished colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will as well.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I strongly urge my \ndistinguished colleagues to vote to confirm this nomination and appoint \nthis outstanding individual to America's most important international \ntrade position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to my very good friend, \nthe esteemed Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  I rise to speak not to question the nomination of Mr. Zoellick--he is \nobviously qualified for the position of U.S. Trade Representative--but \nto question the trade policy priorities of administrations past and \npresent. For the problems our manufacturers and workers face today are \nnot Democratic problems or Republican problems, they are problems with \na trade liberalization approach that needs to be rethought and \nreinvigorated. That approach has led to record trade deficits and \nalarming trends in income inequality. The current crisis in the U.S. \nsteel industry demonstrates that unfettered importation of unfairly \ntraded products causes serious harm to our manufacturers and workers.\n  Sustained reflection on the causes and consequences of the trade \ndeficits has led me to three conclusions. First, there must be a \ngeneral recognition that low-wage competition from less-developed \ncountries is part of the problem. The low wages in those countries both \nundercut the economics of production in the United States and impede \nthe development of a middle class that can purchase U.S. exports. Our \ntrade policy cannot be complacent as first-world manufacturing plants \nare relocated to take advantage of less-developed labor markets, a \nphenomenon that makes it increasingly difficult for American employers \nto stay competitive and, at the same time, pay good wages and provide \ngood benefits. If, as President Bush maintains, we are to be \ncompassionate, let us start by making sure that American workers are \nnot made worse off--on balance--by future moves toward freer trade with \nless-developed countries.\n  Indeed, the inevitable result of the current trade liberalization \napproach in many historically high-wage and efficient industries is \nbankruptcy. Need I tell Senators you about all of the steel companies \nin, or on the verge of, bankruptcy? Are we so naive as to believe that \nthe problems of the steel industry--as well as the elimination of \nmillions of manufacturing jobs across the economy since 1979--are \nunconnected to predatory trade practices by foreign producers and their \ngovernments? For those who have any doubts on this score, I recommend \nstudy of the recent Commerce Department report entitled ``Global Steel \nTrade.''\n  Second, we must recognize that a key objective of many of our trading \npartners in any full trade negotiation is to weaken U.S. trade laws, \nincluding our antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard regimes. \nIt is an iron law of international trade negotiations and the \nimplementation of international trade agreements--that, if the trade \nlaws are ``on the table,'' they will be weakened. Is there any doubt \nthat the antidumping and countervailing duty laws were weakened in the \nUruguay Round negotiations? Is there any doubt that we see more \nevidence of this weakening every day? Has the trade representative ever \nprevailed at the World Trade Organization in defending U.S. \nimplementation of U.S. trade law? The United States simply must not \nonce again enter into an open-ended negotiating round in which \ncountries such as Japan, Korea, and the European Union are able to work \nin concert to eviscerate the framework of fair trade. Equally \nimportant, we cannot permit any international tribunal to interpret and \nto apply the trade laws of the United States.\n  Third, in addition to including strong labor and environmental \nprotections in all trade agreements, we must adopt and enforce policies \nto attack hidden and non-tariff barriers and to effectively counter or \nchallenge foreign subsidies for research, development, and exports. For \nexample, we must do more to address the manner in which producers in \nmany countries are able to control distribution in their home markets \nand thereby shut out their U.S. competitors. The current trade \nliberalization approach limits the ability of the United States to use \nimport restrictions to ensure fair trade in our markets while giving \nmercantilist foreign countries virtually a free hand in excluding \nselected U.S. exports from their markets. In light of the record U.S. \ntrade deficit, this imbalance can no longer be tolerated.\n  One last thought for Mr. Zoellick: The 106th Congress passed a joint \nresolution calling on the President to request an investigation of the \nsteel industry under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. Such an \ninvestigation is necessary because of the crisis conditions I alluded \nto--total imports for 2000 approached the record levels set during \n1998, prices for many steel products are at record lows, and many \ncompanies are in bankruptcy. On January 19, 2001, in a letter to the \nChairman of\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nthe International Trade Commission, then-President Clinton stated that \n``our analysis of the current and prospective import situation and \nrecent events in the steel industry lead us to believe that Section 201 \nrelief may be warranted in the near future.'' Mr. Zoellick, our steel \ncompanies and steel workers cannot wait for the ``near future.'' The \ncrisis is now. The remedies are at hand. Let us not tarry!\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRobert Zoellick to be United States Trade Representative.\n  I know Mr. Zoellick personally and am confident that he has the \nbackground and skills to do an outstanding job. He is an exceptionally \nbright and talented individual with a broad understanding of trade \npolicy and a strong commitment to public service. President Bush \ndeserves real credit for this selection.\n  Robert Zoellick has an extensive background that should prepare him \nwell for his new position. During the administration of former \nPresident George H. W. Bush, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff at the \nWhite House, as Counselor of the Department of State and Undersecretary \nof State for Economics, and as the President's personal representative \nfor the G-7 Economic Summits in 1991 and 1992. In the 1980's he also \nserved at the Department of the Treasury in various positions, \nincluding counselor to Secretary James A. Baker III.\n  Mr. Zoellick is now poised to play an important role in the current \nBush administration and could have a real impact on the future of our \neconomy. In my view, it is critical that we continue working hard to \nopen up foreign markets for American businesses, while maintaining a \nstrong commitment to environmental protection and labor protections. \nAlthough it has received little attention, the United States has been \nrunning very large trade deficits in recent years, and our net foreign \ndebt now exceeds $1.5 trillion. This means we are increasingly \ndependent on foreign investors to maintain our economic strength, a \nvulnerability with potentially serious consequences.\n  I know that Bob Zoellick will be an aggressive advocate for opening \nup foreign markets. As the same time, I hope that he will work hard at \nforging consensus on the various trade issues that will come before the \nCongress. In particular, I am hopeful that he will work constructively \nwith those who want labor and environmental concerns to be addressed \nseriously in international negotiations. I realize that this is a \ncontroversial area and that President Bush has expressed skepticism \nabout incorporating these matters in trade agreements. However, if \ntrade policy is going to enjoy strong bipartisan support, as it should, \nthe administration will have to compromise.\n  Few people would be better prepared to navigate the complex political \nand substantive issues involved with trade policy than Bob Zoellick. I \nbelieve he will be a highly effective trade representative, and I wish \nhim the best of luck in his new position. I am looking forward to \nworking with him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Robert \nZoellick to be United States Trade Representative. As the world economy \nof the twenty-first century continues to evolve, it is paramount that \nthe United States continue to pursue comprehensive international trade, \ncommodity, and direct investment policies that create growth and raise \nliving standards both at home and abroad. By nominating Robert Zoellick \nfor the position of U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, President Bush has \nchosen someone who is eminently qualified to coordinate these policies, \nand I look forward to doing all I can in Congress to support him.\n  A respected scholar at Harvard University and former president and \nchief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, Robert is no stranger to public service. He served during \nPresident George Bush Sr.'s Administration with distinction in variety \nof important posts including Under Secretary of State for Economics, as \nwell as the President's personal representative for the G-7 Economic \nSummits in 1991. From 1985 to 1988, he served as Counselor to Secretary \nof Treasury James Baker, as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nFinancial Institutions Policy at Treasury. Indeed, this extensive \ngovernment experience, coupled with his outstanding academic \ncredentials make Robert Zoellick a USTR nominee who I am proud to \nsupport .\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to briefly comment on \nthe nomination of Robert Zoellick to be United States Trade \nRepresentative. At the outset, I would first like to commend President \nBush for choosing a nominee of such high caliber to take on the \nresponsibilities demanded of the U.S. Trade Representative. \nFurthermore, I am pleased with the President's decision to keep the \nTrade Representative a Cabinet-level position. This was the right \ndecision that reaffirms the United States's role in a global trading \nenvironment. I fully support Mr. Zoellick's nomination and look forward \nto working with him in the new Administration.\n  Mr. President, in a world that has become increasingly interconnected \nthrough and dependent on trade, a skilled and experienced Trade \nRepresentative is essential to ensuring that the United States \nmaintains it position as a leader in this area. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative has the dual responsibilities of fostering continued \nopenness with traditionally underserved markets while at the same time \nsafeguarding the well-being of American businesses and workers. I \nbelieve Mr. Zoellick's past experience makes him qualified to fulfill \nthese obligations.\n  After earning both public policy and law degrees at Harvard \nUniversity, Mr. Zoellick went on to serve as a Deputy Assistant \nSecretary at the Department of the Treasury during the Reagan \nAdministration. He then assumed the position of Under Secretary for \nEconomic Policy at the State Department under President George Bush. He \nleft public service to serve as the Executive Vice President of Fannie \nMae and most recently sat as a fellow and board member of the German \nMarshall Fund of the United States.\n  Mr. Zoellick assumed a key role in some of the most critical trade \ndeals to face the United States in decades. Some of his most notable \nachievements include managing the negotiations over German \nreunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall, fostering compromise \nthat led to the creation of World Trade Organization, and negotiating \napproval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  Mr. President, if, which I assume will be the case, Mr. Zoellick is \nconfirmed as U.S. Trade Representative, he would assume stewardship of \nan agency that enjoys one of its strongest positions in its history. I \nwould be remiss if I did not acknowledge the great strides made under \nthe former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Deputy U.S. \nTrade Representative Richard Fisher, and their team.\n  In the last two years alone, we have passed legislation that created \nnew trading opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa and enhanced the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative program. And one of the most monumental \ntrade achievements in recent history was the accession agreement \nreached between the U.S. and China with respect to its entry into the \nWTO and the granting of Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to \nChina just last fall. These were both landmark agreements that have \nsignificantly altered the face of U.S.-Chinese trade relations. More \nimportantly, they are accomplishments we can and should build upon.\n  And while we should take pride in these achievements, we must not \nlose sight of the tremendous tasks that still lie ahead, and upon being \nconfirmed as Trade Representative, Mr. Zoellick will be faced with a \nnumber of unresolved trade matters that, in my opinion, will require \nhis immediate attention.\n  First, we must continue to ensure that China adheres to the \nconcessions it made in its WTO Accession Agreement with the United \nStates in order to guarantee that American workers and industries gain \nthe full benefits negotiated in this historic agreement.\n  Secondly, the Trade Representative will need to formulate solutions \nto our on-going troubles with the European Union (EU), specifically in \nregard to the beef-hormone and banana disputes. Moreover, the WTO is \nscheduled to rule on the EU's case against the U.S. with respect to \nforeign sales corporations. A ruling against the U.S. in this matter \ncould result in almost $4 billion in retaliatory tariffs being levied \nagainst American goods that could financially\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\nruin businesses and cost countless American jobs. Resolution of this \nissue must be a priority.\n  Finally, one of Mr. Zoellick's greatest challenges will be working \nwith Congress to gain approval of fast-track trading authority for the \nPresident. This authority will take on increased importance at the \nupcoming Summit of the Americas in Quebec in April where, President \nBush has stated, he will make the creation of a Free Trade Agreement of \nthe Americas his number-one priority. Allowing the President to assure \nother world leaders that he will gain this authority will only increase \nthe prospects of the this agreement becoming reality.\n  And while I support both of these initiatives, I do so with the \nadditional belief that worker rights and environmental protections must \nbe included within any fast-track legislation.\n  I am disappointed that President Bush has publicly voiced his \nopposition to these provisions as a part of trade agreements.\n  It is my hope that Mr. Zoellick will show some flexibility on these \nissues and be mindful of their importance in future negotiations. \nAbsent these safeguards, it is my opinion that the President will face \na difficult time obtaining the support needed to secure this critical \ntrading authority.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I have long supported efforts to open the \ndoors of trade to new markets. Expanded trade improves the lives of \nAmerican workers by providing better paying jobs and increased markets \nfor American goods. Ultimately, this translates into a stronger \nnational economy.\n  I also believe that it can serve the purpose of slowly transforming \ncountries that have been socially and politically intolerant into \ncountries that recognize the rights of their own citizens. Ultimately, \nruling by respect rather than fear is in their own best economic \ninterest.\n  At the same time, I firmly believe that every effort must be made to \nbalance the economic benefits of free trade with the needs of American \nbusinesses and workers and to vigorously enforce existing trade laws \nagainst unfair trading practices. The U.S. Trade Representative must be \nunwavering in this regard.\n  Mr. Zoellick has agreed to undertake this critical balancing act, and \nI believe his record as a fair and capable negotiator will serve him \nwell as he assumes this post. Again, I wish to reiterate my support for \nhis nomination as U.S. Trade Representative and urge my colleagues to \ndo likewise.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, ``A foreign policy wunderkind,'' ``Baker's \nsecond brain,'' ``a resume so impressive it might be mistaken for a \nparody of overachievement,'' ``the most impressive thinker of my time \nin government,'' ``the best-prepared guy in the room,'' a man whose \n``board memberships read like the directory of the internationalist \nestablishment,'' one whose friends possess ``almost a cultlike \nadmiration for his intelligence, hard work, and integrity''--such \npraise for Bob Zoellick demonstrates the high expectations for his \ntenure as the United States Trade Representative. I share these hopes \nfor his leadership of our ambition to expand free trade and restore \nAmerica's rightful place at the forefront of global trade \nliberalization.\n  Unlike previous trade representatives, who often possessed more \nnarrow legal backgrounds, Bob's range of experience at the Departments \nof Treasury and State, in the White House, and with organizations like \nNATO, the WTO, and the G-7 grant him unusual insight into the role of \ntrade within the framework of America's broader engagement with the \nworld. Bob's talents, combined with the enthusiasm and purity of his \nbelief in free trade as a force to advance American interests and \nincrease prosperity around the globe, suggest that he will serve well \nPresident Bush's mandate to push forward with a meaningful free trade \nagenda. If personnel is policy, as we often say in Washington, Bob's \nselection for the cabinet-rank trade post foretells important \nachievements in our nation's trade expansion efforts.\n  Yet such achievements will not come easily. America's economy, which \nhas been the engine of global economic growth, is slowing, and there \nexists no broad-based domestic consensus on the benefits of free trade. \nJapan's economy remains mired in an enduring recession that can be \nended only by fundamental structural reforms. China's implementation of \nits market-opening obligations under the WTO remains worrisomely \nincomplete. The European Union, where growth has recently accelerated, \nretains significant market distortions that are reflected in its \ncontinued agricultural protectionism and the array of trade disputes \nwith the United States over subjects like hormone-treated beef. The \neconomic health of Latin America is mixed, and many African nations \nwith tremendous trade potential suffer the pernicious effects of poor \ngovernance and civil strife. Clearly, Bob has his work cut out for him.\n  Given the challenges and opportunities ahead--and the critical role \nof trade to the continued dynamism of our own economy--our nation must, \nto the extent possible, speak with one voice in favor of trade \nexpansion. Bob has pledged to work closely with the Congress on such \npriorities as creating a hemispheric free trade zone, providing the \nPresident with renewed trade-promotion authority, ratifying our \nbilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, locking in free trade with \npartners like Singapore and Jordan, and setting the stage for a new \nround of global trade talks. It is my hope that both parties in \nCongress will work constructively and in good faith with Bob and the \nAdministration to advance this ambitious but achievable trade agenda, \nfor the benefit of the American people we serve.\n  As Bob noted in a ``Foreign Affairs'' article during the campaign, \n``A primary task for the next President of the United States is to \nbuild public support for a strategy that will shape the world so as to \nprotect and promote American interests and values for the next 50 \nyears. . . . America must capture the dynamism of the era and transform \nits new elements into the economic and security foundations for a \nfuture system.'' Such an integrated approach, which I strongly endorse, \nrequires restoring our nation's leadership in liberalizing global \ntrade. I wish Bob the best as he spearheads this effort, upon which \nrests our fondest hopes as a people for prosperity and purpose in the \nworld.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Robert Zoellick to become the U.S. Trade Representative. \nI will support confirmation of the nomination of Robert Zoellick.\n  Given the important contribution of the automotive industry to \nAmerica's economic prosperity and job creation, I wish to flag two \nimportant automotive trade relationships that I hope will be made a \npriority by USTR designate Zoellick: the United States automotive trade \nrelationship with Korea and with Japan.\n  I was disappointed to note that Mr. Zoellick was not asked during his \nSenate Finance Committee confirmation hearing last week about two trade \nagreements of key interest to the automotive industry: the 1995 \nFramework Agreement on Autos and Auto Parts between the United States \nand Japan and a 1998 United States-Korea Auto Market Access MOU. \nNeither have achieved the expected results of opening these markets to \nUnited States automotive exports. It is time to go back to the table \nand insist on the results we were promised.\n  The automotive industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the \nUnited States representing 3.7 percent of GDP. It ranks first among \nmanufacturing industries in R expenditures spending over $18 billion \na year, employs almost 2.5 million Americans and exports more than any \nother industry. This is why it is so important for our USTR and the \nAdministration to fight aggressively to allow this industry to compete \non a fair and level playing field in foreign markets.\n  The 1995 Framework Agreement on Autos and Auto Parts between the \nUnited States and Japan was allowed by the Government of Japan to \nexpire at the end of 2000. This is despite the Agreement's failure to \naccomplish its stated objective to significantly expand sales \nopportunities resulting in purchases of foreign parts by Japanese firms \nin Japan and through their transplants in the United States and to \nresolve market access problems for foreign autos and auto parts in \nJapan. The U.S. Government, working closely\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\nwith the American auto parts industry, organized labor and Members of \nCongress, developed and presented a significant proposal for extending \nand enhancing the 1995 Agreement. In the closing days of 2000 Japan was \neven unwilling to permit the extension of the existing Agreement which \nwould have allowed time for the new Administration to pursue a more \nsubstantial five year agreement.\n  I urge the Bush administration, and Mr. Zoellick in particular, to \nmake the renegotiation of a stronger and more effective agreement one \nof its earliest and highest priorities.\n  Regarding Korea, despite two separate automotive trade agreements \nbetween the United States and Korea intended to open Korea's market, we \nnow have a rapidly increasing automotive trade imbalance between the \ntwo countries. Korea exported almost 500,000 vehicles to the United \nStates last year but imported only 4,300 foreign vehicles from \neverywhere in the world. Foreign vehicles make up only .32 percent of \nKorea's total vehicle market, making it the most closed market in the \ndeveloped world.\n  This is not a level playing field and should not be tolerated. This \nimbalance has occurred despite efforts by United States auto \nmanufacturers to make long-term and extensive efforts to increase sales \nin Korea. I urge the administration and Mr. Zoellick to redouble the \nUnited States efforts to achieve market access progress in Korea, \nespecially in urging the Government of Korea to take specific actions \nto reverse the anti-import attitudes and policies that so blatantly \ndiscriminate against foreign vehicles in Korea.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nRobert Zoellick as the next United States Trade Representative. I think \nthat Bob Zoellick has the experience, education, and leadership skills \nto be an outstanding USTR.\n  Mr. Zoellick has had a broad range of experience in the executive \nbranch, including the Treasury Department, State Department, and the \nWhite House. Chairman Grassley has detailed his record of \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. Zoellick's experience is not just from the view of a government \nadministrator. Since 1997, he has held a number of positions with \nprivate sector firms involved with asset management and capital \ndevelopment. This unique combination of public sector and private \nsector experience will prove vital to his performance as USTR.\n  As trade becomes more important to the economy of Utah and the United \nStates as a whole, it is imperative that we have senior officials that \nunderstand the significance of free and fair trade. And it is critical \nthat they can view trade issues with a vision of the attendant foreign \npolicy, national security, and economic policy considerations that are \nat stake. I think Bob Zoellick can see the world from many \nperspectives.\n  The United States faces a number of key trade issues in the next few \nyears. It will be a great advantage to American workers and American \nconsumers if we can create a bi-partisan U.S. trade policy.\n  We need to look at the issue of granting new trade promotion \nauthority to Ambassador Zoellick. But fast track authority alone should \nnot replace the hard work and effort to forge bi-partisan support for \nU.S. trade initiatives.\n  My experience on the Judiciary Committee has taught me that \nintellectual property issues will play an increasingly important role \nin the international economy. We must make sure that the creative \nefforts of those who produce software, entertainment such as music and \nmovies and breakthrough drugs and medical devices get the benefit of \nTRIPS implementation and enforcement. Frankly, we need to get better \nacross the board at enforcing the trade agreements that we negotiate.\n  We also need to resist any efforts to impose unnecessary barriers on \nthe emerging Internet economy. For example, we must work to see that \ncomputer downloads are not unduly hindered through tariffs or technical \nbarriers.\n  I want to re-enforce many of the comments that my friend from West \nVirginia. Senator Byrd made with respect to the crisis among our \ndomestic steel producers. I want to work with Mr. Zoellick and Senator \nO'Neill on the efforts by the Bush Administration to re-energize our \ndomestic steel industry. I think at his confirmation hearing that Mr. \nZoellick made the correct comment to Senator Rockefeller, my other good \nfriend from West Virginia, on the potential use of section 201 \nauthority with respect to steel. We must come up with a comprehensive \nplan to help U.S. producers of steel like Geneva Steel from my state of \nUtah. Part of this plan must focus on foreign dumping and \ncountervailing duties.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Majority Leader Lott and I raised the \nbananas and beef cases and the use of the carousel rotation of product \nretaliation lists. We can't let the Europeans avoid the consequences \nwhen the lose WTO cases. Frankly, I think that one of the first things \nthis Administration ought to do in the trade area is to follow the law \nwe passed last year and immediately implement the carousel system.\n  The Korean government's recently announced $2.1 billion bailout of \nHyundai electronics raises many troubling questions. This development \nmay be a direct violation of commitments made to the IMF in 1997. \nSpecifically, USTR must examine whether this new bailout program is in \naccordance with the commitments made in paragraphs 34 and 35 of the \n1997 IMF Standby Arrangement addressing, respectively, bank lending \npractices, and government subsidies and tax preferences. I trust that \nUSTR will look into this, and I want my colleagues to know that this is \nan issue that I take very seriously. Frankly this government bailout \nmust be scrutinized by USTR so that we can be sure that American high \ntechnology firms like Micron can remain competitive in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  I am confident that Bob Zoellick can work effectively with Commerce \nSecretary Evans and other key Administration officials to bring the \nAmerican public the promise of free and fair trade. We need to open new \ntrading opportunities, but we also need to enforce U.S. trade laws and \nensure compliance with international trade agreements.\n  Many believe--and I believe--that the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative is the best governmental trade organization in the \nworld. We ask Mr. Zoellick to lead and inspire this very strong agency \nto perform even better. The citizens of Utah and throughout the United \nStates have much at stake in the performance of USTR.\n  As a Senator who believes in the long-term benefits to America of \nfree and fair trade, I plan to vote for Robert Zoellick and stand ready \nto work with him and my colleagues to build a strong, bipartisan trade \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now yield to my good friend from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for Bob Zoellick to be the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. I am not a big fan of the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice--never have been--under Republican or Democratic \nadministrations. My view is that our trade policy in this country is a \nmess. It has gotten worse, not better. We are headed towards a $440 \nbillion merchandise trade deficit.\n  In fact, it might be useful to show a chart that describes what has \nhappened to our trade deficits. It shows that since 1993 our \nmerchandise deficit has ballooned from $136 billion to over $440 \nbillion. All the Republicans and all the Democrats that give us \nsoothing assurances and say this trade policy of ours is working really \nwell ought to take a look at these deficits, that are ballooning, year \nafter year after year after year.\n  I want to talk a little about why I think it is so important, as we \nvote on\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\nthe confirmation of Mr. Zoellick, we need to expect something different \nfrom the U.S. Trade Representative's office. You could put a blindfold \non and listen to both Republican and Democratic administrations over \nlast 20 years, Republican and Democratic stewards at USTR, and you \ncouldn't tell the difference between them. It wouldn't matter. It is \nall the same, all the same trade policy: Negotiate another agreement \nand hope things get better. However, what really happens is, they \nnegotiate another agreement and things get worse.\n  I am told that we have, in the last 8 years, negotiated 304 trade \nagreements. I am also told, that some of the agreements cannot even be \nlocated in the offices of the Trade Representative, let alone get them \nenforced. At the time when we have negotiated 304 trade agreements, our \ntrade deficit has increased over 300 percent.\n  Let me show you what bothers me from time to time about our current \ntrade strategy. Let me do it in terms of T-bone steaks. I have a chart \nI want to share with you.\n  We negotiated a trade agreement with Japan in 1989 on the issue of \nbeef. The U.S. could not successfully get beef into the country of \nJapan. So our negotiators went to Japan, and they negotiated really \nhard, and they got an agreement, and then they had a big celebration. \nThey had banquets, and, Lord, they had headlines in the newspapers: \n``We have reached an Agreement with Japan.'' Good for them. God bless \nthem.\n  Now 12 years later, we are getting more beef into Japan. Good for us. \nDo you know what the tariff is on every pound of beef that goes into \nJapan? Incidentally, these are T-bone steaks on the chart. As this \nchart shows, there is a 38.5-percent tariff on every pound of American \nbeef going into Japan. This is 12 years after the great agreement with \nJapan, a country, incidentally, that has over a $70 billion merchandise \ntrade surplus with us, or to say it another way, a U.S. deficit with \nJapan.\n  By what justification does anyone who negotiates this kind of trade \nagreement stand here and say to American producers: We really scored a \nvictory for you this time? These people obviously did not wear jerseys \nthat said ``USA'' when they negotiated this one. They said: We will \nagree, after a phase-in, to a 50-percent tariff that will be reduced \nover time. Great, except it has a snap-back provision which says, the \nmore you get in, the higher the tariff will be. So guess what. Twelve \nyears later, we have a 38.5-percent tariff on every single pound of \nbeef going to Japan. It is a failure. Not only do people not care about \nit, most people don't know about it; and nobody is going to do much \nabout it.\n  If not T-bone steaks, what about cars? We just finished a trade \nagreement with China. We have over a $70 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit with China, and it is growing rapidly. Here in the Senate, we \ndid not have a vote on the bilateral trade agreement with China. If we \ndid vote, I would have voted no. We had a vote on PNTR, but we did not \nhave a vote on the bilateral trade agreement. We had negotiators go to \nChina, and once again, apparently, they left their jerseys at home, the \nones who say: ``USA''--``Here is what I am negotiating for. I want a \ngood deal for us.''\n  Our negotiators go to China and negotiate an agreement. At the end of \nthe agreement, after a long phase-in, here is what we have done on \nautomobiles. We have said: Yes, there are probably 1.2 billion people \nover there, and if they are able to increase their standard of living, \nat some point they will become more affluent and want to start driving \ncars. If that happens there will be more automobile trade between the \nUnited States and China. What we will agree to, China, we will grant \nyou access to our market at a 2.5-percent tariff on any cars, and we \nwill allow you to have a tariff that is 10 times higher--25 percent--on \nany U.S. automobiles going to China.\n  What on Earth are we thinking about? Here is a country that has a \nhuge surplus with us, or we have a huge deficit with them. We negotiate \nan agreement with them and say: Oh, yes, by the way, we will allow you \nto impose tariffs on automobiles 10 times higher than those we impose \non you.\n  Time after time, there are examples of the incompetence of these \nnegotiators, let alone the fact that once we get these agreements, as \nbad as they are for this country, they are not enforced. Do you know \nhow many people we have enforcing our trade agreements? Yes, even the \nbad trade agreements with China? Seven. There used to be 10; now there \nare 7. China has done little to comply with any of our trade \nagreements. So now we have gone and negotiated a new bilateral \nagreement that is poorly designed and at the same time decreased the \nnumber of people monitoring and investigating how China is not playing \nby the rules. Our staff for China went from 10 to 7.\n\n  At some point we have to realize, that ballooning trade deficits we \ncurrently have in this country, are unhealthy for our country, our \nfuture and our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 25 minutes 7 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Iowa has 32 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I noticed \non the floor the presence of my good friend and colleague from \nLouisiana. It was actually her idea that drew me over here. I am glad \nshe is here. I will try and be brief in my remarks and then defer to \nthe Senator from Louisiana to share some of her thoughts.\n  Let me say, first of all, I am a strong supporter of Bob Zoellick to \nbe the new U.S. Trade Representative. I think he will make a very fine \nTrade Representative. We worked very closely together over the years on \nother matters. He was at the State Department. I know him to be \ntremendously thoughtful, a good listener, one who is not afraid of new \nideas and is attentive to a wide diversity of interests dealing with \nsome of the issues affecting some of the very regions of the world I \nwill address some remarks to, and that is Central America and Latin \nAmerica back in the 1980s.\n  So I am a strong supporter of Bob's. He will do a great job. The \nPresident is lucky to have his willing services in this administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Dodd pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 260 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't think I have authority to yield \ntime, but I think Senator Baucus would be comfortable yielding 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher work.\n  Mr. President, I support Mr. Zoellick. I am not here to oppose his \nnomination at all, but I would like to express my great reservations \nabout the direction of our trade policy. Unless I am mistaken, I think \nI heard the majority leader today out on the floor saying that we need \nto, of course, have the trade but we need for it to be fair trade. I \nwas pleased to hear his very strong remarks.\n  I guess it was about maybe a month ago that I was on the Iron Range \nof Minnesota with the taconite workers at a gathering at Hoyt Lakes. \nThere were about 1,000 workers there, although 1,300 of them have lost \ntheir jobs. The LTV Steel Company closed down. They shut down the \ntaconite operation. Fourteen-hundred workers on the Iron Range lost \ntheir jobs. Other workers, by the way, are being laid off at other \nmines. It is not just those workers. It is the subcontractors. It is \ntheir families. It is the people in the community.\n  I never mind saying this because it is just true. Even though you \ntalk about one region of the State, you never want to act as if you \ndon't care about other regions. Northeastern Minnesota is like a second \nhome to Sheila and I. This is where our campaign started in 1989. They \nsupported me when no one\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\nthought I ever had a chance. These are people with the greatest work \nethic in the world. They are just incredible people. There are a lot of \nbroken lives, broken dreams, and potentially broken families in \nnortheastern Minnesota.\n  I always go to one high school just to stay in touch with the \nstudents there. I have been there about three or four times in the last \nyear or two. The discussions with the students are so poignant. They \nwant to know if they can afford college. They want to know what is \ngoing to happen to their mom or dad, and whether or not there will be \nany jobs for them. These are good jobs that pay probably $65,000 a \nyear, counting health benefits. There are not a lot of other jobs such \nas that. Of course, there will be a future because when you have people \nwith such a strong work ethic and who are so self-reliant and self-\nsufficient it will happen.\n  But I want to say this on the floor of the Senate. When I was at this \ngathering, I was looking out over about 1,000 workers. And I thought to \nmyself: These are industrial workers. All too often in our trade policy \nand all too often on the floor of the Senate and on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives, they have been out of sight and out of mind. \nI could add the autoworkers to the steelworkers, and a lot of \nindustrial workers as well.\n  In this particular case, the import surge of steel--in the case of \ntaconite workers, it is semifinished steel--slab steel from Brazil, \nfrom South Korea, from Russia, and from other countries way below our \ncost of production has essentially put them out of work. These steel \nworkers on the Iron Range of Minnesota want to know where they fit into \nthis international economy. I say this to Mr. Zoellick--and I will say \nit every day for the rest of my time in the Senate--why can't we have a \ntrade policy that, of course, recognizes the importance of trade but \nalso works for working people in our country? If it is true that we \nlive in an international economy--yes, it is true--then if you care \nabout human rights, you have to care about it not only in our country \nbut other countries. If you care about the right of people to join a \nunion and make decent wages for their families--you have to care about \nthat, not only in our country but other countries as well--if you care \nabout religious freedom, you have to care about this in our country but \nother countries as well. If you care about the environment, you have to \ncare about it in an international context. But from NAFTA to GATT to \nWTO to efforts to have fast track here and there, I have not seen an \neffort to really talk about a fair trade policy.\n\n  I am not an isolationist. I am an internationalist. My dad was born \nin Odessa, Ukraine. He fled persecution in Russia. He spoke 10 \nlanguages fluently. I grew up in a family where there was no other \nchoice but to be an internationalist. But there has to be some new \nrules that come with this international economy.\n  This has to be an international economy and global economy that works \nfor steelworkers--workers for autos, workers for family farmers, the \nenvironment, and human rights. That is not the case now. Lord, I have \ngiven enough speeches on the Senate floor about human rights violations \nin China and other countries as well. I will not do that today.\n  I make this appeal to Mr. Zoellick and appeal to my colleagues that, \nwhatever we do, let's try to figure out some additional steps we can \ntake that will give some assurance to hard-working people in our \ncountry so they don't get the short end of the stick and get spit out \nof the economy because we have no level playing field.\n  That is what has happened to these steelworkers on the Iron Range. \nThat is exactly what has happened to these taconite workers.\n  I think Senator Dayton would say the same thing. We are desperately \ntrying, with Congressman Oberstar and others, to get trade adjustments \nto people. We hope the taconite workers fit into that. We want to talk \nabout section 201, and the Rockefeller bill deals with the whole \nproblem of unfair trade in steel, and whether or not we have to say to \nthe other countries we can't deal with these import surges, especially \nif we think it is a dumping of steel, or semifinished steel well below \nthe cost of production; especially when you talk about countries where \npeople do not get decent wages, where there are no OSHA or any \nworkplace safety rules.\n  There has to be a way we can have some competition and a trade policy \nthat makes sure steelworkers on the Iron Range of Minnesota and family \nfarmers and people who care about the environment and people who care \nabout human rights figure in. I think those industrial workers are \nsimply off the radar screen when it comes to politics in the Nation's \nCapital today.\n  There are two Senators on the floor: Senator Grassley from Iowa, who \nis chair of the Finance Committee, one of the best Senators in the \nSenate--he is wrong on every issue but he is one of the best Senators \nin the Senate--and Senator Baucus, who is also ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, who is very skillful. I say to both of my colleagues \nand other Senators, I hope maybe this year, since we are 50/50, and we \nwill have a lot of passionate debates, there are certain areas where \nmaybe we can work together. Maybe there are some things we can do to \ntry to make this trade policy work a little better for some of the \npeople in our country and in this particular case for some of the \nsteelworkers on the Iron Range and some other people in my State much \nless other States. That is the appeal I make today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n\n\n                             Grant Aldonas\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for a very special purpose \nrelating to the work of the Senate Finance Committee and the aspect of \nour work that deals with international trade and the high caliber of \nstaff who have been on the International Trade Subcommittee over a long \nperiod of time. But I take special note of one of our staff people, our \nchief trade counsel, Grant Aldonas. He is right here.\n  He is going to soon be leaving the position that he has with our \ncommittee. It is going to be a loss for our committee, and particularly \nfor me as a new chairman. It is going to be a tremendous loss because \npeople of his caliber who are so successful in the private sector and \nare willing to come back into public service are few and far between. \nHe is one who has done that. He has done it for 3\\1/2\\ years as the \nFinance Committee's top trade lawyer. He served Senator Roth before me \nwith the greatest of professionalism and diligence; he has done a very \ngood job.\n  Grant has left his mark on some of the Senate's most significant \ntrade policy initiatives--the passage of the Trade and Development Act \nof 2000, and the passage of the bill that has been on everybody's mind \nover the last 3 or 4 years giving permanent normal trade relations \nstatus to the great country of China. This was chief among all the work \nthat he did for that period of time on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I think I can speak for members of the Senate Finance Committee on \nboth sides of the aisle. They have come to rely upon Grant's skill and \njudgment. Even though he is very skillful, judgment is the greatest \nasset that he has when dealing with the policies of international \ntrade, not only from the domestic standpoint but from the international \nstandpoint. Judgment with good common sense is very important.\n\n  I have already referred to his success in the private sector. That is \nbecause he is a good lawyer. He is also a good public servant and just \na plain good person.\n  I wish you, Grant, and your wife Pam all the best in your new life \nbeyond the Hill. Thank you very much for your services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  I join in the remarks of our distinguished chairman to Grant Aldonas. \nI am fond of saying I believe the most noble human endeavor is \nservice--service to church, to family, to the community, State and \nNation; whatever makes the most sense for each one of us graced to be \non the face of this Earth particularly public service--more \nparticularly, public service where\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nyou don't get your name in the headlines or the evening news, public \nservants who don't have huge egos but are working for the country in \nthe best interests of the United States of America and all Americans. \nGrant certainly is in that category.\n  Grant is a guy who works behind the scenes to get results. Again, it \nis not headlines. It is talking to all the Senators, the Senators' \nstaffs, the administration, whoever it is he must talk to in order to \nget a result, legislation, something passed for the sake of the people.\n  He is a great bipartisan kind of a guy. He is particulary effective \nbecause of his prior service, whether USTR, the State Department, or \nprivate sector.\n  I do think his background as a lawyer helps. The understanding of the \nlaw helps one be effective. There are very bright and fine ways to get \naround that stuff, but generally I think a legal background is quite \nhelpful.\n  Whether it is China, PNTR, or trade bills of Africa, Caribbean, Grant \nhas been there--a true professional, calm, even tempered, smart, \ncreative thinking, diligent, hard working, focused on getting results.\n  I underline the point the chairman made; namely, of Grant's sense of \njudgment and his common sense, a commodity which is probably one of the \nmost important a person can have. We will miss you, Grant. We know you \nwill go on to bigger and better things. We also know in the real sense \nyou will not have left. We will still be able to call you, seek your \nadvice, and wish you the very best.\n  In the remaining minutes, I thank the Senators who have spoken. They \nmake very good points on which I know the administration and Mr. \nZoellick will focus.\n  How we bring all the components together for coherent consensus in \ndeveloping a trade policy for America is extremely difficult. It \nincludes business interests of America, labor interests in America, and \nenvironmental interests in America. It includes all the Americans who \nthink they are left out of trade and the benefits of trade agreements. \nCompanies do pretty well in some places and employees wonder where they \nfit in to all of this. We have to work harder to develop that \nconsensus. I very much look forward with the chairman and people such \nas Grant and others in the administration to develop that consensus. \nFrankly, we have no other choice. We have to find that consensus to be \neffective and serve our people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to say a few things about the \nnominee and about the larger issue of trade.\n  I commend my distinguished ranking member for his comments earlier \nand those who have already expressed themselves. It goes without \nsaying, and it ought to be emphasized, that Robert Zoellick is going to \nbe an excellent Trade Representative. He has broad Government \nexperience and a record of achievement that is enviable. His experience \nin the State Department, the Treasury Department, and the White House \nis a clear demonstration of his commitment to public service and public \npolicy.\n  The USTR role is one that I think is an increasingly important role \nin the Federal Government, particularly given the increasing importance \nof trade and globalization generally.\n  I am concerned about reports that consideration was given to \ndowngrading the position from its Cabinet rank, and I am very pleased \nthat the Cabinet rank in this case will be retained.\n  As I look back over the 106th Congress, one could argue that some of \nour greatest achievements were in the field of trade. We enacted the \nCaribbean Basin and African trade bill. We met our obligation under the \nWTO regarding FSC. We granted permanent normal trading relations to \nChina, paving the way for the most populous country in the world to \njoin the global rules-based trading system.\n  Now we have a chance to build upon the achievements and the record of \nthe 106th Congress by promoting the economic, national, and foreign \npolicy interests of the United States in a global economy.\n  The United States is uniquely positioned to benefit, in my view, from \nincreased globalization. First, we have the most productive economy in \nthe world. Second, we have a comparative advantage in an increasingly \ninformation-based global economic framework.\n  Globalization improves productivity as countries specialize in areas \nof comparative advantage and puts downward pressure on prices consumers \nface. We have seen examples of that over and over.\n  The promotion of international understanding and the reduction of \ninternational conflict is critical if this is going to happen in the \nmonths and years ahead.\n  The freer flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas around the world \ncreates interdependence and understanding that both can help lower the \nprobability of conflict and raise the cost of conflict.\n  There is an economic cost to a nation being ostracized from the \nglobal economy. Economic liberalization advances key foreign policy \ngoals such as increased economic freedom and reduced poverty. So the \nstakes could not be much higher for us or for the world as we create \nthis global framework and recognize the advantages of participating in \nit.\n  We also have to recognize that participation in and of itself is not \nall necessarily positive. There is a lack of domestic consensus on \nexpanded trade and globalization, and as we consider all of the public \npolicy choices we will face in the 107th Congress, I hope we work to \ntry to build a better consensus, one we did not have in all occasions \nlast year.\n  We start building that better consensus by recognizing \nthat globalization can inflict costs on certain groups, and those costs \nneed to be addressed.\n\n  Workers in import-competing countries may face downward wage pressure \nand job loss. In a recent study, ``Americans on Globalization'' the \nauthor, Steven Kull, found that people would be much more supportive of \nincreased globalization if the government did more to help people who \nlose out through trade. I believe that is true. I do not think there is \nany question that if we could find ways with which to address that \nconcern, a consensus could be more the reality than it is today.\n  Fully 66 percent of respondents agreed with the following statements: \nI favor free trade, and I believe it is necessary for the government to \nhave programs to help workers who lose their jobs.\n  That is all they seem to be asking: the realization that there are \npeople who get hurt as this new infrastructure gets established.\n  Another 18 percent favored free trade in the absence of such help, \nwhile 14 percent opposed it with or without the help. We have 66 \npercent of the people who say they favor free trade so long as we \naddress the problems of free trade. We need to work together to do that \nto address those problems.\n  Our challenge is to build that consensus on trade policy in a global \neconomy, not only in this country but around the world.\n  I look forward to working with Bob Zoellick and my colleagues on the \nchallenge we face in doing that constructively and successfully.\n  There are some key elements, in my view, for building that consensus. \nFirst, I believe one of the key and perhaps one of the fundamental \napproaches that will be required is a realization that expanded worker \nadjustment assistance is one way with which to ease the pain and \naddress the problem. A more broad-based, flexible, and effective \nadjustment assistance program is clearly needed, and I hope we all can \naccept that realization.\n  A smooth transition from displacement back into the workforce is \nimportant for communities and the overall economy, and such assistance \nis critical to building consensus on moving forward on greater trade \nliberalization.\n  Bob Zoellick was a key member of the Trade Deficit Commission. The \nCommission did not agree on the underlying cause of the trade deficit \nor how to remedy it. The only area of broad bipartisan agreement was \nfor expanded worker adjustment assistance. I look forward to working \nwith Mr.\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\nZoellick in this area. I look forward to recognizing the possibility \nfor bipartisan consensus on expanded worker adjustment assistance. I \nhope it will be an integral part of anything we do in the longer term \nwith regard to trade policy.\n\n  A second element is increased support and emphasis on lifetime \nlearning. A policy that waits until someone loses a job is doomed to \nfailure. Over time, the goal has to be to embed the culture with an \nappreciation of learning and upgrading skills throughout one's life, \nand that by doing so, economically and educationally, this new \nconstruction of lifelong learning can be an integrally important and \nextremely essential part of anything we do to advance the cause of \nworld trade.\n  Let's recognize that building those learning skills and upgrading \nthem throughout life must not be viewed simply as an education issue \nbut as a trade issue.\n  Third, we must advance labor and environmental standards around the \nworld. I believe this has to be done on a bilateral and multilateral \nbasis. Recent bilateral trade pacts, such as the one with Jordan, have \nbegun to make progress in this critical area. But there is so much more \nthat needs to be done. We recognized it in the bilateral arrangement \nwith Jordan. We ought to recognize it in any new bilateral arrangement. \nBut, clearly, we have to recognize it in multilateral efforts as well.\n  We recognize how difficult it is. We recognize how challenging. We \nrecognize how divisive. We recognize how much debate, and in some ways \nconfrontation, has occurred over issues relating to labor and \nenvironmental standards. But we also must recognize that if we are \ngoing to address increased consensus, we must address this issue.\n  We also must make sure that our trade laws work and are perceived as \nfair. Fair trade laws help create an environment that maintains \nconsensus for the openness we all seek in the first place. We have to \nmaintain vigilance to ensure that laws are perceived as fair both \ninside and outside the country. Frankly, we have not always done a good \njob at that.\n  The steel industry is one such industry. Despite substantial \ninvestment and modernization, steel has faced repeated pressure from \ndumped steel all over the world. We have to do a better job.\n  We have to also understand the importance of making the WTO work \nbetter. Greater transparency and avenues for participation are needed. \nIn the United States, we must advance those reforms.\n  We have to help poor countries. Greater globalization holds great \npromise for further reducing poverty in poor areas. But the United \nStates and other rich countries need to continue to help poor countries \nparticipate in the WTO, and the trading system generally, and be \nmindful that poor countries often seem to believe that globalization is \nbeing imposed on them. We simply cannot allow that to happen.\n  So I look forward to working, on a bipartisan basis, on all of these \nchallenges. I look forward to working with the soon-to-be-confirmed \nUSTR and with my colleagues. As I talked a moment ago about steel and \ndumping, there is an array of dumping and serious imbalances in trade \nwith our European and Canadian allies with regard to agriculture that \nalso must be addressed--whether it is meat or agriculture in a number \nof ways, or whether it is the New Softwood Lumber Agreement with \nCanada.\n  The Softwood Lumber Agreement with Canada expires in a few short \nmonths. There is a major risk of a flood of imports entering our market \nat a time when low timber prices already have led to mill shutdowns and \nclosures. This will be one of the first issues that Mr. Zoellick will \nhave to face. I share Senator Baucus' concern, as he has taken a \nleadership role in addressing this matter.\n  We need a new agreement with all stakeholders at the table. We need \nto address agriculture with all producers, processors, and traders at \nthe table.\n  We need to understand the implications of the imbalances, the \ndumping, and the serious problems that we face in agriculture today as \na result of unfair trading practices in agriculture. That has to be \naddressed and put on the table.\n  We have to work towards a consensus, as I said a moment ago, on labor \nand the environment. I hope we can find common ground on those issues \nas well.\n  The President has made a strong nomination. I know my colleagues will \nbe as supportive of this nominee as I am. I hope and expect it will be \nan overwhelming vote. But I also hope and expect that this is not the \nend but the beginning of the creation of an even more balanced trade \npolicy with more consensus on international trade and globalization, \nand a realization that that consensus depends on how effectively we \naddress myriad challenges that we have not addressed successfully to \ndate. I look forward to working with our nominee and with my colleagues \nin that regard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I intend to vote for Mr. Robert Zoellick \nfor U.S. Trade Representative. I believe he brings excellent \ncredentials to this position. I do believe the new President, President \nGeorge W. Bush, is entitled to discretion but, in any event, this is a \nqualified man. I would like to take a moment or two to talk about the \nenforcement of U.S. trade laws, especially as they relate to a very \nserious situation in my State with respect to the steel industry.\n  Steel has been victimized in the United States by illegal trade \npractices, trade practices which violate U.S. law and trade practices \nwhich violate international law.\n  We have had a surge of dumping in the United States which has cost \nthe steel workers, in the past two decades, a reduction in employment \nfrom close to half a million steel workers to now less than 160,000 \nworkers, and a situation where many steel corporations today are on the \nverge of bankruptcy.\n  We need to see to it that dumping is not permitted in this country. \nSimply stated: Dumping is where steel, for example, is sold in the \nUnited States at a lower price than it is sold in the country from \nwhich it is exported.\n  I have introduced legislation in the past and intend to reintroduce \nit this year which would provide for a private right of action, which \nwould enable the corporation or the injured workers and the union to go \nto Federal court and to get injunctive relief. That relief can be \nobtained very promptly.\n\n  It is possible, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to get a \ntemporary restraining order on an ex parte basis on the filing of \naffidavits--there has to be a hearing within 5 days, evidence can be \nput into the record, equity actions can be tried very promptly, and \nthat is an effective way to see to it that U.S. trade laws are enforced \nand that they are consistent with international trade laws.\n  Last year we legislated on a matter on a bill introduced by Senator \nDeWine of Ohio and backed by quite a number of us in the Senate steel \ncaucus, a caucus which I chair, with the cochair being Senator Jay \nRockefeller of West Virginia. Then through the leadership of Senator \nRobert Byrd of West Virginia, with my concurrence in the Appropriations \nCommittee, we put that bill into effect last year which provides that \nwhere duties are imposed for violations of U.S. trade laws, that those \nduties are paid to the injured parties instead of going into the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  Obviously, it is desirable to have funds go into the Treasury, but \nwhere it can be ascertained that the illegal foreign trade practices \nresulted from a violation of U.S. trade law and can be traceable to \ndamages to specific companies and individuals, that is where those \nduties ought to be paid.\n  A question has arisen as to whether the United States will fight to \nretain that legislation against complaints by some of the foreign \ncountries where infractions have been found. I do hope our new Trade \nRepresentative will enforce that legislation which was passed by the \nCongress and was signed by the\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nPresident under an appropriations bill last year.\n  I make these comments because U.S. jobs, U.S. industrial interests \nought not to be sacrificed for foreign policy or for defense policy. \nNot too long ago, when we were anxious to back up the Russian economy, \nwe permitted tremendous dumping of steel by Russia in the United \nStates. While I am concerned about the stability of the Russian \neconomy, I am candidly more concerned about the stability of the \nPennsylvania economy and the U.S. economy. But fair is fair. When the \nlaws are on the books, they ought to be enforced and they ought not to \nbe sacrificed for collateral U.S. interests on foreign policy or on \ndefense policy.\n  I make these comments with the hope that our new Trade Representative \nwill be a vigorous enforcer of U.S. trade laws and that my colleagues \nwill consider the legislation, which I will introduce later in this \nsession, which will provide for that private right of action.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Robert B.

Mr. President, this is a remarkable day in American \nhistory. Today we celebrate the 90th birthday of Ronald Reagan, the \n40th President of the United States. As a Senate, we send to him our \nheartfelt best wishes for his continued recovery from a recent surgery \nand we thank him for all that he has done to make America, the Shining \nCity on the Hill. Ronald Regan stands in the first rank of freedom's \npantheon. Happy Birthday, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article highlighting Ronald Reagan's \nearly journey through politics, Rehearsals for the Lead Role, written \nby John Meroney, associate editor of The American Enterprise, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 4, 2001]\n\n                       Rehearsals for a Lead Role\n\n       Ronald Reagan was a liberal, an actor; a labor chief, but \n     some unscripted plot twists forged a new character\n\n                           (By John Meroney)\n\n       Hollywood.--All day, memories had been flooding back to \n     him. Riding home from the airport across the west side of \n     L.A., he was traveling the same streets he had driven years \n     before. Back then he knew the town by heart, and used to \n     drive it with the top down on his green Cadillac convertible.\n       As the car pulled into the residence of 668 St. Cloud Rd. \n     in Bel Air, the city was beginning to slip into the afternoon \n     dusk. Millions of tiny lights would soon fill the L.A. basin, \n     a scene he always thought remarkable. And looking out across \n     it on that January day when he became a private citizen 12 \n     years ago, Ronald Reagan knew that had it not been for the \n     events of his life in this place, he probably never would \n     have been president.\n       This week, Ronald Reagan will join John Adams and Herbert \n     Hoover as the only presidents to reach the age of 90. An \n     entire generation knows him only as president or as the \n     ailing statesman living in seclusion. Even though Reagan was \n     a movie star who appeared in 53 motion pictures, and is \n     unique among presidents in that so much from his early years \n     is preserved on film for posterity, that critical part of his \n     life has largely become forgotten history.\n       His movies rarely appear on television. (During the 1980 \n     presidential campaign, Federal Communications Commission \n     officials banned them from broadcast because they asserted it \n     gave him an unfair advantage.) Dozens of books have been \n     written about him, but the three decades he spent as a movie \n     star and labor leader are given scant attention in most.\n       This is remarkable given that Reagan's life during the \n     1940s and '50s was often more dramatic than the parts he \n     played. He lived in surroundings so compelling that they have \n     formed the basis of many great films, such as ``Chinatown'' \n     and ``L.A. Confidential.'' Writers from Raymond Chandler to \n     James Ellroy have for decades carved their stories from \n     Reagan's era in Hollywood. The town was at the height of its \n     glamour, and was steeped in national political intrigue. And \n     Ronald Reagan not only witnessed this, but was a central \n     figure to much of it.\n       Recently, new details about his life have emerged, \n     presenting a more accurate and deeper understanding of him. \n     Last fall, Nancy Reagan published a collection of dozens of \n     love letters and personal correspondence her husband wrote \n     that reveal a creative and passionately emotional side to the \n     40th president. A collection of 677 scripts for radio \n     commentaries that Reagan wrote by hand during the 1970s was \n     recently discovered by researchers, and is being published \n     this week. They document a man with clearly defined ideas \n     about public policy.\n       Still, there persists the caricature of Reagan as a B-movie \n     actor who used the talents he honed on soundstages in Burbank \n     to\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n     attain high office where he stumbled into the end of the Cold \n     War. Even his conservative supporters have perpetuated this \n     view. Reagan national security adviser Robert McFarlane once \n     remarked, ``He knows so little and accomplishes so much.''\n       But a close review of the historical record, and recent \n     interviews with those who knew Reagan best during the 1940s \n     and '50s, show a man profoundly affected by his experiences \n     as a movie star and six-term president of the Screen Actors \n     Guild. He emerges as a complex individual who--through what \n     he once described as intense ``philosophical combat''--\n     changed his political ideology. Contrary to assertions (which \n     Reagan himself often encouraged) that he became a Republican \n     because the Democratic Party abandoned him, Reagan actually \n     went from being a staunch liberal who participated in \n     Communist front groups to a stalwart anti-communist because \n     of his firsthand experiences dealing with Communist Party \n     members.\n       History sometimes reveals the moments and incidents that \n     mold and shape our presidents. Most of Ronald Reagan's \n     occurred here. In part, he is simply a man who loved (as he \n     called them) ``pictures''--being in them, talking about them \n     and the business of making them. But it was a growing \n     obsession with politics that sharply diminished his acting \n     career, helped destroy his first marriage, and changed his \n     life forever.\n       Reagan's involvement with the Screen Actors Guild spanned \n     more than a decade, and even before he became president of it \n     in 1947 (a position that paid him no salary or benefits), he \n     immersed himself in its work. He would often speak \n     extemporaneously for extended periods on the labyrinthine \n     matters of the industry workforce, impressing professional \n     negotiators with his knowledge of thorny labor issues.\n       The nature of Reagan's role as labor leader isn't the only \n     part of his life that runs counter to the popular perception. \n     In the years after his divorce from actress Jane Wyman in \n     1948, Reagan was living a life that most who know him best as \n     the grandfatherly president would never recognize. Indeed, \n     Reagan was handsome, rich (spending in excess of $750 a month \n     on dinners and nightclubs) and dating some of the most \n     beautiful actresses in the business.\n       Hollywood was booming. It was, as David Niven once \n     described it, filled with great personalities, but controlled \n     by arrogant moguls, overcrowded and smelling of despotism, \n     nepotism and blacklists. Los Angeles supposedly had more \n     swimming pools and private detectives per square mile than \n     any other place in the world.\n\n\n                         ``The Gipper'' Is Born\n\n       When Reagan arrived in Hollywood in May 1937, the country \n     was still in the Depression, but L.A. still had a grand style \n     about it. Virtually all of the residences Reagan had here \n     still exist, and are largely unchanged. His first apartment \n     was at the elegant Art Deco Montecito apartment building on \n     Franklin Avenue in Hollywood. Today, as one walks into the \n     lobby and then the unit that he rented, the romance and \n     glamour of the era become obvious.\n       Barely 12 months later, Reagan's career was in full \n     flourish. By the end of 1938, he had already made nine \n     pictures. ``Brother Rat,'' the story of cadets at the \n     Virginia Military Institute, is perhaps the best among them. \n     More important, he had fallen in love with his co-star, \n     Wyman, and they married just over a year later. The Warner \n     Bros. publicity machine was churning out press releases \n     touting them as the new all-American couple.\n       Jack Warner typically knew a good thing when he saw it, and \n     from the moment of Reagan's screen test, he took a liking to \n     the young man from Dixon, Ill. Now, Reagan seemed to be \n     exceeding expectations. For years, he had dreamed about \n     making a movie based on the life of the legendary Notre Dame \n     football star George Gipp, whose deathbed words became a \n     rallying cry for the Fighting Irish. In his spare time, \n     Reagan would make notes about a possible film. And when he \n     heard that Warner had given the green light to a picture \n     about Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, he saw his chance.\n       ``I've been a great fan of Gipp's throughout his career, \n     and I've read just about everything that's been written on \n     him and Rockne,'' Reagan told Pat O'Brien, who was signed to \n     play Rockne. ``I can play the part. I won't let you down,'' \n     he pleaded. Studio records show that Reagan beat out both \n     John Wayne and William Holden for the part of Gipp. ``Knute \n     Rockne, All American'' was released in 1940. And the line \n     ``Win one for the Gipper\" eventually became as synonymous \n     with a politician as ``I like Ike.''\n       By the middle of 1941, Reagan was making almost $2,000 a \n     week. He and Wyman had built a house on Cordell Drive, just \n     above Sunset Boulevard, with a sweeping view of the city. \n     (Record producer Richard Perry lives there now.) And Warners \n     was about to release ``Kings Row,'' a film that it had been \n     holding for a year, afraid of how audiences might react to \n     its depiction of an idyllic small town that turns sinister. \n     Reagan gives what is arguably the best performance of his \n     career as Drake McHugh, a happy young man with a bright \n     future who wakes up after a train accident to discover his \n     legs have been needlessly amputated. ``Where's the rest of \n     me?!'' he screams.\n       On a hot July day of that year, Wyman suggested to SAG \n     Executive Director Jack Dales that her husband would be the \n     best candidate to fill a vacant alternate position on the \n     SAG board of directors. ``I remember Jane looked at me and \n     said, `My husband might be president of SAG one day,' '' \n     Dales remembers today. ``Then she added, sort of jokingly, \n     `Who knows, he might even be president of the United \n     States.' '' With that, Ronald Reagan's life began to take \n     a completely different turn.\n\n\n                          A Witness Testifies\n\n       On April 10, 1951, in Room 226 of what is now the Cannon \n     House Office Building on Capitol Hill, actor Sterling Hayden \n     was under oath, describing to members of the House Committee \n     on Un-American Activities what had caused him to join the \n     Communist Party. ``There was something boiling inside of \n     me,'' said Hayden, whose unforgettable face made him look \n     like one of the toughest characters in all of Hollywood. \n     (Years later, he would play the Air Force general who sets \n     off nuclear war in ``Dr. Strangelove'' as well as the corrupt \n     police captain in ``The Godfather.'')\n       ``I felt reluctant accepting the very lucrative and easy \n     life Hollywood had offered me,'' he said. ``All of it planted \n     a seed: If I could do something about the conditions of the \n     world, I could probably justify my position as an actor. I \n     was appalled at what the Communists were telling me. I would \n     get propaganda literature, scan it, and then burn it up.''\n       Hayden said he left the Communist Party after being \n     convinced it was ultimately being directed by Joseph Stalin. \n     ``Joining was the stupidest, most ignorant thing I have ever \n     done,'' he said. Hayden said Communists tried to paralyze \n     entertainment industry labor unions so that all studio \n     workers would eventually be organized under one gigantic \n     union controlled by the party itself, and he was asked what \n     stopped them. ``They ran into Ronald Reagan, who was a one-\n     man battalion.''\n\n\n                            An FDR Disciple\n\n       Although he was a captain in the Army, Reagan spent most of \n     World War II in Culver City, Calif., because his \n     nearsightedness prevented him from being in combat. His \n     responsibility while stateside was to help administer the \n     Army Air Forces 1st Motion Picture Unit at the Hal Roach \n     Studios, making military training and promotional films.\n       Making ``This Is the Army,'' a 1943 musical for Warners, \n     and watching Franklin Roosevelt prosecute the war, stirred \n     Reagan's longings to be a part of it. It also increased his \n     zeal for the leadership in Washington. ``Ronnie really \n     idolized FDR,'' remembers Dales. ``I mean, you have to \n     understand, Ronald Reagan thought Roosevelt was a true \n     savior. And by getting involved with the politics of the \n     Guild, he heightened his reverence for FDR's abilities. \n     There's no question that I think he imagined himself having a \n     major role in our industry that way.''\n       Biographer Edmund Morris once interviewed a man in the \n     Signal Corps who encountered a distraught Reagan all alone on \n     the studio lot just after FDR's death in 1945. ``He seemed \n     really stricken, like he had a migraine,'' said Elvin \n     Crawford. ``When he looked at me I saw he was in despair. \n     `Oh, sergeant, I don't know what's going to happen to this \n     country.' ''\n       As the celebrations of victory in World War II ended, \n     Americans were flush with success in practically every area \n     of their lives. Some 90 million were going to movies every \n     week. And within what seemed like just a moment, Hollywood \n     was on the front lines of the Cold War.\n\n\n                      The Era of FBI Surveillance\n\n       Today, the concern about Soviet subversion that gripped the \n     country through the late 1940s and '50s seems odd. After all, \n     the Soviet Union had been an ally during World War II. But \n     once no less an authority than Winston Churchill announced \n     that ``an iron curtain has descended'' across Europe in his \n     famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Mo., and he warned that the \n     Communist Party was ``seeking everywhere to obtain \n     totalitarian control,'' Americans began to look at Soviet \n     influence in a different light. Washington had become \n     aggressive in its efforts to investigate possible subversion \n     and infiltration from elements deemed loyal to Stalin, and \n     because films and entertainment reached such wide audiences, \n     Hollywood seemed a ripe target for propaganda.\n       On Capitol Hill, the House Un-American Activities Committee \n     (HUAC) convened hearings in October 1947, at which Reagan \n     testified. Although he cooperated with the HUAC, he resented \n     government interference in the business he loved, later \n     calling the panel (which included another future \n     president, Richard Nixon) a ``pretty venal bunch.''\n       The FBI conducted surveillance on thousands of prominent \n     Americans, including Reagan. But Reagan was also helping J. \n     Edgar Hoover gather information about others, and agents \n     first visited him in 1941. While most of the information \n     Reagan provided pertains to possible Communist influence, the \n     FBI appears to have been interested in anything politically \n     controversial. In 1943, for example, he told an agent about a \n     party where anti-Semitic statements were made. ``Captain \n     Reagan became highly incensed and withdrew from the \n     conversation,'' according to the report contained in Reagan's \n     partially declassified FBI file. ``He said that he almost \n     came to blows'' with someone who had spoken disparagingly \n     about Jews.\n       In every war, there is injustice and unfairness, and the \n     Cold War was certainly no different. Careers were \n     sidetracked, others destroyed. Actress Jane Wyatt (TV's \n     ``Father\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n     Knows Best'') is one example of someone who was inadvertently \n     caught up in organizations that eventually turned out to be \n     Communist front groups. Wyatt was blacklisted, and in order \n     to work again, she had to publicly criticize the party.\n       Director John Huston, who worked at Warner Bros. during \n     Reagan's time there, was sympathetic to those on the \n     blacklist. In his memoirs of Hollywood published in 1980, he \n     wrote: ``There is no doubt in my mind that the Communists \n     were out to proselytize, to win converts. But there is also \n     no doubt in my mind that activity in no way posed a threat to \n     national security. The Communists I knew were liberals and \n     idealists, and would have been appalled at the idea of trying \n     to overthrow the United States government.''\n\n\n                       Hollywood Has No Blacklist\n\n       Part of the journey to understand how this backdrop \n     influenced Reagan's life and eventually the presidency takes \n     one to--of all people and places--Hugh Hefner and the Playboy \n     Mansion. Hefner recalls that in 1960, he had heard about a \n     dinner with Reagan and Homer Hargrave, a friend of Hefner's \n     who was the son of silent film star Colleen Moore. It came \n     just after Playboy had published a favorable story about \n     Charlie Chaplin, who was then a stalwart supporter of the \n     Soviet Union. ``Thank God for Communism,'' Chaplin said in \n     1942. ``They say Communism may spread all over the world. I \n     say, So what?''\n       In addition, Playboy had also published an article about \n     the Academy Awards by screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, a member of \n     the Communist Party from 1943 to 1948. He famously refused to \n     answer questions from the House Un-American Activities \n     Committee and served 10 months in prison in 1947 for refusing \n     to testify. He rejoined the party briefly in 1954.\n       Starting in November 1947--in response to charges that the \n     industry was infiltrated by subversives--the studios adopted \n     an industry-wide policy forbidding the hiring of anyone \n     suspected of communist sympathies. For Trumbo, the blacklist \n     period was a financial hardship, but like many on the \n     blacklist, he continued to write scripts under pseudonyms. \n     And in 1960, he again began to work under his own name when \n     Otto Preminger announced he'd hired Trumbo to write the \n     script for ``Exodus.''\n       ``When Trumbo wrote his story for us, he was just starting \n     to come out of the shadows,'' remembers Hefner. Reagan and \n     Trumbo had both been members of the liberal Hollywood \n     Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and \n     Professions (HICCASP, as Reagan called it, ``pronounced like \n     the cough of a dying man''), later revealed to be secretly \n     supported by the Communist Party. At the dinner, Reagan told \n     Hargrave that considering Chaplin and Trumbo's defiant \n     attitudes about communism, he found Hefner's support for them \n     galling. Hargrave mentioned the remark to Hefner.\n       ``When I heard what Reagan said, I wrote to him,'' says \n     Hefner. ``I liked `Kings Row' and all that, but I was also \n     unhappy about what had happened during the blacklist era. And \n     so I told him.''\n       What Hefner received in response--six pages, handwritten on \n     Reagan's personal stationery--is, perhaps, a more precise \n     rendering of the former president's personal and ideological \n     transformation than has ever appeared in the legion of \n     books and articles written about him. It surfaces very \n     briefly in Morris's book on Reagan, but until now the 1960 \n     letter has never been published in its entirety.\n\n                                                           July 4.\n       Dear Mr. Hefner: I've been a long time answering your \n     letter of May 13 and my selection of--The 4th--as an \n     answering date is coincidence plus the fact that Holidays \n     are--free time--days around our house:\n       Your letter has been very much on my mind and I question \n     whether I can answer in a way that will make sense to you. \n     First because I once thought exactly as you think, and second \n     because no one could have changed my thinking (and some \n     tried). It took seven months of meeting communists and \n     communist influenced people across a table in almost daily \n     sessions while pickets rioted in front of studio gates, homes \n     were bombed and a great industry almost ground to a halt.\n       You expressed lack of knowledge about my views, political \n     back ground etc. Because so much doubt has been cast on \n     ``anti-communist,'' inspired by the radicalism of extremists \n     who saw ``Reds'' under every ``cause,'' I feel I should \n     reveal where I have stood and now stand.\n       My first four votes were cast for F.D.R., my fifth for \n     Harry Truman. Following World War II my interest in \n     liberalism and my fear of ``neo-fascism'' led to my serving \n     on the board of directors of an organization later exposed as \n     a ``Communist Front,'' namely the ``Hollywood Independent \n     Citizens Comm. of the Arts, Sciences & Professions''! \n     Incidentally Mr. Trumbo was also on that board.\n       Now you might ask who exposed this organization as a \n     ``Front''? It was no crusading committee of Congress, the \n     D.A.R. or the American Legion. A small group of board members \n     disturbed by the things being done in the organization's name \n     introduced to their fellow board members a mild statement \n     approving our Dem. system and free enterprise economy and \n     repudiating communism as a desirable form of govt. for this \n     country. The suggestion was that by adopting such a policy \n     statement the board would reassure our membership we were \n     liberal but not a ``front.'' The small group who introduced \n     this measure were such ``witch hunters'' as James Roosevelt, \n     Dore Schary, Don Hartman, Olivia de Havilland, Johnny Green & \n     myself.\n       Leaders of the opposition to our statement included Dalton \n     Trumbo, John Howard Lawson and a number of others who have \n     since attained some fame for their refusal to answer \n     questions. I remember one of their group reciting the Soviet \n     Constitution to prove ``Russia was more Democratic than the \n     U.S.'' Another said if America continued her imperialist \n     policy and as a result wound up in a war with Russia he would \n     be on the side of Russia against the U.S. We suggested this \n     ``policy statement'' was perhaps a matter for the whole \n     organization to decide--not just the board. We were told the \n     membership was ``not politically sophisticated enough to make \n     such a decision.''\n       When we resigned the organization went out of existence \n     only to reappear later (minus us) as ``Independent Citizens \n     Committee of the Arts, Sciences & Prof.'' in support of Henry \n     Wallace and the Progressive Party.\n       The ``seven months'' of meetings I mentioned in the first \n     paragraph or two refers to the jurisdictional strike in the \n     Motion Pic. business. There are volumes of documentary \n     evidence, testimony of former communists etc. that this whole \n     affair was under the leadership of Harry Bridges and was \n     aimed at an ultimate organizing of everyone in the picture \n     business within Mr. Bridges longshoreman's union.\n       Now none of what I've said answers your argument that \n     ``freedom of speech means freedom to disagree,'' does it? \n     Here begins my difficulty. How can I put down in less than \n     ``book form'' the countless hours of meetings, the honest \n     attempts at compromise, the trying to meet dishonesty, lies \n     and cheating with conduct bound by rules of fair play? How \n     can I make you understand that my feeling now is not \n     prejudice born of this struggle but is realization supported \n     by incontrovertible evidence that the American Communist is \n     in truth a member of a ``Russian American Bund'' owing his \n     first allegiance to a foreign power?\n       I, like you, will defend the right of any American to \n     openly practise & preach any political philosophy from \n     monarchy to anarchy. But this is not the case with regard \n     to the communist. He is bound by party discipline to deny \n     he is a communist so that he can by subversion & stealth \n     infuse on an unwilling people the rule of the \n     International Communist Party which is in fact the govt. \n     of Soviet Russia. I say to you that any man still or now a \n     member of the ``party'' was a man who looked upon the \n     death of American soldiers in Korea as a victory for his \n     side. For proof of this I refer you to some of the ex-\n     communists who fled the party at that time & for that \n     reason, including some of Mr. Trumbo's companions of the \n     ``Unfriendly 10.''\n       Hollywood has no blacklist, Hollywood does have a list \n     handed to it by millions of ``movie goers'' who have said \n     ``we don't want and will not pay to see pictures made by or \n     with these people we consider traitors.'' On this list were \n     many names of people we in Hollywood felt were wrongly \n     suspect. I personally served on a committee that succeeded in \n     clearing these people. Today any person who feels he is a \n     victim of discrimination because of his political beliefs can \n     avail himself of machinery to solve this problem.\n       I must ask you as a publisher, aside from any questions of \n     political philosophy, should a film producer be accused of \n     bigotry for not hiring an artist when the customers for his \n     product have labeled the artist ``poor box office,'' \n     regardless of the cause?\n       I realize I've presented my case poorly due to the \n     limitations of pen & paper so may I ask one favor? Will you \n     call the F.B.I. there in Chi. ask for the anti-communist \n     detail, then tell him of our correspondence (show him my \n     letter if you like) and ask his views on this subject of \n     communism as a political belief or a fifth column device of \n     Russia.\n       Now my apologies for having taken so long in answering your \n     letter and my appreciation for your having taken the time to \n     write in the first place.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ronald Reagan.\n\n       I asked Hefner whether he took Reagan's advice. ``Growing \n     up,'' he answered, ``FBI agents were my heroes. I saw Cagney \n     in `G-Men' when I was a kid. But by the '50s I had already \n     had visits from them, and they had harassed my ex-wife. So to \n     say that Reagan's suggestion fell on deaf ears is an \n     understatement.''\n\n\n                     Standing Up Against Communism\n\n       A scene from 1946, once recounted by Reagan: The setting is \n     the posh residence of a top star, a meeting of the HICCASP. \n     Reagan is running late, and arrives to grab a seat next to \n     MGM studio head Dore Schary.\n       ``Lots of people here I didn't think I'd see,'' he says.\n       ``Stick around,'' answers Schary.\n       FDR's son James stands to propose adopting a statement \n     denouncing communism and the Soviet state. ``I was amazed at \n     the reaction,'' remembered Reagan. One musician stands to \n     assert that the Soviet constitution is superior to the \n     American one. A screenwriter says he'd volunteer for Russia \n     if war between it and the United States ever broke out. ``I \n     decided that an Irishman couldn't stay out, and took the \n     floor and endorsed what Roosevelt said.'' Pandemonium. Reagan \n     recalled one woman having a heart attack.\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\n       The meeting breaks up. Schary tells Reagan, ``We're meeting \n     up at Olivia de Havilland's apartment.''\n       Reagan goes over to find about a dozen HICCASP members \n     celebrating how they'd just smoked out the Communists.\n       Reagan is looking at de Havilland, grinning.\n       ``What's so funny?'' she asks him.\n       ``Nothing,'' he says, ``except I thought you were one.''\n       She looks at him, smiling, ``I thought you were one. Until \n     tonight, that is.''\n\n\n                              Rival Unions\n\n       Aside from Dales, the man Reagan worked mostly closely with \n     during his days as SAG president, it was Roy Brewer. An FDR \n     New Dealer, Brewer had grown up in Grand Island, Neb., and at \n     age 19, as a projectionist at the Capital Theater, ran the \n     1927 version of ``The Jazz Singer,'' all 15 reels of it.\n       Brewer became a top labor official in Nebraska, and rose \n     quickly to prominence in the International Alliance of \n     Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), part of the American \n     Federation of Labor. When he arrived in Hollywood in 1945 on \n     a mission to mediate what appeared to be a jurisdictional \n     strike, he walked into a dispute between his IATSE members \n     and a rival labor group, the Conference of Studio Unions, \n     headed by Herbert Sorrell. What he also discovered was an \n     industry that during the war had attracted a wide variety of \n     characters--some who thought Hollywood was their ticket to \n     fame and fortune, and a very small minority who were pushing \n     political agendas.\n       Reagan was initially on the side of the strikers, but after \n     he became convinced that the real objectives of those behind \n     the strike were detrimental to the industry, he became a fast \n     ally with Brewer. The two were soon confidants, and were \n     featured together in Fortune magazine as two of the most \n     influential figures in the business. By 1948, Reagan and \n     Brewer were co-chairing the Hollywood campaign for Harry S \n     Truman's reelection.\n       Reagan and Brewer believed Sorrell's group was trying to \n     force the entire film community to accept an industry-wide \n     union headed by Harry Bridges, leader of the International \n     Longshore and Warehouse Union, who had attained fame from \n     organizing the San Francisco waterfront strike of 1934. \n     Records that have emerged since the end of the Cold War seem \n     to support this claim, and also show that Bridges was a \n     Communist Party member.\n       ``Ronnie and I saw that the way things were going, it would \n     be impossible for the studios to produce any movies at all,'' \n     Brewer says today. Historians on both sides of the political \n     spectrum now estimate there were approximately 300 party \n     members in Hollywood during this era, and some of them have \n     since admitted that while a concerted effort was underway to \n     insert propaganda into films, the more important immediate \n     goal was to seize control of the unions because they held the \n     financial keys to all of the industry.\n       Reagan's increasing involvement in the affairs of the \n     industry seemed to come at great personal cost. Threats were \n     made against his life, and Warner's issued him a .32, which \n     he began wearing in a shoulder holster.\n       A union transcript of a divisive SAG meeting late one night \n     at the Knickerbocker Hotel during October 1946 shows Reagan \n     aggressively confronting rival union organizer Sorrell:\n       ``I have had to have guards for my kids because I got \n     telephone warnings about what would happen to me because of \n     my activities in trying to settle this strike.\n       ``Now, smile. I don't know where the telephone calls came \n     from. I know I took them seriously and I have been looking \n     over my shoulder when I go down the street. Now, I know there \n     are people from both sides in the hospital. I know it has \n     been a vicious and deplorable thing in our business. I have \n     never given up for one minute trying for peace, because I \n     believed if the two factions wanted peace, there must be a \n     grounds upon which they can meet. . . .\n       ``Herb, as far as I'm concerned, you have shown here \n     tonight that you intend to welsh on your statement of two \n     nights ago [about settling the strike], and as far as I am \n     concerned, you do not want peace in the motion picture \n     industry.''\n       Those who would know Reagan later in life say these \n     experiences shaped his presidency, and eventually the way he \n     approached the Soviets. ``That era was a major influence on \n     him,'' says Edwin Meese, attorney general under Reagan. ``He \n     said it gave him a good sense of the tactics used by the \n     Communist Party, and a sense for their methods of subversion. \n     There's no question it was pivotal.''\n       But it was also devastating to his marriage. In early 1948, \n     Wyman sued him for divorce, complaining that her husband's \n     life revolved around the union. His discussions ``were far \n     above me,'' and ``there was nothing left to sustain our \n     marriage.''\n       Said Reagan: ``Perhaps I should have let someone else save \n     the whole world and saved my own home.''\n\n\n                               Moving On\n\n       By the early 1950s, with the back of the Communist Party in \n     Hollywood now essentially broken, Reagan found that securing \n     work for former Communists and others who were innocently \n     caught up in the blacklist was one of the responsibilities \n     of his volunteer job. Along with Brewer and Dales, Reagan \n     would vouch for actors and others in the industry who \n     publicly broke ranks with the party.\n       It was this role that partly accounted for his first \n     substantive meeting with actress Nancy Davis in 1949. Of \n     course, Reagan was an eligible bachelor, and Nancy knew it.\n       But she also wanted Reagan to protect her, and make sure \n     industry leaders knew she wasn't politically controversial. \n     ``I told her director, Mervyn LeRoy, that I'd take care of \n     it--having made the switch from Ronald Reagan, actor, \n     regretfully to Ronald Reagan, SAG president,'' he once wrote. \n     Davis herself tried to make sure that politics never \n     jeopardized her career, and became a member of the Guild's \n     board of directors in August 1950, a position she would keep \n     for more than a decade. The Reagans' first real date, though, \n     is now the stuff of legend. It began with both of them saying \n     they needed to be home early and ended sometime after 3 a.m. \n     In 1952, they married.\n       Shortly thereafter, Reagan, who had a ranch at the beach, \n     landed his first position in public office: honorary mayor of \n     Malibu Lake. Within hours, California car dealer Holmes \n     Tuttle came calling, saying he and others were prepared to \n     back Reagan for the U.S. Senate. On that occasion, Reagan \n     turned him down.\n       Hollywood has remained a constant in Ronald Reagan's life \n     since the day he arrived here in 1937. Often it appears in \n     the most curious ways. Screenwriter and producer Douglas \n     Morrow once tried to find Reagan a role when no one else \n     seemed to be offering one. Years later, in 1979, Morrow, who \n     had connections in the aerospace industry, arranged for \n     Reagan to make a secret visit to the North American Defense \n     Command headquarters deep in the mountains of Colorado. \n     Seeing firsthand that the United States had no defenses \n     against nuclear strikes moved him, and stoked his fire for a \n     missile defense system.\n       When Washington conservatives were nervous about President \n     Reagan giving away the store to the Soviets at Reykjavik, and \n     sent Lyn Nofziger in to urge him to be cautious and remain \n     stalwart, Reagan responded: ``Don't worry. I still have the \n     scars on my back from fighting the communists in Hollywood.''\n\n\n                       Hollywood's Guiding Lights\n\n       When he came back from Washington, Reagan was approached \n     about possibly returning to films for a special cameo, but \n     always politely declined the overtures.\n       Reagan's personal office now overlooks the 20th Century Fox \n     studios, and is in a building that has served as the site for \n     numerous films. A parade of dignitaries from Gorbachev to \n     Thatcher has visited him there, but Reagan always seemed to \n     especially relish the industry people who would appear at his \n     door.\n       On Tuesday, in a house high above the city, Nancy Reagan \n     will mark her husband's 90th birthday with him, without \n     fanfare. And perhaps, at the end of it, as the sun goes down \n     and the lights of the City of the Angels come up, Ronald \n     Reagan will have a fleeting glance of the town where an \n     American president found his destiny.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, we celebrate the birthday of a \ngiant, Ronald Reagan. America is indebted to President Reagan for \nreviving our national spirit and ensuring that we prevailed in that \n``long twilight struggle'' against soviet totalitarianism. His \nleadership not only revitalized our economy, but gave us a rebirth of \npatriotism and national greatness.\n  My fellow Vietnam Prisoners of War share a special affection for \nRonald Reagan. Word of his steadfastness against aggression even \nreached us in our cells thousands of miles away from freedom. When we \nwere released, he befriended and supported us. He understood and \nappreciated the ``noble cause'' for which so many brave Americans made \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  Today, America enjoys unprecedented peace and prosperity largely due \nto the policies of Ronald Reagan. So, to celebrate your 90th birthday, \nwe salute you President Reagan, a brave soldier in the battle for \nfreedom.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nand celebrate the 90th birthday of our 40th President, Ronald Wilson \nReagan.\n  It is ironic that today this body is debating the merits of a tax \ncut. Almost twenty years ago, President Reagan introduced and helped to \npass the largest tax cut in our Nation's history. Nearly two decades \nlater, we are still enjoying the economic benefits of that tax cut. Our \neconomy has had real growth every year since 1982, with the exception \nof a tiny 1.2 percent dip in 1991.\n  Thanks to President Reagan's tax cut, we have experienced by far the \nlongest run of economic growth in American history.\n  President Reagan's main reason for supporting tax relief was not to \nprovide an economic stimulus, although that was an inevitable result. \nHis main reason was to promote freedom. Freedom from the heavy hand of \nGovernment. Freedom to spend one's own hard earned money on whatever \none wanted.\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\n  Back in our country's colonial days, the colonists would tar and \nfeather tax collectors because they had to pay around one percent of \ntheir wages. One percent! The famous Boston Tea Party was another way \nthat our forefathers protested a relatively small, by our modern \nstandards, tax increase.\n  But by 1980, our highest tax rate was an enormous 70 percent!\n  President Reagan understood that such a tax rate was indefensible. It \nwas unjust, oppressive and against everything for which our Nation \nstands. He supported and got a 25 percent across the board tax cut. He \nknew that the American people, not the American Government, knew best \nhow to spend their own money. Pretty revolutionary thinking.\n  President Reagan also took office at the height of Communist \nexpansion around the world.\n  The Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Southeast Asia was \nstill experiencing the dreadful repercussions of Pol Pot. Communist \ninsurgents were wreaking havoc all over Central America. The embryonic \nSolidarity movement in Poland was being brutally repressed. The voice \nof Democracy was being stifled around the globe. Our own armed forces \nwere in a shambles, both in terms of morale and military readiness.\n  But our President did not waver. He knew that as the most visible \nleader of the Free World, he must stand up for freedom and democracy. \nAnd despite facing strong opposition, at home and abroad, from those \nwho considered the dominance of the Soviet Union to be inevitable, \nPresident Reagan stood up and helped change the course of history.\n  It was his military buildup that showed the Soviet Union that we \nmeant business. He knew that the Communists could not withstand an arms \nrace. He knew that eventually the voices of freedom would drown out the \nnightmarish cries of Communist regimes.\n  He knew that our country's character, dedication, industriousness and \nresolve would push the Soviet Empire into the abyss. All our Nation \nneeded was a leader. And because of his visionary leadership, the \nBerlin Wall came crumbling down, democracy spread across Eastern Europe \nand the Soviet Union collapsed. Today millions of Europeans view \nPresident Reagan as their liberator, and our economy has been further \nhelped along because of the ``peace dividend.''\n  President Reagan was known as the ``Great Communicator.'' Sometimes \nthis was used as s derisive term against him, as though the only reason \nordinary Americans liked and trusted him was because the former actor \nhad somehow pulled the wool over their eyes.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The American people saw an uncomplicated man, much like themselves, \nwho held the same traditional values as they did. They saw a man who \npersonified class. They saw a man who led by example, a man who never \ntook off his jacket in the Oval Office because he held The People's \nsacred trust in such high esteem. Most important of all, they saw a man \nwho trusted them to run their own lives.\n  No wonder the American people love Ronald Reagan. No wonder we \nelected him twice by overwhelming margins. He proved to everyone, at \nhome and abroad, that ``Government is not the solution--Government is \nthe problem.'' He gave us hope for the future. He gave us hope for our \ncountry. He gave us hope in ourselves.\n  He told us that it was ``morning in America'' again and that our \ngreat Nation is a ``shining city on the hill.''\n  Although President Reagan's voice has been silenced by Alzheimer's, \nwe can still hear the echoes of freedom ringing from his writings and \nhis presidency.\n  We can still pay homage to his deeds by recognizing the woman behind \nthe man, his wife, Nancy. Mrs. Reagan, we salute you.\n  Today we honor the life and leadership of Ronald Wilson Reagan. \nWithout his shining example, our country, and our world, would be a \nmuch darker place.\n  Happy Birthday Mr. President!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1058-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1058-S1059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ONLINE ACCESS TO CONGRESSIONAL DOCUMENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator \nMcCain to introduce a Senate resolution to provide Internet Access to \nimportant Congressional documents.\n  Our bipartisan resolution makes certain Congressional Research \nService products, lobbyist disclosure reports and Senate gift \ndisclosure reports available over the Internet to the American people.\n  The Congressional Research Service, CRS, has a well-known reputation \nfor producing high-quality reports and information briefs that are \nunbiased, concise, and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay \n$67 million a year to fund the CRS, deserve speedy access to these \npublic resources and have a right to see that their money is being \nspent well.\n  The goal of our legislation is to allow every citizen the same access \nto the wealth of CRS information as a Member of Congress enjoys today. \nCRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on \nhundreds of topics. American taxpayers have every right to direct \naccess to these wonderful resources.\n  Online CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the \npublic. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products \nand receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before the \nCongress. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to \npromote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able \nto make decisions and petition us to do the right things here in \nCongress.\n  Our legislation follows the model online CRS program in the House of \nRepresentatives and ensures that private CRS products will remain \nprotected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any \nproducts that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may \nprotect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. \nWe can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens \nthrough electronic access to invaluable CRS products.\n  In addition, the bipartisan resolution would provide public online \naccess to lobbyist reports and gift disclosure forms. At present, these \npublic records are available in the Senate Office of Public Records in \nRoom 232 of the Hart Building. As a practical matter, these public \nrecords are accessible only to those inside the Beltway.\n  I applaud the Office of Public Records for recently making \ntechnological history in the Senate by providing for lobbying \nregistrations through the Internet. The next step is to provide the \ncompleted lobbyist disclosure reports on the Internet for all Americans \nto see.\n  The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American \npeople to have everyday access to this public information. Our \nbipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age \nto allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in \ntheir official form, in context and without editorial comment. All \nAmericans should have timely access to the information that we already \nhave voted to give them.\n  And all of these reports are indeed ``public'' for those who can \nafford to hire a lawyer or lobbyist or who can afford to travel to \nWashington to come to the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building \nand read them. That is not very public. That does not do very much for \nthe average voter in Vermont or the rest of this country outside of \neasy reach of Washington. That does not meet the spirit in which we \nvoted to make these materials public, when we voted ``disclosure'' \nlaws.\n  We can do better, and this resolution does better. Any citizen in any \ncorner of this country with access to a computer at home or the office \nor at the public library will be able to get on the Internet and get \nthese important Congressional documents under our resolution. It allows \nindividual citizens to check the facts, to make comparisons, and to \nmake up their own minds.\n  I commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on \nopening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire \nfor the American people to have electronic access to many more \nCongressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days \nto let the information age open up the halls of Congress to all our \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal \naccess to at least that type of currency, and that is something which \nMembers on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and join in.\n  This bipartisan resolution is an important step in informing and \nempowering American citizens. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this legislation to make available useful Congressional \ninformation to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1059-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NONPROLIFERATION REPORT CARD\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a recent report \nreleased by The Russia Task Force entitled ``A Report Card on the \nDepartment of Energy's Nonproliferation Programs with Russia.'' This \nbipartisan Task Force was co-chaired by Lloyd Cutler and Howard Baker. \nThe report concludes that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nor weapons-usable material is ``the most urgent unmet national security \nthreat for the United States today.''\n  This conclusion restates similar conclusions of other reports and \nanalyses done over the past several years. The book Avoiding Nuclear \nAnarchy published in 1996 drew a similar conclusion. A January 2000 \nCenter for Strategic and International Study report, ``Managing the \nGlobal Nuclear Materials Threat'' provided a concise analysis and \nnumerous policy recommendations of this ``most devastating security \nthreat.''\n  The U.S. response has not been and still is not commensurate to the \nthreat.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction programs have achieved much and \ncontributed greatly to U.S. security. Still there is always room for \ninnovative approaches to remaining issues and faster progress.\n  The Department of Energy programs--from Materials Protection, Control \nand Accounting to the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention--have \nalso enhanced U.S. security. But their work is not even close to \ncomplete, and a ``clear and present danger'' looms.\n  I have repeatedly suggested that we have a very simple choice: we can \neither spend money to reduce the threat or spend more money in the \nfuture to defend ourselves. I am a strong believer that threat \nreduction is now underfunded and is the first-best approach in this \ncase.\n  The report estimated the cost at $30 billion to be provided not only \nfrom the U.S. budget, but also by Russia and other countries. The \nnational security benefits to U.S. citizens from securing 80,000 \nnuclear weapons and potential nuclear weapons would constitute the \nhighest return on investment of any current national security program.\n  How do we get there? One recommendation of the report is the dire \nneed for a White House-level nonproliferation czar. Not just the \nDepartment of Energy and the Defense Department are involved in Russia. \nWe have a number of federal agencies chipping away at specific, \nisolated aspects of the problem.\n  But we do not have a coherent, integrated agenda. Overlaps and \nshortfalls exist. But no one person--with budgetary responsibility and \nrequisite authority--can view the spectrum and identify the gaps, \nremedy inter-agency turf battles and bring the necessary coordination \nto get the job done efficiently and quickly.\n  A nonproliferation czar should be given access to the President and \nthe necessary budgetary powers. This person should be charged with \nformulating a cohesive strategy. This would allow us to coordinate and \nstreamline our efforts. This person would identify which programs are \nripe for more resources and which ones are already adequate to address \nthe immediate need.\n  The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation enacted in 1996 required that \nsuch a nonproliferation czar be put in place. Also, Section 3174 of the \nFY2001 Defense Authorization bill expressed again Congressional will to \nhave one person accountable for our nonproliferation efforts. The \nClinton Administration refused to adhere to the statute and repeatedly \nignored other Congressional attempts to address the coordination \nproblem. Other Commissions have also recommended this remedy in the \npast to no avail. I am hopeful that the national security team within \nthe new Administration will see the merits of this recommendation and \nact on it soon.\n  The Task Force also offered several other important insights and \nrecommendations. These included:\n\n       The threat today arises from Russia's weakened ability to \n     secure its nuclear arsenal. Contributing factors include, \n     delays in paying those who guard nuclear facilities, \n     breakdown in command structures and inadequate budgets for \n     stockpile protection.\n\n  I would go even further than that. I believe that it's the economics \nthat drives many of the threats and areas of potential conflict that \nthe U.S. faces with Russia today. They sell nuclear technologies to \nIran not because they like the Iranians and want to snub the Americans. \nThe Russians are also aware that Iran could present a threat should it \nacquire the requisite nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. \nHowever, the Russian decision is driven by economics--not by ideology, \nnot by historical ties, but by necessity. If we don't attempt to \naddress the underlying economics of the situation, cooperation with \nIran may continue and many other programs may eventually fail.\n\n       The President should develop a strategic plan, consulting \n     Congress and cooperating with the Russian Federation, to \n     secure all weapons-usable material located in Russia, and to \n     prevent the outflow of weapons of mass destruction-related \n     scientific expertise.\n\n  We can only move so fast as the Russians allow. We can only achieve \nsufficient transparency and get access so long as Russia agrees. \nHowever, I believe several existing programs, such as the Plutonium \nDisposition Agreement, have demonstrated that a serious U.S. \ncommitment, especially in financial terms, is exactly the appropriate \nincentive to get action.\n  Repeatedly, however, our nonproliferation programs with Russia are in \na Catch-22 situation. Congress will not adequately fund them until they \ndemonstrate success. A trickle at the tap is insufficient to persuade \nRussians of the seriousness of our intent. So, the U.S. programs \nstumble along unable to achieve the gains necessary because the \nRussians are reticent to play ball. And, in turn, Congress becomes even \nmore leery of providing any funding at all in light of the meager \ngains. It's in our immediate national security interest to remedy this \nsituation.\n\n       The plan should review existing programs, identifying \n     specific goals and measurable objectives for each program, as \n     well as providing criteria for success and an exit strategy.\n\n  It would be reasonable to propose that one plan be geared toward \naddressing the fundamental linkages between economic and social \ninstability in Russia and specific proliferation threats. Without \naddressing the relationship of Russians' economic situation to a \ndecaying nuclear command and control infrastructure, threats of \ndiversion from within, rather than from outside, the weapons complex, \nand many other tight relationships, we will fail to prevent \nproliferation.\n  The report envisions an 8-10 year time-frame. At that point, Russia \nwill hopefully be in a position to take over any remaining work.\n  In the next decade we could eliminate the greatest security challenge \nwe currently face. Inaction will only drive up costs to defend \nourselves against unknowables that we could have squelched had we had \ngreater foresight.\n  I believe President Bush and his team have foresight. President Bush \nrepeatedly mentioned the importance of these programs as an integral \npart of his national security strategy.\n  To quote our new National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice:\n\n       American security is threatened less by Russia's strength \n     than by its weakness and incoherence. This suggests immediate \n     attention to the safety and security of Moscow's nuclear \n     forces and stockpile.\n\n  I believe this recent report reiterates this clear fact and sets \nforth several very important policy recommendations for tackling this \nchallenge. I look forward to working with the new Administration to \nensure that a decade from now we have protected U.S. citizens from this \nproliferation threat and secured a more peaceful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1059-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1059-S1060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF THE HONORABLE BUD SHUSTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to honor \nmy\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\ncolleague, Congressman Bud Shuster, who retired from Congress last week \nafter serving fifteen terms in the United States House of \nRepresentatives. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve \nwith Congressman Shuster since 1981, when I first came to the United \nStates Senate. Bud Shuster has worked tirelessly on behalf of his \nconstituents in the 9th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, the \nentire state, and the nation.\n  During his time in office, Congressman Shuster consistently reached \nacross party lines to work with his colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to pass some of the most important public works bills in our \nnation's history. Over the years he built up a remarkable level of \nclout in Congress, affording him a great deal of success in enacting \nhis legislative priorities.\n  The name Bud Shuster is synonymous with transportation, and I have \nworked closely with Congressman Shuster on a number of transportation \nchallenges facing Pennsylvania and the nation, including the ISTEA and \nTEA-21 highway authorization bills, the effort to take the highway \ntrust fund off-budget, and the AIR-21 airport authorization bill. As \nChairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, he \nbrought a level of insight and tenacity into infrastructure, highways \nand airports that was really remarkable. Congressman Shuster's \nexpertise in the field of transportation and public works projects was \nsecond to none, and I valued his advice and counsel on a number of \nissues over the years.\n  Few may know that Congressman Shuster graduated Phi Beta Kappa from \nthe University of Pittsburgh, holds an MBA from Duquesne University and \na Ph.D. in business from the American University. While these academic \naccomplishments have suited him well in his role as a legislator, they \nhave also served him in his role as an accomplished author, penning two \nacclaimed novels about life in small-town Pennsylvania.\n  Bud Shuster's legislative skill and almost thirty years of dedicated \nservice to his constituency will be sorely missed in Pennsylvania and \nin America. We will be hard pressed to replace such a distinguished \npublic servant and I wish him the best of luck in his future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1060-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to \nmy former Senate colleague Alan Cranston. With Senator Cranston's \npassing, we lost a gifted leader, a shrewd politician and a dedicated \nreformer. It seemed significant that Senator Cranston passed away on \nNew Year's Eve 2000 because his life encompassed, literally, the 20th \ncentury. He was born the year World War I began, grew up during the \nDepression, covered the rise of fascism in Europe as a foreign \ncorrespondent and led the fight for a nuclear arms freeze during the \nCold War. He called luminaries of the age among his friends, most \nnotably Albert Einstein. Alan Cranston arrived in the Senate shortly \nafter I did and we served together for 24 years until his retirement in \n1993. We even hit the Presidential campaign trail together, both \nrunning for the White House on the Democratic ticket in 1984.\n  Those of us who served with Senator Cranston will remember the tally \nsheets he carried around to count votes. We will also remember the \ntalent he had for carefully preserving his own liberal ideologies while \nworking effectively with those on the opposite end of the political \nspectrum.

Mr. President, on Monday, January 22, introduced S. 142, \nthe Rural America Needs Competition to Help Every Rancher Act, \nlegislation to prohibit meatpackers from owning livestock prior to \nslaughter. My bill enjoys bipartisan support from Republican Senators \nChuck Grassley of Iowa and Craig Thomas of Wyoming. Senator Tom Daschle \ncosponsored my bill, as well. We believe this proposal will help \nrestore a competitive bidding process to the cash slaughter-livestock \nmarketplace by strengthening the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.\n  The growing, unabated trend of agribusiness consolidation and \nconcentration--a problem really sweeping across this entire nation--is \none of the prime concerns of South Dakota family farmers and ranchers. \nHowever, concern about meatpacker concentration is not new in the \nUnited States. Newspaper cartoons in the 1880s depicted companies that \nforced the pooling of livestock prior to any purchase agreement as \ncounterproductive ``beef trusts,'' engaging in discriminatory pricing \nbehavior. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson directed the Federal Trade \nCommission (FTC) to investigate meatpackers to determine if they were \nleveraging too much power over the marketplace.\n  As a result, the FTC released a report in 1919 stating that the ``Big \n5'' meatpackers at that time (Armour, Swift, Morris, Wilson, and \nCudahy) dominated the market with ``monopolistic control of the \nAmerican meat industry.'' The FTC also found these meatpackers owned \nstockyards, rail car lines, cold storage plants, and other essential \nfacilities for distributing food. These findings led to the Packers \nConsent Decree of 1920 which prohibited the Big 5 packers from engaging \nin retail sales of meat and forced them to divest of ownership \ninterests in stockyards and rail lines. Subsequently, Congress enacted \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 which prohibited meatpackers \nfrom engaging in unfair, discriminatory, and deceptive pricing \npractices.\n  Unfortunately--veiled behind what some mistakenly describe as \ninevitability--the meatpacking industry is once again crusading to take \nfree enterprise and market access away from independent livestock \nproducers. On January 1, 2001, Tyson Foods declared its intention to \nacquire IBP, and the Justice Department recently accepted Tyson's \nassertion that the deal poses no antitrust violation. I am very \ndisappointed with the Justice Department's decision, and believe their \ninaction on this matter makes it imperative for Congress to act.\n  I recently met with executives of Tyson and IBP to discuss the \nramifications of this merger. The CEO of Tyson made a provocative \npromise that Tyson will not replicate its current practice of owning \nlivestock--they now own swine and poultry--after buying IBP. \nEssentially, Tyson alleges they will not own cattle before slaughter. \nYet, it has been reported that Tyson would only make that promise for \nten years into the future, and the company has declined to comment on \nwhat purchasing practices a merged Tyson-IBP would utilize after that \ntime.\n  While this may be a short-term panacea to satisfy Federal agencies \nand elected officials, livestock producers--particularly cattle \nranchers--are in business for the long-term. Ten years can go by awful \nquickly in the cattle business. Moreover, I believe--as do most South \nDakotans--that doing and saying are two very different things. Indeed, \nLee Swenson, President of the National Farmers Union, has called upon \nTyson to issue a written commitment to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that Tyson won't go into the cattle owning business.\n  Consequently, my bill to forbid packer ownership of livestock \nrestores healthy competition to the cash marketplace and ensures that \nTyson and other vertical integrators won't engage in packer ownership. \nAgricultural concentration is not inevitable, it is sweeping the rural \nlandscape because of the choices we make. Given the Justice \nDepartment's reluctance to address this merger, Congress must take some \nresponsibility to recommend ways to strengthen our competition and \nanti-trust laws. I believe S. 142 is one step Congress can take.\n  Last year, several major farm organizations endorsed my bipartisan \neffort to prohibit meatpackers from owning livestock prior to \nslaughter. I would like to thank them for their support. These \ngrassroots groups include the\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\nNational Farmers Union, South Dakota Farmers Union, the South Dakota \nCattlemens Association, the Iowa Pork Producers Association, Illinois \nFarm Bureau, the Center for Rural Affairs, the Organization for \nCompetitive Markets, and the Ranchers--Cattlemens Action Legal Fund, R-\nCALF.\n  The members of these organizations believe that packer ownership and \ncaptive supply arrangements by meatpackers result in less competition \nfor all sellers in the market, even though producers or feeders who \nhave these arrangements often enter into them voluntarily. As a \nconsequence of having slaughter livestock supplies locked up through \ncaptive supplies, meatpackers do not have to bid competitively for all \nof their slaughter needs. This may depress the marketplace and restrict \naccess to producers and feeders without the arrangements. Packer \nownership of livestock increases the likelihood of price manipulation \nin the marketplace. When packers own livestock, they have the ability \nto push forward or hold back captive supplies in response to market \nprice. My bipartisan legislation is one way to achieve a more \ncompetitive bidding process in the cash market.\n  So today, almost a century after President Teddy Roosevelt used a big \nstick to give livestock producers a square deal, we again face a choice \nbetween corporate takeover of agriculture and a fight for free \nenterprise. I proudly cast my lot with free-enterprise family farm and \nranch agriculture that has served our country so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1061-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HOWARD BILLIMAN, JR.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to \nHoward Billiman, Jr., a decorated war hero, proud father and \ngrandfather, and loyal servant of this country. It is with profound \nsympathy and respect that I commemorate the passing of this honorable \nman. He exemplified the true spirit of an American hero, humbly willing \nto place his loyalty to this country before his own life.\n  Howard will be remembered as one of the celebrated Navajo Code \nTalkers of World War II, a dedicated Marine of the 2nd Marine Division \nwho answered his country's call to duty and served with distinction.\n  In reflection of his life, Howard's family has said that he never \nforgot his roots, beginning in the small town of Buell Park, Arizona. \nHe grew up in a small town, attending schools at Ft. Defiance and Ft. \nWingate, hardly known by most outsiders. Howard, at the young age of \n16, voluntarily enlisted in the Marine Corps, leaving behind his \nfamily, town, and childhood. He would face trials that would change his \nlife forever.\n  As one of 420 Navajos selected by the military, Howard quickly \nexcelled, and was appointed as one of the first instructors of the \nNavajo Code Talkers. With other young Navajos, Howard helped to create \nan unbreakable code that baffled the Japanese. Military experts now \nestimate that these code-talking efforts shortened the war in the \nPacific by at least one year--and some have even speculated that the \nwar may have turned out differently, had it not been for their heroic \ndeeds.\n  During World War II, Howard participated in every campaign of the 2nd \nMarine Division including the invasions of Saipan, Tinian, the Battle \nof Okinawa, and the occupation of Japan at Nagasaki. Howard did not \nseek credit nor praise, but quietly and modestly amassed a memorable \nrecord of brave acts and passionate service to his country and family. \nAs a tribute for his valiant service, Howard received numerous awards \nand honors including the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a \nPresidential Unit Citation with Star for Combat Action at Tarawa, the \nNavy/Marine Corps Occupation service Medal, and the Purple Heart for \nwounds received in combat. He was honorably discharged as a Corporal on \nJanuary 18, 1946.\n  After returning to the Navajo reservation, Howard settled down at \nBuell Park and then Sawmill, where he raised 10 children with his \nspouse, Mary Louise. He later became a proud grandfather of 42 \ngrandchildren.\n  In later years, as a member of the Navajo Code-Talkers Association, \nHoward received several more awards during travels with the group to \nPhiladelphia and Washington, D.C. He was the last surviving original \nNavajo Code Instructor.\n  Until recently, the American public was not aware of the tremendous \nsacrifice and contribution of Howard and other Code Talkers. Without \nthe Navajo Code Talkers, one can only imagine what tragedies might have \noccurred at that pivotal time in history. As Americans, we owe a debt \nof gratitude to the sacrifices of selfless patriots like Howard whose \nnoble service teaches us valuable lessons of duty and honor.\n  Howard Billiman, Jr. will be missed by his family and friends, but \nhis remarkable courage and patriotism will be long remembered by his \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1061-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAROL DIBATISTE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, It is an honor to take this \nopportunity to recognize Carol DiBattiste, under Secretary of the Air \nForce, who departed office last month. During her tenure, Under \nSecretary DiBattiste served with honor and distinction, providing \nexceptional leadership, and ensuring a promising future for the \nDepartment of Defense, the Air Force, and for American aerospace power.\n  Under Secretary DiBattiste earned a respected reputation for her \nenergy and enthusiasm, focused directly on improving quality of life \nfor Air Force members and their families. She quickly became the Air \nForce's key leader in the fight against retention shortages and \nrecruiting shortfalls; her successes in these endeavors are both \nimpressive and renowned.\n  Because of her immense talent and dedication, Under Secretary \nDiBattiste was selected to lead a special Department of Defense task \nforce to formulate anti-harassment policy--an emotionally and \npolitically charged subject. She delivered, as always, a brilliant \nsolution, and then returned her sharp focus back to her visionary and \naggressive campaign against recruiting shortfalls. The Air Force met \nits goals in recruiting last year mainly because of her visionary \nsolutions to create an Air Force Recruiting and Retention Task Force, \nan Air Force Marketing and Advertising Office, and a Strategic \nCommunications Outreach Program. Under Secretary DiBattiste is a leader \nwe respect because she leads by example. In a short, 12-month stretch \nof time, she delivered almost 100 speeches; and she traveled to over 85 \nbases and locations throughout the world during her tenure.\n  Carol DiBattiste has set a high standard of leadership, commitment, \nenergy, and service to country. I know my colleagues in Congress and \nour grateful nation join me in thanking her for her dedication and \ndistinguished service to our country; and we wish her continued success \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1061-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1061-S1062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WHITTEN PETERS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \nrecognize the contributions of a patriot, a leader, and a good friend \nof this institution who has departed government service to return to \nlife as a private citizen.\n  During, his four-year tensure as Under Secretary, Acting Secretary, \nand Secretary of the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters has lead his Service \nto new heights of achievement, and the world is better for it. At a \ntime when the global security environment became less predictable with \neach passing day, Whit Peters understood the need for the Air Force to \nbecome more responsive, more versatile, and more powerful--all at the \nsame time. With boundless energy and enthusiasm, he set out help the \nUnited States Air Force do those things and more.\n  As the leading architect of aerospace power, Whit Peters drove a \nfundamental re-examination of the relationship between air, space, and \ninformation systems. As a result, the Cold War Air Force he inherited \nis well on its way to becoming a modern, integrated aerospace force, \ndesigned to meet the challenges of a new millennium.\n  During Secretary Peters' tenure, in the troubled skies over Serbia, a \nwar was won for the first time with aerospace power alone--and we did \nit without losing a single American to enemy\n\n[[Page S1062]]\n\naction. Today, despots and dictators hesitate to act because they know \nAmerica's Air Force can bring power to bear at the point of decision in \na matter of minutes or hours. And, millions of people, the world over, \nlive better lives because of the humanitarian missions undertaken by \nour United States Air Force in the last four years.\n  While busy guiding the evolution of the Air Force's operational \ncapabilities, Secretary Peters also directed significant improvements \nin acquisition, logistics, and sustainment programs to ensure the best \npossible use of defense resources. He presided over the development of \nthe Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle--a revolutionary pairing of \nRussian propulsion technology with the best US commercial space-launch \ncapabilities--which will drastically lower the cost of placing \ncommercial and defense payloads in earth orbit. He led the \nconsolidation of five Air Force aircraft depots into three, reducing \ndepot over-capacity by 40 percent and saving the taxpayers over $377 \nmillion a year. And, he arrested a 10-year drop in aircraft readiness \nrates by putting two billion dollars worth of additional spares on the \nshelf where they will be useful to aircraft maintainers.\n  Most important, Whit Peters took care of his people. As every member \nof this body knows, he fought hard for improved pay, housing, and \nmedical benefits for every member of America's Air Force. He fought for \nbetter re-enlistment bonuses for people in hard-to-fill skills such as \nair traffic control, computer network administration, and over a \nhundred others. He pushed relentlessly for better child-care facilities \nto meet the demands of working families, and today 95 percent of all \nAir Force child care centers meet federal accreditation standards, \ncompared to just 10 percent of child care facilities nation-wide.\n  No wonder the enlisted men and women of the Air Force honored him \nwith their most prestigious recognition: induction into the Air Force \nOrder of the Sword. In the 53-year history of America's youngest \nservice, no other Air Force Secretary has ever been so honored. Nor has \nany service secretary been so respected by the men and women he leads.\n  Like the men and women of the Total Air Force--the Air National \nGuard, the Air Force Reserve, and the Regular Air Force--we hate to see \nWhit Peters go, and I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him \nthe fondest of farewells. He is a rare leader and an even rarer person \nin this town: a true gentleman who cares more about others than \nhimself. As the Air Force slogan says, ``No one comes close.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1062-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1062-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE OPERATION OF THE ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT--MESSAGE \n                        FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 203(f) of the Andean Trade Preference Act \n(ATPA) of 1991, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.), I transmit \nherewith the third report to the Congress on the Operation of the \nAndean Trade Preference Act.\n                                                      George W.

Chafee, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 247. A bill to provide for the protection of children from \ntobacco; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just under 3 years ago, on March 31, 1998, \nSenators Harkin, John Chafee and Graham teamed up to introduce the \nfirst comprehensive bipartisan legislation to reduce teen smoking. \nToday, I am pleased to announce that Senators Harkin, Lincoln Chafee \nand Graham are teaming up again with the same goal. We are re-\nintroducing the first bipartisan Senate bill to restore the Food and \nDrug Administration's authority to protect our kids from tobacco.\n  We hope the introduction of this bill is the beginning of a \nbipartisan push to get this type of common sense legislation passed. \nThe need is clear. As Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nrecognized, tobacco use among children and adolescents is probably the \nsingle most significant threat to public health in the United States. \nStudy after study has shown how the tobacco industry continues to \nsuccessfully target our children. In a survey done by the Campaign for \nTobacco Free Kids, seventy-three percent of teens reported seeing \ntobacco advertising in the previous two weeks, compared to only 33 \npercent of adults. And 77 percent of teens say it is easy for kids to \nbuy cigarettes.\n  This is why every day another 3000 kids in this country become \nregular smokers. And that is why cigarette smoking among high school \nseniors is at a 19-year high.\n  There is no question. Nicotine is an addictive product and cigarettes \nkill. Even the tobacco companies are starting to admit it. In fact, Big \nTobacco has known this for so long, they deliberately manipulate the \nnicotine in cigarettes to get more people addicted.\n  The FDA regulations, struck down by the Supreme Court last year, were \nabout stopping kids from smoking. These regulations were an investment \nin the future of our kids. They also provided consumers with critical \nprotections against false advertising and health claims by tobacco \nmanufacturers.\n  Tobacco companies are making harm reduction claims about new products \nwith no real independent examination or oversight. This deceptive, \nself-interested behavior is not part of a new pattern. The history of \ntobacco companies is rife with examples of deceptive practices designed \nto addict both adults and children with their harmful products. Our \nbill will ensure that this type of behavior is stopped.\n  Our legislation re-affirms the FDA's authority over tobacco products. \nIt classifies nicotine as a drug and tobacco products as drug delivery \ndevices. It allows FDA to implement a ``public health'' standard in its \nreview and regulation of tobacco products. Companies will be prevented \nfrom making claims of reduced risk unless they can show scientific \nevidence their product is actually safer.\n  By codifying FDA's regulation of 1996, our legislation also allows \nfor continuation of the critically important youth ID checks. It \nprovides needed youth access restrictions such as requiring tobacco \nproducts to be kept behind store counters and ban vending machines. It \nalso includes sensible advertising limits to reduce teen access to \ntobacco.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation. I \nhope we can work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to move this \nimportant issue forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the bill I have introduced expands the \nexisting production tax credit for renewable energy technology to cover \nall renewable energy technologies.\n  We have a crisis in America today. It is called electricity. It is \ncalled power. What took place and is taking place in California is only \na preview of things that are going to happen all over America unless we \ndo something about it. It is time to recognize the present system isn't \nworking.\n  We can criticize California and what they did. It is obvious to \neveryone that their deregulation program simply was not workable. It \nwasn't workable because they were energy inefficient. They did not \nproduce enough energy inside the State of California for the\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\nderegulation bill they passed to work. The only time a deregulation \nbill such as they had would work is if you have a State that produces \nmore electricity than it uses. There are some examples of that. \nCalifornia, however, decided they were going to deregulate, even though \nthey didn't have enough electricity produced within the State. They \nfigured they could buy cheap power elsewhere and have it brought into \nCalifornia. It was a recipe for disaster. The disaster hit. They are \nnow trying to work their way out of the problem.\n  There is no question that the current energy crisis in California has \ndemonstrated that America must diversify its energy mix. Already in \nNevada electricity rates have risen six times; the natural gas price \nhas increased more than 75 percent. This is a real problem. All we have \nto do is look around. I have a letter from a man named Ronald Feldstein \nfrom Carson City, NV. Among other things, he said: I was horrified to \nread that Southwest Gas was increasing our gas bills 35 percent \neffective February 1. Nevada is a poor State, mostly composed of senior \nretired citizens.\n  I add editorially, that isn't true, but we do have lots and lots of \nsenior citizens. To the author of this letter, it seems the State of \nNevada is composed mostly of senior citizens.\n  Last month, he says, his Southwest Gas bill was over $100; a 35-\npercent increase will mean an additional $35 on his electricity bill. \nThe only way a senior can afford such a huge increase is to give up \nsomething. In other words, lower his standard of living. That usually \nmeans giving up a certain prescription drug or lowering his food bill.\n  He went on to say other things, but I think that conveys the problem \nwe have in Nevada, and people all over America are about to have; that \nis, a huge increase in the price of fuel energy.\n  Ensuring that the lights and heat stay on is critical to sustaining \nAmerica's economic growth and our quality of life. The citizens of \nNevada and of this Nation demand a national energy strategy to ensure \ntheir economic well-being and security, and to provide for the quality \nof life they deserve.\n  It is a sad state of affairs that people like Mr. Feldstein, which \ncan be multiplied in the State of Nevada thousands and thousands of \ntimes, have to make significant sacrifices to pay their energy bills. \nPeople are saying: I'm going to have to cut back on my prescriptions. I \nwill have to cut back on the food I buy because I have a fixed income, \nand these power bills must be paid because I can't go without heat. \nCarson City, NV, is a cold place in the winter.\n  Nevadans understand that a national energy strategy must encompass \nsomething other than what we are doing. What we are doing now does not \nwork. We are depending mostly on importing oil, and people who import \nthe oil are manipulating the price and that price is going sky high. We \nhave to do something different. Of course, we have to do something \nabout conservation. We must be more efficient. We must also expand our \ngenerating capacity. How are we going to do that? There are some who \nsay that one of the ways is to do something with clean coal technology. \nThat is something I am willing to take a look at, hopefully, so we can \nreduce the global warming problem when it is necessary to use coal. But \nit is difficult to significantly reduce harmful emissions with coal.\n\n  I have supported clean coal technology. We have a plant near Reno, \nNV, that started out with clean coal technology. It is important we do \nthat. We are not going to develop any more nuclear powerplants in \nAmerica in the foreseeable future. There are too many problems. It is \ntoo expensive. We have no way of disposing of the waste.\n  What else can we do? We have powerplants now, but the primary way \nthey can be constructed is if they are fueled by natural gas. The cost \nof natural gas has gone way up.\n  What else can we do? I think one of the things we can do is develop \nrenewable energy resources. This is a responsible way to expand our \npower capacity without compromising air or water quality.\n  Fossil fuel plants pump out over 11 million tons of pollutants into \nour air each year. This is not 11 million pounds, but tons, into our \nair each year. Powerplants in the United States are responsible for 35 \npercent of our national carbon dioxide emissions which contribute to \nglobal climate change, global warming. Powerplants in the United States \nare responsible for 66 percent of sulphur dioxide, which causes acid \nrain, 25 percent of nitrogen oxides, which lead to smog, and 21 percent \nof mercury, which poisons fish and other animals. That is what \npowerplants in the United States do. There is no disputing that. That \nis a fact.\n  The legislation I have introduced will renew the wind power \nproduction tax credit, expand the credit to additional renewable \ntechnologies, including solar, open-loop biomass, poultry and animal \nwaste, geothermal, and incremental hydropower facilities. There is so \nmuch that can be done.\n  We are constructing, as we speak, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas at \nthe Nevada Test Site, wind-generating capacity that in 3 years will \nproduce from windmills enough electricity, 265 megawatts, to power a \nquarter of a million homes.\n  These renewable energy sources can enhance America's energy supply on \na scale of 1 to 3 years, considerably shorter than the time required \nfor a fossil fuel powerplant.\n  The proposed production tax credit for all these renewable energy \nsources would be made permanent. One of the problems we have with many \nof our tax credits is we do them for a short period of time. People \ndon't know whether they are going to be in existence, and therefore \nthey are unwilling to commit long term. This proposed production tax \ncredit, if it is made permanent, will encourage use of renewable energy \nand signal America's long-term commitment to clean energy, to a healthy \nenvironment, and to our energy independence.\n  My bill also allows for coproduction credits to encourage blending of \nrenewable energy with traditional fuels and provides a credit for \nrenewable facilities on Native American and Native Alaskan lands.\n  Renewable energy is poised to make major contributions to our \nNation's energy needs over the next decade.\n  It is so important we recognize that within 3 years one wind-\ngenerating farm in Nevada will produce 8 percent of all the electricity \nneeds of the state. We can multiply that by 6 years to 20 percent. It \nis remarkable what can be done.\n  Nevada has already developed 200 megawatts of geothermal power with a \nlonger term potential of more than 2,500 megawatts, enough capacity to \nmeet the State's energy needs. Growing renewable energy industries in \nthe United States will also help provide growing employment \nopportunities in the United States and help U.S. renewable technologies \ncompete in world markets.\n  In States such as Nevada, expanded renewable energy production will \nprovide jobs in rural areas--areas that have been largely left out of \nAmerica's recent economic boom.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated we could increase our \ngeneration of geothermal energy almost tenfold, supplying 10 percent of \nthe energy needs of the West, and expand wind energy production to \nserve the electricity needs of 10 million homes.\n  Renewable energy, as an alternative to traditional energy sources, is \na commonsense way to ensure the American people that they can have a \nreliable source of power at an affordable price.\n  The United States needs to move away from its dependence on fossil \nfuels that pollute the environment and undermine our national security \ninterests and balance of trade.\n  If there were ever a national security interest that we have, it \nwould be doing something about the importation of fossil fuel. We have \nto do something to stop our dependence on these countries that \nmanipulate the price of oil and other fuels. We have to do that; it is \nessential for our national security.\n  We need to send the signal to utility companies all over America that \nwe are committed in the long term to the growth of renewable energy. We \nmust accept this commitment for the energy security of the United \nStates, for the protection of our environment, and for the health of \nthe American people and literally the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lott, Mr.\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\n        Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Carper, Mr. L.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit to holders of qualified bonds issued by Amtrak, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, and 47 other \ncosponsors, the High Speed Rail Investment Act of 2001. With this \nlegislation we continue the work begun by our former colleagues, \nSenator Bill Roth, Senator Pat Moynihan, and especially Senator Frank \nLautenberg, who worked so hard in the last Congress to support high \nspeed intercity passenger rail.\n  Since the very first steam locomotive in this country rolled in \nNewcastle, Delaware, railroading has been a capital-intensive industry. \nFrom the rolling stock to the right of way, railroads require major \nlong-term investments. But unlike every other passenger rail system in \nthe world, Amtrak has lacked a secure source of public support for its \ncapital needs. Over the years, along with many of my colleagues here in \nthe Senate, I have looked for ways to right that wrong.\n  The bill that Senator Hutchison and I introduce today is designed to \nprovide Amtrak with the capital funds to establish a truly national \nhigh speed passenger rail system. The idea is simple, and it is modeled \non a program we already have in place to support another important \npublic priority, public school construction. Under this legislation, \nAmtrak is authorized to issue, over the next ten years, up to $12 \nbillion in bonds. Instead of an interest payment, the holders of those \nbonds will be paid by a rebate on their federal income taxes.\n  The funds generated from the sale of the bonds will be available for \ninvestments in high speed rail corridors throughout the country, from \nthe established and profitable Northeast Corridor to planned corridors \nfrom Florida to the Pacific Northwest. One thing I learned from my days \non the County Council in Delaware was that each route on a bus system \nsupports and sustains the others. Cut one route, and ridership will \nfall off on the others as the whole system becomes less useful. \nConversely, the more complete the system the more people will find that \nit meets their needs.\n  Another thing I learned on the county council, Mr. President, is that \nif state and local governments are required to put up some of their own \nfunds to match assistance from the federal government, they will think \nlong and hard about the best use of their funds. That is why this \nlegislation requires a twenty percent match by the state before a high \nspeed rail project can qualify for the support this bill provides. This \nprovision not only provides an additional safeguard that high speed \nrail investments meet the many real needs the states have, but it also \nassures that the funds will be there to pay off the bonds as they come \ndue.\n  Before a project is eligible for the funds raised under this bill, it \nmust be reviewed by the Secretary of Transportation for its financial \nsoundness, its role in a national passenger rail system, and its \ncontribution to balance among the many regional corridors in the \nnational system.\n  I know that I don't have to tell my colleagues about the growing \nchorus of public complaints about air travel in this country. All over \nthe country, overworked and over booked airports and flyways keep \npassengers sitting in terminals or out on the runways, waiting for some \nmovement in a clogged system. The vast majority of our most crowded \nairports are located near rail lines that could take some of those \npassengers where they need to go faster, safer, and more comfortably.\n  But only if we make the same investment in passenger rail that every \nother advanced economy does, Mr. President. Today, those tracks carry \nno passengers while our airports are bursting at the seams.\n  The same is true for the major highway corridors between our nation's \ncities. Those arteries are clogged with every kind of traffic, from \nfreight haulers to vacationers to business travelers. Many of them run \nparallel to major rail corridors, that could share some of that load. \nBut only, Mr. President, if we make the same investment in passenger \nrail that every other advanced economy does.\n  Just look at the lack of balance in our transportation spending, Mr. \nPresident. We spend $80 billion a year on our highways. We spend a \nbillion just cleaning up road kills, and more than a billion a year \nsalting icy roads. But we spend less than $600 million a year on rail \ninfrastructure.\n  We spend $19 billion a year on aviation, but, again, less than $600 \nmillion on rail.\n  These numbers are even more disturbing when you realize what you get \nfor each dollar spent. Look at the enormous cost of individual \nprojects. Construction of a freeway in Los Angeles costs $125 million \nper mile. Per mile, Mr. President. But that is cheap compared to the \n``Big Dig'' Central Artery in Boston--the price tag on that is $1.5 \nbillion per mile. Airport construction is just as expensive: the Denver \nInternational Airport cost $4.2 billion. To expand the Los Angeles \nInternational Airport will involve $3 billion to $4 billion in ground \ntransportation costs alone.\n  High speed passenger rail investments can get a lot more done for a \nlot less money--five to ten times as much as an investment in new \nhighways. For example, expanding I-95, our major east-coast highway \ncorridor, by just one lane can cost as much as $50 million a mile. That \nworks out to about 45 passengers per hour for every million dollars. \nBut a mile of new, high-speed rail track, which can cost $8 million a \nmile, will move 450 passengers per hour for every million dollars \ninvested. That's a good deal all around.--fewer cars, less pollution, \nmore people getting where they want to go.\n  Under the terms of the Amtrak Reform Act of 1997, we have put Amtrak \non a path to self-sufficiency in its operating budget by the year 2003. \nI have said many times that I do not think that this is the wisest \ncourse. Given the long history of underfunding Amtrak's needs, I am far \nfrom convinced that we have put Amtrak in a position to reach full \noperating self sufficiency by that artificial deadline. But whatever we \nmake of that deadline on operating support, Mr. President, it is clear \nthat the very least we can do is provide Amtrak with the capital funds \nto become the passenger rail service this nation needs.\n  With the commitment of the leadership in both parties, with the \nsupport of over half of the Senate on the day of its introduction, this \nlegislation is off to a great start. We will need all of these \nresources and more to see this through to final passage, and to get a \nreal, world-class passenger rail system for the United States under \nway.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join our esteemed majority \nand minority leaders in sponsoring the High Speed Rail Investment Act \nof 2001. I am proud that our two leaders have been willing and able to \nwork in a bipartisan manner to fulfill a promise that they made last \nmonth to re-introduce this critical legislation. I thank them, and I \nthank Senator Biden and Senator Hutchison for their strong leadership \nas well. Their commitment to this bill cannot be overstated.\n  This legislation would allow Amtrak to sell $12 billion in bonds over \nthe next ten years and permit the federal government to provide tax \ncredits to bondholders in lieu of interest payments. Amtrak would use \nthis money to upgrade existing rail lines to high-speed rail \ncapability. This bill has supporters from both parties and all regions \nof the country.\n  Mr. President, high speed rail is not a partisan issue. It is not a \nregional issue. It is not an urban issue. The High-Speed Rail \nInvestment Act has the support of the National Governors Association, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures. Thirty newspapers, from the New York Times and Providence \nJournal, to the Houston Chronicle and Seattle Post Intelligencer, have \ncalled for the enactment of this legislation.\n  It is in our national interest to construct a national infrastructure \nthat is truly intermodal. Rail transportation helps alleviate the \nstress placed on our environment by air and highway transportation. It \nis a sad fact that America's rail transportation, and its lack of a \nnational high-speed rail system, lags well behind rail transportation \nin most other nations--we spend less, per capita, on rail \ntransportation than Estonia and Greece.\n  Mr. President, I know I made many of these same points on the floor \nof the Senate in December when we discussed a similar version of the \nHigh Speed Rail Investment Act. However, I believe that this \nlegislation is critical to our nation's transportation infrastructure \nneeds, and these facts bear repeating:\n  The federal government has invested $380 billion in our highways and \n$160 billion in airports since Amtrak was created. By contrast, the \nfederal government has spent only about $30 billion on Amtrak. We have \nspent just four percent of our transportation budget on rail \ntransportation in the last 30 years. The Congress has mandated that \nAmtrak soon achieve operational self-sufficiency. That does not, nor \nshould it, preclude further capital improvement grants. This is often \nmisunderstood and misinterpreted. Amtrak has reduced its operating \nlosses over the last two years, and remains capable of meeting its \ngoal. However, it will continue to need the federal government to \nsupport its track upgrades, rolling stock improvements and other large-\nscale upgrades so that it may\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\nmaintain its trademark quality service.\n  There is a compelling need to invest in high-speed rail. Our highways \nand skyways are overburdened. Intercity passenger miles traveled have \nincreased 80 percent since 1988, but only 5.5 percent of that has come \nfrom increased rail travel. Meanwhile, our congested skies have become \neven more crowded. The result, predictably, is that air travel delays \nare up 58 percent since 1995. Things have gotten so bad in Chicago that \nO'Hare airport maintains 1,500 cots for snow-bound travelers. This \nsummer, the airport had to order additional cots to accommodate \npassengers left stranded by myriad delays and cancellations.\n  Amtrak ridership is on the rise. More than 22.5 million passengers \nrode Amtrak in Fiscal Year 2000, a million more than the previous year. \nNearly six million riders took Amtrak in the first quarter of this \nfiscal year, the best first quarter in the company's 30-year history. \nRidership for the quarter was up 8.5 percent, while ticket revenue \nclimbed almost 14 percent over the first quarter of FY00. We should \nwelcome that increased use and support it by giving Amtrak the \nresources it needs to provide high-quality, dependable service.\n  The High-Speed Rail Investment Act is critical to the future of \nAmtrak. For about the cost of the new Denver International Airport, we \ncan improve intercity transportation in 29 states. For less than double \nthe cost of constructing the new Woodrow Wilson bridge improving \ntransportation in two states, we can create eight high-speed rail \ncorridors in 29 states.\n  High-speed rail is a viable transportation alternative. There is a \nlarge and growing demand for rail service in the Northeast Corridor. \nAmtrak captures almost 70 percent of the business rail and air travel \nmarket between Washington and New York and 30 percent of the market \nshare between New York and Boston. True high-speed rail will \nundoubtedly increase that market share. These new trains, like the \nAcela Express that debuted in the Northeast this year, currently run at \nan average of only 82 miles per hour, but with track improvements, will \nrun at 130 miles per hour.\n  As a nation, we have recognized the importance of having the very \nbest communication system, and ours is the envy of the world. That \ninvestment is one of reasons our economy is the strongest in the world. \nAnd we should do the same for our transportation system. It should be \nequally modern and must be fully intermodal. Rail transportation is a \npart of that network and I hope that we can pass this critical, cost-\nefficient legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 252. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize appropriations for State water pollution control revolving \nfunds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nWater Infrastructure Financing Act of 2001, legislation which will \nreauthorize the highly successful, but undercapitalized, Clean Water \nState Revolving Loan Fund, SRF Program administered by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Clean Water SRF Program is an \neffective and immensely popular source of funding for wastewater \ncollection and treatment projects. Congress created the Clean Water SRF \nProgram in 1987 to replace the direct grants program that was enacted \nas part of the landmark 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or, \nas it is known, the Clean Water Act. State and local governments have \nused the Federal Clean Water SRF to help meet critical environmental \ninfrastructure financing needs. The program operates much like a \ncommunity bank, where each state determines which projects get built.\n  The performance of the Clean Water SRF Program has been spectacular. \nTotal federal capitalization grants have been nearly doubled by non-\nfederal funding sources, including state contributions, leveraged \nbonds, and principal and interest payments. Communities of all sizes \nare participating in the program, and approximately 7,000 projects \nnationwide have been approved to date.\n  As in many states, Ohio has needs for public wastewater system \nimprovements which greatly exceed typical Clean Water SRF funding \nlevels. For instance, in fiscal year 2001, a level of $1.35 billion was \nappropriated for the Clean Water SRF. However, in Ohio alone, about $4 \nbillion of improvements have been identified as necessary to address \ncombined serve overflow, CSO, problems, according to the latest state \nfigures. The City of Akron, for example, has proposed a Long Term \nControl Plan that will cost more than $248 million to implement--nearly \n20 percent of the total SRF level appropriated in fiscal year 2001. \nBecause of Akron's CSO problem, city sewer rates will more than double \nwithout outside funding.\n  Further, estimates indicate that among Ohio towns with a population \nof less than 10,000, there exists $1.2 billion in CSO needs. In recent \nyears, Ohio cities and villages have been spending more on maintaining \nand operating their systems in order to stave-off the inevitable \nupgrades. Nevertheless, their systems are aging and will need to be \nreplaced.\n  While the Clean Water SRF Program's track record is excellent, the \ncondition of our nation's overall environmental infrastructure remains \nalarming. A 20-year needs survey conducted by the EPA in 1996 \ndocumented $139 billion worth of wastewater capital needs nationwide. \nIn 1999, the national assessment was revised upward to nearly $200 \nbillion, in order to more accurately account for expected sanitary \nsewer needs. This amount may be too small; private studies demonstrate \nthat total needs are closer to $300 billion when anticipated \nreplacement costs are considered.\n  Authoziation for the Clean Water SRF expired at the end of fiscal \nyear 1994, and the continued failure of Congress to reauthorize the \nprogram sends an implicit message that wastewater collection and \ntreatment is not a national priority. The longer we have an absence of \nauthorization of this program, the longer it creates uncertainty about \nthe program's future in the eyes of borrowers, which may delay or, in \nsome cases, prevent project financing. In order to allow any kind of \nsubstantial increase in spending, reauthorization of the Clean Water \nSRF program is necessary in the 107th Congress.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will authorize a total of $15 \nbillion over the next five years for the Clean Water SRF. Not only \nwould this authorization bridge the enormous infrastructure funding \ngap, the investment would also pay for itself in perpetuity by \nprotecting our environment, enhancing public health, creating jobs and \nincreasing numerous tax bases across the country. Additionally, the \nbill will provide technical and planning assistance for small systems, \nexpand the types of projects eligible for loan assistance, and offer \nfinancially-distressed communities extended loan repayment periods and \nprincipal subsidies. The bill also will allow states to give priority \nconsideration to financially-distressed communities when making loans.\n  The health and well-being of the American public depends on the \ncondition of our nation's wastewater collection and treatment systems. \nUnfortunately, the facilities that comprise these systems are often \ntaken for granted absent a crisis. Let me assure my colleagues that the \ncosts of poor environmental infrastructure cannot be ignored and the \nprice will pay for continued neglect will far exceed the authorization \nlevel of this bill. Now is the time to address our infrastructure needs \nwhile the costs are manageable.\n  In just over a decade, the Clean Water SRF Program has helped \nthousands of communities meet their wastewater treatment needs. My bill \nwill help ensure that the Clean Water SRF Program remains a viable \ncomponents in the overall development of our nations' infrastructure \nfor years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation, and I urge its speedy consideration by the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Allard, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 253. A bill to reauthorize the Rural Education Initiative in \nsubspart 2 of part J of title X of the Elementary and\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\nSecondary Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nEducation Improvement Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, \nSenators Conrad, Gregg, Hutchinson, Enzi, Hagel, Roberts, Dorgan, \nThomas, Allard, Burns, and Johnson, as original cosponsors of this \ncommon sense, bipartisan proposal to help rural schools make better use \nof federal education funds. I also want to acknowledge the valuable \nassistance provided over the past two years by the American Association \nof School Administrators.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Rural Education Initiative Act--the \nfoundation for today's legislation. I am pleased that the REIA was \nlargely incorporated into the final appropriations bill, thus allowing \nsmall, rural school districts to combine funds from four formula grant \nprograms, giving them the flexibility to target funds toward their \nstudents' most pressing needs. While the passage of this bill \nrepresented substantial progress, it was a one-year authorization only, \nand no appropriations were provided for the supplemental grant program \nauthorized by the new law.\n  Mr. President, the bill we introduce today strengthens the \nlegislation enacted last year. The Collins-Conrad bill would provide a \n5-year authorization of the rural education provisions enacted last \nyear and authorize $150 million annually for the supplemental grant \nprogram.\n  Our legislation would benefit school districts with fewer than 600 \nstudents in rural communities. More than 35 percent of all school \ndistricts in the United States have 600 or fewer students. In Maine, \nthe percentage is even higher: 56 percent of our 284 school districts \nhave fewer than 600 students. Our legislation would help them overcome \nsome of the most challenging obstacles they face in participating in \nfederal education programs.\n  By way of background, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nauthorizes formula and competitive grants that help many of our local \nschool districts to improve the education of their students. These \nfederal grants support such laudable goals as the professional \ndevelopment of teachers, the incorporation of technology into the \nclassroom, gifted and talented programs, and class size reduction. \nSchools receive categorical grants, each with its own authorized \nactivities and regulations, each with its own red tape and paperwork. \nUnfortunately, as valuable as these programs may be for many large \nurban and suburban school districts, they often do not work well in \nrural areas for two major reasons.\n  First, formula grants often do not reach small, rural schools in \namounts sufficient to achieve the goals of the programs. These grants \nare based on school district enrollment, and, therefore, smaller \ndistricts often do not receive enough funding from any single grant to \ncarry out a meaningful activity. One Main district, for example, \nreceived a whopping $28 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug-free \nSchool program. This amount is certainly not sufficient to achieve the \ngoal of that federal program, yet the school district could not use the \nfunds for any other program.\n  To give school districts more flexibility to meet local needs, our \nlegislation would allow rural districts to combine the funds from four \ncategorical programs and use them to address the school district's \nhighest priorities.\n  The second problem facing many rural school districts is that they \nare essentially shut out of the competitive programs because they lack \nthe grant-writers and administrators necessary to apply for, win, and \nmanage competitively awarded grants. The Rural Education Improvement \nAct would remedy this program by providing small, rural districts with \na formula grant in lieu of eligibility for the competitive programs of \nthe ESEA.\n  A district would be able to combine this new supplemental grant with \nthe funds from the formula grants and use the combined monies for any \npurposes that would improve student achievement or teaching quality. \nDistricts might use these funds to hire a new reading or math teacher, \nfund professional development, offer a program for gifted and talented \nstudents, or purchase computers or library books.\n  Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives \nwould mean for one school Maine School District in Northern Maine with \n400 students from the towns of Frenchville and St. Agatha receives four \nseparate formula grants ranging from $1,904 for Safe and Drug Free \nSchools to $9,542 under the Class Size Reduction Act. You can see the \nproblem right there. The amounts of the grants are so small that they \nreally are not useful in accomplishing the goals of the program. The \ntotal for all four programs is just under $16,000. Yet, each must be \napplied for separately, used for different--federally mandated--\npurposes, and accounted for independently.\n  Superintendent Jerry White told me that he needs to submit eight \nseparate reports, for four programs, to receive this $16,000. Under our \nbill, this school district would be freed from the multiple \napplications and reports and would have $16,000 to use for its \neducational priorities.\n  Moreover, since this district does not have the resources to apply \nfor the competitive grant programs, our legislation would result in a \nsupplemental grant of $34,000 as long as the District foregoes its \neligibility for the competitively awarded grants. Under the Rural \nEducation Improvement Act, therefore, the District will have $50,000 \nand the flexibility to use these funds for its most pressing needs.\n  But with this flexibility and additional funding come responsibility \nand accountability. In return for the advantages our bill provides, \nparticipating districts would be held accountable for demonstrating \nimproved student performance over a 3-year period. Schools will be held \nresponsible for what is really important--improved student \nachievement--rather than for time-consuming paperwork. As \nSuperintendent White told me, ``Give me the resources I need plus the \nflexibility to use them, and I am happy to be held accountable for \nimproved student performance. It will happen.''\n  Mr. President, we must improve our educational system without \nrequiring every school to adopt a plan designed in Washington and \nwithout imposing overly burdensome and costly regulations in return for \nfederal assistance. Our bill would allow small, rural districts to use \ntheir own strategies for improvement without the encumbrance of onerous \nfederal regulations and unnecessary paperwork.\n  Congress took an important step last year by recognizing that small, \nrural districts face challenges in using federal programs to help \nprovide a quality education for their students. Due to our efforts last \nyear, the law now reflects Congress's intention to provide these \ndistricts more flexibility and additional funding. This legislation \nwill move us from intention to implementation by providing sustained \nsupport, flexibility, and funding for our rural schools.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, National Rural Education \nAssociation, the Association of Educational Service Agencies, and the \nNational Education Association, and I ask unanimous consent that \nendorsement letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    National Rural\n\n\n                                        Education Association,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The National Rural Education \n     Association would like to applaud your recognition of the \n     unique hardships that face small, rural schools in respect to \n     their federal funding.

Federal \n     funding formulas are based on enrollment, which prevent small \n     schools from receiving adequate resources. Due to the small \n     numbers of students, these schools rarely receive enough \n     combined funds to hire a teacher. Small schools also lack the \n     administrative capacity to apply for competitive grants. This \n     puts small rural schools on unequal federal footing with many \n     of their urban and suburban counterparts.\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\n       Last December, your Rural Education Initiative was included \n     in the omnibus appropriations bill. The new law allows \n     districts to commingle some of the federal funds they receive \n     and use them in areas to improve student achievement and \n     professional development. In addition, it included \n     legislation that would provide a minimum of $20,000 to \n     schools of 600 or less. These are the same schools are \n     typically receiving approximately $5,000 from the federal \n     government.\n       By setting a baseline amount and allowing schools to \n     commingle the funds, the local school district will have the \n     opportunity to hire a specialist, provide signing bonuses to \n     teachers, extend after school opportunities and enhance many \n     other aspects of the small school budget. Most of all, it \n     would enable the school to provide an education consistent \n     with local needs.\n       Once again, we would like to extend our grateful thanks for \n     your leadership on this issue. We urge the full Senate to \n     reauthorize and fully fund this legislation on behalf of \n     those schools who are too small to be heard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Mary Conk,\n     Legislative Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                     of School Administrators,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.\n     Hon.

The changes \n     proposed in your reauthorization bill would improve upon last \n     year's effort by providing more flexibility and increased \n     funding for small isolated schools. Thank you for your \n     continuing advocacy on behalf of rural schoolchildren and \n     rural communities.\n       Currently small and rural school districts find it \n     difficult to compete with larger districts for hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in federal education competitive grants. \n     Small, isolated districts receive well below their share of \n     competitive grants, usually because they lack the \n     administrative staff to apply for grants. The problem is \n     compounded by shortcomings of federal formula programs. \n     Federal education programs allocate funds based on \n     enrollment, typically providing very little revenue to the \n     smallest schools. The Collins-Conrad Rural Education \n     Initiative would level the playing field by ensuring that \n     each small district receives at least enough funding to hire \n     a teacher or a specialist.\n       Studies in individual states and the National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress document the difficulties of small, \n     rural school districts:\n       Difficulty attracting and retaining quality teachers, and \n     administrators,\n       Inability to offer advanced academic or vocational courses,\n       Disproportionate spending on transportation,\n       Loss of a sense of community when schools are consolidated, \n     and\n       Inability to process all the federally required paperwork \n     normally required of recipients.\n       The Rural Education Initiative would help small/rural \n     districts by providing enough school improvements funds to \n     implement real change. Rural and small school districts would \n     be eligible for grants of $20,000 to $60,000 depending upon \n     enrollment. Although the program was passed into law last \n     year, it has not yet been funded. More than 4,000 small and \n     rural school districts benefit from the flexibility provided \n     in last year's program; those same 4,000 districts will be \n     able to advance even greater improvements when the program is \n     reauthorized and appropriated.\n       The funds would be used to enhance the reading and math \n     proficiency of students; to provide an education consistent \n     with local needs; and to enable small/rural communities to \n     prepare young people to compete in the emerging knowledge-\n     based economy.\n       The Association is grateful to you, Kent Conrad, R-ND; Judd \n     Gregg, R-NH; Conrad Burns, R-MT; Chuck Hagel, R-NE; Michael \n     Enzi, R-WY; Pat Roberts, R-KS; Tim Johnson, D-SD; and Byron \n     Dorgan, D-ND for their advocacy on behalf of rural school \n     children.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Association of \n     Education Service Agencies, we would like to express our \n     gratitude for your work on the Rural Education Initiative. \n     Your efforts during the 106th Congress helped rectify many of \n     the inequalities that disadvantage small school districts. By \n     increasing the flexibility of federal education programs, \n     local districts can now make better use of federal dollars. \n     This year, you have taken that effort one step further with \n     the reauthorization of the Rural Education Initiative. The \n     Collins-Conrad reauthorization proposal would complete last \n     year's goal by ensuring that small rural schools are treated \n     fairly by federal formula programs and funded at an adequate \n     level.\n       Educational Service Agencies (ESAs) are intermediate units \n     that frequently provide assistance to small and rural schools \n     that do not have the administrative staff to operate some \n     education programs in-house. When a small rural school \n     district receives a tiny federal education, ESAs often \n     facilitate consortia to make better use of federal funds. \n     ESAs are the primary source of professional development and \n     technology assistance to rural schools. The members of our \n     association understand first-hand the particular needs of \n     rural districts; your proposal offers the best hope for \n     accommodating those needs and the best means for improving \n     rural education.\n       Rural schoolchildren deserve to benefit from the federal \n     education programs enjoyed by urban and suburban students. We \n     thank you for your work on the Rural Education Initiative, \n     and we offer our full support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Hunter,\n     Legislative Specialist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2001.\n\nStatement of the National Education Association in Support of the Rural \n                          Education Initiative\n\n       The National Education Association's (NEA) supports the \n     concepts included in the Rural Education Initiative (REI), \n     introduced today in the United States Senate by Senators \n     Collins and Conrad.\n       NEA research demonstrates the need for increased emphasis \n     on meeting the needs of rural schools. For example, 49 \n     percent of the nation's public schools, teaching 40 percent \n     of the nation's students, are located in rural areas and \n     small towns. Yet, schools in rural and small towns receive \n     only 22 percent of total federal, state, and local education \n     spending. In addition, federal funding formulas often provide \n     rural and small towns with small allotments that afford \n     little or no actual assistance but require significant \n     paperwork.\n       The Rural Education Initiative represents an important step \n     toward addressing the unique problems associated with \n     education in small towns and rural areas. We encourage its \n     passage into law.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Susan Collins and Senator Judd Gregg, to introduce \nthe Rural Education Initiative (REI). We introduced similar \nlegislation, S. 1225, during the 106th Congress to respond to a number \nof challenges facing small, rural schools, and I am pleased that we \nwere successful in incorporating some of the major the provisions of S. \n1225 in the FY 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This Congressional \naction will provide flexibility for school officials from small, rural \nschools to make better use of Federal education funds for critical \neducational needs at the local level.\n  Under Public law 106-1033, Congress authorized school districts with \nfewer than 600 students, and a Department of Education (DOE) Locale \nCode designation of 7 or 8 to combine funding from four Federal \neducation programs (Titles, II, IV, VI and Class Size Reduction) and \nuse that funding to supplement Federal education programs under Titles \nI, II, IV, and VI. Congress also authorized, although was not able to \nfund, supplemental grants of up to $60,000 to assist small, rural \nschool districts develop programs to improve academic achievement and \nthe quality of instruction. Funding the supplemental grants program in \nthe Rural Education Initiative is a major priority during consideration \nof the Elementary and Secondary Reauthorization in the 107th Congress.\n  Today, we are re-introducing legislation to extend the authority \nunder the Rural Education Initiative in P.L. 106-1033 for a five-year \nperiod to permit small, rural school districts to continue to have \nflexibility in the use of funds from a limited number of Federal \neducation programs. This bill will also authorize $150 million for \nsupplemental grants of up to $60,000 to rural schools to improve \nstudent achievement, provide professional development opportunities for \neducators or undertake education reform activities. School districts \nwith fewer than 600 students and with a DOE Locale Code of 7 or 8 will \nbe eligible to participate in the REI program.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Rural Education Initiative has \nreceived bipartisan support and is cosponsored today by Senators \nCollins, Gregg, Hagel, Enzi, Hutchinson, Dorgan, Roberts, Burns, \nJohnson, and Thomas. The Rural Education Initiative is\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nalso being endorsed by the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Education Association, the National Rural \nEducation Association, and the Association of Educational Service \nAgencies.\n  Mr. President, small rural schools face a growing number of unique \nchallenges because of declining school age populations, aging \nfacilities, and significant distances and remote locations for many \nrural school districts. While increased Federal education funding and \ntargeting of these funds has been very helpful for rural school \ndistricts, these efforts alone are not responding sufficiently to the \nneeds of many small, rural schools.\n  Many rural schools, for example, while recognizing the importance of \nnew initiatives like Class Size Reduction, are already at the levels \nrecommended under the Class Size Reduction Initiative. Under current \nlaw, rural schools have only limited flexibility to use Class Size \nfunds to meet other local education priorities. In many instances, the \nClass Size funds and allocations from a number of other Federal formula \nprograms are not sufficient to permit effective use of the funds by the \nrural district.\n\n  Additionally, although rural schools are able to apply for DOE \ncompetitive grant programs, rural schools are not able to compete as \neffectively as some urban and suburban schools because limited \nresources do not permit many smaller, rural districts to hire \nspecialists to prepare grant applications to compete for these funds. \nIn some cases, the only option for a smaller district is to form a \nconsortium with other schools to qualify for sufficient funding.\n  The difficulties accessing DOE competitive grant funds by rural \nschools are summed up well by Elroy Burkle, Superintendent of the \nStarkweather Public School District, a district with 131 students. \nBurkle remarked, ``schools districts have lost their ability to access \nfunds directly, and as a result of forming these consortiums in order \nto access these monies, it is my opinion, we have lost our individual \nability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that would be \nconducive to promoting the educational needs of our individual \nschools.''\n  Mr. President, the Rural Education Initiative responds to many of the \nconcerns of Elroy Burkle and thousands of other school officials from \nsmaller, rural school districts. The REI authorizes flexibility for \nlocal schools officials to more effectively use certain DOE formula \nfunds. The legislation also authorizes supplemental grant funding for \nrural school districts who are not in a position to apply for some DOE \ncompetitive grant programs and in need additional funds for programs to \nimprove student achievement or provide professional development \nopportunities for educators.\n  As we begin our debate in the 107th Congress on the education \nproposals recently presented by President Bush and reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, it's very important that we \nconsider the Rural Education Initiative as part of this debate. No \nissue is more important for rural America than the future of our \nschools. We must make certain that Federal education dollars are \navailable to assist small, rural schools to provide the best education \nopportunities for children in rural America.\n  I commend Senator Collins for taking the lead again in the 107th \nCongress on this important education issue. I also congratulate the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators and the National \nEducation Association for their leadership on rural education issues \nand the development of this important rural education initiative. I \nstrongly urge the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nto carefully examine the many concerns of schools in rural America and \nto support reauthorization of the Rural Education Initiative that was \nadopted during the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the endorsements of the \nRural Education Initiative from the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Education Association the National Rural \nEducation Association, and the Association of Educational Service \nAgencies be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of the National Education Association in Support of the Rural \n                          Education Initiative\n\n       The National Education Association's (NEA) supports the \n     concepts included in the Rural Education Initiative (REI), \n     introduced today in the United States Senate by Senators \n     Collins and Conrad.\n       NEA research demonstrates the need for increased emphasis \n     on meeting the needs of rural schools.

Most of all, it \n     would enable the school to provide an education consistent \n     with local needs.\n       Once again, we would like to extend our grateful thanks for \n     your leadership on this issue. We urge the full Senate to \n     reauthorize and fully fund this legislation on behalf of \n     those schools who are too small to be heard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Mary Conk,\n     Legislative Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                 Educational Service Agencies,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, February 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the Association of \n     Education Service Agencies, we would like to express our \n     gratitude for your work on the Rural Education Initiative. \n     Your efforts during the 106th Congress helped rectify many of \n     the inequalities that disadvantage small school districts. By \n     increasing the flexibility of federal education programs, \n     local districts can now make better use of federal dollars. \n     This year, you have taken that effort one step further with \n     the reauthorization of the Rural Education Initiative. The \n     Collins-Conrad reauthorization proposal would complete last \n     year's goal by ensuring that small rural schools are treated \n     fairly by federal formula programs and funded at an adequate \n     level.\n       Educational Service Agencies (ESAs) are intermediate units \n     that frequently provide assistance to small and rural schools \n     that do not have the administrative staff to operate some \n     education programs in-house. When a small rural school \n     district receives a tiny federal education, ESAs often \n     facilitate consortia to make better use of federal funds. \n     ESAs are the primary source of professional development and \n     technology assistance to rural schools. The members of our \n     association understand first-hand the particular needs of \n     rural districts; your proposal offers the best hope for \n     accommodating those needs and the best means for improving \n     rural education.\n       Rural schoolchildren deserve to benefit from the federal \n     education programs enjoyed by urban and suburban students. We \n     thank you for your work on the Rural Education Initiative, \n     and we offer our full support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Hunter,\n                                           Legislative Specialist.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, Today I rise in support of the Rural \nEducation Initiative introduced by Senator Collins. I am also pleased \nto join my other colleagues from the Health Education Labor and \nPensions Committee in support of this bill. In a time when the \neducation of our nation's youth is a priority, we need to make sure \nthat all schools have the opportunity to improve and reform. This \nlegislation does just that.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act will allow small rural schools to \nmake better use of federal education dollars. In Kansas, 46 percent of \nour school districts have fewer than 600 students. In Utica, Kansas, in \nthe Nes Tre La Go Unified School District number 301, there are 34 \nelementary students and 39 high school students that make up the entire \nenrollment. Districts like these in Kansas and other rural areas face \nmultiple obstacles when obtaining and utilizing federal funds.\n  First, they seldom receive enough money from any single grant to make \na lasting and measurable impact on school improvement. Grants are based \non school enrollment and the funds doled out to these small districts \nare rarely enough. This bill would allow the merging of splintered \nfederal funds so that grant money can be used effectively to meet local \neducation priorities. District are granted the freedom to spend the \nfunds as they see fit.\n  Second, small rural districts do not have the manpower to apply for \ncompetitive grants. This bill provides a formula grant as an option \ninstead of limiting districts to the lengthy and involved application \nprocess for ESEA competitive grant programs. Under this formula, \ndistricts don't have to strain their resources simply applying for \nfederal funds.\n  With this reform and flexibility there will be accountability. \nDistricts will be required to demonstrate improved student performance \nusing tests they already administer to assess student achievement.\n  This bill abolishes undue obstacles rural districts face as they try \nto improve the quality of education in their own schools. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this common sense legislation and allow small \nrural districts to obtain federal funds and use them to meet their own \nobjectives.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my support for Senator Collins' Rural Education Improvement \nAct, a bill that would allow school districts in my state and across \nthe nation to more fully benefit from the use of federal grant monies. \nIn current formula-based federal grants, some of the amounts rural \ndistricts receive are so small the school districts an not do anything \nmeaningful with them. This ``One-size-fits-all'' policy would be \nremedied under the ``Rural Education Improvement Act,'' which would \nallow several small sums to be joined and spent according to local \nneeds. Like Senator Collins, I'm committed to giving parents and local \nschool districts more say in how their education dollars are spent. I \ncommend the Senator for her efforts in this area and am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 254. A bill to provide further protections for the watershed of \nthe Little Sandy River as part of the Bull Run Watershed Management \nUnit, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Little Sandy \nWatershed Protection Act.\n  I promised Oregonians that one of my first legislative actions when \nthe 107th Congress convened would be the introduction of this bill.\n  Therefore, joined by my friends Senator Gordon Smith and Congressman \nEarl Blumenauer, I introduce this legislation to make sure that \nPortland families can go to their kitchen faucets and get a glass of \nsafe and pure drinking water today, tomorrow, and on, into the 21st \ncentury.\n  The Bull Run has been the primary source of water for Portland since \n1895. The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, Mount Hood National \nForest, was protected by Congressional action in 1904, in 1977 and then \nagain, most recently, in 1996 (P.L. 95-200, 16, U.S.C. 482b note) \nbecause it was recognized as Portland's primary municipal water supply. \nIt still is.\n  Today I propose to finish the job of the Oregon Resources and \nConservation Act of 1996. That law, which I worked on with former \nSenator Mark Hatfield, finally provided full protection to the Bull Run \nwatershed, but only gave temporary protection to the adjacent Little \nSandy watershed. I promised in 1996 that I would return to finish the \njob of protecting Portland's drinking water supply, and I intend to \ncontinue to push this legislation until the job is completed.\n  The bill I introduce today expands the Bull Run Watershed Management \nUnit boundary from approximately 95,382 acres to approximately 98,272 \nacres by adding the southern portion of the Little Sandy River \nwatershed, an increase of approximately 2,890 acres.\n  The protection this bill offers will not only assure clean drinking \nwater, but also increase the potential for fish recovery. Reclaiming \nsuitable habitat for our region's threatened fish populations must be \nan all-out effort. Through the cooperation of Portland General Electric \nand the City of Portland, the Little Sandy can be an important part of \nthat effort.\n  The bill I introduce today is a compromise that was passed \nunanimously by the Senate during the last days of the 106th Congress. \nUnfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives of the 106th Congress \nrefused to pass this important, noncontroversial, piece of legislation \nbefore the final bells rang.\n  My belief is that the children of the 21st century deserve water that \nis as\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nsafe and pure as any that the Oregon pioneers found in the 19th \ncentury. This legislation will go a long way toward bringing about that \nvision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node dissection for \nthe treatment of breast cancer and coverage for secondary \nconsultations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Women's \nHealth and Cancer Rights Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friends, \nSenator Murray of Washington and Senator Johnson of South Dakota, as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill has a two-fold purpose. First, it will ensure that \nappropriate medical care determines how long a woman stays in the \nhospital after undergoing a mastectomy. This provision says that \ninpatient coverage with respect to the treatment of mastectomy--\nregardless of whether the patient's plan is regulated by ERISA or State \nregulations--will be provided for a period of time as is determined by \nthe attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be \nmedically necessary and appropriate. Second, this bill allows any \nperson facing a cancer diagnosis of any type to get a second opinion on \ntheir course of treatment.\n  A diagnosis of breast cancer is something that every woman dreads. \nBut for an estimated 192,200 American women, this is the year their \nworst fears will be realized. One thousand new cases of breast cancer \nwill be diagnosed among the women in Maine, and 200 women in my home \nState will die from this tragic disease. The fact is, one in nine women \nwill develop breast cancer during their lifetime, and for women between \nthe ages of 35 and 54, there is no other disease which will claim more \nlives.\n  It's not hard to understand why the words ``you have breast cancer'' \nare some of the most frightening words in the English language. For the \nwoman who hears them, everything changes from that moment forward. No \nwonder, then, that it is a diagnosis not only accompanied by fear, but \nalso by uncertainty. What will become of me? What will they have to do \nto me? What will I have to endure? What's the next step?\n  For many woman, the answer to that last question is a mastectomy or \nlumpectomy. Despite the medical and scientific advances that have been \nmade, despite the advances in early detection technology that more and \nmore often negate the need for radical surgery, it still remains a fact \nof life at the beginning of the 21st century these procedures can be \nthe most prudent option in attacking and eradicating cancer found in a \nwoman's breast.\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\n  These are the kind of decisions that come with a breast cancer \ndiagnosis. These are the kind of questions women must answer, and they \nmust do so under some of the most stressful and frightening \ncircumstances imaginable. The last question a woman should have to \nworry about at a time like this is whether or not their health \ninsurance plan will pay for appropriate care after a mastectomy. A \nwoman diagnosed with breast cancer in many ways already feels as though \nshe has lost control of her life. She should not feel as though she has \nalso lost control of her course of treatment.\n  The evidence for the need for this bill--especially when it comes to \nso-called ``drive through mastectomies'', is more than just \nallegorical. Indeed, the facts speak for themselves--between 1986 and \n1995, the average length of stay for a mastectomy dropped from about \nsix days to about 2 to 3 days. Thousands of women across the country \nare undergoing radical mastectomies on an outpatient basis and are \nbeing forced out of the hospital before either they or their doctor \nthink it's reasonable or prudent.\n  This decision must be returned to physicians and their patients, and \nall Americans who face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis must be \nable to make informed decisions about appropriate and necessary medical \ncare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and work \ntowards passing it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 256. A bill to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect \nbreastfeeding by new mothers; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is \nvery important to working women and their families--the Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act Amendments of 2001. This bill would clarify that the \nPregnancy Discrimination Act protects breastfeeding under civil rights \nlaw, requiring that a woman cannot be fired or discriminated against in \nthe workplace for expressing breast milk during her own lunch time or \nbreak time.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women with infants and \ntoddlers are the fastest growing segment of today's labor force. At \nleast 50 percent of women who are employed when they become pregnant \nreturn to the labor force by the time their children are three months \nold. Although the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was enacted in 1978 and \nprohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, \nchildbirth, or related medical conditions, courts have not interpreted \nthe Act to include breastfeeding.\n  Some employers deny women the opportunity to express milk . . . some \nwomen have been discharged for requesting to express milk during lunch \nand other regular breaks . . . some women have been harassed or \ndiscriminated against; some women have had their pay withheld or been \ntaken off of shift work for saying that they wanted to pump milk.\n  On the other hand, many employers have seen positive results from \nfacilitating lactation programs in the workplace, including low \nabsenteeism, high productivity, improved company loyalty, high employee \nmorale, and lower health care costs. Parental absenteeism due to infant \nillness is three times greater among the parents of formula-fed \nchildren than those that are breastfed. Worksite programs that aim to \nimprove infant health may also bring about a reduction in parental \nabsenteeism and health insurance costs.\n  There is no doubt as to the health benefit breastfeeding brings to \nboth mothers and children. Breastmilk is easily digested and \nassimilated, and contains all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients \nthey require in their first five to six months of life. Furthermore, \nimportant antibodies, proteins, immune cells, and growth factors that \ncan only be found in breast milk. Breastmilk is the first line of \nimmunization defense and enhances the effectiveness of vaccines given \nto infants.\n  Research studies show that children who are not breastfed have higher \nrates of mortality, meningitis, some types of cancers, asthma and other \nrespiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal \ndiseases, ear infections, allergies, and obesity. Other research \nstudies have shown that breastmilk and breastfeeding have protective \neffects against the development of a number of chronic diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, lymphomas, Crohn's disease, celiac \ndisease, some chronic liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. A number \nof studies have shown that breastfed children have higher IQs at all \nages.\n  This is a simple bill--it simply inserts the word ``breastfeeding'' \nin the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. It will change the law to read \nthat employment discrimination ``because of or on the basis of \npregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medication \nconditions'' is not permitted.\n  I believe that it is absolutely critical to support mothers in across \nthe country--they are, of course, raising the very future of our \ncountry. And we should ensure that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act \ncovers this basic fundamental part of mothering.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 257. A bill to permit individuals to continue health plan coverage \nof services while participating in approved clinical studies; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Improved \nPatient Access to Clinical Studies Act. This bill builds on progress \nmade in the last several years in the difficult and challenging fight \nagainst life-threatening diseases.\n  This bill will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage for \nservices provided to individuals participating in clinical trials, if \nthose services would otherwise be covered by the plan. This bill would \nalso prevent health plans from discriminating against enrollees who \nchoose to participate in clinical trials.\n  This bill has a two-fold purpose. First, it will ensure that many \npatients who could benefit from these potentially life-saving \nexperimental treatments, but currently do not have access to them \nbecause their insurance will not cover the associated costs. Second, \nwithout reimbursement for these services, our researchers' ability to \nconduct important research is impeded as it reduces the number of \npatients who seek to participate in clinical trials.\n  According to a report published by the General Accounting Office in \nSeptember 1999, ``given the uncertainty about [health insurance] \napproval and payment levels, patients and physicians can be discouraged \nfrom seeking prior approval from insurers'' and therefore, will not \nattempt to enroll in what could possibly be the patients' last hope. \nWhen faced with a life-threatening disease, such as cancer, it is \nabsolutely paramount that individuals be given every opportunity, every \npossibly imaginable, to fight their illness. What patients should not \nbe faced with is the certainty of a health insurance fight.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill which will \nhelp those suffering from life-threatening diseases and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 258. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under the Medicare program of annual screening pap \nsmear and screening pelvic exams; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Providing \nAnnual Pap Tests to Save Women's Lives Act of 2001. I am pleased to be \njoined by my friend, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, as an original \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  According to the American Cancer Society cervical cancer is one of \nthe most successfully treatable cancers when detected at an early \nstage. In fact, 88 percent of cervical cancer patients survive one year \nafter diagnosis, and 70 percent survive five years.\n  In the 52 years since use of the pap test became widespread, the \ncervical cancer mortality rate has declined by an astonishing 70 \npercent. There is no question that this test is the most effective \ncancer screening tool yet developed. The Pap smear can detect \nabnormalities before they develop into cancer. Having an annual Pap \nsmear is one of the most important things a woman can do to help \nprevent cervical cancer.\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\n  Congress has recognized the incomparable contribution of the Pap \nsmear in preventing cervical cancer and nine years ago directed \nMedicare to begin covering preventive Pap smears. Under this law \nMedicare beneficiaries were eligible for one test every three years, \nalthough a more frequent interval is allowed for women at high risk of \ndeveloping cervical cancer. And through the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, Congress expanded the Pap smear benefit to also include a \nscreening pelvic exam once every three years. Last year as a part of \nthe Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection \nAct, P.L. 106-544, we brought the screening down to once every other \nyear.\n  However, the American Cancer Society screening guidelines recommend \nthat all women who are or have been sexually active or who are 18 and \nolder should have an annual Pap test and pelvic examination. After \nthree or more consecutive satisfactory examinations with normal \nfindings, the Pap test may be performed less frequently at the \nphysician's discretion. Unfortunately, Medicare guidelines do not \nreflect this recommendation.\n  Women understand the usefulness and life-saving benefit of the Pap \nsmear. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported \nthat 88.3 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 44 have received \na pap test within the preceding three years. However, this rate \ndropped, for women age 65 and over--only 72.3 percent have received a \npap test within the preceding three years.\n  The bill Senator Lincoln and I are introducing today will bring \nMedicare guidelines in line with the American Cancer recommendations, \nand it will encourage Medicare beneficiaries to utilize this screening \nbenefit more regularly.\n  The Pap test has contributed immeasurably to the fight against \ncervical cancer. We cannot risk erasing our advancements in this fight \nbecause of an inadequate Medicare screening benefit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 259. A bill to authorize funding the Department of Energy to \nenhance its mission areas through Technology Transfer and Partnerships \nfor fiscal years 2002 through 2006, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for technology transfer. \nThis bi-partisan bill which is referred to as the ``National \nLaboratories Partnership Improvement Act of 2001'' is co-sponsored by \nmy colleagues Mr. Domenici and Mrs. Murray. Let me summarize this bill. \nFirst, I will outline the Department's commitment to science and how it \nhas admirably worked to transfer its technology in light of a serious \nresource decline. I then will discuss how tech transfer naturally \ncompliments the Department's mission oriented R I will review the \nlegislation we introduced in the last session which is a start in the \nright direction. I will conclude by proposing how this bill by \nleveraging existing efforts, should move the Department in the right \ndirection to support technology transfer without disrupting its R \nmission focus.\n  The Department of Energy is about science. For FY 2001, the \nDepartment's R budget was roughly $8 billion out of the $18.3 billion \nappropriated. Science programs account for 43 percent of the \nDepartment's budget. In the area of the physical sciences, DOE provides \nroughly half of all of the federal R In mathematics and computer \nsciences, DOE is second after the DOD. In engineering, the DOE ranks \nthird after NASA and the DOD. DOE affiliated scientists have won more \nthan 71 Nobel prizes for fundamental research; they garner the largest \nnumber of R 100 awards for applied research. The Department has more \nthan 60 multipurpose laboratories and primary purpose facilities across \nthe U.S. in high energy physics, materials science, nuclear science and \nengineering, waste management, biosciences, robotics, advanced \nscientific computing, microelectronic and nanomaterials fabrication. \nEach year DOE labs and facilities are used by more than 18,000 \nresearchers from universities and industry.\n  Yet with this surprising portfolio of research, the Department in FY \n2001 only line allocates $10 million for the transfer of technology. In \n1995 this allocation was over $200 million. That is not to say DOE is \nnot transferring its technology. In FY 1998, which is our last set of \ngood statistics from the Department of Commerce's Office of Technology \nPolicy, the DOE was second only to the DOD in the number of CRADA's \ngranted from its federal facilities, the DOD had 1424 and the DOE had \n868. The in-kind funds from industry to DOE for these CRADA's averages \nabout $100 million while its work for others from non-federal sources \nwas $145 million. In FY 1998, the DOE had 168 licenses granted to use \nits technology, the DOD had 34 and HHS had 215. In FY 1998, the DOE had \n512 patents issued on federal lab inventions while the DOD had 579, the \nnext closest was HHS with 171. In FY 1998, 50 companies were \nestablished as a result of DOE technology transfer. To put these \nnumbers in perspective, the DOD R budget for FY 1998 was $37.5 \nbillion, HHS' was $13.8 billion, while DOE's was $6.3 billion. These \nstatistics are impressive because in FY 1998 the DOE had line allocated \nabout 1 percent of its R budget to tech transfer. Today, that number \nis 0.14 percent of its R budget.\n  Given that tech transfer is not the Department's primary mission, the \nquestion is what is the right mix and what is the optimal technology to \ntransfer? For the NNSA, the primary mission is ensuring a safe and \nreliable nuclear stockpile. The Office of Science's primary mission is \nadvancing the frontiers of basic R The Office of Environmental \nManagement's primary mission is cleaning up contaminated DOE sites. The \nFossil Energy Program's mission is developing cleaner and more \nefficient fossil fuels. The list goes on. Nor do I think that tech \ntransfer, given the above numbers will be the principal engine for \ndirect economic growth in the tech heavy new economy. Let me explain \nthis premise by examing the pattern of economic and technological \ngrowth in a little more detail. In the year 2000, the National Science \nFoundation estimates that total U.S. R was $264 billion, a 7.9 \npercent increase over 1999 which itself was a 7.5 percent increase over \n1998. Technology R has a growth rate exceeding 15 percent in the last \ntwo years alone. What counts is the make up of these R trends. In the \nyear 2000, the industry contribution to the total R was $179 billion, \na 10.3 percent increase over 1999 while federal R grew by only 3.9 \npercent. Given the investment the federal government makes in R, \ntechnology transfer from federal labs does not contribute directly to \nthese amazing growth rates. In industries like telecommunications and \nchip design, the turn around cycles from research to product ranges \nfrom 1 to 3 years. The government is simply too slow to contribute \ndirectly to industrial driven short term needs that are so clearly \nevident in these national trends of R funding. On the other end of \nthe spectrum, basic and applied R are areas where industry finds it \ndifficult to invest given the short term equity demands on their \nprofits. The right mix then is for the government to maintain basic and \napplied R so it can transfer this knowledge to industry over the long \nterm.\n  If we agree that the government best transfers long term R we must \nask the next question which is how do the Department's mission focused \nR programs transfer technology to the private sector and how can the \nDepartment ensure its continued success with minimal disruption to its \nmission areas? Mission focused DOE programs like the NNSA, \nEnvironmental Management, Fossil Energy, Renewable Energy, Nuclear \nEnergy and the Office of Science all advance the frontiers of science \nat different stages. All of these programs in carrying out their \nmissions naturally perform different degrees of tech transfer. The \nFossil Energy, Nuclear and Renewable programs work closely with \nindustry and usually cannot start without an industry partner through a \nCRADA. The NNSA with their advanced computing requirements naturally \npush the state of the art in industry. CRADA's and Licenses provide to \nthe NNSA a fresh influx of the outside world's advancing technology \ninto their national security\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nmissions. The Office of Science with their wonderful user facilities \nand broad basic energy research mandate provide a fertile R base by \nwhich industry can stay competitive ten years out into the future, \nCRADA's smooth and shorten that transition. CRADA arrangements are a \nnatural outgrowth of the DOE mission programs. A CRADA or License \nsimply makes the tech transfer process smoother. So the issue is not \nhow much money do we need to line item for the formation of a CRADA or \na license--the CRADA is simply a by product of a organic tech transfer \nprocess in the Department's R programs. The issue is what kind of \norganizational structure in the DOE do we need to keep track of these \ntech transfer activities and how to insure that it is easily accessible \nfor potential partnerships.\n  If as I have just described that tech transfer occurs organically to \nthe Department's R mission areas we need to ask ourselves is there an \ninfrastructure that moves beyond the single contractual framework which \na CRADA represents? Tech transfer is not so much a static contract but \nit is a multi-dimensional transactional process. In some select cases \nwe should stimulate the transactional tech transfer process by regional \ntechnology clusters. Technology clusters will permit industry to locate \naround these wonderful pools of scientific knowledge. In turn they will \nbuild the R infrastructure surrounding the laboratory itself. We all \ntoo often think that the internet can solve the distance problem of \nconnecting business transactions thus negating the need for regional \ntechnology clusters--that's actually wrong, very wrong. Successful \nutilization of R technology starts because many small business are \nnearby to each other in a supportive state business climate. The \ntechnology clusters that form simply use the internet to exchange ideas \nand data that they generate from face-to-face collaboration on short \nnotice. People to people transactions initiate business and wealth in a \nrather spontaneous event; the internet is simply a tool to make it more \nefficient. You see such natural clustering occurring in Wall Street for \nfinancial markets, Palo Alto for information technology, Detroit for \nautomobiles and right here in Bethesda for genetics around the NIH. \nThus, enabling the formation technology clusters rather than focusing \non the static contractual CRADA process should be the next step in the \nevolution of federal technology transfer.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today address the issues I have just \noutlined. It establishes a headquarters level Technology Transfer \nCoordinator as the Secretary's lead advocate for developing DOE \ntechnology transfer policy across its many missions. This Coordinator \nwill collect and disseminate tech transfer data to Congress, the \ninteragency and public. I have provided a ceiling limit of about $1 \nmillion per year to collect this data and prepare the reports as \nrequired by law. I have provided additional funding for the Coordinator \nto help out the administrative tasks associated with the \nInterlaboratory Technology Partnerships Working Group. This group is \nstaffed by members from the DOE laboratories and facilities with the \npurpose to deconflict and disseminate publically DOE's R The \nInterlaboratory Technology Partnerships Working Group is a powerful \ngrass roots organization outside the beltway. This group operates at \nthe local community and laboratory level where the technology \ninitiates. I have designated the Coordinator as the Secretary's lead \nfederal officer for the group's oversight by reporting its activities \nto Congress and the interagency. I have authorized about $1 million a \nyear to leverage the Technology Partnerships Working Group's activities \nby ensuring that it can develop the necessary web interfaces and \ndatabases by which the public can easily access DOE's technology. I \nhave expanded the clustering bill that was introduced in the last \nCongress through the Defense Authorization Act from the NNSA \nlaboratories to the entire DOE complex. This expansion will permit \nindustry to benefit from the entire range of technology R across the \nDOE. If successful, these clusters will strengthen our experience in \ntechnology clusters; it will actively involve the state and local \ncommunities in encouraging the role that a technology infrastructure \nwill have in their economic development. I have authorized $10 million \nfor these clusters while requiring a 50 percent in-kind funding \ncontribution from the proposed partner. The clustering partner can be a \nstate, university, R consortia or business entity. I have given the \nSecretary discretion to stop this clustering expansion if the pilot \neffort for the NNSA labs proves unworkable. I have authorized a small-\nbusiness advocate, to support DOE wide, for what has been a lab by lab \npolicy. Such a small business provision is needed to accommodate the \nunique needs for R collaboration of start up businesses. I have \nproposed modifying the Department of Energy Organization Act to make it \nmore flexible in entering into alternative research contracts with \nentities such as R consortia. Finally, I have asked the Secretary to \nexamine the need for a policy to move people across the lab fence to \nstart up companies. This policy is balanced against the unique mission \nareas of each lab. In some cases implementing such a policy may prove \nunworkable based upon a lab's mission requirement. If such a policy \nproves unreasonable based upon a particular lab's mission, I have given \nSecretary the discretion not to implement it. I must emphasize though \nthat half of tech transfer is not just a piece of technology moving \nacross the fence but the movement of people and their know-how to a \nsmall start up. Universities are a classic example of the movement of \ntechnology and people between their home institution and a small \nregional technology park. Everyone benefits from this flow in people, \nthe start-up, the lab or facility with a more vibrant workforce \nsurrounding it and the local economy through local high tech business \nstart ups.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that this is not another line item \nCRADA funding project, its not corporate welfare. This bill takes the \ntech transfer activities that are naturally occurring in all these \nvaried science mission areas and leverages them with small amounts of \nfunding--about 0.06 percent of DOE's overall budget.\n  Let me summarize once more what I have just outlined is in the \nproposed bill. First, a small Technology Transfer Coordinator is \nproposed to be the Secretary's advocate across the Department for \nuniform policy development and reporting. Second, a small web based \ninterface is proposed to help the public easily access and leverage the \nR activities at all the DOE labs and facilities. Third, I've proposed \nto help seed small technology clusters local to the labs under merit \nreview and with the discretion not to proceed forward if the FY 2001 \nNNSA pilot program proves unworkable. Technology clusters are the next \nevolutionary stage past a static CRADA. Fourth, I've asked the \nSecretary to implement, where its feasible, a policy where by \nlaboratory personnel can move with the technology to start up a company \noutside the fence. Fifth, I asked the Secretary to ensure where its \nreasonable a uniform policy to help small businesses with their unique \nneeds access DOE technology. Like most government programs that come \nunder close scrutiny by Congress, their intent is worthy but the \nprogram's size oscillates greatly over time. The pendulum for tech \ntransfer at the DOE is one such program. This program has swung from a \n$200 million program in the mid 1990's to essentially zero funding in \nFY 2001 with a minimal headquarter's office to help policy development \nacross its diverse mission areas. This bill establishes what I feel is \nthe right level of tech transfer in a R organization by leveraging \nthe existing industrial collaboration that naturally occurs in carrying \nout their missions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 259\n\n       Be in enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide, \nwith respect to research on breast cancer, for the increased \ninvolvement of advocates in decisionmaking at the National Cancer \nInstitute; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill which \nbuilds on progress made in the last few years in the difficult and \nchallenging fight against breast cancer.\n  Our challenge was summed up by one breast cancer advocate when she \nstated, simply and eloquently, ``We must\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\nmake our voices heard, because it is our lives.''\n  A diagnosis of breast cancer is something that every woman dreads. \nOver 192,000 American women, and 1,000 in my home state of Maine--will \nface a diagnosis of breast cancer this year. Over 40,000 women across \nthe country will die from this tragic disease. The fact is, one in nine \nwomen will develop breast cancer during their lifetime, and for women \nbetween the ages of 35 and 54, there is no other disease which will \nclaim more lives.\n  This bill will give breast cancer advocates a voice in the National \nInstitutes of Health's, NIH's research decision-making. The Consumer \nInvolvement in Breast Cancer Research Act urges NIH to follow the \nDepartment Of Defense's lead and include lay breast cancer advocates in \nbreast cancer research decision-making.\n  The involvement of these breast cancer advocates at DOD has helped \nfoster new and innovative breast cancer research funding designs and \nresearch projects. While maintaining the higher level of quality \nassurance through peer review, breast cancer advocates have helped to \nensure that all breast cancer research reflects the experiences and \nwisdom of the individuals who have lived with the disease, as well as \nthe scientific community.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 262. A bill to provide for teaching excellence in America's \nclassrooms and homerooms; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, this nation was rocked by the \npublication, in 1983, of the landmark report, A Nation at Risk. The \nfindings were devastating: Our educational system was being ``eroded by \na rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our future as a nation and a \npeople.'' That report went on to say that if ``an unfriendly foreign \npower'' had tried to impose on America our ``mediocre educational \nperformance,'' we might well have viewed it ``as an act of war.''\n  A Nation at Risk sounded a wake-up call to our educators, parents, \nbusinesses, community leaders and officials at all levels of \ngovernment. Since its publication in 1983, a number of states have \nstrengthened their commitment to educational improvements. Many \ntightened high school graduation requirements. They pushed for more \nachievement testing for students and higher standards for teachers.\n  As a result of these efforts, we have seen improvement. Our dropout \nrate is down, and student achievement is up. Performance on the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, has increased, \nparticularly in the key subjects of reading, math, and science. Yet \nstill, in America, 2,800 high school students drop out every single \nday. Each school year, more than 45,000 under-prepared teachers, \nteachers who have not even been trained in the subjects they are \nteaching, enter the classroom. Clearly, this is not acceptable.\n  The positive news is that eighteen years after A Nation at Risk, \nthere is widespread agreement that the improvement of our educational \nsystem must be a priority and hope that there will be consensus on \neducation reform. Key to the success of any effective education reform \ninitiative is the issue of teacher quality. What teachers know and can \ndo are the single most important influences on what students learn, \naccording to the National Commission for Teaching and America's Future \nTeachers.\n  Three years after A Nation at Risk, the Carnegie Task Force on \nTeaching as a Profession issued a seminal report, A Nation Prepared: \nTeachers for the 21st Century. Its leading recommendation called for \nthe establishment of a National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards. Founded in 1987, the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards is an independent, non-profit, and non-partisan \norganization whose mission is to establish high and rigorous standards \nfor what accomplished teachers should know and be able to do.\n  To date, over 9,500 teachers from all 50 states and the District of \nColumbia have completed advanced certification by the National Board \nfor Professional Teaching Standards--the most rigorous assessment \nprocess that a teacher can go through and the highest professional \ncredential in the field of teaching. And more than 12,000 teachers have \napplied for National Board Certification in the 2000-2001 school year. \nRecognizing the value of qualified teachers in the classroom, 39 states \nand 181 local school districts have enacted financial incentives for \nteachers seeking National Board Certification, including fee support to \ncandidates and salary increases for teachers who successfully complete \nthe certification process.\n\n  Georgia, for example, provides a 10 percent salary increase to \nteachers who achieve National Board Certification as well as full \nreimbursement of the $2300 fee upon certification. The State of \nLouisiana provides an annual salary adjustment of $5,000 for its \nNational Board Certified Teachers, NBCTs, and in addition, the State \nBoard of Elementary and Secondary Education has allocated a $300,000 \nsupplement over a three-year period to provide fee support for National \nBoard Certification. North Carolina, which has over 2,400 National \nBoard Certified Teachers, has a particularly strong support program. \nAmong its incentives, the State pays the fee for up to 1,500 teachers \nwho complete the National Board Certification process; offers up to \nthree days of release time for candidates to work on their portfolios \nand prepare for the assessment center exercises; and provides a 12 \npercent salary increase for those who achieve National Board \nCertification. Florida, with 1,267 National Board Certified Teachers, \nhas passed legislation appropriating $12 million to pay 90 percent of \nits candidates' certification fee. In addition, the State provides a 10 \npercent salary increase for the life of the certificate and an \nadditional 10 percent bonus to those who mentor newly hired teachers or \nserve as support mentors for advanced certification candidates. Florida \nalso provides $150 to candidates to offset National Board Certification \nexpenses.\n  The incentives offered by Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Florida \nand the remaining 35 states clearly demonstrate that state leaders \nrecognize and understand the value and contribution of National Board \nCertification to their own efforts to enhance quality teaching and \nimprove school performance. In an effort to assist states' efforts and \nto encourage participation, the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act \nauthorized federal assistance to the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards. To date, the Board has provided over $18 million to \nthe states according to a formula based on teacher population. In FY \n2000, $2.5 million was appropriated to help states and local schools \ndistricts subsidize the certification fee for National Board Certified \ncandidates.\n  In each and every year since funding was authorized, candidate demand \nhas outpaced the money available. Therefore in an effort to encourage \nand promote teacher quality in the classroom, I am joined today by my \ncolleague, Senator Landrieu, in introducing the Teaching Excellence in \nAmerica's Classrooms and Homerooms (TEACH) Act. According to a new \nstudy by the National Education Association, teacher salaries have \nremained stagnant over the past decade, and two-thirds of the states do \nnot meet the national average of $40,582 for teacher salaries. \nTherefore to help teachers pay the $2300 certification fee, our bill \nwould double the candidate subsidy funding, from the current $2.5 \nmillion to $5 million. Further, our legislation would provide an \nadditional $1 million for outreach and educational activities to \nheighten teachers' awareness of the National Board Certification \nprocess, with a priority given to teachers in school districts serving \nspecial populations, including limited English proficient children, \nchildren with disabilities, and economically and educationally \ndisadvantaged children.\n  Teachers who successfully complete the arduous requirements for \nNational Board Certification should not be penalized. Therefore, our \nlegislation would provide that any financial benefit, such as a bonus, \nwhich a teacher receives solely as a result of achieving National \nBoard Certification would be tax-free. And teachers who pay out of \npocket expenses for advanced certification, such as fees, travel, and \nsupplies, should be reimbursed for these costs. The Teaching Excellence \nin\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nAmerica's Classrooms and Homerooms would allow candidates to take an \nabove-the-line deduction for their certification expenses. This will \nallow these teachers who do not itemize their deductions to still be \nable to benefit from tax-favored treatment for their National Board \nCertification.\n\n  A study by researchers at the University of North Carolina at \nGreensboro has recently concluded that teachers who are certified by \nthe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards significantly \noutperform their peers who are not National Board Certified on 11 of 13 \nkey measures of teaching expertise, including an extensive knowledge of \nsubject matter, the capacity to create optimal environments for \nlearning, and the ability to inspire students and to promote in them \nproblem-solving skills. The Accomplished Teaching Validation Study, \nreleased in October, was originally designed as a means to seek \nindependent validation for the National Board's assessment process, and \nit is based on criteria which two decades of research have deemed to be \nthe measures of effective teaching. Among its conclusions, the study \nfound that nearly three-quarters of the National Board Certified \nTeachers produced students whose work reflected deep understanding of \nthe subject being studied compared with less than one-quarter of non-\ncertified teachers. The Greensboro study is believed by some education \nleaders to be the first step in compiling research that will shed \nimportant light on the connection between accomplished teaching and \nstudent learning.\n  Christa McAuliffe, selected to be the first schoolteacher to travel \nin space, described simply but poetically the awesome potential of her \nvocation: ``I touch the future,'' she said. ``I teach.'' If we are to \nimprove student achievement and success in school, the United States \nmust encourage and support the training and development of our nation's \nteachers, the single most important in-school influence on student \nlearning. Investing in teacher quality is a direct investment in \nquality education--and as Benjamin Franklin said, ``on education all \nour lives depend.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the letter of \nsupport from the National Education Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n            TITLE I--NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

We believe this \n     legislation will make a critical difference in allowing \n     teachers to pursue National Board Certification and, thereby, \n     ensuring the highest quality teachers in our nation's \n     classrooms.\n       As you know, no single factor will have a greater impact on \n     improving student achievement than the quality of our \n     nation's teaching force. National Board Certification offers \n     the highest credential in the teaching profession, taking \n     teachers through a rigorous assessment and evaluation \n     process. An October 2000 study found that Board Certified \n     teachers significantly outperformed their peers on 11 of 13 \n     measures of teaching expertise. In addition, the study found \n     that 74 percent of work samples from students of Certified \n     teachers reflected ``high levels of comprehension,'' compared \n     with 29 percent of students whose teachers did not have \n     national certification.\n       Unfortunately, the high cost prohibits many teachers from \n     seeking Board Certification. By providing funding to states \n     and local districts to help teachers pay Board Certification \n     fees, your legislation will enable more teachers to \n     participate in this important process. In addition, the \n     resourses provided for outreach will help bring information \n     about Board Certification to many more teachers.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing the TEACH \n     Act and look forward to working with you in support of our \n     nation's teachers.\n           Sincerley,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 263. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to ensure that \ncoverage of bone mass measurements is provided under the health \nbenefits program for Federal employees; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  S. 264. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand coverage of bone mass measurements under part B of the medicare \nprogram to all individuals at clinical risk for osteoporosis; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills which \nbuild on progress made in the last few years in the difficult and \nchallenging fight against osteoporosis. I am pleased to be joined by my \nfriend, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey, as an original cosponsor of \nthese bills.\n  Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million \nAmericans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone \nmass. Osteoporosis causes 1.5 million fractures annually at a cost of \n$13.8 billion--$38 million per day--in direct medical expenses. In \ntheir lifetime, one in two women and one in eight men over the age of \n50 will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis. Amazingly, a woman's risk \nof a hip fracture is equal to her combined risk of contracting breast, \nuterine, and ovarian cancer.\n  Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could \nbe avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. Though we \nnow have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent and new \ndrugs have been proven to actually rebuild bone mass, a bone mass \nmeasurement is needed to diagnose osteoporosis and determine one's risk \nfor future fractures.\n  And we have learned that there are some prominent risk factors: age, \ngender, race, a family history of bone fractures, early menopause, \nrisky health behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol \nconsumption, and some medications all have been identified as \ncontributing factors to bone loss. But identification of risk factors \nalone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how strong bone is.\n  Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act 3\\1/2\\ years ago. In doing \nso, we dramatically expanded coverage of osteoporosis screening through \nbone mass measurements for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Since we passed this law, we have learned that under the current \nMedicare law, it is very difficult for a man to be reimbursed for a \nbone mass measurement test. Each year, men suffer one-third of all the \nhip fractures that occur, and one-third of these men will not survive \nmore than one year. In addition to hip fracture, men also experience \npainful and debilitating fractures of the spine, wrist, and other bones \ndue to osteoporosis.\n  The first bill we are introducing today, the Medicare Osteoporosis \nMeasurement Act, would help all individuals enrolled in Medicare to \nreceive the necessary tests if they are at risk for osteoporosis.\n  Currently, Medicare guidelines allow for testing in five categories \nof individuals--and most ``at risk'' men do not fall into any of them. \nThe first category in the guidelines is for ``an estrogen-deficient \nwoman at clinical risk for osteoporosis.'' The Medicare Osteoporosis \nMeasurement Act changes this guideline to say that ``an individual, \nincluding an estrogen-deficient woman, at clinical risk for \nosteoporosis'' will be eligible for bone mass measurement. This \nchange--of just a few words--will vastly increase the opportunities for \nmen to be covered for the important test.\n  The second bill Senator Torricelli and I are introducing today is \nsimilar to the Medicare bone mass measurement benefit. The Osteoporosis \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Standardization Act guarantees the \nsame uniformity of coverage to Federal employees and retirees as \nCongress provided to Medicare beneficiaries in 1997.\n  Unfortunately, coverage of bone density tests under the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefit Program, FEHBP, is inconsistent. Instead of a \ncomprehensive national coverage policy, FEHBP leaves it to each of the \nalmost 300 participating plans to decide who is eligible to receive a \nbone mass measurement and what constitutes medical necessity. Many \nplans have no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests \non a case-by-case basis. Some plans refuse to provide consumers with \ninformation indicating when the plan covers the test and when it does \nnot and some plans cover the test only for people who already have \nosteoporosis.\n  Mr. President, we know that osteoporosis is highly preventable, but \nonly if it is discovered in time. There is simply no substitute for \nearly detection. These bills will ensure that all Medicare \nbeneficiaries at risk for osteoporosis will be able to be tested for \nthis disease, and will standardize coverage for bone mass measurement \nunder the FEHBP.\n  I hope that our colleagues will join Senator Torricelli and me in \nsupporting these bills.\n                                   ____\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Kohl, and Mr. Durbin):\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\n  S. 265. A bill to prohibit the use of, and provide for remediation of \nwater contaminated by, methyl tertiary butyl ether; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``MTBE \nElimination Act of 2001.'' I thank my colleagues--Senators Bayh, \nBrownback, Kohl, and Durbin for joining me as original co-sponsors of \nthis important legislation. I have become deeply concerned by the use \nand ultimate misuse of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl \nether, MTBE, a nonrenewable fuel derivative, and its potential adverse \nhealth effects on those who come in contact with it. As my colleagues \nmay remember, I introduced the ``MTBE Elimination Act of 2000\" last \nCongress, but no action was taken in the 106th Congress to eliminate \nthe use of this potentially hazardous chemical additive.\n  Specifically, the ``MTBE Elimination Act of 2001'' will phase out \nMTBE use across the United States over the next three years, ensure \nproper labeling of all fuel dispensaries containing MTBE enriched \nreformulated gasoline, provide grant awards for MTBE research, and \nexpress the sense of the Senate that the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should provide assistance to \nmunicipalities to test for MTBE in drinking water sources, as well as \nprovide remediation where appropriate. This bill represents an \nimportant first step toward nationwide safe and healthy drinking water.\n  Despite the potential damaging effects of MTBE, research of this \nchemical is still in its preliminary stages. In February of 1996, the \nHealth Effects Institute reported that MTBE could be classified as a \nneurotoxicant for its acute impairment effects on humans. Further, the \nAlaska Department of Health and Social Services and the Centers for \nDisease Control from December 1992 through February 1993 monitored \nconcentrations of MTBE in the air and in the blood of humans. These \nstudies showed that people with a higher concentration of MTBE in their \nbloodstream have a much greater tendency toward headaches, eye \nirritation, nausea, disorientation, and vomiting. Finally, the January \n16, 2000 broadcast of the ``60 Minutes'' show noted, ``the EPA's \nposition is that MTBE is a possible human carcinogen.'' Mr. President, \nwe must remove this kind of chemical from our Nation's drinking water \nsupply.\n  Widespread pollution of water systems by MTBE has been perpetuated by \na lack of knowledge, as well as indifference, to this potentially \nhazardous substance. MTBE does not readily attach to soil particles, \nnor does it naturally biodegrade, making its movement from gasoline to \nwater extremely rapid. The physical properties of MTBE, coupled with \nits potential adverse health effects, make the use of this specific \noxygenate dangerous to the American people.\n  The elimination of the use of MTBE in reformulated gasoline should \nnot mean the removal of the oxygenate requirement set forth under the \nClean Air Act of 1990--which requires reformulated gasoline to contain \ntwo percent oxygen by weight. I believe it to be reasonable for our \nnation to expect both clean air and clean water, without having to \neliminate the reformulated gasoline market or sacrifice our national \nhealth.\n  According to the United States Department of Agriculture study \nentitled ``Economic Analysis of Replacing MTBE with Ethanol in the \nUnited States,'' replacing MTBE with the corn-based oxygenate additive \nethanol would create approximately 13,000 new jobs in rural America, \nincrease farm income by more than $1 billion annually over the next ten \nyears, and reduce farm program costs and loan deficiency payments \nthrough an expanded value-added market for grain. Furthermore, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has concluded that within three years, \nethanol can be used as a substitute oxygenate for MTBE in nationwide \nmarkets without price increases or supply disruptions.\n  Ethanol has proven to be a viable, environmentally-friendlier \nalternative to MTBE. The Chicago reformulated gas program (RFG) has \nused ethanol for years, and according to the American Lung Association, \nChicago has established one of the most successful RFG programs in the \ncountry. Ethanol is vitally important to my home state since Illinois \nis the number one producer of ethanol in the nation. Each year, 274 \nmillion bushels of Illinois corn are used to produce about 678 million \ngallons of ethanol. At a time when agricultural prices are at near-\nrecord lows, this increased demand is sorely needed.\n  Recently, Tosco Corporation, one the nation's largest independent oil \nrefiners and marketers, announced its intention to sell ethanol-blended \nfuel from its 1,600 retail outlets throughout California. This decision \nwill result in the replacement of MTBE with ethanol in one-fifth of \nCalifornia's reformulated gasoline by the end of this year, thereby \nhelping to protect California's water supply for future generations, \nwhile keeping its air clean. The bill that I introduce today paves the \nway for this important bio-based fuel to be used not only in California \nand the Midwest, but nationwide. By supporting bio-based fuel through \nlegislative measures such as this bill, we are taking positive and \ndecisive steps toward cleaning our nation's water, and the environment \nwe will leave for our children and grandchildren.\n  This legislation will send a signal that the Senate strongly supports \nbio-based fuels research and recognizes the need to find viable ways to \nreduce our dependency on fossil fuels.\n  Through research programs, localized testing, and proper labeling we \ncan help assure that MTBE is properly identified in gasoline, extracted \nfrom groundwater, and phased out of use thereby reducing the risk of \nfuture MTBE contamination.\n  By phasing out MTBE over a three year period and replacing it with \nethanol, we can help secure an ample supply of reformulated gasoline, \nclean water, and clean air for future generations. This bill should \nenjoy bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to join me in co-\nsponsoring this bill that is so important to the well being of the \nenvironment as well as our nation's farmers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 265\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``MTBE Elimination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a single cup of MTBE, equal to the quantity found in 1 \n     gallon of gasoline oxygenated with MTBE, renders all of the \n     water in a 5,000,000-gallon well undrinkable;\n       (2) the physical properties of MTBE allow MTBE to pass \n     easily from gasoline to air to water, or from gasoline \n     directly to water, but MTBE does not--\n       (A) readily attach to soil particles; or\n       (B) naturally degrade;\n       (3) the development of tumors and nervous system disorders \n     in mice and rats has been linked to exposure to MTBE and \n     tertiary butyl alcohol and formaldehyde, which are 2 \n     metabolic byproducts of MTBE;\n       (4) reproductive and developmental studies of MTBE indicate \n     that exposure of a pregnant female to MTBE through inhalation \n     can--\n       (A) result in maternal toxicity; and\n       (B) have possible adverse effects on a developing fetus;\n       (5) the Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 \n     that the studies of MTBE support its classification as a \n     neurotoxicant and suggest that its primary effect is likely \n     to be in the form of acute impairment;\n       (6) people with higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream \n     are significantly more likely to report more headaches, eye \n     irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of the nose and \n     throat, coughing, disorientation, and vomiting as compared \n     with those who have lower levels of MTBE in the bloodstream;\n       (7) available information has shown that MTBE significantly \n     reduces the efficiency of technologies used to remediate \n     water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons;\n       (8) the costs of remediation of MTBE water contamination \n     throughout the United States could run into the billions of \n     dollars;\n       (9) although several studies are being conducted to assess \n     possible methods to remediate drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, there have been no engineering solutions to make such \n     remediation cost-efficient and practicable;\n       (10) the remediation of drinking water contaminated by \n     MTBE, involving the stripping of millions of gallons of \n     contaminated ground water, can cost millions of dollars per \n     municipality;\n       (11) the average cost of a single industrial cleanup \n     involving MTBE contamination is approximately $150,000;\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\n       (12) the average cost of a single cleanup involving MTBE \n     contamination that is conducted by a small business or a \n     homeowner is approximately $37,000;\n       (13) the reformulated gasoline program under section 211(k) \n     of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(k)) has resulted in \n     substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air \n     pollutants from motor vehicles, including volatile organic \n     compounds, carbon monoxide, and mobile-source toxic air \n     pollutants, including benzene;\n       (14) in assessing oxygenate alternatives, the Blue Ribbon \n     Panel of the Environmental Protection Agency determined that \n     ethanol, made from domestic grain and potentially from \n     recycled biomass, is an effective fuel-blending component \n     that--\n       (A) provides carbon monoxide emission benefits and high \n     octane; and\n       (B) appears to contribute to the reduction of the use of \n     aromatics, providing reductions in emissions of toxic air \n     pollutants and other air quality benefits;\n       (15) the Department of Agriculture concluded that ethanol \n     production and distribution could be expanded to meet the \n     needs of the reformulated gasoline program in 4 years, with \n     negligible price impacts and no interruptions in supply; and\n       (16) because the reformulated gasoline program is a source \n     of clean air benefits, and ethanol is a viable alternative \n     that provides air quality and economic benefits, research and \n     development efforts should be directed to assess \n     infrastructure and meet other challenges necessary to allow \n     ethanol use to expand sufficiently to meet the requirements \n     of the reformulated gasoline program as the use of MTBE is \n     phased out.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     should provide technical assistance, information, and \n     matching funds to help local communities--\n       (1) test drinking water supplies; and\n       (2) remediate drinking water contaminated with methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill regarding the use of the trust land and resources of \nthe Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise as the original cosponsor of the \nPelton Dam Agreement legislation introduced today by my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.\n  This legislation sanctions an historic agreement, reached on April \n12, 2000, between the Oregon Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs \nReservation, Warm Springs, Portland General Electric Company, PGE, and \nthe United States Department of the Interior (Department). This \nagreement is important because it sets a responsible precedent for the \njoint ownership and operation of the Pelton-Round Butte Hydroelectric \nProject located in Jefferson County, Oregon, on the Deschutes River. It \nalso provides a model for how the United States, Indian tribes and \nprivate companies can work together to solve contentious issues.\n  Beginning in the summer of 1998, the Warm Springs and PGE began \nnegotiations to settle Pelton Dam Project ownership and operation \nissues. Approximately one-third of the Project lands are located on the \nWarm Springs Reservation. Because of the Department's legal trust \nresponsibility to the Warm Springs, Department representatives also \nparticipated in the negotiations. On April 12, 2000, Department, Warm \nSprings and PGE representatives signed the Long Term Global Settlement \nand Compensation Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement creates shared \nownership responsibilities and benefits between PGE and the Warm \nSprings for all three Pelton Project dams and facilities located both \non and off the Warm Springs Reservation.\n  The Warm Springs, PGE and the Department worked with myself and \nSenator Smith to carefully craft this legislation to authorize the \nDepartment to sanction the Agreement. This legislation provides Federal \napproval for only the aspects of the Agreement that affect tribal \nlands, resources, or other tribal assets. Section 2(b)(1) makes it \nclear that the legislation does not affect the normal Federal and State \nregulatory approvals that would be required for an agreement of this \ntype. Section 2(b)(2) was included to address a Departmental concern \nthat this legislation will not be interpreted to mean that legislative \napproval of future similar agreements will be necessary. In addition, \nthis bill authorizes a 99-year leasing authority for the Warm Springs \nthat is shared by countless other tribes.\n  This bill is supported by PGE, the Warm Springs Tribe and Jefferson \nCounty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Smith of \n        New Hampshire):\n  S. 267. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, to \nmake it unlawful for any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to \ntransfer or market nonambulatory livestock, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Downed Animal \nProtection Act, a bill to eliminate inhumane and improper treatment of \ndowned animals at stockyards. Senators Carl Levin, Charles Schumer, \nRobert Torricelli, Judd Gregg, Bob Graham, Bob Smith, Harry Reid and \nBarbara Boxer have joined me in sponsoring this bill. The legislation \nwill prohibit the sale or transfer of downed animals unless they have \nbeen humanely euthanized.\n  Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are too \nsick to rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes immobile, it \nmust remain where it has fallen, often without receiving the most basic \nassistance. Many of these downed animals\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\nthat survive the stockyard are slaughtered for human consumption.\n  These animals are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle \nhumanely. They have very demanding needs, and must be fed and watered \nindividually. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the \nonly humane solution to their plight is immediate euthanasia. It is \nimportant to note that downed animals compromise a tiny fraction, less \nthan one-tenth of one percent, of animals at stockyards. Banning their \nsale or transfer would cause no economic hardship.\n  While I commend the major livestock organizations such as the United \nStockyards Corp., the Minnesota Livestock Marketing Association, the \nNational Pork Producers Council, the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, \nand the Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, along with \nresponsible and conscientious livestock producers throughout the \ncountry, for their efforts to address the issue of downed animals, this \nlamentable problem still exists. Not only is this suffering inhumane \nand unnecessary, it is eroding public confidence in the industry.\n  The Downed Animal Protection Act will prompt stockyards to refuse \ncrippled and distressed animals, and will make the prevention of downed \nanimals a priority for the livestock industry. The bill will complement \nand reinforce the industry's effort to address this problem by \nencouraging better care of animals at farms and ranches.\n  The bill will remove the incentive for sending downed animals to \nstockyards in the hope of receiving some salvage value for the animals \nand would encourage greater care during loading and transport. By \neliminating this incentive, animals with impaired mobility will receive \nbetter treatment in order to prevent them from becoming incapacitated. \nIn addition, the bill will also discourage improper breeding practices \nthat account for most downed animals.\n  My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby \nremoving any unfair advantages that might result from differing \nstandards throughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional \nbureaucracy will be needed as a consequence of my bill because \ninspectors of the Packers and Stockyard Administration regularly visit \nstockyards to enforce existing regulations. Thus, the additional burden \non the agency and stockyard operators will be insignificant.\n  As I stated before, this bill will stop the inhumane and improper \ntreatment of downed animals at stockyards and I encourage my colleagues \nto support this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Downed Animal Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNLAWFUL STOCKYARD PRACTICES INVOLVING NONAMBULATORY \n                   LIVESTOCK.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Packers and Stockyards \n     Act, 1921, is amended by inserting after section 317 (7 \n     U.S.C. 217a) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 318.

Res. 18\n\n       Whereas, on the morning of January 13, 2001, a devastating \n     and deadly earthquake of a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter \n     scale shook the entire nation of El Salvador, killing more \n     than 700 people, injuring more than 3,000, and leaving more \n     than 50,000 homeless;\n       Whereas the earthquake of January 13, 2001, has left \n     thousands of buildings in ruin, caused deadly landslides, and \n     destroyed highways and other infrastructure;\n       Whereas the strength, courage, and determination of the \n     people of El Salvador has been displayed since the \n     earthquake;\n       Whereas El Salvador is still recovering from years of civil \n     war, hurricane damage, and flood damage;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and El Salvador \n     share strong friendship and mutual interests and respect;\n       Whereas some United States specialists from Costa Rica and \n     Miami, including specialists from the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue \n     Department, were deployed to assist disaster relief efforts \n     in El Salvador;\n       Whereas United States military personnel from the United \n     States Southern Command are providing some technical \n     assistance;\n       Whereas the USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) \n     has set up an office in El Salvador's National Emergency \n     Committee (COEN) to assist the office in its coordination \n     efforts and to ensure access to the latest information; and\n       Whereas the United Nations launched an appeal for \n     humanitarian assistance and initial rehabilitation to address \n     the devastation caused by the powerful earthquake: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its deepest sympathies to the people of El \n     Salvador and other Central American countries for the tragic \n     losses suffered as a result of the earthquake of January 13, \n     2001;\n       (2) expresses its support for the people of El Salvador as \n     they continue their efforts to rebuild their cities and their \n     lives;\n       (3) expresses support for disaster assistance being \n     provided by the United States Agency for International \n     Development and other relief agencies;\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\n       (4) recognizes the important role that is being played by \n     the United States and other countries in providing assistance \n     to alleviate the suffering of the people of El Salvador; and\n       (5) encourages a continued commitment by the United States \n     and other countries to the long-term, sustainable development \n     of El Salvador.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his tremendous \nleadership in this area for many years as it relates to Latin America. \nHe is usually the first one on the floor to outline a strategy for U.S. \nassistance because he knows that we share mutual benefits in opening \ntrade lines and expanding our cultural ties to this particular part of \nthe world. I thank him for his leadership.\n  On behalf of the Senator from Connecticut and myself, I send a \nresolution to the desk and a bill that I will briefly describe.\n  Mr. President, the resolution simply calls the attention of the \nCongress to this particular dilemma in El Salvador, a country that has \nbeen wracked for decades by war, only to be hit 2 years ago by one of \nthe largest and most destructive hurricanes. And now to face an \nearthquake is almost too much to describe.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, the devastation has \ntotaled about $1 billion. To put that into perspective, that is 5 \npercent of El Salvador's entire GDP. The equivalent of 5 percent of the \nUnited States' GDP is $500 billion. When hurricane Andrew struck, it \nwas the largest natural disaster in our history at $7 billion. So it is \nhard for us in America to understand what a natural disaster can do to \na country whose economy is so fragile.\n  We are blessed in this Nation with an abundance of resources. We have \nthe means and structures in place to deal manage such crises. When \ndevastation like this hits other countries, they just reel. If we are \nnot there quickly with assistance, it is very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for them to recover.\n  Let me be quick to point out that the people of El Salvador will do \neverything they can to help themselves; they will work hard and \nstruggle. But the U.S. must be quick to aid them. That is what our \nresolution calls for.\n  Our bill specifically calls for quite a modest amount, but a start, \nto aid the over 50 thousand people who lost their homes. There is an \nimmediate need for shelter. That is how our bill will help in some way \nto complement what USAID is doing now.\n  I am happy to urge my friends and Members in the Senate and the House \nto come quickly to the aid of a country that needs so much help.\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I have watched the \nhumanitarian calamity unfurl in El Salvador, with horror and sorrow. In \nthe wake of a 7.6-size earthquake, the people of Central America are \nstruggling to rebuild their lives. Still marred by hurricane and flood \ndamage, they are desperate for help: to heal the wounded, feed the \nhungry, and shelter the displaced. And now, my colleagues, tragedy has \nstruck these people once again. Crisis has not spared the men, women \nand children of El Salvador.\n  Of course most of the destruction is difficult to quantify. The death \ntoll is over 700, with nearly 3,000 people injured, over 50,000 \nestimated homeless, 46,000 evacuated, and 91,000 homes damaged or \ndestroyed. In fact, as President Francisco Flores pleaded for \ninternational aid, he requested an additional 3,000 coffins.\n  As our Latin American neighbors desperately seek comfort in their \nfaith and family, let us find solace in a passage from the Second Book \nof Corinthians: ``Blessed be God . . . God of all comfort; Who comforts \nus in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who \nare in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are \ncomforted by God.''\n  The United States must rise to the occasion, and respond with aid. \nPerseverance has proven a critical trait for Salvadorans these last few \nweeks; we shouldn't count it to become a way of life.\n  Already, our ties with El Salvador run deep along both cultural and \nhistoric lines. On one score, El Salvador has stood by the U.S. as a \nstrategic ally and crucial trading partner during and after the Cold \nWar. On another, the U.S. remains home to millions of immigrants who \nhave sought refuge from calamity in Central America. Helping Central \nAmerica rebuild is of special concern in Louisiana. It may come as some \nsurprise to my colleagues to learn that New Orleans, with one of the \nlargest Honduran and Salvadoran communities in the U.S., is often cited \nas one of the largest Central American cities outside Latin America. \nAnd with organizations like Partners of the Americas, we are continuing \nto foment our bonds of friendship with Central America. The Louisiana \nChapter of Partners already has two Medical Assistance and Emergency \nPreparedness teams set up for travel to El Salvador to work in delivery \nof health care and work with communities on future needs.\n  It was these strong connections and long history of humanitarian aid \nwhich induced us to respond to pleas for help after Hurricane Mitch in \n1998. And for these reasons, I am introducing two pieces of legislation \ntoday. The first is a resolution to raise awareness of the \ncircumstances in El Salvador. Simply put, I am sure that my colleagues \nwill join me and Senator Dodd in expressing sympathy for the victims of \nthe devastating earthquake that struck El Salvador January 13, 2001.\n  The second piece of legislation is meant to complement USAID's \ncurrent efforts to provide short term relief and establish preventative \nmeasures to prepare for future disasters. As USAID and the State \nDepartment help draft long term strategies for Central America, let us \nnot neglect some immediate concerns. One of the most pressing problems \nafflicting the Honduran people is lack of shelter. In the last \nCongress, I authored legislation with several senators on both sides of \nthe aisle that provided $10 million for the home building program for \nCentral American countries affected by Hurricane Mitch. Today, I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting a similar measure to help \ncomplete the work which we began. We must do all that we can to \nexpeditiously provide homes for the more than 50,000 displaced persons \nthrough El Salvador. Time is of the essence.\n\n  In the last Congress, we witnessed a historic meeting in the \nCapitol's LBJ Room hosted by Senators Lott and the late Paul Coverdell. \nThere, four Central American Presidents made it clear to us that \npermanent housing along with opening trade opportunities were among the \nhighest priorities for their recovery. The Republican leader and \nmembers of his caucus were very helpful in providing housing aid after \nHurricane Mitch.\n  And yet, here we are, in the beginning of an entirely new Congress. \nPeople are once again homeless, and have no suitable means to protect \nthemselves from future natural disasters. I will be working along with \nother colleagues on both sides of the aisle--to see that we do all we \ncan in the area of housing in Central America. Let us begin today, with \nEl Salvador. Then we shall extend our efforts throughout the region, to \ntry and stop such devastation from occurring again. Let me assure our \nCentral American friends of one thing, we will not turn our backs on \nyou.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \npeople of El Salvador and India who are working so bravely towards \nrecovery in the wake of the devastating earthquakes that recently \nstruck those nations.\n  In the case of El Salvador, the death toll has exceeded 700, and \ncountless numbers have been left injured and homeless. More than 68,000 \npeople have been evacuated with no promise of ever returning, and \n60,000 are living in temporary shelters. Indeed, in addition to the \n74,000 homes that were so suddenly destroyed last month, another full \n118,000 may have been damaged beyond repair, and in some areas, Mr. \nPresident, one quarter of schools were completely destroyed. While the \ncost of rebuilding is still being calculated, the El Salvador National \nEmergency Committee estimates that it most certainly will run to over \n$1 billion, with an estimated $100 million loss in agricultural revenue \nalone.\n  At the time of the quake the people of El Salvador were already hard \nat work rebuilding their country after the 12 years of civil conflict \nthat had claimed the lives of 70,000 men, women, and children during \nthe 1980's. Their suffering, as they struggle toward stability and \ndevelopment, has only been compounded by the natural disasters of\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\nthe past two years. After a dozen years of civil strife, the people of \nEl Salvador were able to reach a political settlement of their \ndifferences. This speaks volumes about their commitment and courage. \nSince the 1992 peace accords, they have worked to build a prosperous \nand democratic country. This is a people tested well beyond what they \nshould be asked to bear. At each step on the path to recovery they have \nfaced a new challenge, and each time they have responded tenaciously \nand stepped forward again.\n  Mr. President, this earthquake is not the first time in recent memory \nthat a natural disaster has brought devastation on such a wide scale to \nthe people of El Salvador. In addition to this terrible earthquake, \nthere has also been a serious outbreak of dengue fever, a serious and \ndebilitating disease. And it was only two years ago that Hurricane \nMitch tore through Central America, exacting an unbearable toll on an \nalready fragile region. In the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and \nNicaragua, more than 11,000 lives were swept away in the rain, winds, \nand massive landslides that Mitch wrought. In some areas, more than 70 \npercent of crops were demolished. The price tag of that devastating \nhurricane soared to more than $4 billion once a full accounting was \nmade.\n  Mr. President, the people of El Salvador did not simply wring their \nhands in despair at the devastation of Mitch. They worked to improve \ntheir lives--they rebuilt roads, and schools, and homes. They began to \naddress the needs of citizens dealing with painful losses and an \nuncertain future. They began to pull themselves, with the help of \ninternational monetary and humanitarian assistance, out of the darkness \ncreated by Mitch when they were struck again by another wanton force of \nmother nature. This earthquake, which registered a thundering 7.6 on \nthe Richter scale, once again threatens to break the back of an already \nstruggling nation.\n  Mr. President, the story unfolding right now in India is no less \ncompelling and deserves our equal attention and concern. January 26th \nis traditionally a day of celebration in India, a day when people \ngather with their families in their homes to celebrate Republic Day, \ntheir constitution, and their country. But this January the clamor of \nparades and cheers was replaced by the roar of collapsing buildings \ntorn down by an earthquake registering 7.9 on the Richter scale, the \nworst earthquake in India in a half century. Tremors were felt in \nPakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh as the earth shook early that morning.\n  Hardest hit was Bhuj, a city of 150,000 in the Gujarat state, only 43 \nmiles from the quake's epicenter. The government of India places the \nofficial death toll at more than 16,000, but estimates this figure \ncould climb to a ghastly 100,000 in the days and weeks to come. Six \nhundred thousand people have been left homeless, many of whom are \nsleeping out in the open, with too few blankets among them, for fear of \nreturning to unsteady buildings. Many others simply have no place to \ngo. As many as 35 million people have been affected in some way by the \nearthquake, a figure so staggering it is almost impossible to \ncomprehend. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) places the cost of rehabilitation and \nreconstruction at $1.3 billion.\n  The daunting task that now lies before us is to bring some measure of \nrelief and care to those who were spared, including an estimated 3,000 \norphaned children. Tragically, the state of Gujarat was particularly \nvulnerable to a natural disaster such as this, as one quarter of its \ncitizens live below the poverty line and almost one half of households \nrely on public food distribution under normal conditions. In an \nemergency such as this, the situation becomes exponentially more dire \nthan before. In addition to the desperate need for food, medicine, and \nshelters, many Indian officials now fear epidemics of cholera and \ntyphoid if access to clean, safe, drinking water is not quickly \nrestored. This task has been made all the more difficult because it \ncomes in the midst of a 3 year drought in India which affected almost 3 \nmillion people in the state of Gujarat last year. The majority of water \nsupply wells are caked with mud and temporarily out of service, \npromoting concerns that some who managed to survive the earthquake may \ninstead succumb to disease while they wait for clean water. Certainly, \nthe survivors of this earthquake should not be exposed to further \nsuffering and injury.\n\n  Mr. President, we cannot and should not ask the governments of El \nSalvador and India, or their people, to walk the path toward recovery \nalone. At a time when these countries seek peace and development, we \nmust be there as both an ally and a partner. We must not turn away from \ntheir suffering, but rather must respond swiftly and effectively.\n  In fact, international relief efforts are already in full operation \nin both El Salvador and India, providing basic necessities such as \ndrinking water, food, blankets and temporary shelter to the quakes' \nvictims. The United States government is actively participating in \nthese international efforts through the work of USAID. At the time of \nthe quake, USAID personnel in El Salvador immediately began meeting \nwith Salvadoran relief agencies to evaluate the extent of the damage \nand the level of aid necessary. To date, USAID assistance to El \nSalvador totals more than $5 million, the majority of which was \nallocated for temporary shelter programs. In addition, the World Food \nProgramme has provided 900 metric tons of rations, the International \nFederation of the Red Cross has released $100,000 of disaster relief \nfunds as well as sent a delegation of relief workers to assist the \n1,200 person Salvadoran Red Cross. Medicines for hospitals and \ntemporary clinics are pouring in from the Pan-American Health \nOrganization, and the International Development Bank is considering a \n$20 million emergency loan. Monetary and other contributions from \nadditional organizations continue to arrive as well.\n  In India, USAID has pledged $9 million in emergency relief, including \nemergency food distribution, airlifts, and temporary shelter equipment. \nIndeed, more than 38 countries have responded to India's cries, as well \nas several hundred non-governmental organizations including UNICEF, The \nInternational Federation of the Red Cross, and the World Food \nProgramme.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that the Bush administration will \nrecognize how desperately our help is still needed in El Salvador and \nIndia and will respond not only with continued short-term emergency \nrelief aid, but also with a comprehensive plan for long term \nreconstruction and development. In the case of India that will require \nthat waiver authority be exercised by the Administration to permit \nbroader categories of assistance to be provided despite existing \nsanctions against that country. I would urge the Administration to do \nso.\n  I am confident that our colleagues in the Senate join with me in \nextending our prayers and our hands to the people of two nations who \nmust persevere at very difficult moments in their histories. I am \nconfident that with our help the lives of the peoples of these two \nnations will improve day by day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1091-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. REID.

SYMMS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me take a few additional moments to \nspeak to the Senate about a friend of ours who has worked with us in \nthe Senate for a good number of years. This week marks the last week of \nwork for the Senate in the career of Loretta Symms. Loretta, as I \nmentioned, has become a friend of all of us while she has worked n the \nSenate.\n  Loretta, who is originally from Coeur d'Alene, IO, moved to \nWashington in the midseventies and began her career working for then-\nCongressman Steve Symms as executive assistant and office manager. In \n1981, after Congressman Symms was elected to the Senate,\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\nLoretta became his executive secretary and then office manager.\n  Most in the Senate got to know Loretta in 1987 when Senator Bob Dole \nappointed her as the Republican representative to the Sergeant at Arms \nOffice. Between 1987 and 1996, Loretta filled a number of positions \nwithin that organization. As its director, she restructured the Capitol \nFacilities Department, providing career ladders, formal position \ndescriptions, instituting reading programs, basic computer classes for \nemployees, and other training programs--clearly, an effort to build a \nmore professional staff within the Sergeant at Arms Office.\n  Loretta also participated in the renovation and the opening of \nWebster Hall, the first and current Senate page dormitory.\n  Like you, Mr. President, I have had the privilege now of having \nseveral Senate pages, and I know they appreciate the facilities that \nare made available for them and, of course, the educational program \nthat is provided to them while they serve us in the Senate.\n  Loretta worked closely with the Office of the Secretary of the Senate \nand has been actively involved in the oversight and the management of \nthe Senate page program.\n  In 1996, Senator Trent Lott named Loretta Deputy Sergeant at Arms, \nthe post in which she still serves. As deputy, Loretta has managed the \nday-to-day operations of 750 employees of the Sergeant at Arms \norganization. In addition to assisting Presidents, Vice Presidents, and \nforeign heads of state on official visits to our Senate, Loretta has \nled Senate delegations to the funerals of former President Richard \nNixon, the late Senator John Heinz, the late Senator John Chafee, the \nlate Senator Paul Coverdell, and a good number of other Senators.\n  During her tenure as deputy, and working closely with the Assistant \nSecretary of the Senate, Loretta was instrumental in the formation of \nthe Joint Office of Education and Training which provides a wide \nvariety of professional seminars and training for the staff of the \nSenate offices and committees.\n  Loretta is married to former U.S. Senator Steve Symms. They have 7 \nchildren and 10 grandchildren. Retirement plans, she tells me, include \nbuilding a new home that I think is under construction at this moment, \ntraveling--that is if she can get Steve out of town--needlepoint, which \nshe already does very well, and spending a lot of time with her \nchildren and grandchildren who live as far away as Atlanta, GA, and in \nher original home of Coeur d'Alene, ID. Of course, we Idahoans look \nforward to seeing her back home in our State.\n  Yes, Mr. President, we will miss Loretta and, of course, the fine \nwork she has always provided us in the Senate. As a fellow Idahoan, I \nstand before you today to say how proud I am of Loretta Symms for the \nwork she has done for all of us and to make the Senate a better place \nto be and to work.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

If a motion to \ntable fails, the amendment then be fully debatable and amendable. \nFurther, that if the motion to table is not made at the expiration of \nthe 3 hours, a vote occur on the amendment without intervening action, \nmotion or debate, provided that no point of order be considered as \nhaving been waived by this agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nhave more comment later, but is it the intent of the majority leader to \ninclude in this unanimous consent agreement debate and disposal of the \nHollings constitutional amendment as well?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator from South Dakota \nthat I will, after this agreement is entered into, follow that \nimmediately with an agreement with regard to the Hollings \nconstitutional amendment, which I assume will also be agreed to.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the Senator like to be heard at this \npoint? I will be glad to yield to Senator McCain for comment before I \ngo to the next consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader, without whose strenuous efforts we would not have \nbeen able to enter into this unanimous consent agreement.\n  I want to make one thing clear: This campaign finance reform will be \nbefore the Senate bumping up against the April recess. I hope we can \ndevote every effort to get that done in the final 2 weeks before the \nApril recess. It would be very good if we could, over a 2-week period, \ndispose of amendments and move to final passage. It is critical that we \ndo that. Perhaps, if necessary, we could even delay the recess, \nsomething that none of us like, but we really don't want to have this \nissue clouding the legislative agenda for the rest of the year.\n  I thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, but I do want to point out, \nI do insist that we get a final vote on this issue. We really need to \nhave it disposed of finally. I know Senator Daschle and Senator Lott \nappreciate that.\n  If there is a filibuster, in other words, just a loading up of \namendments, whether they be extraneous or not, but basically covering \nthe same ground, I will be the first to condemn that, and I know that \nmy friend from Wisconsin feels the same way. There are a number of \nissues that need to be addressed, but we will know if it is becoming \nextraneous and just a delaying tactic. Then we will have to make our \ndecisions as to what our options are.\n  We owe it to the American people, and we owe it to the Members of \nthis body who have been involved in this issue for so long to bring \nthis issue to conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a colloquy between myself and Senator \nLott be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that colloquy also includes Senator Daschle. I \nthink the three of us are included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to see a copy of that colloquy.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could get a clarification, the Senator \nis reserving the right to object?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to see a copy of the \ncolloquy that was just referred to before agreeing to unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask that Senator McCain withhold that \nrequest until he can consult further with his colleague. I presume \nthere would be no problem at that point.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If I could make a brief comment, as did my leader, \nSenator McCain, I thank the majority leader for his cooperation on \nthis, coming to this agreement. I especially thank the Democratic \nleader, who has not only provided our Democratic unity on this issue, \nbut has also worked so effectively to help us come to this agreement. I \nalso thank the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, who is not with us on \nthe floor at this time, for his tremendous efforts on this.\n\n  I reiterate two points the Senator from Arizona has made. One is that \nthis, fortunately, through the cooperation of everybody, will be a \ntruly open process. Senator McCain and I have been very involved in \nthis issue. But we are certainly not the only people who know a lot \nabout this issue. Every Member of the Senate is an expert on campaign \nfinance reform. That means it is essential that every Senator have an \nopen chance to participate in the amending process. I believe that is \nwhat this agreement truly does.\n  The second is to simply agree with the Senator from Arizona that we \nwant to finish as fast as we can, within the bounds of giving everybody \na chance to participate. We hope to finish before the Easter recess. \nBut we will make sure that this matter comes to a vote up or down in \nthe end and that is our understanding in going forward with this \nagreement.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while the Senators are consulting, we are \ngoing to have a colloquy. Let me add to what has been said by Senators \nMcCain and Feingold, and I know Senator Daschle feels the same way.\n  This is a fair and very open agreement. I guess there is plenty of \nopportunity for mischief, if somebody on either side decides to cause \nit. I guess we could get tangled up on many issues, completely \nunrelated to election and campaign finance reform. But we are trying to \nall act in good faith. We are going to have to try to do that.\n  The way this is constructed, Senators should have an opportunity to \noffer amendments, have those amendments debated for a reasonable period \nof time--3 hours is a good bit of time--and get a vote. Then if that \ndoesn't carry, then a second degree could be offered or other \namendments could be offered. I suppose that one example of the kind of \nmischief you can have is a Senator could get the floor and talk for a \nlong time without ever offering an amendment and eat up 2 hours before \nhe or she ever lays down their amendment. Then there would be 3 hours. \nThat is not good faith. That would be violating the spirit of what we \nare doing here. Three hours is enough time to talk and have a vote.\n  I have said all along, unlike in the past, I think everybody ought to \nhave a chance to make their case and get a vote. I also think that 2 \nweeks is long enough. In that period of time, if you get to figuring \nthe amount of time we are going to be in, a number of amendments could \nbe offered. I don't know whether it will wind up being 15 or 25. But \nthere will be plenty of opportunity, and more, for amendments to be \noffered and then to wrap it up. I think, hopefully, we will get a vote \non final passage of the end product and move on. I am going to think \nthat bad faith, again, is at play if we are into the middle of the \nthird week, or if it goes beyond that, when we should be taking up the \nbudget resolution instead or taking up some other issue, such as \nenergy, or any other matter. I think we have a fair parameter in terms \nof how amendments can be offered, debated, voted on, and come to a \nconclusion within a 2-week period of time.\n\n  I ask that Senators on both sides of the aisle try to live up not \nonly to the specifics of the agreement and the colloquy, but the spirit \nin which it has been put together.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was going to wait until after the other \nunanimous consent request, but I am compelled now to add my comments. I \ndon't think it could have been said any better than what you have just \nheard the majority leader say. As we talked about how we were going to \nrun the Senate over the next 2 years, I can't tell you the number of \ntimes we have said you can put as much as you want on paper, but at the \nend of the day it is going to be what good faith there is between \ncaucuses and among Senators on whether or not this will work. I believe \nthis is a good example. We can put as much on paper as we want to, but \nit still depends upon the intentions and the approach and the attitude \nthat people bring to the floor as we debate this issue.\n  As the majority leader said, I think 2 weeks ought to be adequate. \nThere are a lot of complicated issues here. Clearly, if anybody comes \nwith good faith, we ought to have a good, vigorous debate on all of the \nissues and accommodate all of the ideas and the philosophies that are \npresented as we consider these amendments.\n  I compliment the majority leader and thank him for his approach in \nthis matter, and I certainly compliment our two ardent advocates and \nleaders on campaign finance reform, Senators McCain and Feingold. They \nhave put forth an extraordinary amount of effort to bring us to this \npoint. We are going to work with them to assure this is a productive \nand successful debate. I am appreciative of the effort that has been \nmade to get us to this point. I look forward to the debate. I don't \nthink we can have a better framework within which to have the debate in \nthe coming weeks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today to \nshare with my colleagues the discussions that the Senator from Arizona \nand I have been having on campaign reform. I appreciate the Senator's \nwillingness to work through this issue, and I believe that we have come \nup with a fair arrangement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader for working with me on this \nagreement. I believe that it accommodates my desire to have a full and \nopen debate early, while ensuring that the leader has the opportunity \nto move important bills prior to its consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under this agreement, the President will have some time to \nintroduce his agenda to the American people and to the Congress. I \nbelieve that the agreement we have reached will allow us to begin work \non some of these issues, while ensuring that campaign, political, and \nelection reform is addressed early. It is my hope that we will be able \nto move expeditiously on both education reform and the budget \nresolution in the next 2 months. To that end, should we have a budget \nresolution ready for floor consideration prior to March 19, we will \nconsider the resolution first. If the budget is not ready within that \ntimeframe, we will consider campaign, political and election reform \nfirst, to be followed by consideration of the budget in early April.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Leader, I just want to add that I am very pleased \nthat this agreement has been worked out in a cooperative way with \nSenator McCain and also the Democratic leader. I also want to thank \nSenator Levin for his contribution to this agreement. We look forward \nto having a full and fair debate on our bill for the first time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is important that there is a full and open debate on \ncampaign reform. I am pleased that the majority leader has agreed to \nuse S. 27, the McCain-Feingold bill, as the legislation that will be \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my intention to call up S. 27, the McCain-Feingold \nbill, within the time frame we have discussed. I also believe that we \nshould have a full and open debate. I expect that many of my colleagues \nhave ideas on campaign reform, political reform\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\nand election reform that warrant consideration by the Senate. The \namendments, I hope, should be on the subjects of campaign reform, \npolitical reform and election reform. In addition, I do not anticipate \na circumstance arising that will compel me to use my prerogatives as \nmajority leader to fill up the amendment tree. I anticipate that we \nwill have a full, open and spirited debate on any amendment offered to \nthe Senate for consideration. Let me be clear, we intend to allow an \nopportunity for all amendments to be considered. Therefore, I do not \nexpect that any major striking amendments, or the so-called wrap around \namendments will be offered toward the end of the Senate's \nconsideration. I intend to complete action on the bill, working long \nhours if necessary, within 2 weeks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the majority leader's assurances that all \namendments will be considered by the Senate. It is also my intention to \nlet the will of the Senate prevail. I share the majority leader's \nintention that all amendments be fairly considered and voted on prior \nto final passage, and I agree that a wrap around amendment would be a \nshow of bad faith. I will work with the majority leader to ensure that \nall amendments are voted on and the bill is ready for final action \nwithin the 2 weeks that the leader anticipates. In order to facilitate \nthis, it would be my hope and expectation that the bill would not be \nfilibustered.\n  Mr. LOTT. As the Senator from Arizona is aware, every Senator has \nrights in this regard. However, I would discourage any efforts to \nfilibuster this measure, and do not anticipate a filibuster of this \nbill. In fact, it is my expectation that the Senate will finish \ndeliberations of campaign, political and election reform within 2 weeks \nof commencing action on it. I am determined to stick to this schedule, \neven if we must work through the weekend to complete action.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the leader for his comments, and I want to \nassure him that supporters of this bill are ready to work through the \nweekend and into the evenings to make sure that this bill passes the \nSenate in a timely manner. I think the American people will applaud the \nleader's statement that he does not anticipate a filibuster on this \nimportant legislation. I think we have reached a fair and balanced \nagreement, and I congratulate the leader and my colleague from Arizona \nfor this achievement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader and I appreciate his \nwillingness to work with me on this important issue. Again, I believe \nthat we have reached a fair and balanced agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I congratulate the majority leader and the Senator \nfrom Arizona for this win-win compromise. The deal will allow the \nPresident's top agenda items to be center stage prior to a discussion \non campaign and election reform. And I agree that we will all work to \nkeep the debate focused on these issues and that a wrap-around \namendment would be a show of bad faith.\n  We may disagree on the public's interest in campaign reform, but I \nthink that we can all certainly agree that there is a true public \ndemand for election reform and political reform. The upcoming debate \nwill in many respects be the equivalent of a bill mark-up on the Senate \nfloor. I think we all agree that there should be a full opportunity for \neveryone who wants to offer an amendment to be allowed to do so and to \nget a vote on that amendment without any games played by either side. \nSo I want to thank the majority leader and my colleague from Arizona \nfor their willingness to ensure that an open and robust debate will \noccur on this matter. I also appreciate the willingness of my colleague \nfrom Arizona to work with the majority leader to ensure that no vote on \nfinal passage occur until all amendments are voted on. I, too, believe \nthat this is a fair agreement and again, I congratulate the leader and \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1094-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--HOLLINGS-SPECTER CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

CLAIR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a special guest joined us at our caucus \nlunch this afternoon. His name is Arthur Malan St. Clair. We know him \nbetter as ``Tinker.''\n  Tinker St. Clair has spent 55 years in public service. He has worked \nin the Senate--for the Sergeant at Arms--for the last 22 years. This \nFriday, he is retiring.\n  His leaving was inevitable. He is, after all, 85 years old, although \nyou would never guess it. Even so, Tinker's departure will leave a void \nfor all of us.\n  Every Member of this Senate knows how dedicated Tinker is to his \nwork. We all know how much he loves this Senate, and this Nation. We \nhave all benefitted--at some time--from Tinker's kind smile, and from \nhis quiet words of encouragement, which always seemed to come exactly \nwhen we needed them. We will all miss him.\n  Tinker St. Clair was born in a coal miner's camp in McDowell County, \nWest Virginia. His father worked in the mines. All together, his \nparents had six sons and one daughter.\n  He got his nickname from his grandmother, because he was a curious \nlittle boy--always ``tinkering'' with something, she said.\n  While some of his brothers followed their father into the coal mines, \nTinker knew he wanted to do something different with his life. After \ngraduating from high school in 1937, he went to work as a school bus \ndriver, and then a commercial bus driver. He later owned his own small \ntaxi business.\n  In 1940, Tinker had the good sense and good fortune to marry Elnora \nHall. They would remain married for 55 years, until her death.\n  Tinker and Elnora had two daughters, Patty and Linda. In 1948, when \nthe girls were little, Tinker began his life in public service. He \nbecame Deputy Sheriff for McDowell County.\n  Over the next 20 years, he would serve as: court bailiff; criminal \ninvestigator for the McDowell County prosecuting attorney; and justice \nof the peace.\n  In 1968, Tinker was elected McDowell County Clerk, running on the \nslogan: ``the man to give the office back to the people.'' In 1974, he \nwas re-elected--with 89 percent of the vote. He might have won 100 \npercent of the vote had he chosen to run for a third term.\n  As a local office holder, Tinker helped many a national leader \nthrough the back roads of West Virginia. He walked through the coal \nfields with President Truman. In 1960, he campaigned with a charismatic \nyoung Senator from Massachusetts, John Kennedy. He greeted President \nJohnson during LBJ's visit to West Virginia. He was at Robert Kennedy's \nside in 1968 when Senator Kennedy sought to bring hope to places \nprosperity had overlooked. He has been a constant help over the years \nto his fellow West Virginians, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller.\n  In July 1979, Tinker and Elnora left West Virginia and moved to the \nWashington area to be closer to their daughters and grandchildren. At \n63--an age when most people are thinking about retiring--Tinker came to \nwork in the Senate.\n  A friend once told me that--for a month after she started working in \nthis building--every time she saw Tinker, she thought, ``Which Senator \nis that?'' You can see how a person could think that. Tinker St. Clair \nis one of the most distinguished-looking men you could ever hope to \nmeet. He's also one of the kindest.\n  At our caucus lunch today, Tinker told us he plans to visit his two \nbrothers in Florida. He also hopes to do a little traveling with his \n82-year-old sister, who lives in Tennessee--if she can get away long \nenough from the little shop she owns and runs.\n  Tinker also told us about some of the friendships he has made in the \nSenate. Probably the most important of those friendships was with the \nman who was sitting at his left at lunch, his fellow West Virginian, \nRobert Byrd--the only man in the Senate with hair as nice as Tinker's \nown.\n  He also spoke about his friendship with the man seated to his right: \nTed Kennedy. They first met in 1960--two years before Ted Kennedy was \nelected to the Senate. Recently, as a token of their friendship, \nSenator Kennedy gave Tinker a framed photograph. It shows the three \nKennedy brothers John, Bobby and Ted all standing together, smiling and \nyoung.\n  ``It's really something,'' Tinker told us.\n  We feel that same way about you, Tinker. You're really something.\n  On behalf of the Senators and staff, I want to say: We're proud to \nhave had the chance to work with you and to know you. You are a \ntreasured member of our Senate family. You take with you our best \nwishes as you begin this next chapter of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/06/senate-section/article/S1095-4", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
