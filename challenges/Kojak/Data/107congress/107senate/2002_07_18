Mr. President, I appreciate very much being recognized \nand having an opportunity this morning to speak regarding the situation \nI believe we are in and the challenges right now as they relate to \nmoving forward on addressing prices and cost containment in the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  We heard a lot of discussion yesterday. We had the opportunity to \ndebate whether to open the border to Canada to have more competition \nbetween the prices that American companies charge in the United States \nand those in Canada. I was pleased we were able to move forward and \ncome together on a plan to open the border, and now we place it in the \nhands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify the \ndifference in prices which we know are there and the fact that there is \nno safety risk, which we know is the case. So I look forward to moving \nahead.\n  A lot came up during that debate and I did want to, as we set the \nstage to debate additional efforts today to lower prices, speak as to \nhow I view the situation in our country right now with our most \nprofitable industry. I welcome the fact that we have a very profitable, \nsuccessful prescription drug industry. There are new lifesaving drugs \nbeing created that keep people out of the hospital and living longer. \nWe celebrate that.\n  Over the last several years, we have seen more and more of a focus on \nselling and marketing and promotion than creating the next generation \nof lifesaving drugs. That is of great concern to me. When we talk about \nreducing prices, we hear that means reducing research and development. \nYet there is nothing today that indicates that is factually accurate.\n  Yesterday, Family USA produced another study showing the companies \nare spending 2.5 times more on advertising, promotion, marketing and \nadministration than they do on research and development. The blue on my \nchart is R and the gold is advertising and marketing. For each of the \ntop drug companies, the gold line is much higher than the blue line. We \nknow there is more being spent in this effort.\n  We also know when you look overall at the profits versus R, we see \nstark numbers. Merck is a successful company in the United States. \nTheir profit was three times more than what they spent on R last \nyear. I do not begrudge that profit margin, but if we are going to have \nthe next generation of new lifesaving medications, we need to see that \nR is the focus and that prescriptions are affordable. If they are not \naffordable, they are not available. That is not acceptable. This is \nabout trying to get some balance in the system. Pfizer had 1.5 times \nmore in profit last year than what they spent on R They spent more \non advertising than on R\n  In the context of what we are talking about right now with corporate \nresponsibility, and companies where executives take the dollars and \nrun, leaving the shareholders or employees holding the bag, my concern \nis that while we are talking about the need to stop prescription drug \nprices from rising three times the rate of inflation, which is the \naverage right now--the average drug used by seniors last year went up \nthree times the rate of inflation. Our seniors do not have insurance \ncoverage and are paying the highest prices in the world--but these \ncompanies are making top profits in the world today, and we find \nastounding salaries in compensation for the CEOs. I do not begrudge it, \nbut I do when our average senior is deciding this morning: Do I eat \nbreakfast or do I take my medicine? Companies are saying, no, they \ncannot lower prices; they could not possibly have more competition, \nthey cannot open to Canada, they cannot allow more generics on the \nmarket, they cannot possibly handle more competition, or lowering \nprices without cutting R\n\n  I am offended when I look at the numbers, when we are seeing more on \npromotion and advertising, more on the sales machine than on research \nand developing new drugs, more in profits, way more in profits than \nR, and more in the compensation for those at the top.\n  I will not name individuals, but we see the five highest paid \nexecutives in the industry, and the top at Bristol-Myers, with a salary \nof almost $75 million last year in direct compensation, not counting \nunexercised stock options. Compare that to the average senior who is \neither not getting their medicine, cutting their pills in half, or \ntaking them every other week; families who are struggling; small \nbusinesses whose premiums are skyrocketing and are having trouble \naffording health care for their employees because of 30 to 40 percent \npremium increases, mostly because of prescription drugs, and employees \nare told they cannot get a pay raise next year because the company has \nto cover more in medical premiums. I believe that company is sincere in \nhaving to struggle with those benefits, those prices.\n  Put that picture together with that of the drug companies, one of the \nmost highly subsidized industries in the world: $23.5 billion we as \ntaxpayers put into the National Institutes of Health this year. So the \ncompanies can take that basic research, and I support that--I would \nsupport more--they take that basic research, and they then develop \ntheir drugs. We give them tax credits and tax writeoffs to develop \nthrough research. We also give them tax writeoffs for their \nadministration, their sales, their marketing. We give them a 20-year \npatent so they are protected from competition for their name brand so \nthey can recover their costs for R What do we get at the end? The \nhighest prices in the world, and an effort to fight everything we are \ntrying to do in the Senate--to increase competition and to lower prices \nand to provide Medicare benefit.\n  Then to add insult to injury, we see those at the top of the \ncompanies that who are fighting us earning $75 million a year, $40 \nmillion a year, $28 million, $23 million, $15 million a year. We see \nunexercised stock options. At the top is Merck, $93 million in \nunexercised stock options; $76 million; $60 million; $56 million; $46 \nmillion.\n  I could live on that. I think everybody within the sound of my voice \ntogether could live on that. I don't begrudge that. But I do begrudge \npeople in that category heading companies that fight everything we do. \nThey have put more money into their lobbying corporation than anybody \nelse. For every one Senator there are six drug company lobbyists who \nspend their time more on sales and marketing than anything else.\n  Let me speak from the standpoint of our future health care \ndiscoveries. In Money and Investing, the Wall Street Journal, there was \nan article about a merger this week, and one of the disturbing parts of \nthat was this:\n  After falling for 5 years, new drug applications to the Food and Drug \nAdministration are expected this year to slide further. Through the \nfirst 5 months of this year, the FDA had received just two new \napplications for new drugs. Last year, total new drug applications \ndropped to 24, less than half the 53 received in 1996. Many in the \nindustry say that past mergers may be among these reasons for these \ndrops in new drug discoveries.\n  What I see is an effort more and more to focus on the fast, easy \nmoney, the quarterly report. Eighty percent of the new applications for \npatents now at FDA are not for new lifesaving discoveries that increase \nour longevity and deal with health challenges, but they are, instead, \nwhat are called ``me too'' drugs; 80 percent of the patents. A purple \npill becomes a pink bill, a daily dose becomes a weekly dose, or maybe, \nto add insult to injury, the packaging changes.\n  I urge, as I draw to a conclusion, that as we look at the issues \nbefore the Senate on increasing competition and lowering prices, we do \nso understanding there is a lot of room to bring down prices without \never touching R I argue we need to do everything possible to change \nthe incentives to a longer view, to more research and development. This \nindustry is out of\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nwhack, just as the other industries we were talking about, the system \nof accounting and auditing, the whole process that has now put us in a \nposition where the incentives are to run right up to the line or over \nthe line, to push for the quarterly profit statement, to look for the \nintermediate gain, the immediate cash rather than the long-term view.\n  Unfortunately, this is not a pair of shoes. It is not even a new \ncar--and I want everybody to buy a new car. This is not an optional \nbuy. This is lifesaving medicine. The research is heavily subsidized \nand paid for by taxpayers, and I think we deserve better. I think that \nis what this debate is about.\n  We want a healthy industry, we want R, but we want the American \ntaxpayers to get their money's worth and be able to afford the \nmedicines they have invested in and helped to create, medicines that \nwill help them and their families be able to be healthy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask to speak for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Stabenow). The Senator has that right and \nis recognized for a period of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to support passage of a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit and express my strong belief that \nthe time has come when a Medicare prescription drug benefit that \nprovides affordable and meaningful coverage for all our Nation's \nseniors should be implemented. We have a historic opportunity to reform \nour Medicare programs and put in place something that I think we all \nknow is necessary and important for our Nation's well-being.\n  I particularly also thank Senator Stabenow, the Presiding Officer, \nfor her extraordinary leadership in raising the level of awareness, the \nlevel of concern and consideration, not only inside the Chamber but \nacross the country. She has done a remarkable job of elevating the \nquality of debate on the subject.\n  Furthermore, and equally so, I thank my colleagues, Senator Bob \nGraham, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Miller, for their efforts to bring \nforward a real and meaningful prescription drug program. It is one that \nI think all of us should get behind and support. It is measured but \ncertain.\n  I have yet to speak out on specific programs. As the Chair knows, the \nindustry which you just so eloquently spoke about is an important part \nof the community which I represent. It has been important, in my view, \nto find a response to this great need in our Nation that also does not \nundermine all the elements that I think make the industry so important \nto our Nation and so entrepreneurial. In fact, I think the Graham-\nKennedy-Miller program has found that balance. It is for that reason I \nalso want to make sure I am on record expressing my support.\n  All of us know it is time to act. We need to ensure that seniors can \nafford their prescription drugs. We have heard the refrain that we \nshould not be forcing people into these hard choices, and it is a \nreality. Anyone who is in public life, who interfaces with our senior \ncitizens around our country--just as much in New Jersey as anyplace \nelse--knows that these are real world choices for people: Whether they \ncan afford their lifesaving, quality-of-life-producing prescription \ndrugs or whether they have to choose between that and other aspects of \nquality of life, including the simple things such as house and home, \nand their ability to have quality of life in general, which our Nation \ncan afford, absolutely, including putting food on the table.\n  The fact is, this is a choice far too many of our seniors are having \nto make, and it is time for us to move to make these costly drugs \navailable so our seniors can lead that independent, productive life \nthat I think all of us hope for, for our families, our parents, and \ncertainly we want for our generation as well.\n  That is why I support this bill. I will be very aggressive in getting \nout and trying to promote it, not only here in the Chamber but actually \namong those in the industry so we can move forward.\n  This effort truly does guarantee prescription drug coverage for every \nsenior--it is universal--rather than relying on the private insurance \nindustry to provide that coverage. That is what the alternative House \nbill is all about. I think many of us think that is going to leave a \nlot of folks out of the system.\n\n  The Democratic package also ensures that seniors will have coverage \nall year. It does not have to deal with so-called doughnut holes, or \nblack holes, two-thirds of the calendar year where people are left out \nof any kind of coverage. That is certainly the case with the proposal \nthat is coming out of the House, the Republican proposal.\n  Under that proposal, a senior would pay $400 a month for her or his \nprescriptions, but they would essentially be out of coverage for nearly \ntwo-thirds of the calendar year. I think that is a major flaw that \nneeds to be addressed. I think it is very effectively done in the \nGraham-Kennedy proposal.\n  Furthermore, the Republican proposal threatens to undermine the \nprivate insurance market. This is really a perverse economic impact. \nTheir proposal would have the effect of encouraging employers to drop \nprescription drug coverage from employer-provided health plans. In 10 \nminutes I am not going to go through this, but the fact is, individual \nworkers facing catastrophic drug costs would not have their drugs \nprovided by the Government if their employer paid for some portion of \nthose drug costs. It is a really serious flaw about which I think \nalmost anyone who has analyzed the proposal coming from the House is \nconcerned. It needs to be addressed under any circumstances.\n  I also ask those who have criticized the cost of the Democratic \npackage that they consider the high cost of not providing comprehensive \ndrug coverage. They call that a cost-benefit analysis. It is well known \nthat prescription drugs reduce the number of hospital admissions, \nsurgical procedures, and doctor visits. They also can reduce costly \nadmissions to nursing homes, helping seniors to stay home longer. Those \nare real savings that will come. I do not think we have fully \nappreciated that or explained those or factored those into our \nthinking.\n  Needless to say, this is not just about saving money, it is about \nimproving the quality of life for our seniors, allowing them to lead \nlonger, healthier, and more productive lives. This is reform that \nMedicare needs. It is one we cannot afford not to address, not to deal \nwith, not to move on.\n  In my own State of New Jersey, we recognized this need about 25 years \nago when we created a pharmaceutical benefit for seniors--probably the \nbest in the Nation. By the way, we have to make sure that as we \nlegislate here, we engineer this legislation in a way that it is \nsupportive of the prescription drug program we have in New Jersey, \nwhich is designed to serve the low- and middle-income seniors in an \nextraordinary way.\n  But I have to say it is almost unconscionable that States such as New \nJersey and Pennsylvania--I think it has a similar program--have stepped \nto the plate to provide this important health care benefit to seniors \nwhile the Federal Government has failed to do it. As a matter of fact, \nit makes New Jersey a magnet for seniors--a positive element in our \nsociety. But people have recognized this fundamental need and have \nvoted with their feet with respect to the follow-through on this.\n  The Democratic plan will help States such as New Jersey expand, if we \nare careful about how we write this legislation, and improve that \nprescription drug program for everyone. By contrast, the Republican \nproposal does nothing. As a matter of fact, it will increase--if we are \nto meet the constraints that are put down in the bill--co-pays and \ncoverage under our PAAD Program, which is what our benefit program is \ncalled. That is simply unacceptable and will require a lot of \nresistance from those of us who care about our seniors--in New Jersey \nspecifically.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a Patients' Bill of Rights to ensure \nthat Americans with private health insurance have access to \nprescription drugs and medical procedures they need to maintain their \nhealth. Should we not offer the same protection to our seniors, \nmillions of whom currently lack access to essential medicines? It is a \nfundamental flaw of Medicare. It is one we need to deal with, \nparticularly because Medicare was designed before the explosive growth \nof medications, so the\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\nuse of medicines is not covered where they are now being applied.\n  We have an opportunity and a responsibility to correct this flaw by \nenacting a prescription drug benefit.\n  I want to work with my colleague in the Chair, my friend from New \nYork, and all of those who truly care about making our society one \nwhere access to quality of life that America can offer is made \navailable to all citizens. It is absolutely essential that we move \nforward.\n  Lastly, it concerns me that we are willing to spend $4 trillion to \nmake last year's tax cuts permanent, which essentially goes to a lot of \nthose people the Chair was talking about who are making $70 million and \n$40 million, the well off in our society, and we don't think we have \nthe resources to pass a $100 billion prescription drug benefit for \nsenior citizens in our Nation.\n  It is time for us to act. Those people have worked hard, paid their \ntaxes, and supported our Nation in all kinds of ways. It is time to get \na prescription drug benefit, get it through this Chamber, get it to the \nHouse and to the President's desk.\n  I thank the Chair. I look forward to working with you and all my \ncolleagues to make sure this comes to pass as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I commend my colleague from New Jersey \nfor his statement, which I think all of us recognize was arrived at \nafter considerable study and thought since he does represent a State \nwhich has a concentration of our finest pharmaceutical companies. His \nstatement today, which shows a balance and a very thoughtful approach \nto policies that affect us, is a great addition to this debate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 12 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I wish to pick up on a comment that you made at the \nend of your remarks before assuming the Chair.\n  I, as all of our colleagues, deeply respect the leadership you have \nprovided on this issue. You are down here on the floor day after day \nmaking the case on behalf of the need for prescription drug coverage \nand reform that would provide the lifesaving quality-of-life drugs to \nour seniors and open the doors to others who are not yet of Medicare \neligibility but who have very high prescription drug costs.\n  At the end of your remarks you said this was connected to the debate \nthat we finished last week concerning the serious issues about \naccounting and corporate governance to which we have to pay special \nattention. I agree with that. We may be debating prescription drug \ncoverage, but it is in the larger context of what kind of country we \nwant to be. What kind of values do we espouse? How are we going to \nensure that people not only have the perception but the reality that \nour system works for everybody, not just for the rich and the powerful, \nnot just for the big companies but for the small businesses and for the \naverage citizen? There is a connection. I think that connection \ndeserves to be drawn. I thank you for doing so.\n  The legislation we are discussing this week addresses not just a top \nhealth priority but a fundamental value of who we are as Americans. \nWill we or will we not provide access to affordable prescription drugs \nfor our seniors? Will we or will we not make equivalent generic drugs \navailable for all Americans? Simple question; complicated answer. That \nis what we are attempting to work out today.\n  The prescription drug issue is well known to any of us who have had \nto fill a prescription in the last several years. Prescription drug \ncosts have been rising at an annual rate of 20 percent, far outpacing \ninflation and more than doubling in the last 5 years.\n  We set a goal a couple of years ago to double NIH funding within 5 \nyears, but instead we have seen the doubling of drug industry costs.\n  Costs have increased for a number of reasons. People have begun to \nuse more of these so-called lifestyle drugs in addition to the \nlifesaving drugs. Costs are also increasing because of drug company \nmarketing efforts to shift patients away from older, less expensive \ndrugs to newer, costlier, so-called ``me too'' drugs which have had an \nimpact. ``Me too'' drugs are copycat drugs that actually do little or \nnothing more than the existing drugs we already have, but they are more \nexpensive because they are new. It is like when you go to the \nsupermarket and they say new and improved, new and different. These are \nnew but not necessarily improved drugs. They are copycat drugs.\n  We have recently heard examples of Vioxx and Celebrex, expensive, \nnew, heavily advertised drugs that doctors now tell us may be no better \nthan the kinds of drugs you get across the counter for which you don't \nneed a prescription.\n  Drug companies are also spending up to $13,000 per doctor annually \ntrying to influence research results and prescribing patterns. Think \nabout it. Every doctor in America has a $13,000 allocation from drug \ncompanies that flood his or her offices with salespeople with all kinds \nof inducements--with trips and dinners and the like in order to \nconvince the doctor to use this different drug than the doctor has been \nusing or to try the new and improved copycat drug. This is going on \ndespite the ethics and gift guidelines that the American Medical \nAssociation has developed and that the pharmaceutical association--\nknown as PhRMA--has agreed to follow.\n\n  Many of my physician constituents continue to complain to me that, \ndespite these ethical guidelines, drug company representatives have \nattempted to circumvent and flout them.\n  With the multibillion-dollars that drug companies spend annually on \ndrug promotion and on physicians, this shocks me, I have to tell you. I \nsaid to my staff: You have to go and triplecheck this. I couldn't \nbelieve it. But with the money they spend on drug promotion mostly \ndirectly to physicians, their spending exceeds the amount of money that \nwe spend as a nation educating all medical students and medical \nresidents in our Nation.\n  That just isn't right. We have a voluntary set of guidelines that are \nsupposed to control it, but, unfortunately, as with a lot of human \nnature, those voluntary guidelines don't have enough teeth in them to \nmake it happen.\n  I am also concerned about the erosion of privacy. Drug companies are \ndoing everything they can to convince patients--that is you and me--to \ntry the drug. In addition to convincing physicians with all of their \nmoney, they are spending a heck of a lot of money trying to convince us \nto try something.\n  A friend of mine said she didn't even know she had a problem until \nshe saw an advertisement. And all of a sudden, she now thinks she has a \nproblem. She talked to her doctor. Her doctor said she really didn't \nneed it. She said: I am not sure. She said: Should I listen to the \ndoctor or should I listen to the advertising? I said: For Heaven's \nsake, you wouldn't do that on anything else. Why would you do it on \nthis?\n  Advertising really works. It gets into our psyche. It kind of \nconvinces us of things and makes us feel that we are not doing what we \nshould unless we go out and buy a new product. That is the same with \nnew drugs.\n  The privacy aspect is different than going out and being convinced \nthat you need a different car or that you should try a different \ndetergent.\n  Under the Bush administration, privacy regulations previously issued \nby the Secretary of Health and Human Services have been changed. These \nchanges make it easier for drug companies to acquire patient \ninformation about us and then to use that patient information they get \nfrom doctors, pharmacists, or health provider organizations without our \nfull knowledge, and certainly without our prior consent.\n  Several weeks ago, we heard about a woman in Florida who received an \nunsolicited prescription drug, Prozac, in the mail. She believes her \nprivacy was violated. I think she is right. It was violated. Can you \nimagine, all of a sudden, into your mailbox come drugs that you never \nasked for, that were never prescribed for you? I do not think any drug \ncompany should have access to a patient's records or be able to use \nthat kind of intimate information without a patient's full agreement \nand consent.\n  So I worry about the combination of the Bush administration weakening\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\nprivacy regulations and the drug companies using that information, \nwhich is extremely personal, to try to sell us something.\n  I do not have any argument with the lifesaving benefits that are \nprovided to all of us because of the work done by pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers. Their role in the American health system is not only \nvital but should be rewarded through exclusive patents on their \ndiscovery for the full patent term of up to 20 years, as set forth by \none of our colleagues and a colleague from the House in the Hatch-\nWaxman bill passed years ago.\n  However, Hatch-Waxman represented a carefully crafted balance \ndesigned to make the American consumer--the American patient--the \nultimate beneficiary. On the one hand, Hatch-Waxman established full \nrestoration of the monopoly patent time for a brand name drug as an \nincentive for real innovation. On the other hand, Hatch-Waxman ensured \nthat after the monopoly term ended, the consumer would get the benefit \nof competition because there would no longer be an exclusive right to \nmanufacture and market that drug.\n  We know the consumer will get benefits with lower drug prices and \ngeneric versions which are just as good as the brand name patented \nversions. Generic drugs share the same active ingredients as the brand \nname drugs but, as this chart shows, the generics are usually \nconsiderably less expensive. Generic drugs have also increased in price \nbut at a much slower rate than brand name drugs have.\n  Generic drugs help keep prices down, particularly for our seniors. If \nyou look at this next chart, it is a chart showing the costs that are \ninvolved in manufacturing and advertising drugs. It is very clear that \nthe amount of money that is spent to market these drugs goes right into \nthe cost of them. That $13,000 per doctor, that has to be paid by \nsomebody, and we are the ones who end up paying for it.\n  It is important to protect innovation. Nobody wants to undermine \ninnovation. But in recent years, drug companies have clearly taken \nadvantage of these loopholes to keep generics off the market. What we \nhave found is that the brand name manufacturers are frivolously listing \npatents not because the generics will infringe on the patents but \nsimply to force generics to certify that those patents are invalid in \norder to get the lower priced generic drugs to market. The reason is \nthat forcing this certification gives the brand name drug an automatic \n2\\1/2\\-year extension, called a 30-month stay, on their monopoly, \nregardless of the merits of the patent.\n  Let me give you a few quick examples.\n  There is a medication called Pulmicort, which is an asthma \nmedication. In addition to all the patents on the compound--in other \nwords, the active ingredients that are in the drug that makes it work \nfor asthma--in addition to all the patents on the compound, on its use, \nand on its formulation, they have a patent on the container, which is \nin what is called the Orange Book. The container may be a really nice \ncontainer, it may look great inside your medicine chest, but when a \ngeneric company is seeking to make a pill for asthma, it is not trying \nto make the bottle, it is trying to make the pill. So a patent on the \nbottle should not prevent the generic version of the drug from coming \nto market.\n  In addition, we know that some drug companies make sweetheart deals \nwith generic companies, literally paying them--I would say bribing \nthem--to stay off the market, which under one of the loopholes in the \ncurrent law means that other generics also have to stay out of the \nmarket.\n  So generic X comes and says, we are going to the market with this \ndrug, and the big drug company says, we will pay you not to; and they \nsay, OK, we will not. That means nobody can come with a competitive \ndrug that will do the same thing at a lower price.\n  I support adequate patent terms for pharmaceutical manufacturers to \nconduct research and development, which all of us know is high risk and \nhigh stakes, but the best way to encourage that research and \ndevelopment is a prospective approach rather than a patent extension \nafter the fact.\n  Companies, as we know, have been maneuvering at the 11th hour just as \ntheir patents are about to expire. This legislation, the underlying \nSchumer-McCain legislation, is intended to prevent that.\n  So let's do the right thing. Let's get our generic manufacturers a \nlevel playing field. Let's get a prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors. And let's send a message to America that we want to treat \npeople fairly in this great country of ours.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will take just a short time to talk a \nlittle bit about pharmaceuticals. Obviously, there are different ideas \nabout that. Indeed, there should be. We are on the floor again, \nhowever, without having a committee suggestion to follow, so it will be \ndifficult for us. But certainly we need to do that.\n  I suggest that the tripartisan bill that is before us is probably the \none that is most likely to get support. Indeed, it is the only \nbipartisan plan in the Senate.\n  We truly talk about finding common ground traditionally between the \nviews. I think that is a good idea. This bill reforms Medicare and \nprovides prescription drug benefits which will ensure that seniors do \nhave coverage.\n  The proposal, if it had been debated, I think would have come out of \nthe committee as the one selected. The tripartisan bill spends about \n$330 billion over 10 years for drugs, which is more than some of the \nbills, but is considerably less than the one the Democrats have put \nforth. So this, perhaps, is a reasonable compromise between those \nproposals.\n  I think the Democrat bill is unofficially scored at $500 billion for \n5 years, and then it expires. So I think that is one of the \ndifficulties, the idea that it expires.\n  The tripartisan bill also spends $40 billion to make some long \noverdue changes in Part B and Part A so seniors will have health \ncoverage. So there seems to be quite more available there than in the \nalternatives. I hope we do something.\n  Just to comment, one of the things that, of course, we are dealing \nwith--we have talked about, and I think has merit--is the idea of \nreimportation. That is kind of what is on the floor at the moment. I \nthink there is some merit in that. I do not believe it is the final \nsolution. Indeed, as it gets into operation, we may find it more \ndifficult than it has been.\n  I think the Cochran amendment, that was passed yesterday, is very \nuseful in terms of safety as it relates to the bill. I do think we \nought to go a bit further; that is, I think there ought to be some \nlabeling so that consumers have the opportunity to choose whether or \nnot they want to take on the reimported drugs that have gone through \nCanada, that may or may not have come from the United States in the \nbeginning. So I do think perhaps we ought to consider the idea, which \ncan be very simple, to have it labeled that it is imported from Canada \nso people can, in fact, make those kinds of choices.\n  Mr. President, since our time has been used, I will yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 5011, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5011) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 5 minutes of \ndebate on this pending measure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that the managers are not in the \nChamber, but I will proceed with my statement.\n  Regretfully, I rise yet again to address the Senate on the subject of \nmilitary construction projects added to an appropriations bill that \nwere not requested by the Department of Defense and are strongly \nopposed by the Office of Management and Budget.\n  This bill contains over $1 billion in unrequested military \nconstruction projects and includes hundreds of millions of dollars for \nArmy and Air Force infrastructure projects relating to Interim Brigade \nCombat Teams, IBCTs, and C-17 Globemaster aircraft bed-down military \nconstruction projects that the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nneither approved nor authorized for this purpose.\n  There are 29 members of the Appropriations Committee. Only one \ncommittee member has not added projects to this appropriations bill. \nThose numbers, needless to say, go well beyond the realm of mere \ncoincidence. Of 116 projects added to this bill, 91 projects, \nrepresenting 80 percent of all projects, are in the States represented \nby the Senators on the Appropriation Committees, totaling over $728.1 \nmillion.\n  Every year, I come to the Senate floor to highlight programs and \nprojects added to spending bills for primarily parochial reasons. While \nI recognize that many of the projects added to this bill may be \nworthwhile, the process by which they were selected is not.\n  By adding over $1 billion above the President's request, the \nAppropriations Committee is further draining away funds desperately \nneeded for transformation. But such short-sightedness is pretty much \nthe norm for Congress. Common-sense reforms--closing military bases, \nconsolidating and privatizing depot maintenance, ending ``Buy \nAmerican'' restrictions, and ending pork-barrel spending--that I have \nlong supported would free up nearly $20 billion per year which could be \nused to begin our long-needed military transformation.\n  But all too often Congress fights these reforms because of home-State \npolitics. As a result, the Defense Department looks elsewhere to find \nthe resources. For example, according to a Baltimore Sun article, \n``Pentagon To Consider Large-Scale Troop Cuts,'' the Department is \nconsidering cutting nearly 100,000 troops ``to free up money'' for \ntransformation. I would oppose this and we will debate this another \nday, but I certainly understand the pressure that Secretary Rumsfeld \nand the Joint Chiefs are under because of Congress' continuing \nparochialism as evidenced once again by the military construction bill \nbefore us.\n  Included in the Senate Appropriations Committee's report are the \nwords: ``The Committee strongly supports the authorization-\nappropriation process.'' That is news to many of my colleagues. If that \nstatement is true why would over $550 million in military construction \nprojects be added without prior Senate Armed Services Committee \nauthorization. It could be that many of these projects would be \nacceptable after going through the normal, merit-based prioritization \nprocess. But the Appropriations Committee decided to do otherwise.\n  Two rather large additions--totaling $200 million--for large military \nconstruction projects for Interim Brigade Combat Teams, IBCTs, \nfacilities and the C-17 Air Mobility Modernization Program are examples \nof the committee's disregard for the authorization process. The \ncommittee report justifies these add-ons on the grounds that ``the war \non terror has placed new demands on all elements of the military'' and \n``military construction timetables developed prior to September 11 are \nno longer sufficient.'' War profiting is what it is all about. Because \nof this, the report continues, ``the committee believes that it is \nimperative to accelerate the Army and Air Force transformation \nprograms.'' There is no mention of Navy and Marine Corps transformation \nprograms. The committee report leads one to ask how the Navy and Marine \nCorps got it right and the Army and Air Force missed the boat.\n  The committee's justification for adding $200 million for the IBCTs \nfacilities and new hangars for C-17s, C-5s and C-130s under the Air \nForce Air Mobility Modernization program is at odds with the facts. The \nPresident's budget was sent to the House and the Senate in February--a \nfull 5 months after September 11. Since September 11, the President and \nhis Secretary of Defense have officially forwarded to Congress the \nFiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriations bill--which we have not \npassed--and recently a formal description of how the Defense Department \nwill spend the $10 billion war reserve fund set-aside in the Defense \nEmergency Response Fund that the President requested for the war on \nterrorism. Let me ask: did anyone on the Appropriations Committee \ninform the President that his budget proposal was not ``sufficient''? I \nknow the answer is no.\n  Let me share some critical facts that were left out of the committee \nreport related to the $200 million in additional funding added for \nthese key programs. It is common knowledge that nearly all the IBCTs \nwill initially be stationed in Alaska and Hawaii and will require a \nsignificant increase of infrastructure. General Shinseki has supported \ntesting the IBCT concept in Alaska and Hawaii and then expanding the \nconcept elsewhere. However, in putting together the Army budget, the \nChief of Staff of the Army, the Secretary of the Army, and the \nSecretary of Defense weighed all the other Army priorities and decided \nthat their were more critical funding issues than to accelerate an \nalready robust IBCT program and adding $100 million more for facilities \nconstruction.\n  Likewise, other facts left out of the Appropriations report related \nto the $100 million in accelerated funding for the Air Force Air \nMobility program should be known:\n  The Air Force did not request this funding;\n  The requirement for accelerating funding is not on the Air Force \nChief of Staff's ``Unfunded Requirements List'';\n  Nor does it appear in the Secretary of Defense's Wartime Fiscal Year \n2002 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations request;\n  Nor does the requirement to accelerate funding for C-17 hangars show \nup on the war reserve fund set-aside in the Defense Emergency Response \nFund (DERF) that the President recently submitted to Congress as an \nFiscal Year 2003 budget amendment for the Department of Defense for \nexpenses relating to the war against terrorism; and\n  Moreover, over 80 percent of the total $1.6 billion military \nconstruction projects under the Air Force C-17 Air Mobility \nModernization program will be built in just 4 states: surprise, \nsurprise California, West Virginia, Alaska, and Hawaii--how surprising.\n  Funding $200 million for IBCTs and C-17, C-5 and C-130 hangars--as \npart of a larger 4-5 billion dollar program--was simply not authorized \nby the Armed Services Committee in its recently passed bill. I attended \nmore than 10 hearings on Armed Services this year, and I cannot \nremember a single instance in which an argument was made in support of \naccelerating this funding.\n  Separately, I am at a loss as to the rationale for including in this \nbill certain site-specific earmarks and directive language. For \nexample, in time-\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\nhonored fashion, the Appropriations Committee continues to earmark \nprojects under the heading ``Unspecified Minor Construction.'' \nAccording to Title 10, Section 2805 of the United States Code, these \n``military construction projects are intended solely to correct a \ndeficiency that is life-threatening, health-threatening, or safety-\nthreatening.'' However, I believe that certain earmarks in this \nAppropriations bill are in violation of this statute, including \nprovisions that would provide:\n  Up to $1.5 million in funding for a storage facility for military \npolice emergency vehicles in Fort Wainwright, AK;\n  Up to $1.5 million in funding for a similar storage facility in Fort \nRichardson, AK;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a Kinetic Energy Missile Complex at the \nWhite Sands Missile Range in New Mexico;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a force protection facility at the Naval \nAir Station in Corpus Christi, TX;\n  $1 million in funding for a training facility at the Corpus Christi \nArmy Deport in Texas;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a UAV facility at the Fallon Naval Air \nStation in Nevada;\n  $1 million in funding to replace and bury electrical infrastructure \nat Lackland Air Force Base in Texas;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a barracks for the Army National Guard in \nChillicothe, OH;\n  $1.5 million in funding for Federal Scout Readiness Centers/Armories \nfor the Army National Guard in Alakanuk, Quinhagak, and Kwigillingok, \nAK;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a maintenance facility for the Army \nNational Guard at Fort Harrison in Montana;\n  Up to $2.5 million in funding for various facilities for the Army \nNational Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction/Civil Support Teams;\n  Up to $1 million in funding for a warehouse for the Air Force Reserve \nat the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas;\n  $1 million in funding for a Multiple Threat Emitter System, MUTES, \nFacility for the Army National Guard at the Smoky Hill Range in Kansas;\n  $1.5 million in funding for a Bachelor Officer/Enlisted Quarters for \nthe Army National Guard at Fort Meade in South Dakota; and\n  $1.5 million in funding for an ammunition supply plant for the Army \nNational Guard at Camp Grafton in North Dakota.\n  I could go on and on. Without a doubt, each of these provisions \nunabashedly expands the definition of unspecified minor construction. \nSadly, yet significantly, the American taxpayer is once again at the \nlosing end of such reckless congressional action.\n  I also find objectionable language in this bill requiring that only \nAmerican firms, or American firms in joint venture with host nation \nfirms, be eligible for architecture and engineering contracts for all \noverseas projects exceeding $500,000. Similarly restrictive language \nbans the awarding of any contract over $1 million to any foreign \ncontractor in U.S. territories and possessions in the Pacific, on \nKwajalein Atoll, and in countries bordering the Arabian Sea. American \nfirms are among the best in the world; advocating a level playing field \nfor them to compete overseas is appropriate. However, it is both \ninappropriate and harmful to the best interests of our Armed Forces to \nmandate that construction projects overseas not be subject to the kind \nof competitive process that best serves the taxpayer and the service \nmember by providing the best product at the lowest cost.\n  We are waging war against a new enemy and at the same time \nundertaking a long-term process to transform our military from its Cold \nWar structure to a force ready for the challenges of tomorrow. A lack \nof political will had previously hamstrung the transformation process, \nbut the President and his team have pledged to transform our military \nstructure and operations to meet future threats.\n  The reorganization of our armed services was, of course, an extremely \nimportant subject before September 11, and it is all the more so now. \nThe threats to the security of the United States, to the very lives and \nproperty of Americans, have changed in the last decade.\n  In the months ahead, no task before the administration and the \nCongress will be more important to require greater care and \ndeliberation than making the changes necessary to strengthen our \nnational defense in this new, uncertain era. Needless to say, this \ntransformation process will require enlightened, thoughtful leadership, \nand not the pork-barreling of military funds if we are to best serve \nAmerica in this time of rapid change in the global security \nenvironment.\n  I thank the President for this opportunity to address the Senate. I \nask unanimous consent that the list of unrequested military \nconstruction projects that were added by the Appropriations Committee \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In an effort to contain the wasteful spending inherent in \n     member requested construction projects, I sponsored, and the \n     Senate adopted, merit based criteria for evaluating member \n     adds as a part of the fiscal year 1995 Defense Authorization \n     Act. The criteria are: (1) The project is in the service's \n     future years defense plan; (2) the project is mission \n     essential; (3) the project can be put under contract in the \n     current fiscal year; (4) the project does not conflict with \n     base re-alignment proposals; and (5) the service can offset \n     the proposed expenditure within that year's budget request.\n\n

Mr. President, I regret that at a time when our defense \ndollars need to be spent efficiently, we now continue the pork-\nbarreling of the military construction appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the 2003 Military Construction \nAppropriations bill provides over $10 billion in funding for planning, \ndesign, construction, and improvements for military bases around the \nworld. A long neglected priority, the bill would provide $4.2 billion \nfor family housing, much of which is substandard right now. Many armed \nforces personnel have suffered a declining quality of life in recent \nyears despite rising Pentagon budgets. The pressing needs of dedicated \nmen and women in uniform and their families must be addressed, \nespecially as they continue to be mobilized for duty in response to the \nattacks of September 11.\n  I want to highlight two provisions in this bill that are of \nparticular importance to my home State of Minnesota. For a very long \ntime, I have said that there would be an increased reliance by the \nDefense Department on the National Guard as budget pressures and force \nstructure realignments continued. Since the attacks on America on \nSeptember 11, the men and women of the National Guard have flown air \nmissions to secure our skies, and they have protected airports and \nother vulnerable public facilities. I am pleased that we were able to \ninclude in this bill $15 million for the Duluth Air National Guard Base \nfor an airport maintenance facility at the 148th Fighter Wing, which \nwill provide maintenance and repair of 15 F-16 fighter aircraft. \nFurther, the bill contains $1.45 million for the Harden Naval Reserve \nCenter in Duluth. I am pleased that these projects\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\nare receiving the funds they deserve, and I appreciate the opportunity \nto work in this area with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, \nwho, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, is especially \nattentive to such needs. The bill goes far in addressing many vital \nnational needs, and I am voting for it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise as the ranking Republican on \nthe committee that has the bill before us for military construction, \nand I am pleased to have worked with Senator Feinstein, chairman of the \nsubcommittee, to bring out a bill that does address the priorities of \nthe Defense Department.\n  I noticed that the Senator from Arizona targeted the Appropriations \nCommittee, saying that a large percentage of the Appropriations \nCommittee were taken care of, as if this were some pork-barrel \nspending.\n  The fact is, the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized every \nproject in this bill. We don't have projects in the appropriations bill \nthat have not been authorized by a completely different committee that \nfocuses totally on defense and has determined that these projects \nshould be authorized.\n  I am very pleased to support this bill. It provides new mission \nfacilities for the Department of Defense consistent with the \nDepartment's request. The priorities are articulated by the military \ndepartments. It also enhances quality of life for servicemembers and \ntheir families--a commitment we made to these people who are \nrepresenting our country and fighting for our freedom on the plains of \nAfghanistan and in Kuwait today, based there for us. We are going to \ntake care of them. Finally, it makes a significant downpayment on \nrenewing the Department of Defense aging infrastructure.\n  Every project in the military construction appropriations bill is \nauthorized in the Defense authorization bill, a completely separate \nbill. Two committees have looked at these priorities. Every project in \nthe bill is on the Pentagon's future year defense plan, and every \nproject the committee added was the base commander's highest priority.\n  The committee added funds to the military construction bill because \nwe were concerned with the sharp drop in funding, particularly for the \nGuard and Reserve forces. That is where much of the funding we have \nadded is focused. Our Guard and Reserve forces are fighting side by \nside with our active-duty forces in Afghanistan and providing the bulk \nof our homeland security forces here at home.\n  Adequate training and readiness facilities are essential for the \nGuard and Reserve, particularly during this time of increased demand on \ntheir skills and services. The bill provides greatly needed facilities \nfor the Guard and Reserve and will help them prepare for and execute \ntheir missions.\n  The bill also provides funding for two key transformation initiatives \nin support of President Bush's strategic vision for transforming the \nDepartment of Defense: $100 million for Army transformation, and $100 \nmillion for Air Force mobility transformation.\n  Earlier this year, both the Army and the Air Force identified \nunfunded transformation military construction requirements to the \nCongress. Many of these requirements were refined after development and \npresentation of the 2003 President's budget, so we added them because \nthey are critical to the Army and the Air Force to make them more \nmobile and capable to face the 21st century battle conditions.\n  The committee funded another initiative, the BRAC environmental \ncleanup initiative, which provides $100 million to accelerate the \ncleanup of dangerous environmental contaminants at closed and realigned \nbases throughout the Nation. Until the cleanup of these bases is \ncompleted, the properties cannot be returned to productive use in these \ncommunities.\n  In my own State of Texas, we have terrible environmental bills, both \nat the former Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio and the former Navy \nAir Station in Dallas. There are reports like this across the country, \nand we are trying to address those concerns wherever they may be, so \nthat these closed bases can be returned to productive use, as we have \npromised these communities they would be.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is a bill that stresses the \npriorities of the Department of Defense and the President. It also has \nadded areas that were not able to be added earlier because the \nDepartment of Defense wasn't ready, and we certainly added more than \nthe President's budget allowed for Guard and Reserve units.\n  I think the priorities are right, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill so we can get on with the business of revamping our aging \nmilitary infrastructure and increasing the quality of life for those \nwho are fighting for us as we speak on this floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the subcommittee, I \nthank the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Texas, for her \nhelp on this bill. She has been a wonderful colleague with whom to \nwork, and I am very grateful for that.\n  Mr. President, essentially, this bill, as Senator Hutchison said, \nprovides $10.6 billion in new budget authority. That is a tenth of 1 \npercent over last year's appropriation. It is 10 percent over the \nPresident's appropriation. The reason for this is that the President \ncut the Guard and the Reserve 52 percent from last year's budget \nrequest. We do not believe they can sustain their infrastructure \nrequirements with that kind of a funding shortfall.\n  As Senator Hutchison mentioned, every project is in the 5-year \ndefense plan. Every project has been authorized. Every project is the \nbase commander's priority. With respect to the transformation \ninitiative, we didn't decide the locations, the services decided the \nlocations. Both the Army and the Air Force have identified the \nlocations for their transformation initiatives. The Army involved 13 \nactive and Guard installations in six States, plus Germany. The Air \nForce's transformation involves 53 active, Guard, and Reserve bases in \n32 States, plus Germany, Japan, and Puerto Rico.\n  The Appropriations Committee is not--and I stress that--attempting to \ndivert funding from any of these planned locations or to influence \nwhere the money will go. These decisions have been and will be made by \nthe services. The purpose of the transformation initiative is to \naccelerate the process. Infrastructure is a long lead time item, and we \nneed to start investing more in this transformation infrastructure now \nto meet the service requirements.\n\n  Essentially, 53 percent of this bill is for military construction for \nthe active and Reserve components. It is $610 million for the Guard and \nReserve, $1.1 billion for barracks, $26 million for child development, \n$137 million for medical facility, and $159 million for chemical \ndemilitarization. The remaining 40 percent--$4.23 billion--is for \nfamily housing, including new housing, housing improvements, and \noperation and maintenance of units.\n  At the BRAC cleanup, as Senator Hutchison stated, I can tell you that \nwe have one closing base--McClellan Air Force Base--in northern \nCalifornia, where plutonium has badly contaminated the ground. Senator \nHutchison, in her State, has toxic materials that are seeping into \nresidential areas from Kelly Air Force Base. There is no question in \neither of our minds that the BRAC rounds we have completed were not \nsufficiently funded with environmental remediation dollars. The proof \nis in the pudding, and that pudding is that many bases still cannot be \ntransitioned into productive civilian use because of the absence of the \nability to clean them up.\n  Mr. President, the MilCon bill is important to the men and women in \nuniform who serve our Nation at home and overseas. We believe it is a \ngood bill, it is a bipartisan bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues \nto approve it.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas, 96, nays 3, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 181 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--3\n\n     Feingold\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 5011) was passed, as follows:\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to comment on the overall \npolicies we are working on today. While this bill we are debating, the \nunderlying bill, is a generic drug bill that came out of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, we all know that ultimately \nwe are going to be talking about Medicare and prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  We all recognize the lack of prescription drug coverage demonstrates \nclearly Medicare has not kept up with the rapid advances in medical \ncare, placing ultimately the health care security of too many seniors \nat risk.\n  When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health care for our \nNation's elderly and disabled, prescription drugs were not included as \npart of the program's benefits. At that time, that made sense because \npharmaceuticals played an extremely minor role in the world of \nmedicine. In the last 35 years, medical practice has changed \ndramatically and prescription drugs have become a vital part of health \ncare. In the last decade or two, we have seen a pharmaceutical \nrevolution. Hundreds of amazing new drugs have been developed to treat \nand manage all different kinds of diseases and medical conditions. \nThose of our population who suffer from these diseases have benefited \ngreatly.\n  More and more these days prescription drug are keeping Americans of \nall ages out of hospitals, enhancing the overall quality of life and, \nyes, keeping people alive. Hundreds of drugs that were unknown decades \nago play a critical role keeping our seniors healthy, active, and \nalive. Yet many of our most vulnerable citizens are seniors who have \ntrouble affording prescription drugs because their Government-\nprovided Medicare coverage has failed to keep pace with medical \nprogress.\n\n  In addition to being exposed financially to the cost of needed drugs, \nseniors without prescription drug insurance do not benefit from the \nlower prices that most third-party buyers--such as insurers, hospitals, \nand pharmacy benefit managers--are able to negotiate with \npharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result, seniors without drug \ncoverage must pay the highest retail price for needed medication.\n  That is a situation we must change. It is time to modernize our \nMedicare system and to add a prescription drug benefit to protect the \nhealth care security of our seniors. The Medicare Program needs to be \nupdated to reflect the past 35 years of medical progress. The millions \nof Americans who rely on Medicare for their health care deserve no \nless.\n  Fortunately, over the past few years the debate in Washington has \nshifted from whether or not to provide a prescription drug benefit to \nhow to best craft a program to provide seniors with the best \nprescription drug coverage possible. Now is the time to act to include \nprescription drugs as part of an overall health security package for \nour seniors.\n  An issue this important deserves debate and serious consideration. \nHow can we consider a serious import issue such as this without the \nbenefit and expertise of the Finance Committee? I have heard the \nstructure and process of this debate described aptly as one of mutually \nassured destruction, or ``mad.'' This issue is too important to too \nmany seniors for this debate to be treated in this manner. Because of \nthe terms of this debate, any drug proposal that passes ultimately must \nhave strong bipartisan support, because 60 votes will be needed to pass \nit. Is that truly ``mad''? I hope not. But I sense that, without the \nbenefit of the Finance Committee working on this, we may be in a very \ndifficult situation.\n  Some watching may ask how did we get into the situation where a \nprescription drug bill will require 60 votes to pass rather than a \nsimple majority. The answer is simple. The first reason is because the \nmajority leader has decided to bring a bill straight to the floor and \nbypass the committee process entirely. This is a troubling pattern. The \nfarm bill, the energy bill, the trade bill all bypassed the committee \nstructure--a mad process.\n  This action is troubling to me because I understand there was one \nproposal with the votes to pass in the Finance Committee, the so-called \ntripartisan bill. But the committee was not allowed to act on this \nimportant issue. That is a shame.\n  How in good conscience can we consider the largest addition to \nMedicare since its inception without the thoughtful input of the \ncommittee with jurisdiction over the Medicare Program? That does not \nmake any sense. That is mad.\n  The second reason 60 votes are necessary is because we have no \nbudget. For the first time since 1974 we have no budget in the Senate. \nThis is one of the consequences of not having passed, or even, for that \nmatter, considered a budget on the floor. Because there is no budget, \nwe are operating under the budget guidelines passed last year that \nwould spend about $300 billion over 10 years to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare. Therefore, any prescription drug plan brought to \nthe floor must be within the $300 billion or it is subject to a budget \npoint of order.\n  This is another problem with the scheme under which we are operating. \nWe will be considering shortly the largest expansion of an entitlement \nprogram in the history of our Nation. We bypassed a committee, we have \nnot had a hearing on it, we have not had a markup, the Congressional \nBudget Office has not scored it, and we will be bringing the bill \nstraight to the floor. Mutually assured destruction. This is mad. It is \na recipe for disaster and inaction.\n\n  What is most troubling to me is the real losers. If the Senate is \nunable to pass a prescription drug benefit, it will be our seniors. The \nseniors are the ones who will be forced to endure another year without \nthe safety net that a Medicare prescription drug benefit could and \nshould provide.\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n  Enough about my concerns about the process. As we look forward to \nthis debate, there are a number of fundamental principles that need to \nbe outlined as we consider various prescription drug options. These are \nfundamental elements to any serious, responsible, bipartisan \nprescription drug benefit.\n  First and foremost, a prescription drug benefit must be permanent, it \nmust be affordable, and it must be immediate. Seniors need help now. \nWith the high cost of prescription drugs, they cannot continue without \nthat assistance. They are hurting today. Seniors often make painful \nchoices between buying food and buying prescription drugs. Seniors need \naction and results on this issue--not an election year issue in \nNovember. Seniors want, need, and, quite frankly, deserve the stability \nof a permanent drug benefit.\n  One of my most serious concerns with the majority leader's bill is \nthe fact it will sunset after only a few years. A prescription drug \nbenefit that sunsets after 2010, just a few years after it finally \nbegins, is simply not good enough. Medicare is an entitlement program \nand seniors deserve permanent benefits they can count on today, \ntomorrow, 10, 12, 15 years from now. A hollow benefit, with temporary \nrelief that sunsets after 5 or 6 years, does not provide adequate \nhealth care security for seniors.\n\n  Think about the lunacy of the situation we are in. We seem to be \nunintentionally on a track of telling seniors they had better die in \n2010. We passed elimination of the death tax, but we did not make it \npermanent, so we tell seniors, you had better die in 2010 or the tax \nrates are going to jump back up and the death tax is going to spring \nfrom the grave. Now we are saying, you can be protected on prescription \ndrugs through 2010, but you had better move on because in 2011 this \nprogram sunsets.\n  Somebody is not thinking. Somebody is not realizing what they are \ndoing. Let's get serious. We need to make the death tax repeal \npermanent, and we need to make prescription drug benefits for seniors \npermanent.\n  Seniors should have the right, also, to choose the prescription drug \nplan that best meets their needs. They should not be told what they \nneed by a politician or a Washington bureaucrat. I fear the majority \nleader's bill dictates a one-size-fits-all, Government-run benefit for \nall seniors and puts the Government in the position of determining what \ndrugs would be covered under the plan. We must protect our seniors from \na Government-run drug program that delays, restricts, or denies access \nto the newest and most effective drugs available on the market.\n  Seniors should have the right to choose a benefit that best meets \ntheir needs and does not restrict access to the newest and most \neffective drugs. I fear that the majority leader's bill leaves no room \nfor innovation and flexibility in terms of plan design, no choice for \nseniors, and could limit access to breakthrough drugs. A prescription \ndrug benefit must address the high cost of prescription drugs and \nattempt to restrain the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs which \ncannot be sustained long term.\n  All existing drug benefits make manufacturers compete to reduce \nprices and pass along the savings from price competition as larger \ndiscounts and lower premiums for beneficiaries. That is the only proven \nway to keep a drug benefit affordable. The majority leader's bill locks \nin copayments and premiums for beneficiaries and prevents competition \nthat could lower drug prices.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, bills that rely on \npublic-private-sector partnerships and an element of competition, such \nas the tripartisan bill, will help manage the cost of drugs. Sadly, the \nCBO found that bills similar to the bill of the majority leader, \nbecause of the lack of competition and inflexibility of the benefit, \nwould in fact increase drug costs. Given the current climate, I simply \ncannot support a plan that increases drug costs or one that sunsets at \nthe end of 2010.\n  Finally, a prescription drug benefit should be fiscally responsible \nand sustainable long term. The best guess we have, without the CBO's \nscoring, is that the proposal by the majority leader and some of his \ncolleagues would cost at least $600 billion over the next 8 years. In a \ntime of deficit spending and a tight economy, such a benefit would \nultimately require cuts in other fields, such as education, Social \nSecurity, or national defense, and place a heavy burden on the current \ngeneration receiving benefits, the generation paying for those \nbenefits, and the next generation.\n  Seniors have a right to demand a drug benefit now, but I believe most \nof them will tell you they do not want to mortgage their \ngrandchildren's future in the process. Seniors must be protected from \ncatastrophic drug costs. No senior should face financial ruin because \nof an illness that triggers catastrophic drug costs. Our Nation's \nhealth care system has changed significantly since Medicare was first \ncreated. To make it effective, we must change Medicare as well.\n\n  We must work to bring affordable prescription drug coverage to every \nMedicare recipient. The Senate has the opportunity to pass a \nbipartisan--tripartisan permanent Medicare prescription drug plan this \nyear. The House has already passed a bill. The President has indicated \nrepeatedly that he wants a prescription drug benefit for America's \nseniors. With this kind of momentum, the time should be now. I hope we \nwill move forward with an honest and open debate that will produce a \nresponsible, bipartisan bill consistent with the principles I have \noutlined that fulfill Medicare's promise of health care security for \nall seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S6977-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6977-S7016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am going to send a modification to the \ndesk very shortly, but I want to comment briefly on the statements of \nmy friend from Missouri that were just made. He talked about lunacy of \nwhat is going on here. I will use his exact term--lunacy. Talk about \nthe death tax, that is, the estate tax, at the same time you are \ntalking about Medicare prescription drugs, the vast majority of people, \nthe vast, vast majority--over 98 percent--of the people on Medicare \nhave no relevance to the estate tax. Why he would bring up the estate \ntax at the same time we are talking about Medicare prescription drugs \nis beyond my ability to comprehend.\n  I would also say he talks about why we bring up some of these bills \nwithout going through the committee. We do not do that very often, but \nwe have done it. When we were in the minority, it was done all the \ntime. We have seen a number of these measures being brought up because \nof what has gone on after September 11.\n  Take terrorism insurance. We passed that. It was really good \nlegislation. The President told us how much it was needed. It took us a \nlong time to get the bill up because they objected to it. Now they will \nnot let us go to conference on this bill. It is interesting to note, \nthe majority leader said we should have a 3-to-2 ratio and we had a 3-\nto-2 ratio. They said no, we want 4-to-3 or we will not go to \nconference. We gave them 4-to-3, and they still won't go to conference. \nThis is terrorism insurance. That is stopping construction\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nprojects in Nevada, in New York, I am sure in Louisiana, all over the \ncountry.\n  There are other examples, of course--the trade bill. The trade bill \nis something the President said he wanted. He wanted us to get it to \nthe floor as quickly as we could. We did, and it passed. Only the last \ncouple of days were we able to get conferees appointed.\n  The farm bill, that is pretty important legislation--the President \nsigned that into law. The energy bill, we finally got conferees there. \nThe President said that was an important bill.\n  I only mentioned a few of them--the trade bill, the farm bill, the \nenergy bill, the terrorism bill. They couldn't be too bad. They passed \nthe Senate by large margins in every case.\n  I hope people will understand that we are doing the best we can to \nwork our way through a difficult situation in this country. We are \nmaking progress. We passed legislation in spite of the obstinacy we \nhave had--not the least of which is the legislation on which the Senate \nis now working. We spent all day yesterday on importation. I think we \nshould have been able to do more. I agree about the fact that we \nfinally passed our first appropriations bill.\n  As I see down the hall, we are completing the very difficult \nconference on the supplemental. I should be there. I am a member of \nthat committee. I hope to go there in a matter of a few minutes. \nSenators Byrd and Stevens, chairman and ranking member of that \ncommittee, indicated to me that they expect to complete that conference \nin the next hour and a half. That will be by 12:30.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4305, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have a modification at the desk. I call \nit up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4305), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CLARIFICATION OF STATE AUTHORITY RELATING TO \n                   MEDICAID DRUG REBATE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Section 1927 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(1) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed as prohibiting a State from--\n       ``(1) directly entering into rebate agreements (on the \n     State's own initiative or under a section 1115 waiver \n     approved by the Secretary before, on, or after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection), that are similar to a rebate \n     agreement described in subsection (b) with a manufacturer for \n     purposes of ensuring the affordability of outpatient \n     prescription drugs in order to provide access to such drugs \n     by residents of a State who are not otherwise eligible for \n     medical assistance under this title; or\n       ``(2) making prior authorization: (that satisfies the \n     requirements of subsection (d) and that does not violate any \n     requirements of this title that are designed to ensure access \n     to medically necessary prescribed drugs for individuals \n     enrolled in the State program under this title) a condition \n     of not participating in such a similar rebate agreement.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I would like to speak to my amendment \nwhich is now before us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors to the amendment: Senators Dorgan, Schumer, Feingold, \nTorricelli, Carnahan, Levin, Johnson, Snowe, Jeffords and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment which is a \nbipartisan amendment, and hopefully one that we will be able to pass, \nworking together and moving forward on the issue of lowering prices of \nprescription drugs and also providing Medicare coverage for our seniors \nand the disabled.\n  This amendment addresses an issue that our States are facing, the \nquestion of allowing States to have the right to have flexibility to \nlower prices.\n  This is a simple amendment. It would give States the flexibility to \nset up programs to pass along negotiated Medicaid rebates and discounts \nto their citizens who do not have prescription drug coverage and are \nnot covered by Medicaid. So the States will have the ability to \nnegotiate and pass on those similar discounts to their citizens who are \nwithout coverage and who are not on Medicaid.\n  This is critical. States should have the ability to provide similar \ndiscounts to all of their uninsured citizens. Since Medicaid only \ncovers low-income people, and lower and middle-income citizens, they do \nnot have the ability to get the same negotiated discount. Some States \nare setting up programs to do that.\n  One of the biggest challenges, as you know, and as we all know--we \nwill be debating it this week and next--is the challenge facing not \nonly our citizens, our families, and our seniors but also the business \ncommunity, which I have talked about frequently. Also, State \ngovernments are addressing this issue of the rising cost of \nprescription drugs and the implications to Medicaid.\n  In fact, the National Governors Association is meeting right now. \nEarlier in the week, I shared a newspaper article where all of the \nGovernors of the United States were speaking about their biggest \nchallenge. Their biggest challenge, according to the article, is the \nrising price of prescription drugs and the rising cost of Medicaid to \nthe State budgets. This is a critical issue for them.\n  We know that from 2000 to 2001 prescription drug prices rose about 17 \npercent. This is not unusual. It has been that way every year. This is \ncausing health care expenditures and health insurance premiums to go up \nfor business, for States, for individuals, and most certainly for those \nwho do not have any insurance and don't have the clout to negotiate a \ndiscount. Those citizens are paying retail, which, in fact, is the \nhighest price in the world right now.\n  In an attempt to respond to the skyrocketing prices, 30 of our States \nhave enacted laws with some type of prescription drug coverage for \nthose without insurance. They are looking for ways to be innovative--to \nuse what we often have heard on the floor from our colleagues--the \ninnovations of the States, the laboratories of democracy, and the ideas \nthat come from our States. About 30 of them are looking for ways to \nenact something that relates to prescription drug coverage--looking for \nways to lower prices and expand coverage. That is according to the \nNational Governors Association.\n  However, unfortunately, the drug companies' trade association--\nPhRMA--has mounted legal challenges against several of those States, \nincluding my own State of Michigan. They have been opposing State \nefforts to lower prescription drug prices and increase coverage for \nthose without insurance.\n  Specifically, they filed lawsuits against Maine and Vermont for their \nprograms because the drug lobby does not want them to extend the \nMedicaid discounts to those without insurance who are hard-working \ncitizens. In fact, we know that a majority of the people without \ninsurance in this country work in small businesses. They are working. \nTheir small business is trying to get health care coverage for \nthemselves and their workers. Those individuals have no access now to \nany kind of group purchasing power or to any kind of discount. States \nare trying to use their group purchasing power for Medicaid and extend \nthat same discount--usually 15 to 20 percent--to their employees. Many \nwork in small businesses and don't have any insurance.\n\n  While Maine's two programs have been upheld in court, Vermont's \nprogram has not. It was actually struck down by the courts. Both States \nare embroiled in a very lengthy appeals process.\n  Specifically, the Maine Rx program is now pending before the Supreme \nCourt. The current administration is supporting Maine's right to \nimplement their program.\n  I commend President Bush and the administration for siding with the \nState of Maine and their right to make decisions about their citizens \nand how to operate their businesses for their State.\n  In fact, the Solicitor General, Ted Olsen, filed a brief on behalf of \nthe Federal Government urging the Supreme Court to allow Maine's Rx \nprogram to go forward without further delay.\n  I argue that this amendment, in fact, is supported by both parties, \npeople on both sides, and that administration certainly has indicated--\nI have not heard directly regarding the amendment, but they certainly \nhave indicated support for the program on which this amendment is \nbased. I appreciate their leadership on this issue.\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n  These legal challenges are very costly to taxpayers. They just deter \nother States from establishing other similar demonstration projects, \nsuch as the underlying generics bill. Unfortunately, the drug companies \nare trying to stop these kinds of innovations.\n  This amendment would, in fact, try to stop the drug companies from \nusing the legal system to keep their prices high. We all know that they \nwill dispatch their high-priced attorneys whenever they can to, \nunfortunately, keep their profits as high as possible.\n  Since the price of prescription drugs is soaring, States have the \nunfettered ability to pass on Medicaid rebates to their residents. They \nshould have that ability to pass those rebates on to their residents.\n  I hope we will agree to this amendment because even if Congress \npasses a Medicare prescription drug program this year, it will be \nseveral years before it is fully phased in.\n  I hope and pray that we will come together and pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. It is long overdue. But we know it will take \nseveral years to phase it in.\n  In the meantime, our States are struggling to help their citizens. I \nbelieve they need our support.\n  The Rx flexibility-for-States amendment would seek to remove the \nlegal hurdles that are preventing States from providing lower priced \nprescription drugs to their citizens.\n  Specifically, States would be able to extend their Medicaid rebates \nand discounts for prescription drugs to non-Medicaid-eligible persons.\n  State governments are close to the people. I know our Presiding \nOfficer was in the State government, as was I. We understand that \nStates and local governments are on the front line hearing from people, \nand wanting to respond. We have States that are responding, and are \nbeing stopped through the legal system right now by the drug company \nlobby. The solution to higher prices, higher prescription drug prices, \nis not just in Washington. It is not just in the Senate, or in the \nHouse of Representatives. But it is in capitals all across the country \nwhere our Governors and our State legislators are working to respond to \nwhat is critically one of the most fundamental issues that families and \nseniors and businesses face to today, which is the explosion in health \ncare costs, predominantly coming from the rising cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Today we have a chance to send a very important message to our \ncolleagues and to States across the country.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with us, on a bipartisan basis, as we \nhave in this amendment, to adopt this amendment and to tell the States \nthat we are standing with them as they fight to lower prices for their \ncitizens and make lifesaving medicines available.\n  If we fail to pass this amendment, many States could be faced with \nlegal challenges from PhRMA as they try to come up with programs to \nlower prescription drug prices. Right now, we have the ability to stop \nthe dollars going into the lawsuits and redirect those to lowering \nprices and making prescription drugs available.\n  I invite and urge my colleagues to join with us. This is an \nopportunity for us to stand together in support of our State \ngovernments. Let the Governors know, this week, as they are meeting, \nthat we understand what they are going through and we want to back them \nin their efforts to make sure that lifesaving medicines are available \nto their citizens.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nMichigan for this absolutely excellent amendment. I am hopeful we can \nget strong support for this amendment because it is so compelling in \nits logic and reason, and the result will be so important to our fellow \ncitizens across the country.\n  Just to catch up to where we are, Madam President, the underlying \nbill, the Schumer-McCain legislation, tries to halt the gimmicking that \nthe drug companies use to get around the Hatch-Waxman bill that was \npassed a number of years ago. They have gimmicked the rules, and they \ndo it in ways that completely circumvent the spirit and the \nunderstanding of the law, in order to keep prices artificially high. \nAnd every family and every user of prescription drugs knows the \nchallenges families are facing with high drug prices.\n  Under the McCain-Schumer legislation, we have tried to deal with that \nissue. I think we have dealt with it effectively. That is the matter \nthat is before the Senate.\n  We had a good debate yesterday on different measures that continue to \nput downward pressure on the escalation of drug prices. I think we had \na very good debate on that, both in support of the underlying \nlegislation and in support of the Dorgan amendment, yesterday. Now we \nhave the Stabenow amendment before us, which will, in a very important \nway, continue this effort to exert downward pressure on the prices of \ndrugs in this country.\n  I am amazed at the opposition to this amendment. For a good part of \nthe afternoon yesterday, we listened to talk about the free market \nsystem that urged us to get away from price controls and use the free \nmarket system. But when the States use the free market system, in order \nto bargain for the lowering of the prices, what happens? What is the \nreaction of the drug companies? The drug companies go ahead and sue the \nStates to try to restrain them from using the free market system.\n\n  This isn't Government intervention, it is the States themselves, \nStates that have Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. The \nStates themselves are trying to use the States' power in order to get \nthe best price for the neediest citizens in their States: the poorest \nindividuals, the ones without insurance. And here comes PhRMA with \ntheir legal actions to make sure the States are not going to be able to \ndo that.\n  When does that greed stop? When does that greed stop? When do they \nstop wringing the final few cents out of the poorest individuals in \nthis country? That is what this is all about.\n  The States are trying to negotiate lower prices for the poorest \nindividuals in these States, and PhRMA says no. They gimmick and \ncircumvent the clear spirit and language of the Hatch-Waxman law in \norder to perpetrate billions and billions of dollars of additional \nprofits.\n  Then we hear a great deal of debate in this Chamber and much \nadmonition from many of those who are opposed to the underlying \nlegislation saying: Let's let the free market work.\n  We had hours and hours of discussion about price controls in Canada. \nWe are not for price controls, as in Canada. We want the free market to \nwork. But what is happening when the free market works in the State of \nMaine, the State of Florida, the State of Michigan, and other States? \nIn comes PhRMA, and they say: No, we are not going to let it work. We \nwant to stop them from doing it.\n  This is the same kind of action that is underlying the basic measure.\n  So I want to review, very briefly, the situation. I understand the \nproblem we are looking at.\n  Under the terrible burden of skyrocketing drug prices, the State \ngovernments are trying to use their authority and bargaining power to \nhelp residents--and our constituents--obtain lower prices.\n  Already, 30 States have passed laws to extend drug coverage or lower \nprices. But PhRMA has done it again, suing the States to stop our \n``laboratories of democracy'' from fighting the drug industry on behalf \nof American consumers.\n  The drug industry has sued the State of Maine. They have sued \nVermont, Michigan, Illinois, and Florida. The drug industry is waging \nwar against our Governors and our State legislatures in the courts.\n  The Stabenow amendment puts the question to the Senate: Will you \nstand with the States or will you stand with the drug industry for \nhigher drug prices?\n  Many of my colleagues are former Governors themselves. I hope they \ntake particular note that just yesterday the Nation's Governors issued \na statement of solidarity with the administration in its legal fight \nwith PhRMA over the Michigan Medicaid waiver that reduces the State's \ndrug costs.\n  Let me read from the NGA statement of July 15, which quotes Michigan \nGovernor Engler:\n\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\n\n       The nation's governors are extremely disappointed with the \n     course of action chosen by PhRMA. It is unfortunate that \n     their organization feels compelled to use the court system to \n     manipulate public policy.\n\n  That is a Republican Governor.\n  The Governors, the administration, and consumers all support State \nefforts to reduce drug prices. Now, with the Stabenow amendment, it is \nthe Senate's turn.\n\n  The amendment is based on a simple but powerful idea: Extend the \nscope of an existing Federal law to help the States supplement the \nrebates we require under Medicaid.\n  Medicaid already collects ``best price'' rebates from the drug \nindustry, thanks to a 1990 law we passed under the leadership of \nSenator David Pryor from Arkansas, a champion of lower drug prices.\n  I was always impressed by the work and the commitment of Dave Pryor \nand his strong desire for protecting the consumer. And this tradition \nfollows with Mark Pryor in Arkansas today: they are strong protectors \nof consumers and lower drug prices.\n  The Stabenow amendment simply permits States to negotiate similar \nState rebates to help lower-income residents afford their drugs. All \nthis amendment does is let the States use the same negotiating tools \nused today by the private sector to lower their drug bills. I do not \nsee why those who otherwise support the free market would oppose this \namendment.\n  We find out that large companies use their negotiating ability. HMOs \nuse their ability. Why not permit the States to use their ability? But \nPhRMA says: No, we are not going to let them do that, particularly when \nthey are using it for the lowest income citizens.\n  The amendment empowers the States to use the same tools and \nnegotiations used by the private sector to lower its drug costs. If a \ndrug company refuses to negotiate with a State, its drugs would still \nbe available but would be subject to ``prior authorization.'' This is \nprecisely what the State of Michigan is doing. This is precisely why \nPhRMA is suing the administration. And this is precisely why the \nStabenow amendment is needed.\n  Here is what the drug industry did when the State of Maine and the \nState of Vermont enacted State laws to lower drug prices.\n  Naturally, the industry sued the States. No surprise so far, given \ntheir abuses of the Hatch-Waxman Act. But then the drug industry \ninstructed its front group, the so-called Citizens for Better Medicare, \nto run TV, radio, and print ads in Maine and Vermont attacking the \nlaws. That is what the drug industry does to keep the prices sky high.\n  They sue our State governments and waste taxpayer dollars defending \nagainst their frivolous lawsuits. And they run attack ads.\n  Lest anyone question whether the so-called ``Citizens for Better \nMedicare'' is anything but a front group for the drug industry, let me \nquote the June 18 Wall Street Journal--\n\n       [T]im Ryan, PhRMA's past marketing director, founded the \n     grass-roots-sounding ``Citizens for Better Medicare'' at the \n     behest and expense of major drug companies.\n\n  There it is. Enough is enough. The American public is sick and tired \nof the drug industry's abuses. Let's support the Stabenow amendment, \nand help our States lower drug prices for all Americans.\n  I see others who want to speak on this issue. I want to mention to \nour colleagues an excellent report being released today. It is a review \nof the impact of the three principal proposals that have been advanced \non coverage. What this study does is take your State, the key features \nof each of the programs that have been advanced, the Republican House \nprogram, the Graham-Miller program, which I am proud to cosponsor, as \nwell as the tripartite program. Then it takes the numbers of citizens \nwho would be impacted, the number of elderly, senior citizens, and \ndisabled on Medicare, and it runs through how each of these programs \nwould impact the seniors in your State.\n  It reviews for each of the programs who would be affected, what the \nimpact would be on each of the seniors in the State, who would benefit \nthe most, and who would benefit the least.\n  We will be releasing this report this afternoon at 2 o'clock. We can \nsay without question that in the review of all 50 States, their \npowerful, compelling, and overwhelming conclusion is that if you want \nto make drugs available, accessible, affordable, and dependable, there \nis one plan that stands out head and shoulders above all the others, \nand that is the one introduced by our friend from Florida, Senator \nGraham.\n  There are others who wish to speak on this. I will come back and \naddress it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, the following Members be recognized to speak: Senator Hatch \nand Senator Frist, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in strong support and as a proud \ncosponsor of the Stabenow bill. It is worthy legislation. What I will \ndo for a few minutes is talk about the underlying bill and the Stabenow \nbill and what they have in common.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts outlined it. These are free market \napproaches to lowering drug prices. The one, the Schumer-McCain bill, \nallows more competition. What could be more all-American than more \ncompetition.\n  The second, the Stabenow bill, allows people within the market to \ngather together in the form of their government and negotiate a lower \nprice. We do this every day in America. That is what a corporation is \nin certain ways. That is what a union is in certain ways. Here we have \nthe State doing the same thing.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, there were some yesterday who \ntalked about the Canadian bill and price controls. These are not price \ncontrols, but we just saw yesterday or 2 days ago Pfizer and Pharmacia \nmerge. What were they trying to do? Well, in a free market way, they \nwere trying to aggregate to increase their bargaining power. Doesn't it \nmake sense to say that the citizens of Maine or Vermont or \nMassachusetts or Utah or New York can aggregate to equal that--well, \nthey will never equal it, but at least to gain a little leg up on that \nbargaining power and get some help?\n  Both of these proposals are free market. There are some people whose \nview of the free market is to let big companies do whatever they want. \nI am a little worried that over at the FCC, the whole idea is, let us \nhave one big communications empire. Actually, the free market needs \nsome competition. But the free market has also said, as it has evolved \nsince the Adam Smith days, that combinations to try and increase our \nbargaining power are legitimate, recognized ways that the free market \nworks.\n  I see that my colleague from Utah is in the Chamber. I first want to \npay him some tribute. I said this in committee a year or 2 years ago. I \nthink Hatch-Waxman has been one of the greatest consumer advances we \nhave done in the last quarter of the last century. When I said it, it \nwas still the previous century. But he has done a great job there.\n  Our goal, in terms of the Schumer-McCain bill, is to restore the \nbalance of Hatch-Waxman. The bottom line is a simple one: That in 1984, \nwe had a very simple template. We said: God bless companies that come \nup with innovative drugs. They research them; they make a lot of \nmistakes. For every drug they bring to market, there are a lot of drugs \nthat don't come to market. They need the help. They need a return. God \nbless them. Give them a return. They are creating a product that makes \nus all live better and longer.\n  But we also said that rate of return, that patent, which is what the \npatent really is, can't be unlimited. And so we said, after a period of \ntime, 20 years after the patent was filed, others could come and \nproduce the drug. It worked. Innovation, from the date Hatch-Waxman \npassed to the present, in the field of pharmaceuticals has been \nunparalleled. Lives have been saved. The people are living longer and \nbetter and healthier. We see that in our parents and our grandparents. \nIt is amazing.\n  In the last 5 years, I believe Hatch-Waxman has steered off course. \nIn fact, the whole pharmaceutical industry has steered off course. For \npeople who make a wonderful product, they are evolving into an industry \nthat is despised and hated.\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\n  They could say to themselves: It is only because these drugs cost a \nlot, and we can't help it because it costs a lot to research them.\n  I would say it is not that simple. I wish it were. They have evolved \nbecause, in a headlong rush to keep their profitability as high as it \nhas been in the past, they are desperately clinging to extend patents \nlonger than Hatch-Waxman ever intended. They end up hiring not just the \nbest researchers anymore but the best lawyers.\n  A drug company should go to Harvard Medical School, not Harvard Law \nSchool, as it continues its work. But they have been spending much of \ntheir time and effort in coming up with schemes--that is what they \nare--to extend the patent beyond the time it should be extended.\n  What does that mean to the average citizen? It means a drug, instead \nof costing $25 a month, is going to cost $100 a month--vital drugs. If \nanything, they have pushed it further and further because so many of \nthese blockbuster drugs, these wonderful drugs, are coming off patent \nshortly.\n  I know my colleague from Utah has a lot invested in Hatch-Waxman. I \nvery much appreciate it. The little changes that we make, Senator \nMcCain and I, in our bill, just build on it and readjust it. But I \nthink the view that Hatch-Waxman is just fine as it was in 1984 is off \nbase. The statistics will show it. That is why this bill has such great \nsupport. I am certainly open and willing and eager to hear whatever \nsuggestions my colleagues from Utah and Tennessee will make. But I will \ntell them this: The view that we should just go back to the old way in \n1984 doesn't work.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have before us the author of the amendment. Since the \nSenator has the floor, I would like to ask him a question or two.\n  Isn't it true that HMOs use their bargaining power to lower costs of \nprescription drugs today? HMOs all over the country have been doing \nthat.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, all over.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Isn't it true that insurance companies use their \nleverage and powers to get the lowest cost possible?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes, and they are proud of it. They brag about it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What could be the possible logic in denying the people \nof the States, particularly the smaller States--or large States, for \nthat matter--what is the logic of denying them their bargaining power? \nIf we are going to let the HMOs and insurance companies do it, why not \nthe States?\n  I am sure we will hear that it is because the States are a \ngovernmental power and therefore this is price control. As I understand \nit, if the drug company doesn't want to sell to them, they don't have \nto, do they?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague is exactly right. By the way, our Federal \nGovernment does the same thing in Medicare. They bargain with the drug \ncompanies for a lower cost for Medicare. Why can't the States do it for \ntheir citizens who are not under Medicare and Medicaid? My colleague \nfrom Massachusetts is right on the money.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It seems we will hear that somehow the States can't \nbargain because they are a governmental institution. But the concept is \nvery much the same. For the insurance industry, it is fine--it is a \nfree market system; and for an HMO, it is fine--it is the free market \nsystem. But somehow for the State, it is government. Even though the \npharmaceutical company is free to say: We don't like these \nnegotiations; therefore, we won't sell to you. If all the \npharmaceutical companies did that, obviously, the State would have to \nbargain in good faith. There is no indication that they are not \nbargaining in good faith.\n  As the Senator pointed out, there is no indication that these \nindustries have been suffering adversely. They are one of the most \nprofitable industries--and Lord only knows they are paying the highest \nsalaries to their executives as well. But I am not as interested in \nthat as in the concept of what we are talking about here.\n  Finally, if the Senator would agree, I am perplexed: We are not \ntalking about bargaining for high income people in the State; we are \ntalking about bargaining for the lowest income, the poorest of the \npoor, many of whom would not be able to have access to the prescription \ndrugs unless this were offered. Why is that PhRMA says: No no, you \ncan't do it; we are going to squeeze the very last dollar out of them?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator is literally on the money. The bottom line \nis that the Senator is exactly right. There is no difference, from an \neconomic point of view, in a State getting together and bargaining for \nits people and an insurance company or HMO doing it. In fact, you can \nargue that the State has more legitimacy, being an elected body and \nrepresenting the will of the whole people of Michigan, Maine, \nMassachusetts, or New York, No. 1.\n  No. 2, what about over in Europe or in Canada? They put on a price \ncontrol. The pharmaceutical company still ends up selling the drug. Do \nyou know what ends up happening? It is the American citizen who ends up \npaying for all the research, which does good around the whole world, \nfor, say, Celebrex or Vioxx. Who pays the whole thing? Us.\n  Why shouldn't the American taxpayer and citizen, through his and her \nState government, be allowed to say we should not bear that whole cost \nourselves?\n\n  That is the thrust of the amendment of the Senator from Michigan. It \nis free market. There is no lock-in. Just as Germany said, you can sell \nVioxx for 3 pfennigs, and that is not worth it. The company doesn't \nhave to sell it. It is the same exact thing here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the point is that the State is not even doing it \nfor all the citizens; it is not even doing it for all of them. They are \ndoing it for the poorest of the poor. That is whom they are trying to \nbargain for in these circumstances. The drug industry is contesting \nthat.\n  Let me, finally, ask my friend, Senator Stabenow, if she has a \nviewpoint on this matter. As I understand, this is not a partisan issue \nin any respect. I read Governor Engler's very strong comments about \nthis where he was actually talking about manipulating public policy. He \nwas using the word manipulate, suggesting that we have to manipulate \npublic policy. The drug companies are manipulating public policy in \ntheir patent policy and in the collusion with the generics, which is \nbeing addressed by the Schumer proposal.\n  So we have a Republican Governor talking about manipulating public \npolicy. I was interested in the fact that this should not be a partisan \nissue. The silence in support from the other side of the aisle is \ndeafening with regard to the Stabenow amendment. I am hopeful there \nwill be voices on the other side that will rise in support of this. To \ntheir credit, they supported the Schumer proposal in the committee. \nFive Republicans did. I hope we will hear those voices again.\n  I just say to the Senator, this isn't really a Democratic or \nRepublican, or liberal or conservative issue. I find there are liberals \nand conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, as well as Republican and \nDemocratic Governors who share the view of the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from New York. If the Senators would comment on that, I \nwould appreciate it because it is an important issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have one simple question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to the gracious Senator from Utah \nfor that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If they can answer my question, then I will be seated.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may ask, how much longer does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No more than 5 minutes longer. I thank the Senator. I \nwill yield to the Senator from Michigan to answer these very worthy \nquestions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank both of my friends and colleagues, who are such \nchampions on this underlying issue--the entire issue of Medicare and \nprescription drug coverage and lowering prices. In fact, as our leader, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, indicated, this is a measure that is a \nbipartisan amendment. We have Governors--frankly, the majority of \nGovernors--Republicans and Democrats, who are struggling with this \nquestion of lowering prices and making prescription drugs and lower \nprices available to their citizens. So as the National Governors \nAssociation is meeting right now, they have said their biggest \nchallenge is the price of prescription drugs\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nand the explosion, in their budget, of Medicaid. They need to address \nthese issues.\n  This amendment will support the Governors across the country. It is a \nbipartisan amendment. It is something supported across the country on a \nbipartisan basis. I am very hopeful that we will have colleagues' \noverwhelming vote on both sides of the aisle supporting the effort to \nsay yes to this innovation of the States. This is not mandatory, it is \npurely based on States taking action on their own to decide if they \nwould like to do this. If they do that through their State legislatures \nand the Governors on behalf of their people, this simply says that this \nis legal and that, hopefully, it will stop the suits PhRMA has been \nbringing against our State governments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. She is on the money. It is \nvoluntary. No State is forced to do this. But if the citizens of the \nStates, through their elected representatives, both Republican and \nDemocratic Governors, want to do this, they should be allowed. We \nshould not be tied up in litigation for years while the prices go up \nand up and up.\n  I am fully supportive, again. To underline this, this is a free \nmarket policy. It is no different than what the insurance companies do, \nthe HMOs, and God bless them. It is saying that people may aggregate. \nAre we going to have people opposing mergers of the big drug companies? \nNo, we are not. They say they can do it better in a larger size. Why \ncan't the average citizen do something in a larger size? That is what \nwe are trying to do.\n  I am going to conclude with one little pitch today. I know my \ncolleague from Utah has been patient, and I very much appreciate that. \nWhether it be the Schumer-McCain bill, generics, or this bill, these \nare reasonable and modest proposals. I say to my friends in the drug \nindustry--again, I admire them; I think they have done a good job--\nplease, you have become ``Dr. No.'' Whenever that comes up, you say \nno. No change. You are willing to change it with your lawyers to extend \nthe patents, with all these new ways you find around what we think the \noriginal intent of the Hatch-Waxman law was. Do not be Dr. No. Get with \nit. Go back and innovate. Go back and form new wonderful drugs and get \nyour patent on those, but when people want to get together to lower \nthose prices in a fair negotiation, when this Congress says we ought to \nprevent the lawyers from changing the original intent of Hatch-Waxman \nand drawing it off course, do not stand in the way.\n\n  In fact, I challenge PhRMA to come up with one constructive proposal \nto help people with the cost of drugs, not just to keep doing it the \nsame way when we know there is an outcry. They know best what helps \nwith innovation. Come up with a proposal. Do not go the way of the \ncigarette companies and spend all your life being sued. Do not go the \nway of the cigarette companies and become the object of scorn and \nhatred.\n  You make a wonderful product. You do something good. Support the bill \nof the Senator from Michigan. Support our bill or come up with some \nconstructive proposals.\n  I will make one other point, Madam President, and then yield the \nfloor. I went to PhRMA a year and a half ago. The Senator from Utah \nknows this because I informed him of the negotiations. I said: Let's \nsit down and figure out something. Let's get the generic industry and \nbrand industry together to come up with a compromise to deal with some \nof the problems.\n  They listened politely, but, frankly, I do not think they thought our \nlegislation had much of a chance for passage, and they said no.\n  Now we are knocking at the door. We are almost there, and it is not \ntoo late. It is not too late to come up with some answers that will \nsolve our problems--the problems that the Senator from Michigan deals \nwith in her legislation, and the problems that Senator McCain and I \ndeal with in our legislation--and get something done. I think I speak \nfor all of us that much rather than make speeches, much rather than win \npolitical victories, we want to get something done, and that is what we \nare here to do today.\n  In conclusion, I urge support for the Stabenow amendment to restore \nsome bargaining power which is voluntary. Let a State's Governor, if \nthey want, do this. Do not wait 5, 10 years until the litigation is \nfinished--it will probably come out the same way--and give people a \nbreak. Let them be able to afford these wonderful medicines that we \nhave and at the same time allow the drug companies to continue on their \npath of real innovation as opposed to false innovation of patents, pill \nsizes, colors of bottles, and different applications.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and once again thank my colleague \nfrom Utah for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \nlegislation, S. 812, the Greater Access to Pharmaceuticals Act. I did \nnot realize the pioneer companies that have been referred to as PhRMA \nare as satanic as they have been represented to be on the floor today. \nOne would think they are everything that is bad in this world and that \nthey are the cause of all the high costs of drugs in our society; that \nthey are not being fair to the generic companies that help bring drug \nprices down; that HMOs are the reason drug prices come down and that \nthe States do not have the same type of market power. I heard all these \nthings. I heard how terrible the research-based companies are. My \ngoodness, I have never known that before. I am so happy to get this \ninformation.\n  I would like to cite a book called ``The System.'' This book was \nwritten by Haynes Johnson and David S. Broder, hardly a conservative \nset of authors, but very intelligent, and highly respected journalists \nand authors. The book is an excellent account of the infamous and \nfailed Clinton health care plan. History has a way of repeating itself. \nYou can hear a theme on the floor over the last several days that comes \nright out of the Clinton play book.\n  On page 90 of that book, it says, in speaking about the political \ntactics to garner public support, a group of the President's political \nadvisers have the following discussion, which sounds familiar to the \nway the debate is going on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere:\n\n       In the campaign period, Fried recalled, Clinton's political \n     advisers focused mainly on the message that for ``the plain \n     folks, it's greed--greedy hospitals, greedy doctors, greedy \n     insurance companies. It was an us-versus-them issue, which \n     Clinton was extremely good at exploiting.\n\n  That was Fried. Then they go on further, and I quote from the Broder \nand Johnson book:\n\n       Clinton's political consultants--Carville, Begala, \n     Grunwald, Greenberg--all thought ``there had to be \n     villains.'' Anne Wexler----\n\n  Who, of course, is not known for her Republican politics----\n\n     remembered, It was a very alarming prospect for those of us \n     looking long term at how to deal with this issue. But at that \n     point, the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical \n     companies became the enemy.\n\n  All this sounds familiar.\n  That is what has been going on here on the floor. Frankly, I do not \nthink it is right. My experience has been there is no one single group \nwho should be blamed for the high costs of pharmaceuticals. I do not \nwant to blame the FDA because it takes up to 15 years and 5,000 \ndifferent compound experimentations to get an approval of a drug and at \na cost, according to some of the top authorities, of up to $800 \nmillion. That is 15 years out of the patent life. Frankly, one wonders \nwhy, with the few remaining years they have on patent life, drugs cost \nso much. I am not going to blame the FDA because their job is to \nprotect Americans, but on the other hand, that is a long time, and I \nmay talk a little bit about that today.\n  I am not going to blame the generic companies. They provide a \ntremendous amount of support for American people who need help. I \nbelieve in the generic industry. By and large, those companies are \ndoing a great service, as we intended in the Hatch-Waxman bill.\n\n  By the way, without the pharmaceutical companies, the pioneer \ncompanies, there would not be any drugs for the generic companies to \ncopy and reduce prices. So there has to be a delicate balance between \nthe two, and that is what Hatch-Waxman is all about.\n  This underlying bill, of course, which for some reason is being \ndebated before the Federal Trade Commission comes out with its \ncomprehensive study and\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nrecommendations on the very issues addressed in the pending bill, which \nshould occur before the end of next month--will change one of the most \nimportant consumer bills in history. I am not concerned just because it \nis my bill and Congressman Waxman's bill, but because without waiting \nfor the FTC to give its recommendations, this underlying bill will \nchange the Hatch-Waxman law before we have had a chance to hear from \nthe FTC, FDA, other experts and interested parties. I do not think it \nis right to change the law until we have all the facts and understand \nbetter what this bill will do.\n  Hatch-Waxman, according to almost all authorities, has saved \nconsumers $8 billion to $10 billion every year since 1984. It created \nthe modern generic drug industry, but it also strengthened the PhRMA \ncompanies, the pioneer companies. Back then, they were spending about \n$3 billion a year on research and development. Today, it is over $30 \nbillion a year. I think almost as satanic as they are portrayed on the \nfloor by our friends on the other side, it seems to me they ought to be \ngiven a little bit of credit for some of the major therapeutical \npharmaceuticals we have today.\n  Without them, we would not be where we are. We would not be the \nleaders in the world with pharmaceuticals, nor would we have the \nbalance of trade surplus we get from the sale of American \npharmaceuticals.\n  Let me comment on three aspects of the underlying legislation: \nPolitics surrounding floor consideration; the process by which the bill \nmoved to the floor; and finally, the substance of this bill.\n  At the outset of this debate, I congratulate and commend the original \ncosponsors of this legislation, our colleague from New York, my friend, \nSenator Schumer, and my colleague from Arizona, my friend, Senator \nMcCain. Even though I disagree with them on the way they resolved the \nkey issues addressed in S. 812, and although the bill that emerged from \nthe HELP Committee does not adhere to the original Schumer-McCain \nlanguage in virtually every key policy area, they deserve recognition \nfor their effort in highlighting issues, issues that are of concern to \neach of us to in this body: Access to prescription drug coverage and \naffordable prescription drug coverage.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I have a special interest in today's \npending legislation. Throughout my career in the Senate, I have helped \nfashion a portfolio of legislation that facilitates our Nation's \npharmaceutical research and development capacity. I am proud to have \nplayed a leadership role in crafting the law that the bill we are \nconsidering seeks to amend, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman bill. A key partner \nin this effort was my good friend from the House, Henry Waxman. That a \nliberal member like Mr. Waxman and a conservative like Orrin Hatch got \ntogether to write this law is but one sign of the bipartisan consensus \nthat developed with respect to the 1984 law and that should be \ndeveloped today.\n  Incidentally, on the House side of the Capitol, this law is often \nreferred to as Waxman-Hatch and in the Senate the names are often \nreversed. This shorthand is only used because it is so time consuming \nto keep repeating the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984.\n  I have a lot of complaints about the process we followed to bring S. \n812 to the floor, and despite my grave dissatisfaction over the \nprocess, I do want to recognize the efforts of Senators Edwards, \nCollins, Kennedy, Gregg, and Frist to make improvements to the \nsubstance of the bill. To be fair, there have been improvements in some \ncritical areas of the legislation. As a general matter, in moving away \nfrom some key provisions of McCain-Schumer, the HELP Committee \nsubstitute is headed in the right direction.\n  Now, I hasten to add, though, that some new provisions were added to \nthe bill during the markup process to make it impossible for me to \nsupport a bill that is so important to me--a bill that amends the law \ncarrying my name, a law that has been shown to benefit millions of \nAmericans every day.\n  Let me talk about the politics and process. Before I discuss the \nmerits of the committee substitute for S. 812, I want to make a few \ncomments concerning the politics and process whereby we find ourselves \ndiscussing these issues at this time.\n  One of the things about which I am most apprehensive in the current \ndebate is the way the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act of 1984, a painstakingly crafted bill that passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House, now \nfinds itself at ground zero in one of the most controversial and \npotentially divisive issues of this year, that is the debate over the \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  The Medicare drug benefit is certainly an issue that deserves the \nSenate's attention, and I am in one of the original tripartisan groups \nthat I believe has come up with a nonpartisan bill that would solve the \ndrug benefit problems for the American people, especially the poor.\n  I commend our colleagues in the House for successfully passing a \nprescription drug bill that promises to make a major expansion of \nMedicare benefits by providing an outpatient drug benefit. I think it \nis now time for the Senate to debate this issue, pass a bill, \nconference with the House, and present a bill for the President to sign \ninto law. I am also, like I say, proud to be the cosponsor of the so-\ncalled tripartisan Medicare prescription drug benefit bill. I think \nSenators Breaux, Jeffords, Grassley, Snowe, and I have put together a \nstrong bill that our colleagues should, and I think will in the end, \nsupport.\n  I had hoped the tripartisan bill could have been the subject of a \nFinance Committee markup, as it deserved. I think it would be approved \nby the Finance Committee, which more than likely explains why we are on \nthe floor today with S. 812. So as we enter this debate, let us be \nclear that the way the Senate Democratic leadership has chosen to \nstructure the floor vehicle, it is very possible the partisan fervor \nthat often accompanies Medicare legislation will spill over into the \nheretofore bipartisan consensus surrounding the 1984 Waxman-Hatch law. \nI hope not.\n\n  One of the things we did back in the 98th Congress in 1983 and 1984 \nwas to take the time and effort to build a broad, bipartisan coalition \nfor the Hatch-Waxman law. I hate to see us lose support as this body \nbecomes caught up in the unavoidable election year politics of \nMedicare. Frankly, it is almost amusing how the Democratic leadership \nhas structured the debate on the Medicare drug benefit. A bill that \ninvolves hundreds of billions of dollars and over a trillion dollars in \nsome of the proposals will be debated as an amendment to the more \nmodestly sized S. 812. Talk about the tail wagging the dog.\n  I hope if, as is well possible, we cannot achieve consensus on the \nMedicare drug debate, the inevitable ill feelings and political \nposturing do not create a poisonous atmosphere in which the broken tail \nof Medicare crushes the dog of Hatch-Waxman. Conventional wisdom has it \nthat a large part of what is at stake in the legislation we will debate \nover the next number of days has to do with jockeying for political \npositioning over who is left holding the bag with the voters in the \nfall if we fail to enact a Medicare drug benefit before the November \nelections. That is why I hasten to add that I hope my colleagues will \nlook at the tripartisan bill, which is nonpartisan, which basically can \nsolve these problems for especially the poor in our society with regard \nto drug benefits and the cost of drugs.\n  I firmly believe the best thing the Senate can do for the American \npublic is to lay aside, as best we can, the political infighting and \ngenuinely try to strike an acceptable compromise on the Medicare drug \nbill.\n  Make no mistake about the fact that although S. 812 may be nominally \nthe pending business before the Senate, the real matter we will be \ndebating is the Medicare drug benefit. I would have greatly preferred \nto debate Hatch-Waxman amendments as a stand-alone bill in a less \ncharged atmosphere. If we had to debate amending Hatch-Waxman with \nother legislation, probably my last choice would have been to lump it \ntogether with the politically volatile Medicare drug bill.\n  Then we have the ill-advised drug reimportation bill, which has been \nadded as an amendment to S. 812. This would have been my second to last \nchoice to add to Hatch-Waxman. I laid out yesterday my concerns with \nthat proposal.\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\nSuffice it to say, the reimportation language was a bad idea in the \nyear 2000, and it is an even worse idea today, given the threats of our \npost-September 11 world.\n  While the regrettable encore appearance of this feel-good but \nultimately downright dangerous drug reimportation legislation is deeply \ntroubling to me, it is doubly troubling to me that it will now be \nlinked to the 1984 Hatch-Waxman law because of the way the majority has \nchosen to proceed.\n  I recognize part of the reality of being on the minority side of the \naisle is that we have to go with the flow as the majority leader calls \nup legislation that he desires or his side desires, and I understand \nthat. As a coauthor of the legislation that S. 812 seeks to amend, I \ntake exception to calling up a bill that opens up Hatch-Waxman in order \nto create a legislative vehicle that promises to throw into play \nevery conceivable way to punish one of the great American success \nstories in innovation and in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n  This, ``everything but the kitchen sink,'' mentality, may be \nsatisfying to some politically. But mark my words, it starts this body \ndown a path that ultimately can only punish the American health care \nsystem. In my experience, delicate provisions and nuances of patent \nlaw, antitrust law, and FDA regulatory law are generally not best \ncrafted in the elbows-flying, raw meat atmosphere of high-stakes \nelection year politics such as we will have during the course of this \ndebate, in addition to what I consider to be an unfavorable environment \nthat will be created by the likely flood of major amendments not \nrelevant to S. 812 or the underlying Waxman-Hatch law.\n  I must also raise objection to the manner in which the bill so \nhastily was reported from the HELP Committee. Frankly, I am deeply \ndisappointed in the way the HELP Committee has acted, although I guess \nwe should not be altogether surprised given the perceived political \nadvantages my friends across the aisle believe they have and that they \nhave gained by calling up S. 812 as the backdrop--or should I say \nbackstop--to debate pharmaceutical issues.\n  It is true that S. 812 was referred to the HELP Committee. It is true \nthat the committee held a hearing on this bill on May 8. I testified at \nthat hearing. I stated my reservations about the way the McCain-Schumer \nlegislation acts to distort the original premise of the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.\n  While I am heartened by the fact that the HELP Committee version of \nS. 812 that is pending before the Senate today resembles more closely \nthe perspective of my testimony than the original Schumer-McCain \nlanguage, I am troubled by the fact that we basically have a bill \nemanating from the HELP Committee that centers on patent law, civil \njustice reform, and antitrust policy. I object to this outcome, and I \nwant to take a few moments to comment that the way the Judiciary \nCommittee was effectively cut out of the process is a matter of great \nconcern to me.\n  Even if three members of the Judiciary Committee serve on the HELP \nCommittee and are highly involved in this effort, I am concerned that \nthe recent actions of the HELP Committee with respect to this bill will \ncome at the expense of the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee both \ntoday and into the future. This is wrong. The Judiciary Committee has a \nrole to play in overseeing and legislating with respect to \npharmaceutical patents and competition in the pharmaceutical \nmarketplace. The process and timing that are being pursued can only \nundermine the appropriate role of the Judiciary Committee, a balanced \ncommittee.\n  The fact is, last year we held a hearing on competition in the \npharmaceutical marketplace and reported Chairman Leahy's bill, S. 754, \nthe Drug Competition Act, which I support. I cooperated with Senator \nLeahy in the development and refinement of his bill, S. 754, the Drug \nCompetition Act. I voted to report the bill out of committee even \nthough I had some reservations about some of the language, and I remain \nprepared to work on those concerns.\n  The fact is, the HELP Committee bill contains patent forfeiture \nprovisions, similar in many respects to the concept once under \ndiscussion as Chairman Leahy and I worked to refine S. 754. I ask why \nthe HELP Committee adopts a policy of patent forfeiture not on the \noutside of its jurisdiction but already rejected by members of the \nJudiciary Committee. I emphasize that this is not a matter of public \nhealth policy but a patent law and civil justice reform, and so is \nwithin the province of the Judiciary Committee, not the HELP Committee.\n  I am mindful of the fact it was referred to the HELP Committee, but \nthis body has a history of committees working in tandem on issues of \nmutual interest. In 1998, although the tobacco bill was referred to the \nCommerce Committee, the Judiciary Committee held 10 hearings on aspects \nof the legislation that touched upon our jurisdiction. We all know the \nlong-awaited FTC study of the pharmaceutical industry that focuses \nprecisely on the provisions of the law that the HELP Committee seeks to \nchange today will be completed in a few short weeks. Why not wait for \nthat? Why not get the best advice of the Federal Trade Commission? They \nhave done an extensive review.\n  Whether we agree or disagree with the final outcome of that, we at \nleast ought to get it before we try to wholesale change the law that \nhas been called the best consumer piece of legislation in the last 50 \nyears.\n  It is clear, to me, that consideration of this legislation would be \nmore informed if we had the information that is about to be presented \nby the FTC to Congress and the public. We should ask the experts at \nFTC, DOJ, the Patent and Trademark Office, and Health and Human \nServices if their perspectives on the changes in the law are advisable. \nIt would have been preferable to hear what the experts think of the \nHELP Committee language before it was brought to the floor. Whatever \nhappened to holding a hearing on the actual language of an important \nbill?\n  The reality is, in the course of the markup, the HELP Committee \nvirtually rewrote the major components of S. 812. Unfortunately, this \nsprint to the floor cannot foster the careful type of review and \nanalysis that the Senate conducted in 1983 and 1984 when we passed the \nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act.\n  Despite my disappointment about the committee process on \nconsideration of the Medicare drug benefit in the Finance Committee and \nthe way the Judiciary Committee was bypassed from playing a role in \nshaping S. 812 before it reached the floor, I want to take some time to \nmake a few remarks about the spending bill, the underlying bill, and \nhow it might affect the law it would amend; that is, the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.\n\n  It is useful to think about the words in the title of the law because \nthey remind us that we had two distinct goals in writing the law--\ngoals, by the way, which have been met. Attempts to change the law must \nalso reach the critical test of these two goals: First, to provide \nincentives for the development of innovative pharmaceuticals--if we \ndon't have that, we don't have anything; second, to promote widespread \ndistribution of generic drugs by permitting a shortcut to regulatory \napproval, which Hatch-Waxman did.\n  There is evidence to conclude that the 1984 law has met with success \nin accomplishing both of these ends, much to the benefit of the \nAmerican public. The 1984 law contains the incentives with respect to \nthe intellectual market that have brought hundreds of therapeutic new \ndrugs to the American public.\n  To mention a few of the drugs, these include products such as Vioxx \nto treat arthritis; the cholesterol drug, Lipitor; new medications that \nhelp millions of diabetics; and as recorded from Barcelona last week, a \nfamily of drugs to treat HIV infection and the complications of AIDS, \ntwo areas in which both the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nand I have spent a lot of time working together.\n  Private sector investment by research-based pharmaceutical firms \nincreased from $3.6 billion in 1984 to over $30 billion this year. This \nsubstantial level of private sector applied research funding, coupled \nwith the $27 billion invested by the taxpayers in the National \nInstitutes of Health budget next year, helps explain why the unique \npublic-private partnership that forms the U.S.\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nBiomedical Research Enterprise has American scientists positioned to \nusher in a revolutionary new age of discovery in the biological \nsciences. We all should take pride in the fact that the United States \nleads the world in developing innovative medicines. Part of the reason \nfor this leadership is the intellectual property protections contained \nin the 1984 statute.\n  The debate on the pending legislation centers on the price \ncompetition that occurs between generic and name brand drugs. But as we \nconsider legislation that alters protection of the innovator firms' \nintellectual property, it is important not to lose sight of the \nimportance of the fierce competition between the generic companies and \nthe brand name companies. It is the competition for new drugs that \ncreates advances in medicine and improves public health and ultimately \nprovides blockbuster drugs for generics to copy and to put out at, \nhopefully, less cost.\n  As we debate how to see that the American public, particularly senior \ncitizens, gains access to today's pharmaceutical products, during the \ngolden eggs of our biomedical research establishment we must be mindful \nof the long-term health of the goose that produces these innovative \ndrug products. Not only does the American public enjoy the benefits of \nthe latest breakthrough medicines, but consumers also reap the savings \nassociated with the use of generic drugs.\n  Since the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act, the \nshare of the prescriptions written for generic drugs has more than \ndoubled and has increased from somewhere less than 20 percent to almost \n50 percent of all prescriptions written. And as we will hear in the \ndebate that will take place over the next several days, everyone in \nCongress knows that senior citizens, particularly senior citizens, have \na great interest in programs, such as the 1984 law that resulted in \ncutting the costs of drugs.\n\n  One undeniable bottom line measure of success of the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984 is the fact that \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this law has contributed \nto annual consumer savings of $8 billion to $10 billion every year \nsince 1984. I wish all our legislation would be as effective and as \nsuccessful as this one.\n  It might prove useful to summarize briefly how the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act works. When you hear how \nthe statute operates, you will understand that a central principle of \nthis legislation is balance among the incentives of both the research-\nbased firms, the pioneer firms, and the generic firms.\n  This balance is not on only a simple matter of fairness to both of \nthese sectors of the pharmaceutical industry. Achieving a balance was \ncritical to help ensure that both of these sectors would succeed \nbecause the bottom line of Hatch-Waxman is to help the American public \nreceive both the latest in medical breakthroughs, and the more \naffordable generic drugs.\n  As we consider changes to Hatch-Waxman, we must be careful not to \nupset the balance because if we do, it is the American people who will \nsuffer. Here is how the law works. In order for a drug to be marketed \nin the United States, a manufacturer must prove to the Food and Drug \nAdministration that the drug is both safe and efficacious, effective. \nDrug discovery and development is an extremely time-consuming, \nexpensive, and risky process.\n  As I have mentioned before, experts at the Tufts University Center \nfor the Study of Drug Development have placed the costs of developing a \nmajor new drug at $800 million, when the opportunity costs of capital \nand the cost of failed drugs are factored into the rare, successful \nproduct.\n  During this debate, some will no doubt be tempted to characterize the \ndrug industry as nothing more than a bunch of greedy, money-grubbing \ncompanies. In fact, for much of the last decade, it has been the most \nprofitable sector of the U.S. Economy.\n  Nevertheless, as many analysts have noted, and was discussed by \nSenator Wyden at the Commerce Committee hearing this past March, drug \ndiscovery is a highly speculative venture and there is currently an \nindustry-wide slow down in the pipeline of products close to final FDA \napproval.\n  For every drug that succeeds in gaining FDA approval, more than 5000 \ncompounds are screened and fall by the wayside during testing. Some of \nthese compounds fall out in the lab; only about 250 of the original \n5000 compounds will proceed to full-scale animal testing; and, of those \n250 that enter animal testing, only 5 will make it to human clinical \ntrials; and, finally, the great majority--4 out of the remaining 5 of \ndrug product candidates--will fall out during the required 3 phases of \nhuman clinical testing.\n  The first phase of clinical testing usually entails about 30 \npatients. The goal of this phase is to assure that the compound under \nstudy is safe for human use. This is a very difficult hurdle as, for \nexample, it can be expected that a compound that can eradicate \ncancerous cells will also likely be toxic to the surrounding healthy \ncells. It is no wonder that the pharmaceutical industry invests a \nhigher percentage of its revenues into research than other industrial \nsectors. Are they given any credit for that on the floor over the last \nnumber of days? Give me a break. They certainly have not. In fact, they \nhave been condemned in talk after talk as though they are the sole \ncause of the high cost of drugs.\n  In the second phase of clinical trials, efficacy is examined. This \nmay involve several hundred patients and it may take several years to \ndesign, conduct, and analyze the trial.\n  If success is sustained through Phase II--and remember that \nexperience teaches us that most of these costly trials will result in \nfailure--an investigator may proceed to the third and final phase of \nhuman clinical testing in which the drug is administered to several \nhundred and sometimes several thousands of patients.\n  Phase III trials attempt to further evaluate safety and efficacy, \nfine tune dosing regimens, and uncover any propensity for adverse \nreactions among subgroups of the broad patient population taking the \nmedicine.\n  Because they involve more patients and seek more precise information, \nPhase III trials are generally even more expensive and time consuming \nthan the earlier phases of drug development. In order to gain FDA \napproval, the agency prefers to see two successful Phase III studies.\n  In addition to costing hundreds of millions of dollars to screen and \ntest drug candidates, it also takes a great deal of time. It has been \nestimated by experts that it takes, on average, about 14 years to bring \na drug from the lab through clinical testing and FDA review.\n  And all during this time the clock is ticking on the patents held on \nthese drug candidates. For example, in the case of the anti-\ninflammatory drug, Daypro, the patent lapsed during the 21-year FDA \nreview of the product.\n  While this case was clearly an outlier and FDA review time has \nimproved somewhat over the last decade due to the user fee legislation, \nit remains true that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is one of the \nmost highly regulated sectors of the economy.\n  It is an expensive process, mainly an expensive regulatory process. \nIf we could somehow find a way of cutting that down, then the cost of \ndrugs would come down, too.\n  We passed a bill--it was another Hatch bill--called the FDA \nRevitalization Savings Act, in the early 1990s, that said we should \ncreate a central campus with state-of-the-art buildings and equipment \nand scientific facilities instead of the almost 40 different locations, \nsome of them converted chicken coops, where they are conducting \nresearch today. The FDA has hardly hired a research scientist in the \nlast 30 years. The reason is there is not the prestige in their eyes to \nwork for the FDA for less money than they would get in the private \nsector.\n  NIH doesn't seem to have that problem because it is so prestigious to \nwork there, even at the lesser salaries, that scientists flock to NIH. \nIt is exciting, plus they have state-of-the-art buildings and equipment \nwith which to work.\n  We need to do that. We need to stop blaming the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, the pioneer companies for all the problems here.\n  In recognition of the exacting and time-consuming nature of FDA \nreview of safety and efficacy testing, the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act provided a number of\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nincentives designed to help research based pharmaceutical companies.\n  The statute provides for partial restoration of pharmaceutical \npatents, but only under limited rules:\n  First, the law allows one day of patent term restoration for each two \ndays spent in the human clinical trial phase.\n  This is known as the IND Phase. IND stands for the investigational \nnew drug and refers to the exemption that FDA grants to allow the human \nclinical trials to proceed.\n  The law also allows day-for-day patent term restoration when the drug \nis in the final stage of FDA review. This is called the NDA phase. The \nNDA, or new drug application, is the formal application that contains \nthe data demonstrating safety and efficacy. I should point out that \ngiven that each NDA contains data and records on thousands of patients, \nthe NDA literally contains hundreds of thousands of pages of \ninformation. In some cases those millions of pages of information would \nfill this whole Chamber--that's how complicated it is. Yet, we hear \nbadmouthing of the pioneer companies every day here on the floor. There \nare fair criticisms, but I don't think all the criticism has been fair.\n  There are two further limitations on the partial patent term \nrestoration. First, when the one-for-two rule in the IND Phase is \napplied with the day-for-day rule during the final review of the new \ndrug application, no patent may be restored more than 5 years. You \nshould keep in mind that, as I said earlier, it takes about 14-years to \nbring a drug through pre-clinical studies through FDA approval.\n  Finally, even after this 5-year limitation kicks in there is another \nrule that prevents any patent from being restored such that it will \nhave an effective patent life beyond 14 years.\n  The 5-year and 14-year limitation rules are sometimes referred to as \nthe Hatch-Waxman caps.\n  So I just want to point out that you will hear a lot of talk during \nthis debate about patent extensions, but what we are talking about is \npartial patent term restoration to offset part, and a relatively small \npart at that, of the time lost during the rigorous FDA review of safety \nand efficacy. You don't hear many comments about that from the critics \nthe fact of the matter is, this is a long, arduous expensive time \nconsuming, costly process. To blame the pharmaceutical companies for \neverything that is wrong is just not fair.\n  It is worth noting that the 14-year cap on effective patent life \ncontained in the Waxman-Hatch Act stands in contrast to how other types \nof patents are treated with respect to administrative delays at the \nPatent and Trademark Office.\n  This is a somewhat complicated story but I think it bears discussion \nin order to place the Hatch-Waxman policies into context with \nsubsequently enacted changes to the patent code.\n  Basically the GATT trade treaty required implementing legislation \nthat mandated the United States to change its patent system from 17-\nyears, measured from the date of approval to a new system of 20-years, \nmeasured from the of date of application with the Patent and Trademark \nOffice.\n  There was concern by many intellectual property owners that this \nchange in the law could actually decrease effective patent life due to \nadministrative delays at PTO. As a result, a provision was included in \nthe 1999 American Inventors Protection Act--a bill that passed with \nbroad bipartisan support--that allowed patent term to be restored up to \n17 years in cases where there was undue delay at the PTO.\n  The 17-year patent term floor in the American Inventors Protection \nAct extends to all types of patents and should be contrasted with the \n14-year patent term ceiling contained in the Waxman-Hatch for \npharmaceutical patents. Moreover, most patent applications are reviewed \nby PTO in one and one-half to two years, so that the effective patent \nlife for most products is actually 18 to 18.5 years. When all is said \nand done, most patents run appreciably longer than patents related to \ndrugs due to the 14-year Waxman-Hatch cap.\n  In addition to the partial patent term restoration provisions of the \n1984 law, the statute provides that each FDA-approved new drug that \nconsists of a new chemical entity receives 5 years of marketing \nexclusivity--not 18 years, which other manufacturers get, but 5 years \nof marketing exclusivity. In other words, we want to treat them at \nleast somewhat fairly.\n  This 5-year marketing exclusivity provision means that FDA may not \napprove any generic drug for that time 5-year period regardless of \nwhether the drug is protected by any patent.\n  The last major incentive on the R side of the ledger that I will \ndiscuss is the provision that entitles a pioneer drug firm that \nsuccessfully undertakes a clinical trial yielding data that \nsignificantly improves, or modifies the use of an existing drug \ncompound, to 3 years of marketing exclusivity.\n  As you can see, this is complex. But it works, and it has worked \namazingly well. Our country has benefited from it. And it was \nbipartisan. Actually, you would have to say it was nonpartisan. That is \nwhat I would like to see in a full Medicare prescription drug \nbill. This 3-year incentive helps encourage incremental, but often \nvitally important improvements, to existing drugs and does not bar \ngeneric competition from the original approved uses of the drug once \nany patent or marketing exclusivity has expired.\n\n  I hope my colleagues can see that the 1984 law contains a powerful \nset of intellectual property incentives that help foster the necessary \nprivate sector investment in pharmaceutical R\n  That is one reason our pharmaceutical companies have done so well. \nThat is why we have such a good balance of trade. They have been among \nthe most successful companies in our society up until now, and they are \nabout to be stratified where they won't have the money to go through \nthis $800 million and 5,000 misses to get one single drug, if they are \nlucky and then have just a few years of patent life. You wonder why \ndrugs cost so much through that market exclusivity.\n  In parallel with the incentives I have just described for innovator \nfirms, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act \nprovided the necessary regulatory regime that created the modern \ngeneric drug industry. Rather than unnecessarily squander societal \nresources by requiring the duplication of the expensive and time \nconsuming process by which safety and efficacy is established for \npioneer products, the law provided a shortcut through the FDA \nregulatory process.\n  That was one of the generic aspects of the law. The 1984 law, in \nessence, allows generic competitors to rely upon the proprietary safety \nand efficacy data generated by the pioneer firm and requires that the \ngeneric drug merely be shown to contain the same active ingredient and \nbe absorbed by the human body in a bioequivalent fashion. This simple \nprovision of law allowed generic firm to bring on high quality copies \nof the pioneer drugs for a fraction of the cost and, most importantly, \nto pass these savings onto consumers.\n  Their cost is less than 1 percent to put the drugs in the \nmarketplace. I want it that way. We wanted it that way when we did the \nHatch-Waxman bill.\n  Another key feature of the law is a unique change in the patent code \ndesigned to allow generic product to enter the market literally the day \nafter the patents on a pioneer drug expire.\n  Upon first consideration this may not sound like a \ndramatic development in the law but it is. Here's why.\n\n  Let us start with the Constitutional basis for patent protection. \nArticle I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provides: \n``Congress shall have the power . . . to promote the progress of \nscience and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and \ninventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and \ndiscoveries.''\n  It is said that Thomas Jefferson had his hand in the drafting of the \nfirst patent statute enacted by Congress back in 1790 and that in his \ncapacity of Secretary of State actually issued and signed some of the \nfirst patents issued by the United States federal government.\n  In areas such as pharmaceuticals, where it is relatively easy to copy \npioneer products that require enormous R expenditures--I mentioned \n$800 million to find one drug--it is critical to have strong laws \nprohibiting the infringement of patents.\n  I should also like to add that a patent right is a negative right and \ndoes not automatically confer monopoly power; a patent only allows the \npatent\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nowner the right to exclude others from utilizing the patented invention \nor process.\n  Section 271(a) of title 35 of the United States code contains the \ngeneral rule against patent infringement. It says: `` . . . whoever \nwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented \ninvention . . . during the term of the patent . . . infringes the \npatent.''\n  This is a tough provision and a good provision because it protects \nthe rights of inventors, inventors of all products used, manufactured \nor sold in each of our states, who have made substantial investment in \nresearch and development.\n  In order to allow generic drug firms to enter the market the day the \npatent expired, the general rule of section 271(a) had to be modified. \nThis is so because in order to get the drug through the truncated FDA \nreview process and gear up production the generic firm has to make and \nuse the patented drug, and this is important, while the pioneer drug is \nunder patent protection.\n  I should also add that under the common law there is a research \nexception to the general rule against patent infringement so that \nacademic researchers could be free to explore new areas of scientific \ninquiry.\n  During the course of the negotiations over the Waxman-Hatch law, a \nquestion arose in the courts with respect to whether this research \nexemption might carry over to the type of research activities necessary \nto develop a generic drug.\n  And right in the middle of these negotiations we got the answer when \nthe precursor court to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals issued its \nopinion in the case of Roche v. Bolar. The court held that the research \nexception did not extend to commercialization activities such as those \nnecessary to prove bioequivalence.\n  The result was that the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act contains a legislative override of the court case. This \nprovision, the so-called Bolar Amendment, creates a unique provision in \npatent law. Section 271(e) of title 35 contains the Bolar Amendment. \nSection 271(e)(1) says: ``It shall not be an act of infringement to \nmake [or] use . . . a patented invention . . . solely for uses \nreasonably related to the development and submission of information \nunder a federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of \ndrugs or veterinary biological products.''\n  When considering the pending legislation, it is important to \nunderstand that in preparing an abbreviated new drug application, or an \nANDA as they are called, the generic firm gets a head start over \nvirtually all other types of generic manufacturers in that they are \npermitted to make and use--and thus violate--pioneer firms drug patents \nwhile these patents are still in effect.\n  That is a major change in patent law that we put into Hatch-Waxman to \nget the generic industry really going. And it helped to create the \nmodern generic drug industry.\n  (Mr. EDWARDS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. In the interest of accuracy, I must add a footnote. In the \n1990 Supreme Court decision of Lilly v. Medtronic, the Court held in an \nopinion written by Justice Scalia that the Bolar amendment also applies \nto some other FDA-regulated industries such as medical devices. While \nyou need to read the opinion for yourself to see how this not-so-\nobvious result was accomplished, as coauthor of the bill, I did take \nnote of Justice Scalia's observation that:\n\n       No interpretation we have been able to imagine can \n     transform section 271(e)(1) into an elegant piece of \n     statutory craftsmanship.\n\n  Mr. President, ouch!\n  But the Medtronic decision has only limited significance and it is \nstill fair to say that the generic drug industry enjoys a head start \nthat virtually no other type of generic manufacturers could even \nimagine--the ability to make and use on-patent products for commercial \npurposes. The head start granted to generic drug firms by the Bolar \namendment was an integral part of the balance of the 1984 law and must \nbe kept in mind when I next discuss the closely related patent \nchallenge provisions of the bill.\n  But before I discuss these provisions, I want to first emphasize that \nthe central feature of the Hatch-Waxman law thankfully remains \nunscathed by the pending legislation.\n  This is the policy tradeoff whereby part of the patent term lost by \ninnovator drug firms during the extensive FDA review is restored while, \nat the same time, generic drug firms were permitted to rely upon the \nproprietary safety and efficacy data of innovator drug firms and enter \nthe marketplace upon a showing that the generic copy of the drug is \ndelivered to the patient in a bioequivalent manner.\n  And from the summary I have just provided, I think you get the idea \nthat the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 \nlaw is a complex piece of legislation. It took us 2 solid weeks, 18 \nhours a day, in my office. I was there every minute of those \nnegotiations to get this negotiated between the PhRMA companies and the \ngeneric companies. I will also concede, as Justice Scalia has noted, \nthat the statute does not read like a novel.\n  The 1984 law has been instrumental in delivering both new drugs and \nmore affordable drugs, but this is not to say that such a complex piece \nof legislation cannot be improved to address unanticipated or \nunintended consequences as well as changes in the marketplace and \nscience.\n\n  Before I discuss my views on the pending legislation, the HELP \nCommittee substitute to S. 812, I would like to complete my summary of \nthe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act by \ndescribing the patent challenge features of the statute. Perhaps no \nfeature of Waxman-Hatch has generated as much controversy as the \nprovisions relating to patent challenges. These are the least \nunderstood and, indeed, least appreciated provisions of the law. The \nguts of the HELP Committee substitute focus on these provisions.\n  I hope that everyone agrees that patents are critical to the drug \ndevelopment process because absent patent protection it would be \nrelatively easy to copy virtually any drug. The challenge of drug \ndevelopment is not in the chemistry of manufacturing, but in conducting \nthe extensive and expensive preclinical and clinical research that \ndemonstrates safety and efficacy.\n  While patents are integral to drug development, consumers can benefit \ngreatly from earlier price competition if it were determined that, for \nwhatever reason, the underlying patents on a drug were invalid or not \ninfringed.\n  At any rate, during the negotiations over the bill in 1984, a policy \nquestion arose regarding how best to guarantee that drug patents would \nbe challenged and what to do in cases in which a challenge was \nsuccessful.\n  We ultimately decided that a generic firm which successfully attacked \nthe patents on a new drug would receive a period of 180-days of \nmarketing exclusivity during which no other generic competitor could be \napproved by FDA.\n  The 1984 law contains an elaborate set of rules surrounding patent \nchallenges. Here is how the system works.\n  From my earlier discussion, you will recall that all new chemical \nentities--even and especially drugs without any patent protection--\nreceive a 5-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the \ngeneric drug firm may not rely upon the safety and efficacy data \ngenerated by pioneer drug firms.\n  And keep in mind that there may be no other industry in which generic \ncompetitors can rely upon pioneer manufacturers' proprietary \ninformation submitted for Federal approval purposes.\n  In any event, the law allows the generic drug firm to submit an \nabbreviated new drug application after 4 of the 5 year marketing \nexclusivity period has lapsed. When the generic drug application is \nsubmitted, the generic firm has to make one of four certifications with \nrespect to each patent related to the drug listed in the official FDA \nrecords called the Orange Book.\n  This chart sets out these choices.\n  First, that such patent information has not been filed.\n  Second, that such patent has expired.\n  Third, the date on which such patent will expire.\n  And fourth, and finally, that such patent is invalid or will not be \ninfringed by the manufacturer's use or sale of the new drug for which \nthe application is submitted.\n  It is the last certification, the so-called paragraph IV \ncertification, that is the chief cause of the major problems the bill \npending on the floor seeks to address.\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\n  As I have said many times over a number of years, by the way, and \nwill say again here today, I acknowledge there are some problems with \nparagraph IV patent challenges.\n  These need to be corrected. I would like to shape legislation to \ncorrect them.\n  But it is also no secret that my preference was to address these \nproblems in the course of a comprehensive review of the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act.\n  In fact, in the good old days when I was still chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, was \nthe chairman of the HELP Committee, we were working together to conduct \nsuch a review.\n  But times have changed. What should not change is that this body \nshould resist the pile-on mentality which villianizes an industry which \nis doing more to help millions and millions of Americans daily than any \nother industry we could imagine.\n  Before I close my remarks today, I will outline the types of issues \nthat ought to be considered a more thorough review of the 1984 law than \nthe pending bill contemplates.\n  In any event, to return to the paragraph IV litigation procedures, \nthe filing of a generic drug application triggers a 45-day period \nduring which the pioneer drug company or firm could initiate a lawsuit \nto determine whether its patents were valid or infringed. In order to \ngive a court adequate time to familiarize itself with, and hopefully \ndispose of on the merits, the almost always complex issues attendant to \npatent litigation, the Waxman-Hatch law provides a statutory 30-month \nstay.\n  During this 30-month period FDA may not approve the generic drug \napplication in dispute unless a court resolves the matter.\n  It is also true that this is a unique provision not available to \nother types of patent holders. However, this unique 30-month stay \nprovision that benefits patent holders must be understood in context of \nthe overall system of balances contained in the 1984 law, and, in \nparticular, in connection with the operation of the Bolar amendment.\n  The Bolar provision, you will recall, has the laudable public purpose \nof trying to get the generic drug product onto the market the very day \nthe patent expires.\n  As I explained earlier, in order to achieve this pro-consumer end, \nthe patent code was amended to allow the generic firms to infringe \npatents.\n  But we must recognize that the reality of the Bolar amendment is that \nit takes away the customary rights of a patent holder to bring a patent \ninfringement action the moment a generic drug manufacturer makes or \nuses a patented product. In this case, the commercial purpose consists \nof seeking FDA approval and gearing up production. It cannot be \ndisputed that section 271(e) of the patent code--the Bolar amendment--\nplaces pharmaceutical patent holders in a disadvantageous position from \nwhich to defend themselves against challenges to its patents by generic \ndrug challengers.\n  This is so because a second prong of the Bolar amendment, codified at \nsection 271(e)(2) of the patent code, treats the somewhat artificial \nact of filing a generic drug application as an act of patent \ninfringement, and it is at that point, and not before that point, that \nthe patent holders can assert their normal patent rights through the \ncourts.\n  It seems only fair to recognize the unique head start that the Bolar \namendment allows to generic firms on the front end of the generic drug \ndevelopment by making available to pioneer firm patent holders the 30-\nmonth stay that allows the courts adequate time to delve into the \nmerits of the challenged patents. Absent the Bolar amendment--and don't \nforget that this provision reversed the Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals decision that decided against generic drug firms on the matter \nof patent infringement--the case for the 30-month stay would not be as \nstrong.\n\n  In any event, during the course of the 30-month stay, it is hoped \nthat an adjudication on the merits of the patent challenge will be \ncompleted. If at the end of the litigation the pioneer firm prevails, \nthe generic drug applicant must wait until the patents expire before \nthe FDA can approve its application and the generic product can be \nmarketed. On the other hand, if the courts determine that the patents \nare invalid or the generic drug firm has successfully invented a way \naround the patents, the 1984 law grants an award of 180-days of \nmarketing exclusivity. As I said earlier, this is to encourage vigorous \npatent challenges so that consumers can benefit from earlier access to \ncost-saving generic drugs.\n  I thought then, and think now, that it is sound public policy to \ncontain an incentive to assure legal attacks on pioneer drug patents, \nand we all must recognize that such litigation is risky, complex, time-\nconsuming, and costly.\n  Now that I have laid a foundation by discussing the basic provisions \nand policies of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration \nAct, I want to add to the debate that was initiated yesterday by \nbriefly describing the key problems that have been observed in recent \nyears with respect to the 1984 law.\n  I first remind the Senate that in the next few weeks the Federal \nTrade Commission is expected to issue a comprehensive report that \ncenters on what many believe are the two most important abuses of the \ncurrent system: First, the manipulation of the patent system for the \npurpose of triggering multiple overlapping or late-in-the-process 30-\nmonth stays; and, second, collusive arrangements between pioneer and \ngeneric firms to game the Paragraph IV litigation in order to preclude \nthe triggering of the 180-day marketing exclusivity clock so that no \ngeneric can reach the market in a timely fashion.\n  I am frustrated by the fact that the tactical choices of my \ncolleagues across the aisle preclude us from debating this important \nlegislation without the benefit of the FTC report.\n  I await with great interest the final version of the forthcoming \ncomprehensive FTC report on the drug industry so we may get a more \naccurate picture of the number of instances in which drug firms have \ntried to game the system by listing a late-issued patents into the FDA \nOrange Book.\n  While my staff and the staffs of a few other Members have been \nbriefed on the general findings of the FTC study, it was under the \ncondition of confidentiality and with the understanding that the \ncommissioners had not evaluated the data and given us their \ninterpretations, conclusions, and recommendations.\n  Along the same lines, I would like to add that the FDA Chief Counsel, \nDan Troy, convened a meeting in February of representatives of both the \ngeneric and pioneer drug firms.\n  Mr. Troy elicited information and debate on several maters, including \na full and frank discussion of both the 30-month stay and the 180-day \nmarketing exclusivity provisions of the 1984 law.\n  One of the many down sides of rushing this bill to the floor in this \nfashion was that it precluded members of several committees, including \nthe Judiciary Committee, Commerce Committee, as well as HELP Committee, \nfrom first reviewing the comprehensive FTC study on the very issues \nthat the pending legislation seeks to address.\n  We may have also missed out on a meaningful opportunity to have the \nusual give and take of a public hearing with the FTC and the FDA on \nthese issues. We could have--and should have--taken the more routine \nand orderly path to legislation by holding a hearing to solicit the \nadministration's detailed advice in crafting language, including \nsoliciting their views on the language that arose just last Tuesday in \nthe HELP Committee.\n  Yesterday, Senator Gregg read from the first, but no doubt not the \nlast, missive from the administration commenting on this new language.\n  In any event, let me turn to the 30-month stay provision. It is my \nunderstanding that the FTC report will reveal that there have been \nseveral--perhaps about 10--cases of either multiple, consecutive 30-\nmonth stays or later-issued patents that resulted in surprise 30-month \nstays.\n  The facts matter.\n  We need to learn about these cases. We also have to keep matters in \nperspective. Although some in this debate suggest that there has been, \nand will continue to be, an epidemic of unjustified triggering of the \n30-month stay, I am not sure that the evidence will support this \ncharge.\n  We must take care not to overcorrect any problems based on anecdotal \ninformation.\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\n  But I will say this: the now famous case of the drug Buspar convinces \nme and many others that Congress should take action to address the \nproblems associated with late-issued patents triggering new 30-month \nstays.\n  This was the case in which a patent on the metabolite of a drug was \nlisted in the Orange Book just as the original patents on the drug were \nset to expire and generic were literally on the loading dock ready to \nbe shipped.\n  I do, however, want to note for the record that in the case of Buspar \nthe courts stepped in and the stay lasted only 4 months, not 30-months.\n  The HELP Committee bill would freeze those patents eligible for the \n30-month stay to those patents filed with FDA within 30-days of \napproval of the New Drug Application. All other subsequently issued \npatents would be eligible for injunctive relief but would not be \nentitled to the longstanding protection afforded by the 30-month stay.\n  First, I commend Senators Edwards and Collins for overturning the \nMcCain-Schumer language that completely--and unjustifiably--eliminated \nthe 30-month stay. The Edwards-Collins amendment also is a great \nimprovement over the language that Chairman Kennedy circulated in the \ndays before the markup.\n  The Kennedy language would have arbitrarily limited the types of \npatents eligible for the 30-month stay to drug substance patents and \nmethod of use patents.\n  By treating some patents as inferior to others, the Kennedy draft \nwould have reversed a longstanding principle of Hatch-Waxman not to \ndiscriminate among types of patents.\n  The very purpose of the 30-month stay is to give the courts an \nadequate period of time to make an informed analysis of the complete \npatent portfolio surrounding a drug product.\n  The 30-month stay allows the time necessary to make fact-based \ndeterminations of the validity of the challenged patents as well as to \ndetermine if the generic challenger has successfully navigated the \nfield of valid patents and produced a non-infringing version of the \ndrug.\n  I know that Senator Gregg was working on a language that would have \nretained the 30-month stay for each patent recorded in the Orange Book \nprior to a generic drug challenger filed a marketing application with \nthe FDA. I think that there is great merit in this approach.\n  The Hatch-Waxman law does not even allow generic drug applicants to \nfile a generic drug application until four full years have elapsed \nafter the NDA has been approved for a new chemical entity.\n  That is because, as I stated earlier, under the 1984 law, drugs \nconsisting of new chemical entities--and these are likely to be the \nbreakthrough products--automatically receive five years of marketing \nexclusivity before FDA can approve a generic copy of the drug. It seems \nreasonable to conclude that, at a minimum, all patents filed before a \ngeneric can first challenge a pioneer drug, that is, after four years \nhave elapsed, should be accorded the protection of the 30-month rule.\n  For example, consider the hypothetical but not unrealistic case of an \napproved intravenous drug covered by pre-NDA issued patents on the \ncompound and the method of use. In addition, assume the drug sponsor \nhas applied for, but does not receive, a patent on the intravenous \nformulation until two years after the NDA is approved. While the \nEdwards-Collins language is barely one week old and I am still studying \nits implications, upon first consideration, I find it difficult to \njustify treating the post-NDA-issued formulation patent differently \nthan the earlier two patents. After all, a generic challenger--although \nfree to infringe the patent under the Bolar amendment for the purpose \nof providing bioequivalence data and to prepare for full-scale \nproduction--cannot even contest any of the three patents for 2 years \nafter the third patent issues.\n  That is because the filing of the generic drug application creates \nthe artificial act of patent infringement required by the Bolar \namendment that allows the Paragraph IV litigation to commence.\n  I emphasize the fact that the lawsuit may not begin at least until \nthe four year statutory bar on submitting a generic drug application \nexpires.\n  And if it makes sense to include all patents issued within the first \nfour years during which no ANDA application and Paragraph IV challenge \ncan be made, one can argue, as Senator Gregg has, and I suggested in my \ntestimony before the HELP Committee in May, that it makes sense to \nfreeze the patents listed in the Orange Book for the purpose of the 30-\nmonth stay on the day that any particular ANDA is submitted, whether or \nnot it is filed on the first day of ANDA filing eligibility, or years \nlater.\n  The McCain-Schumer proposal to do away with the 30-month stay \naltogether is dead.\n  The Kennedy proposal to allow only some types of patents to qualify \nfor the 30-month stay is dead. Perhaps the governing principle should \nbe one bite, and one bite only, of the 30-month apple and all we are \ndebating is when, not whether, to cut off the availability of the stay. \nAs I said last night, in some respects the Edwards-Collins language is \na step in the right direction and this is one of those improvements.\n  We know that it currently takes, on average, about 18 months for FDA \nto complete its review of generic drug applications. I understand that \nit takes, on average, about two years to reach a district court \ndecision in Paragraph IV patent challenge case. We also know that the \ngeneric have argued--and the Edwards-Collins amendment embraces--that \nit would be unfair to start the 180-marketing exclusivity clock--a \nmatter that I will discuss latter in my remarks--until a final decision \nhas been reached by an appellate court. This appellate review takes \nabout another year, so the total litigation period of Paragraph IV \ncases is about 36 months.\n  I can understand why generic Paragraph IV challengers want to wait--\nthe prospects of treble damages seems to me like a good reason for them \nto exercise caution--until an appellate court decides the merits of the \npatent challenge. Given the risk adverse behavior engendered by the \nthreat of treble damages, I don't see why it is so absolutely critical \nin the first place to bifurcate the application of the 30-month rule at \nthe time a new drug application is approved.\n  Perhaps the FTC study will unveil a pattern of cases in which courts \nhave ultimately determined that frivolous, or at least invalid, patents \nwere filed between the approval of the NDA and the first ANDA \nsubmissions. Perhaps not, only time will tell.\n  But frankly, this is an area where the actual data that presumably \nwill be forthcoming in the FTC study will be extremely helpful. I will \nbe greatly interested to know how the patent challenge cases would have \nbroken down if the Edwards-Collins NDA-plus 30 day rule were applied \nretroactively. Stated another way, are there any significant \ndifferences in the outcome Paragraph IV challenge litigation between \nOrange Book patents listed before, and those patents listed after, 30-\ndays after the NDA has been issued? It will be beneficial to get a \nsense on whether there is a pattern with respect to when invalid \npatents and patents that have been circumnavigated tend to be listed.\n  And as I said earlier, I think we would have all been better served \nif the Committees of jurisdiction had been afforded the opportunity to \nconduct hearings with the purpose of analyzing the actual language of \nthe Edwards-Collins Substitute and with the hindsight provided by the \nFTC report, together with the expert advice and analysis of the FTC, \nother federal agencies, and other experts and interested parties.\n  We should all recognize that patent litigation is often, as in the \ncase of pharmaceutical patents, inherently technical and complex.\n  For example, The Legal Times recently reported that the Federal \nCircuit has a reversal rate of 40 percent in certain patent cases. I am \nconcerned that to the extent we adopt a policy that relies too heavily \non simply throwing the matter of injunctive relief to federal district \ncourts absent a period to allow the court to sufficiently familiarize \nitself with the issues at hand not only disrupts a justified internal \ncheck and balance of Waxman-Hatch, but also may have the effect of \ncreating uncertainty as the district courts wrestle with arcane matters \nof patent law.\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\n  While I can see how some enterprising generic firms and their \nattorneys might be able to turn this new and potentially unpredictable \nenvironment into leverage for settling patent challenges, I am not sure \nthat this instability is either fair to pioneer drug firms or in the \nlong run interests of the American public.\n  For now, I will listen carefully to the debate on this matter but, \nfrom what I now know, I am inclined to conclude that the Gregg proposal \nis preferable to the NDA-plus 30-day standard contained in the HELP-\nreported version of S. 812.\n  Moreover, as I stated earlier, I think a case can be made for making \nthe 30-month stay available to all patents listed within four years \nafter the NDA has been approved since no patent litigation can commence \nunder the 1984 law until that time.\n  In short, while I am open to further debate and discussion on the \nmatter, at this point I question whether the Edwards-Collins language \nunnecessarily cuts off the 30-month stay too early in the process?\n  I welcome the understandable and justified attempt to address the \nproblem of late or even multiple 30-month stays that can occur when \nlater-issued patents are entered into the Orange Book. As I said in my \ntestimony in May, if there is a compelling case to keep the current \npolicy of universal availability of the 30-month stay for all patent \nwhenever listed, let's hear the arguments.\n  Once again, let me commend Senators Edwards and Collins for moving \nthe Committee away from the these negative aspects of the McCain-\nSchumer and Kennedy proposals.\n  I am pleased that there appears to be something of a consensus on the \nimportance of retaining the 30-month stay even though, for the reasons \nI have just described, I think we need further discussion of when the \nstay should be available and when it should not be operative.\n  Having addressed the general issue of the wisdom of retaining the 30-\nmonth stay, I would be remiss if I did not comment upon some aspects of \nthe Edwards-Collins substitute that would also drastically affect \npatent litigation under the 1984 Waxman-Hatch law.\n  Mr. President, I speak now of the what I will call the file-it-or-\nlose-it and sue-on-it-or-lose-it provisions of the HELP Committee \nSubstitute.\n  Mr. President this is a case of the HELP Committee trying to rewrite \npatent law and doing an absolutely horrible job at it to boot.\n  There are three very similar and very disturbing provisions that \nessentially say a pharmaceutical patent holder can effectively forfeit \ntheir rights by not filing patent information or a patent infringement \naction at a certain time.\n  The first of these provisions is found in Section 3 (a)(1) ``(2)(F)'' \nof the bill. This provision requires manufacturers of innovative new \ndrugs to file certain patent-related information in the FDA Orange Book \nupon penalty of--and here's the rub--forfeiture of their patent \nenforcement rights.\n  A second provision of the bill, contained in Section 3(a)(2)(B) of \nthe bill makes this filing requirement applicable to drugs approved \nprior to enactment of S. 812.\n  This provision says, in effect, that upon enactment of S. 812, every \nholder of a pre-enactment approved new drug application has 30 days to \nfile all specified patent-related information in the FDA Orange Book or \nlose forever their rights to sue for patent infringement.\n  Talk about Draconian remedies for failing to file information with \nthe government. This takes the cake! I should also point out that \nsection (a)(1) ``(2)(C)'' of the bill significantly expands the type of \npatent information that must be filed, including requiring very precise \nclaim by claim certifications of what each particular patent covers. I \nam concerned about the policy and potential effects of this language.\n  Given that forfeiture of patent rights is the penalty for the two \nfile-it-or-lose-it provisions I just described, you should not be \nsurprised to learn that the patent right forfeiture trifecta is \ncompleted in section 4(a)(2)(C) which contains a sue-on-it-or lose-it \nprovision that appears to say that failure to defend against any \nParagraph IV challenge waives your patent rights against all \nchallengers for all time.\n  I was relieved to hear Senator Kennedy state on the floor yesterday \nthat this last provision was not intended to require forfeiture of \npatent rights as against all potential infringers. I take him at his \nword that this language will be clarified. But, once again, I must ask \nwhy we find ourselves on the floor with a poorly drafted patent \nprovision that has not been vetted by the Judiciary Committee, the PTO, \nthe White House or the patent bar or any number of other experts?\n  Nevertheless, I find these three provisions so troubling I hardly \nknow where to start my criticism. Under the current law, failure to \ndefend against a Paragraph IV challenge does not result in automatic \nforfeiture of patent rights.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues should know that under current law the \npenalty for not promptly defending against a Paragraph IV litigation \nchallenge is waiver of the 30-month stay, not forfeiture of any patent \nrights.\n  It seems to me that the current law waiver of the 30-month stay \nagainst the particular litigant bringing a particular paragraph IV \nchallenge is a proportionate response to the failure to defend against \na particular lawsuit.\n  I think that both of the two file-it-or-lose-it provisions and the \nsue-on-it-or-lose provision simply go too far. I am not aware of any \nanalogous provision in title 35, or in case law, but I am the first to \nadmit that because this language is only a week old my study is not \ncomplete. I must question embracing the principle that if a patent \nholder, for whatever reason, fails to file information with the FDA \nthat those rights should be automatically surrendered against any \nwould-be patent infringers.\n\n  It seems to me that these provisions should be subjected to careful \nscrutiny under the takings clause before they are adopted. As well, the \ndisadvantageous treatment accorded pharmaceutical patents under these \nthree positions should be examined from the perspective of the TRIPS \nprovisions of the GATT Treaty. That involves the Finance Committee as \nwell.\n  We must not lose sight of the fact that patents are presumptively \nvalid. We must not lose sight of the fact that the reason we have laws \nto protect intellectual property is because society benefits from \nadvances in the arts and sciences, as the Constitution asserts.\n  If we expect to have breakthrough medicines, we better protect \npatents.\n  Why would we ever support a system in which the failure of a mail \nroom clerk, even if underpaid and overworked, or the U.S. Postal \nService could result in the forfeiture of rights stemming from \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars and precious human capital \ninvested in cutting edge biomedical research?\n  Just this week, because of the anthrax problem, I received some \nChristmas presents. One can imagine what can happen on some of these \npatent cases.\n  Why shouldn't pharmaceutical product patent owners retain the same \ntime-honored rights exercised by all other patent owners to decide how \nand when to respond to patent challenge litigation?\n  Mr. President, I must tell my friends on the HELP Committee that this \nmember of the Judiciary Committee--the committee charged with \noverseeing the patent law, antitrust law, and the administration of \ncivil justice--that I do not support the manner in which they have \nresolved significant matters of patent law, civil justice and antitrust \npolicy.\n  In fact, when Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and I were \nnegotiating over the provisions of his bill, S. 754, the Drug \nCompetition Act, at one point a Leahy staff draft contained a provision \nin some ways similar to the pending bill's file-it-or-lose-it and sue-\non-it-or-lose-it provisions. Ultimately, that approach was rejected. \nAnd for good reason.\n  As many of my colleagues know, S. 754 requires the prompt reporting \nof any potentially anticompetitive agreements between brand name and \ngeneric drug firms to DOJ and FTC.\n  Basically, the Leahy staff proposal--I cannot say whether Chairman \nLeahy was aware of all of the details of this particular provision--was \nthat a drug company would surrender its patent rights if it did not \npromptly report to\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nFTC and DOJ any potentially anticompetitive agreement with a generic \ndrug firm.\n  Let me read the Leahy staff draft that was circulated to my staff \nlast July.\n  It was contained in the enforcement section of the bill, and it said:\n\n       Contract and Patent Enforceability--if any person, or any \n     officer, director, partner, agent, or employee thereof, fails \n     to comply with the notification requirement under section 5 \n     of this Act, such failure shall render permanently \n     unenforceable any agree which was not filed with the \n     Commission--[referring to the FTC] and the Attorney General, \n     and [here comes the relevant language] shall also render \n     permanently unenforceable any patent of the generic drug \n     manufacturer or the brand name drug manufacturer that is the \n     subject of the agreement.\n\n  I must give Senator Leahy's staff a great deal of credit. One of them \nis Ed Barron, the deputy chief counsel of the Judiciary Committee \nDemocratic staff. Ed is a level-headed, gifted lawyer and has been an \nasset to the Senate and the Judiciary Committee for many years.\n  As well, Susan Davies, a former Supreme Court clerk, is an extremely \ntalented lawyer.\n  When they consulted with experts in the field and further studied the \nmatter, they properly concluded that patent forfeiture was an improper \nresponse for a mere reporting failure--even if that unreported \nagreement was ultimately found to be violative of the Federal antitrust \nlaws.\n\n  How does a patent law provision with civil justice reform \nimplications aimed at an antitrust problem find its way in three places \nin a HELP Committee-reported bill, one year after the chairman and \nranking Republican member of the Judiciary Committee considered and \nrejected the same basic policy in a bill that covers the same concerns \nas the pending legislation?\n  Mr. President, I am afraid that yet another casualty of the truncated \nprocess observed by the HELP Committee in its consideration of S. 812 \ncan be seen in the last minute inclusion of the ``file-it-or-lose-it'' \nand ``sue-on-it-or-lose-it'' provisions of the pending bill. But this \nis exactly the kind of negative outcome that can occur when there is a \nmarkup on a Wednesday and untested language appears the day before.\n  The truth of the matter is that is exactly what took place last week \nin the HELP Committee.\n  While I have commended Senators Edwards and Collins for rejecting the \nkey provisions of the McCain-Schumer bill, in the case of the ``file-\nit-or-lose-it'' and the ``sue-on-it-or lose-it'' provisions, I must \ncommend Senator McCain and Senator Schumer for not including such \ntroublesome language in the first place.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to think carefully about the precedent \nthis body would be setting for patent and copyright owners if we follow \nthe lead of the HELP Committee and retain this language.\n  At a minimum, I hope the Judiciary Committee will have a chance to \nhold a hearing on this novel language.\n  If the press of election year politics precludes the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee from holding such a hearing, I would hope that the House \nJudiciary Committee will step up to the plate and fully vet this issue.\n  We need to hear from PTO and the patent bar on this issue.\n  We need to hear from the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation and the intellectual property groups on this issue.\n  This matter is far too important to be brushed aside in the rush of \nthe HELP Committee to report a virtually complete substitute to S. \n812--a substitute that suddenly springs forward last Tuesday, a day \nbefore the markup--a substitute that is then hastily plucked off the \nSenate calendar before, I believe, a committee report is even filed, \nand then rockets its way onto the floor as a straw man for the Medicare \nprescription drug debate.\n  I am dubious of the language in the bill that creates, I am told, \nperhaps for the first time in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \na private right of action.\n  I am speaking of the provision in the Section 3(a) ``(2)(E)'' of the \nbill that creates what appears to be a new cause of action to attack \npatent listings.\n  Aside from setting an unwelcome foothold for trial lawyers to reach \ninto the FDC Act, one must wonder how a provision that seems to create \na parallel course of litigation to the well-established Paragraph IV \npatent contests simplifies or adds any measure of certainty to the \npatent challenge system? As the debate unfolds, I may have more to say \non this matter and urge my colleagues to act to strike this language.\n  The last major area on which I wish to comment with respect to the \npending legislation relates to the collusive agreements that have \noccurred in connection with the 180-day marketing exclusivity incentive \nof the 1984 law.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I have just discussed why I believe the \npending bill's treatment of the 30-month stay is an improvement over \nthe McCain-Schumer bill. For the reasons I have just discussed, I think \nthe NDA plus 30-day rule goes too far. I come here today to give you my \nviews on the 30-month stay issue and to see how the sponsors of the \npending legislation respond to my arguments. If they say this is a \nnonnegotiable matter, that is one thing. If they are willing to modify \nthe language, I will be willing to work with them on this. I would like \nto hear from them on this issue.\n  I have a number of other issues I will raise, but I want first to see \nwhether there is a willingness to work with me in correcting what I \nconsider to be inflexible language and to work with me in providing the \nflexibility to work on the 30-month stay, the file-it-or-lose-it or the \nsue-on-it-or-lose-it provisions, and the private right of action.\n  I have worked on many occasions with the Senator from Massachusetts. \nI have worked against him. I have worked with him. I know sometimes he \nadopts the no amendment strategy. The minute we yield the floor, I am \nraising the question of whether the sponsors are totally locked in on \nthe language, and then I would like to hear what they have to say about \nthe arguments I have made. This is too important an issue to play \npolitics. We are talking about the health of the American public. I am \nwilling to work to improve the bill. The language has improved as it \nhas moved further away from the original Schumer-McCain language, but \nfor the reasons I have described I think the language still needs some \nwork.\n  I have a lot more to say, but I will end by rereading first an \nadministration policy from the Executive Office of the President and \nthen rereading a paragraph from this book.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy, it says:\n\n       However, the administration opposes S. 812 in its current \n     form because it will not provide lower drug prices. S. 812 \n     would unnecessarily encourage litigation around the initial \n     approval of new drugs and would complicate the process of \n     filing and protecting patents on new drugs. The resulting \n     higher costs and delays in making new drugs available will \n     reduce access to new breakthrough drugs. Moreover, this new \n     cause of action is not necessary to address patent process \n     abuses. Clearly, the bill would benefit from consideration by \n     the Senate's experts on Hatch-Waxman law on the Judiciary \n     Committee, the proper committee of jurisdiction for this \n     bill.\n\n  Let me finally conclude where I began, and that was the book written \nby Haynes Johnson and David Broder, highly respected journalists, \ncertainly not conservative journalists but journalists I respect, and \nthey said this on page 90:\n\n       In the campaign period, Fried recalled, Clinton's political \n     advisers focused mainly on the message that for ``the plain \n     folks, it's greed--greedy hospitals, greedy doctors, greedy \n     insurance companies. It was an us-versus-them issue, which \n     Clinton was extremely good at exploiting.'' Clinton's \n     political consultants--Carville, Begala, Grunwald, \n     Greenberg--all thought ``there had to be villains.'' Anne \n     Wexler remembered--\n\n  Who is one of the leading Democrats in this town, one of the leading \nlobbyists in this town. I respect her greatly. She said--\n\n       It was a very alarming prospect for those of us looking \n     long term at how to deal with this issue. But at that point, \n     the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies \n     became the enemy.\n\n  All I ask in this debate is that we get rid of some of this rhetoric \nthat the large pharmaceutical companies are a bunch of criminals and \nbad people who have run up the costs of drugs and who really do not \nplay much of an important role in our society, and who literally are \nthe reason we cannot get low-cost, affordable drugs to the American \npeople.\n  During those 18 days or so, whatever it was, that we debated in my \noffice and came up with the Hatch-Waxman\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nAct, we had almost fist fights between the PhRMA companies, the \npioneering companies, and the generic companies, but in the end we were \nable to bring them together. Neither side was totally happy, but I \nbelieve both sides have been totally happy with the Hatch-Waxman \nresults over the last 18 years. To be honest, before we change \nsomething that has been so doggone effective and efficacious, I might \nadd, to use an FDA term, it seems to me we ought to at least make sure \nwe are doing it the right way.\n\n  I have a lot more to say, but I have spoken for a long time. I \nunderstand that. I apologize to my colleagues, but I will be back to \ndiscuss other issues such as the 180-day rule which is at the center of \nwhat are considered to be collusive deals between the generics and the \npharmaceutical firms.\n  To me, these issues are important. I want to apologize to my \ncolleagues for going on so long, but this is a very complex bill. There \nis no way it can be explained in a matter of a few minutes. I have only \ncovered a small part of it, but I have covered some very important \nparts, and I think, and I hope, my colleagues will realize I have made \na case that they really ought to give consideration to.\n  I do not have any political axes to grind. I like both sides of this \nbusiness. I like the pharmaceutical companies that have done so much to \ncome up with lifesaving drugs, and I love the generic firms that have \ndone so much to duplicate those drugs at an almost nonexistent cost, \ncompared to the $800 million to create those products, but that have \ngotten them out there in bioequivalent ways for the benefit of the \nAmerican people.\n  They both deserve a great deal of credit. Neither one of them \ndeserves to be torn down in the Senate. I think we can fix Hatch-Waxman \nin ways that will continue to give both of them the incentives to \ncontinue to provide a pipeline of very wonderful drugs, lifesaving \ndrugs, for us, and at affordable prices ultimately. I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to what I have to say. I do not have any desire \nto malign anybody, but I really believe what I have had to say today is \nimportant and that Hatch-Waxman is an important bill. I do not want to \nsee it fouled up because we are unwilling to pay the price to do it \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to extend in many ways the comments \nmade by the Senator from Utah. At the outset, I not only express my \nrespect and admiration for his eloquent remarks, but also for the \ntremendous commitment he has shown on this particular issue over the \nlast 20 years, especially with the Hatch-Waxman law which for the last \n18 years has achieved so much for the benefit of the American people. \nThe Senator from Utah has shown a commitment and has shown real \nforesight, in sponsoring and authoring--along with other colleagues in \nthis body--the original Hatch-Waxman bill in his eloquent analysis of \nthe legislation before us, as has been modified and improved markedly \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He has also \nprovided an excellent analysis of the underlying McCain-Schumer bill \nand some of the deficiencies he sees within this legislation.\n  After listening to his remarks, I think the underlying message was \nthe real beauty in this legislation and in the original Hatch-Waxman \nlegislation in achieving a sense of balance between the brand \npharmaceutical companies and what they achieve through research and \ndevelopment, creativity and innovation, that balance with the growth \nand the appropriate incentives given to the generic community, where we \nknow that cost-effectiveness has been demonstrated and needs to \ncontinue to be demonstrated as we move forward. We need to keep this in \nmind especially in this world with skyrocketing drug costs, which are \nputting the cost of pharmaceuticals out of the reach of seniors, of \neveryday Americans, and of individuals with disabilities.\n  Much of the discussion over the last 3 days has been on how best to \nprovide seniors and individuals with disabilities in Medicare access to \nprescription drugs, and that debate will continue into next week.\n  Throughout this entire discussion is the whole issue of cost--what we \nneed to do responsibly that can be sustained long term in terms of cost \nto make sure the cost of drugs are appropriate, reasonable, and not \nbeyond the reach of Americans. The Hatch-Waxman law has had 18 years of \nbalance, and now is the time to go back and readjust and make sure that \nbalance is well situated for the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Utah say the legislation, as \ncurrently written--and recall he commended the various amendment \nprocesses in the HELP Committee to improve the bill--goes too far in \ncorrecting what is out of kilter today. That balance needs to be \nreadjusted. The underlying legislation has many deficiencies that he \nbelieves, and I agree, should be addressed. I will walk through several \nof those from the perspective of having served on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  The issue of cost is one that disturbs everyone. It is at the heart \nof the discussion on health care and on extending prescription drugs in \nan affordable way, in a bipartisan way, to seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. The cost is not just in the public sector but the private \nsector as well. The skyrocketing cost is driving people to the ranks of \nthe uninsured.\n  As we look at the overall skyrocketing cost of health care, the cost \nof prescription drugs is increasing in a way that cannot be sustained \nover time. In the name of cost savings and in the name of reaching out \nand rallying support for particular pieces of legislation or amendments \nfocusing on cost savings, never should we threaten public health, which \nwe talked about yesterday. Furthermore, never should we threaten the \nresearch and innovation that has made us the envy of the world in terms \nof health care--the great breakthrough drugs, the investment in \nresearch and delivery, which eventually will deliver a cure for things \nwhich are not curable today, such as HIV/AIDS. That virus will kill \nsomewhere around 60 million people over the next 20 years. We do not \ncurrently have a cure, however, I am confident a cure will be found by \nresearch and development from our pharmaceutical companies.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act has served us very well. As the distinguished \nSenator from Utah said, generic drugs represented only about 20 percent \nof the market in 1984. Yet today, half of all drugs in this country are \ngeneric which, again, is a huge advance. At the same time, we have been \nable to see this rise in the generic industry, which I advocate because \nof the cost-effectiveness that is demonstrated there because of the \nbalance we have. The brand name pharmaceutical companies have continued \nto invest in research and development. Over that same period of time \nsince 1984, that research and development by the brand name \npharmaceutical companies have increased not twofold, threefold or \nfivefold but have increased ninefold since 1984.\n  We have seen dramatic breakthroughs in pharmaceutical treatments for \nsuch areas as mental health, cancer, and heart disease. Costs have put \ndrugs out of reach for too many Americans today, and we must address \nthat. Over time, both the generic industry and the brand name \npharmaceutical companies have, unfortunately, circumvented the \nintentions of Hatch-Waxman. That circumvention is clearly an abuse \nbecause it ultimately drives up the cost of health care, and it must be \naddressed. Adjustments are in order. What concerns me and what clearly \nconcerns the original author of the Hatch-Waxman legislation, the \nSenator from Utah, is that this underlying legislation goes too far.\n  I will comment on several of the areas. First, I restate the \nlegislation in the Senate today is currently much improved over the \noriginal Schumer-McCain legislation introduced last May. The original \nversion of S. 812 took a heavy-handed approach to this very real \nproblem. It would have dealt a serious blow to pharmaceutical research \nand innovation, which we all depend on as we look for potential cures \nand potential therapies in the future.\n\n  My colleagues, Senators Edwards, Collins, Gregg, Hutchinson and \nothers should be commended for working\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\nwith the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. Senators McCain and Schumer also worked to approve the \nlegislation. Nevertheless, the bill before us has significant flaws. \nLet me briefly outline several of my concerns.\n  First, we are focused most importantly on cost savings, the driving \nforce. Everyone knows the costs are too high. It is important for our \ncolleagues to understand there has been no demonstration that the \nunderlying legislation will actually save money, lower the overall \nburden of prescription drugs and generic drugs in the aggregate to \neither consumers or in the aggregate in terms of the overall health \ncare dollar.\n  The intent of the authors has been clear--the goal of the legislation \nis to improve competition. If improving competition is achieved, and I \nhave real questions about whether competition will be improved as \nwritten, I believe costs will decrease. It will speed cheaper generic \ndrugs to the market, which is the intent of the authors of this \nlegislation.\n  Part of the legislation discussed today is clearly being promoted \nbecause of the intent, or what the proponents say it would do, and that \nis to lower costs. The real question is, Does it? Is there any evidence \nthat it will do so?\n  The Congressional Budget Office, to the best of my knowledge, has not \nscored this piece of legislation. By score, I mean it has not estimated \nthe cost of this legislation. Neither this legislation nor the original \nbill introduced by Senators Schumer and McCain has been analyzed by the \nCBO.\n  As you listened to Senator Hatch's eloquent comments earlier and you \nlistened to the complexities of this bill, I ask, Does this increased \ncomplexity and new cause of action actually contribute to increasing \ncosts?\n  Lastly, I am not aware of any other estimates of potential savings by \nindependent, nonpartisan experts that members of the Senate will have a \nchance to review before we go forward.\n  My second point refers to how best to curb abuses. The whole idea of \ncurbing abuses is a common goal that we share in the underlying \nlegislation, in the amendment process, and in the H.E.L.P. Committee. \nAs Senator Hatch again spelled out in his comments, the Federal Trade \nCommission is currently conducting an extensive study of potential \nabuses in this area. As we discussed in the hearing several days ago \nand as Senator Hatch requested, the FTC is preparing a report regarding \nthis area. It would be nice to have an objective body like the Federal \nTrade Commission present its data before we potentially complicate \nlegislation over the next several days and weeks.\n  Unfortunately, we are not going to have that opportunity. It is too \nbad because as I understand it, the real problem is being made in terms \nof the Federal Trade Commission's ongoing study.\n  Current law, as we look at the 180-day exclusivity provision, \nprovides an incentive for the first generic that challenges an \ninnovator's original patent. It awards that generic company 180 days, \nor about 6 months, during which other generics may not be approved. The \nbill before the Senate, which is quite different than the original \nlegislation, provides that if one generic loses that 180 days of \nexclusive rights, it can pass on to the next generic.\n  I am told the 180-day exclusivity rule has been the most frequently \nlitigated area of the Hatch-Waxman legislation over the last several \nyears.\n  I am concerned and again this understates the concern of Senator \nHatch. The provisions in the proposed bill are overly complex and they \nmight actually encourage even more litigation and promote even greater \nconfusion in this area.\n  As Senator Hatch mentioned, during the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee's evaluation, we reached out to understand the \nlanguage in this particular bill. I have to admit that the new bill's \nlanguage was confusing to me, but at the end of our discussion, my \ninterpretation as we listened to the proponents of the bill is that the \n180-day exclusivity period would allow, theoretically, a rollover \nindefinitely.\n  If that is a correct interpretation, it could actually take longer \nfor cheaper generic drugs to get to the market. While a generic drug \nwould be cheaper during this 180-day period than a brand name drug, it \ncertainly would be more inexpensive during the 60-day or 180-day \nexclusivity period, where it had absolutely no generic competition.\n  Last May, Senator Hatch and others were highly critical of a concept \nof rolling exclusivity when they testified before the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. In fact, Senator Hatch \ntestified and quoted former Acting Director of FDA's Office of Generic \nDrugs, Gary Buehler, as follows:\n\n       We believe that rolling exclusivity would actually be an \n     impediment to generic competition.\n\n  Senator Hatch further stated:\n\n       If our goal is to maximize consumer savings . . . it is \n     difficult to see how rolling exclusivity achieves this goal.\n\n  In fact, many experts believe and have expressed that the 180-day \nexclusivity period is no longer necessary today, and that if it were \nabolished, even more significant cost-savings could be achieved. \nMoreover, eliminating the 180-day provision altogether, in my opinion, \ncould be the best way to curb abuses currently being investigated by \nthe FTC--where brand companies and generic companies have allegedly \nentered into collusive and potentially anti-competitive agreements to \nprevent cheaper generic drugs from coming to market and benefitting \nconsumers.\n  My main point is if we are going to act in the absence of the FTC \nreport, which examines this very issue and their findings, we clearly \nshould not add confusion to this area. We should not add provisions \nwhich would increase litigation or increase costs, and we should not \nadd provisions that could exacerbate incentives for anti-competitive \nbehavior by both generic and brand name drug companies. This is the \narea we need to fix.\n  If we are not ready to eliminate this 180-day rule or wait for the \nFTC report to help guide us on how we can make that ultimate decision \nand act responsibly, I believe what is called a ``use it or lose it'' \npolicy would better discourage anti-competitive behavior. This so-\ncalled ``use it or lose it'' policy would take away incentives for \ngeneric companies to make their own potentially anti-competitive \narrangements.\n  Senator Gregg initially proposed this ``use it or lose it'' policy \nduring the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nconsideration of this legislation. I believe this policy would clearly \nbenefit consumers more than any form of ``rolling'' exclusivity. If we \nare going to act in the absence of the full report of the FTC, we ought \nto at least to do so in a straightforward way that promotes competition \nand that clearly helps consumers.\n  The third issue I would like to raise is the issue of bioequivalence. \nThis is a particular issue that I introduced in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee and spoke a little about on the floor two \ndays ago. Again, it is an issue I want to put out to my colleagues for \ntheir consideration. The unintended consequence, in the way this \nlegislation is written, is potentially harmful in a way that I will \ndelineate.\n  The Hatch-Waxman law allows generic companies to market off-patent \ndrugs if they are able to demonstrate this so-called bioequivalence. \nBioequivalence simply means the active ingredient in a generic \npharmaceutical or a generic drug is absorbed at the same rate and to \nthe same extent as the brand drug.\n  The bill before us--and this is the key point--could significantly \nweaken this important patient protection by giving the Food and Drug \nAdministration broad authority to significantly relax, to loosen, the \nstatutory Hatch-Waxman bioequivalency standard. My concern is this \npotential loosening of the standards.\n  We all have agreed--at least in the Health, Education, Labor and \nPension Committee discussions, including the proponents of the \nlegislation--that the FDA has broad authority with regard to \nbioequivalence and that there has not been a successful challenge to \nthe FDA bioequivalence standards as they exist today.\n  Based on existing statutory language the FDA has developed through \nthe process of notice and comment--rulemaking specific bioequivalence \ntest methods to address a range of products have been established over \ntime. They\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\nhave not been successfully challenged. As we discussed this in \ncommittee, the FDA has been uniformly successful in defending its \nbioequivalence methodology and its findings. In fact, we agreed in \ncommittee that the FDA's authority in this area has been repeatedly \nupheld. There has not been a reported case challenging the FDA's \nbioequivalence standards since the case was decided in FDA's favor back \nin 1997, five years ago.\n  Therefore, as we look at bioequivalence, I think it is unnecessary, \nimprudent, and unwise to include any bioequivalence language in this \nlegislation. Nonetheless, the bill before us would deem FDA's \nregulations to be authorized under relevant provisions of the Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act.\n  Again, my concern is that it could insulate the FDA from any \npotential challenge in this area.\n  The reason I keep bringing it to the floor and talking to my \ncolleagues about this issue is because I hear a lot about it from the \nmedical community, the scientific community, and the biological \nresearch and development community. Given the importance of the \nbioequivalence requirement in assuring the safety of generic drugs, I \nbelieve any loosening of standards is in the disinterest of the \nAmerican people. Why? Because, once again, it goes back to safety and \npublic health. Instead of moving forward, it is moving backwards.\n  There are many examples, but a typical example would be taking a \nblood thinner such as Coumadin. Coumadin is used all over the country. \nIt is a tremendous drug and a very powerful drug. It is well known that \none generic of Coumadin versus another versus yet another behaves in a \ndifferent way, even if you prescribe the same dose in milligrams. The \nbioequivalence can be variable and might be tiny, 3 percent, 5 percent, \n8 percent. But when the goal is thinning of the blood so you do not \nhave another stroke or heart attack, when you go from one drug to \nanother drug for whatever reason--it might be the pharmacy telling you \nto do it, it might be your health plan, it might be you who has chosen \nto do it--your blood might be thin one day and not thin the other, and \nyou think you are taking the same drug.\n  That is what bioequivalency is--where there might be loosening of the \ncurrent standard. The reason I say there might be loosening is because \npeople who are a lot smarter than I who study the language tell me the \nlanguage as written looks to be loosening.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield for the question.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Tennessee understands the issue better \nthan anybody else, and certainly the points he makes are excellently \nmade.\n  It was my understanding on this specific point of bioequivalency that \nthe Senator had a commitment from a primary Democratic sponsor of the \nbill, Senator Edwards, that this would be worked out or straightened \nout before the bill came to the floor. Am I correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to my distinguished colleague, \nthis issue of having a general agreement that we would work out \ntechnical language, and then after 48 hours or 72 hours have the bill \ncome to the floor without the opportunity, in a bipartisan way, to be \nable to access experts in the field, is what concerns me most. You can \ntake an initial bill and improve it a little bit, and then you can \nleave something out and not reach bioequivalency. In response to the \nquestion is a particular instance where during the discussion, the \nmark-up, we said let's get together and make absolutely sure that we \naddress it in a way so that standards are not being loosened; yet, the \nbill that comes to the floor does not have that guarantee in it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me continue. Let me answer one \nquestion, and then return to my comments. I would be happy to yield for \na question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Tennessee is the expert. He is a cardiac \nheart surgeon who is recognized for what he has done before he came to \nthe Senate. I will certainly bow to his educational and professional \nexperience.\n  Talking about bioequivalency, is it not true that when it comes to \nthe efficacy of a drug that we should also take that into consideration \nwhen we are dealing with women, children, or pregnant women? It is my \nunderstanding that all of these are relevant to the efficacy of drugs--\nbioequivalency.\n  Is it not correct that were it not for the congressional pressure and \nmandating the same pharmaceutical companies the Senator is speaking of \nthey would not be engaged in clinical trials sufficient to make certain \nthat the efficacy of drugs would be the same for women and men, and \ndosages for children?\n  The point I am making is the industry, itself, had to be pushed into \na position to find exactly what was better for people in usual \ncircumstances of life. Is that not a fact?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished colleague \nthat we need to do a much better job in pushing the pharmaceutical \nindustry to make sure that when it comes to testing of drugs or \ninvestigating drugs that they are adequate, especially as you look at \nbioequivalency in a varied population.\n  In fact, in the HELP Committee, as my colleague knows, we have passed \nlegislation and we will continue to work on legislation that says we \nneed to do more in terms of testing to see what the bioequivalent \nstandard is. What is called in my profession of medicine a ``dose \nresponse'' relationship is in populations--whether it varies by race, \nage, or gender--we need to do a lot more. We need to keep pushing \nthere.\n  My concern with bioequivalence--we will agree, whichever population \nit is or whether clinical trials are being conducted--the way this \nlanguage is written today allows a significant loophole for a lessening \nof the bioequivalent standards that we as the American people deserve. \nThat is my concern.\n\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire addressed in his question to me, we \nare reaching out. Clearly, we are in the minority. We are not going to \nhave the votes. But I am going to continue to reach out. And I think \nyou will see that our side will continue to reach out in the interest \nof cost savings. We do not want to push so hard that we lower the \nstandards for the safety of the American people who take these drugs. I \ndo not care if the cost savings is $100, $50, or $5. If that drug is \nnot bioequivalent--if the dose is too strong, then your blood will not \nclot properly and you can get a stroke from bleeding in the brain, or, \nif the dose is too weak, then your blood clots too easily and you can \nget a stroke from having a blood clot go to your brain--you have done a \ndisservice to the American people.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire just mentioned, I will continue to \nreach out on this particular issue of bioequivalence.\n  You heard Senator Hatch from Utah stress that we need to slow down a \nbit to make sure that your intent in having cost savings does not hurt \nthe American people. That is really the issue.\n  I am not the expert. Of course, I have dealt with a lot of these \ndrugs, and I know what it is like being told by a managed-care \norganization that you have to switch drugs. The fear I have is that the \ndrug has not been tested in a certain population effectively. Again, it \ncould be by race or gender or age. That concerns me. Therefore, I do \nnot want any lowering of those standards by our Government.\n  The Biotechnology Industry Organization sent a letter to Senator \nKennedy dated July 15.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                            Biotechnology Industry\n\n\n                                                 Organization,\n\n                                                    July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter protests proposed \n     legislation (the Edwards-Collins substitute) to alter the \n     Hatch-Waxman Act of facilitate generic drug approvals. The \n     substitute's proposed changes raise serious concerns for \n     members of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO). We \n     urge you to reconsider these amendments and to work on a more \n     considered basis on any effort to revise the carefully-\n     balanced Hatch-Waxman system.\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\n       As you know, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act of 1984 (the ``Hatch-Waxman'' Act) strikes a \n     balance between promoting access to generic drugs and fairly \n     protecting the legitimate rights of the patent holder. It \n     proves an expedited path to market for generic drugs, while \n     ensuring that innovators receive an adequate term of patent \n     life to stimulate new drug development.\n       The initial purposes of proposed amendments to Hatch-Waxman \n     were to prevent abuses and facilitate efficient market entry \n     of generic products. The reported bill goes far beyond these \n     purposes. Among other things, the reported bill would \n     completely abolish patent rights if litigation is not \n     initiated within 45 days of notice by a generic that it \n     intends to challenge a patent, or if a new drug applicant \n     failed to list its patent with the FDA within 30 days. It \n     creates a private right or action for generic manufacturers \n     to attempt to ``correct'' patent information filed on a \n     listed drug. At least prior to committee consideration, the \n     bill provided the FDA with broad authority to define and \n     apply standards governing bioequivalence--the critical \n     determination of safety and efficacy of a generic drug--\n     without challenge (or even comment) from affected members of \n     the public. If enacted, these proposals would significantly \n     erode the measures included in Hatch-Waxman to ensure an \n     effective patent incentive for new drug development, and \n     would create undesirable precedents for sound science-based \n     regulations of drug products in the United States.\n       Our specific concerns follow:\n       When it enacted the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress recognized \n     that patent disputes over drugs regulated by the abbreviated \n     new drug procedure were inevitable. The abbreviated new drug \n     system thus provides procedures to permit generic and pioneer \n     manufacturers to resolve these disputes before the FDA grants \n     marketing approval to a generic producer. Under its \n     procedures, the FDA will not immediately approve an \n     abbreviated new drug application if the ANDA applicant \n     challenges a patent that has been identified as covering the \n     drug (a so-called paragraph IV patent certification). \n     Instead, the patent challenge triggers, by statute, an \n     opportunity for the patent owner to initiate a legal \n     proceeding to resolve the patent dispute. The initiation of a \n     patent suit in response to the paragraph IV certification \n     will trigger a 30-month stay of action by the FDA on the \n     abbreviated new drug application. The patent challenge \n     procedures and the stay of approval ensures that products \n     that would clearly infringe the patent rights of the \n     innovator will not enter the market.\n       The amendments approved by the HELP Committee convert these \n     procedures--which were designed to enhance the ability of a \n     patent owner to enforce its rights--into an all or nothing \n     system that can eliminate the patent rights of our companies. \n     Under the legislation, a patent owner who for any reason \n     fails to initiate litigation against a generic drug applicant \n     within 45 days of receiving notice under the ANDA procedure \n     will be barred from enforcing patent rights in any forum \n     against either the ANDA applicant or any party that \n     manufactures, uses, sells or offers for sale the approved \n     drug product. In addition, a new drug applicant--who may \n     not even be the patent owner--who fails to list a patent \n     with the FDA within 30 days of approval of a new drug \n     application, or within 30 days of the grant of a patent if \n     that occurs after the NDA is approved, is similarly barred \n     from enforcement of patent rights on the drug against a \n     generic manufacturer. Either of these events will \n     completely abolish patent rights in new drugs or related \n     technology.\n       The legislation also creates new opportunities for generic \n     drug makers to harass our companies through unnecessary and \n     pointless litigation. As proposed, our companies and their \n     drug marketing partners would be required to list patents \n     that pertain to an approved new drug. Failure to list patents \n     would render our patent rights void. Notwithstanding this \n     mandatory listing process, the legislation would create a \n     private right of action to permit a generic manufacturer to \n     challenge these mandatory patent listings. The legislation \n     also would allow generic drug applicants to initiate this \n     litigation regardless of whether our companies or their \n     partners intend to assert their patent rights in the ANDA \n     process. Plainly, the motivation to prevent improper listings \n     of patents has been turned onto its head by these procedures.\n       Members of BIO thus unquestionably will be harmed by the \n     Edward-Collins substitute. Many of our companies focus on \n     improving currently marketed drugs regulated under the new \n     drug and abbreviated new drug approval system. These \n     innovations of our companies create new and better medicines \n     for patients that are more effective, easier to administer \n     and open up new opportunities for treating unmet medical \n     needs. These technologies frequently--often by commercial \n     necessity--are licensed to multiple drug manufacturers who \n     have the resources to bring new drug products that use these \n     technologies to market. Perversely, under the legislation \n     approved by the HELP committee, if our companies elect to not \n     aggressively enforce their patent rights by immediately suing \n     every generic drug applicant, or if one of the marketing \n     partners makes administrative errors in listing patents with \n     the FDA, the patent rights of our companies will be \n     forfeited. This forfeiture will occur without compensation, \n     without a right of appeal and without any recourse. This \n     provision is probably unconstitutional, and in any event is \n     totally unconscionable.\n       Finally, as you know, as originally drafted, Section 8 of \n     the bill would selectively codify certain regulations \n     governing ``bioequivalence'' requirements and would \n     legislatively shield the FDA from challenges to its actions \n     in setting approval standards. We understand the purposes of \n     Section 8 to be limited: to confirm the authority of the Food \n     and Drug Administration to use testing methods other than \n     those specifically set forth in current law to establish the \n     bioavailability and bioequivalence of a generic drug, when \n     the methods specified cannot be applied. Types of generic \n     drugs to which alternative testing methods would be applied \n     would include drugs intended to deliver the active moiety \n     locally, such as topical preparations for the skin or oral \n     dosage forms not intended to be absorbed.\n       As pointed out by Senator Frist during markup, section 8 as \n     currently drafted goes far beyond the intended purposes of \n     the provision. The draft proposal presented during markup \n     would codify fifteen pages of FDA regulations governing \n     ``bioequivalence'' requirements on both new drugs and \n     generics and would legislatively shield the FDA from \n     challenges to its actions in setting approval standards. In \n     essence, the proposed changes would make it impossible for \n     drug manufacturers, whether pioneer or generic, or members of \n     the public, to challenge improper standards enacted by the \n     agency on key approval criteria, or to challenge improper \n     decisions made under valid authority. Moreover, the current \n     regulations include several provisions in which FDA provides \n     to itself unfettered discretion to create or define at will \n     any standard ``deemed adequate by FDA.'' This makes an \n     otherwise legitimate challenge to an agency decision \n     virtually impossible to sustain. Shielding the agency from \n     actions to challenge its proper authority simply makes no \n     sense, particularly when the consequences involve potential \n     risks to patients and to public health.\n       We were assured by your staff that this provision would be \n     narrowed to its intended scope, in consultation with BIO, \n     prior to floor consideration, and we provided alternate \n     language to your staff that would accomplish the intended \n     purpose of section 8. We have been presented with another \n     draft that would continue to codify all of FDA's \n     bioequivalence regulations (including the ability to define \n     at will any standard it deems adequate) but only preserves \n     ``existing'' legislative authority to regulate biologics \n     under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This is simply \n     unacceptable to BIO. At this stage we can only ask that the \n     entire section 8 be deleted. We point out that FDA's \n     authority to establish different standards for non-systemic \n     drugs has been confirmed by the courts. See Schering Corp. v. \n     Food and Drug Administration, 51 F. 3d 390 (3rd Cir., 1995).\n       Provisions in the draft that served as the basis for \n     committee discussion were made available to the biotechnology \n     industry less than two days prior to markup. These provisions \n     would have an enormously negative impact on the property \n     rights of the emerging biotechnology industry and completely \n     upset the delicate balance between the interests of pioneer \n     and generic companies crafted by the Hatch-Waxman law. They \n     go far beyond the provisions of McCain-Schumer, which served \n     as the basis for the Edwards-Kennedy redraft; the late \n     release of the redraft made meaningful legal review and \n     comment impossible.\n       We urge you not to rush this bill to the Senate floor. The \n     implications of the changes being proposed by the Edwards-\n     Collins substitute are far reaching and will significantly \n     and adversely impact biotechnology companies. They would \n     severely diminish the incentives of the patent system for our \n     industry to develop newer, safer, easier to administer and \n     more effective drugs that could help patients lead better \n     lives. The changes being proposed, simply stated, will not \n     yield better results for patients or the biotechnology \n     industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carl B. Feldbaum,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have a \nsimilar letter from the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          Massachusetts Biotechnology Council,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, July 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, I request that you oppose S. 812, \n     legislation to alter the Hatch-Waxman Act. The bill raises \n     serious concerns for our Massachusetts Biotechnology Council \n     membership. I urge you to work on a more considered basis on \n     any effort to revise the carefully-balanced Hatch-Waxman \n     system.\n       I understand that under the reported bill, a patent owner \n     who for any reason fails to initiate litigation against a \n     generic drug applicant within 45 days of receiving notice \n     under the ANDA procedure will be barred from enforcing patent \n     rights in any forum against either the ANDA applicant or any \n     party that\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\n     manufactures, uses, sells or offers for sale the approved \n     drug product. In addition, a new drug applicant--who may not \n     even be the patent owner--who fails to list a patent with the \n     FDA within 30 days of approval of a new drug application, or \n     within 30 days of the grant of a patent if that occurs after \n     the NDA is approved, is similarly barred from enforcement of \n     patent rights on the drug against a generic manufacturer. \n     Either of these events will completely abolish patent rights \n     in new drugs or related technology.\n       The legislation also creates new opportunities for generic \n     drug makers to harass biotech companies through unnecessary \n     and pointless litigation. The reported bill would create a \n     private right of action to permit a generic manufacturer to \n     challenge these mandatory patent listings. The legislation \n     also would allow generic drug applicants to initiate this \n     litigation regardless of whether our companies or their \n     partners intend to assert their patent rights in the ANDA \n     process.\n       The proposal would codify fifteen pages of FDA regulations \n     governing ``bioequivalence'' requirements on both new drugs \n     and generics and would legislatively shield the FDA from \n     challenges to its actions in setting approval standards. In \n     essence, the proposed changes would make it impossible for \n     drug manufacturers, whether pioneer or generic, or members of \n     the public to challenge improper standards enacted by the \n     agency on key approval criteria, or to challenge improper \n     decisions made under valid authority. Moreover, the current \n     regulations include several provisions in which FDA provides \n     to itself unfettered discretion to create or define at will \n     any standard ``deemed adequate by FDA.'' This makes an \n     otherwise legitimate challenge to an agency decision \n     virtually impossible to sustain. Shielding the agency from \n     actions to challenge its proper authority simply makes no \n     sense, particularly when the consequences involve potential \n     risks to patients and to public health.\n       I urge you to oppose S. 812. The implications of the \n     changes being proposed are far reaching and will \n     significantly and adversely impact biotechnology companies. \n     They would severely diminish the incentives of the patent \n     system for our industry to develop newer, safer, easier to \n     administer and more effective drugs that could help patients \n     lead better lives. The changes, simply stated, will not yield \n     better results for patients or the biotechnology industry.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen Mulloney,\n       Director of Government Relations and Communications, \n     Massachusetts Biotechnology Council.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Biotechnology Organization represents \nover 1,000 biotechnology companies and their members all over the \ncountry and in every State. California, Massachusetts, and Maryland \nhave the highest concentration of biocompanies in the United States.\n  I think what people understand and what my colleagues understand is \nthat the biofield is a fairly new field. When I was in medical school, \nthese biotech companies were not out there. The drugs they are looking \nat today were nonexistent. For the most part, they are in their infancy \ntoday. Fifty years from now and looking back, we will see on the curve \nan increase that right now we are at the beginning of.\n  Of the 130 biotech drugs approved by the FDA, all were produced by \nfewer than 100 companies. As I just said, there are over 1,000 \nbiotechnology companies that exist today. What that means is, if you \nhave ten companies working at the early research stage to figure out \nwhat drug is going to cure HIV/AIDS, or reverse a certain case of \nemphysema or reverse that blood clot just about ready to cause a stroke \nin your brain, one company will ultimately produce an effective \nproduct. Many of these companies are small, emerging companies.\n  Look at Senator Kennedy's language on bioequivalence. That is the \nlanguage that will ultimately go into the bill.\n  These letters make clear the concerns raised by myself in committee \nand others during the Health, Education and Labor Committee markup. The \nbioequivalent language in the underlying bill has not been addressed.\n  You heard Senator Hatch's plea. Even if this bill sails through, \nplease listen to us and allow us to participate in changing that \nlanguage.\n  Let me just say that I also share the concerns of others about the \ncodification in this bill.\n  Let me quote from their letter only three sentences. This is from the \nbiocommunity.\n\n       . . . section 8 as currently drafted goes well beyond the \n     intended purpose of the provision. In essence, the proposed \n     changes would make it impossible for drug manufacturers, \n     whether pioneer or generic, or members of the public, to \n     challenge improper standards enacted by the agency on key \n     approval criteria, or to challenge improper decisions made \n     under valid authority. Moreover, the current regulations \n     include several provisions in which FDA provides to itself \n     unfettered discretion to create or define at will any \n     standard ``deemed adequate by FDA.'' This makes an \n     otherwise legitimate challenge to an agency decision \n     virtually impossible to sustain. Shielding the agency from \n     actions to challenge its proper authority simply makes no \n     sense, particularly when the consequences involve \n     potential risks to patients and to public health.\n\n  Bioequivalence--again, that is probably the last time I will be able \nto address this issue on the floor. It is a plea that we work together \nand come to an agreement so we do not accomplish a loosening of these \nstandards.\n  The Senator from Utah also mentioned the 30-month stay provisions.\n  Let me just say that this 30-month stay provision has served a very \nimportant purpose. If you look back at the legislation, which is \nconsistent with remarks from the Senator from Utah, you will see that \nthe 30-month stay is part of the balancing act between the brand name \npharmaceutical companies, which are heavily invested in R, and the \ncost-effective generic companies to achieve that balance, which we have \nseen is so important.\n  As I have said, it has been the magic over the last 16 to 18 years. \nWe need to be very careful when we start tinkering with that and \nwhether or not that goes too far in upsetting that balance.\n  I know and my colleagues know that there have been huge abuses by \nsome brand name companies versus the generic companies in our \ndiscussions. They have filed what are late patents. They file late \npatents that may not represent significant medical advances. Their \npurpose is because they saw the law written this way as simply to \nextend that 30-month stay protection period. And they are protected. \nWhen you have that sort of protection, obviously, it affects prices \nthroughout.\n\n  The legislation before us would treat patents, listed after a new \ndrug application is approved, differently than patents listed when a \nnew drug application is approved. Providing lower protections to \npatents at any point in time will have real implications in terms of \ninnovation, in terms of incentives to innovate as you develop new \nformulations and new aspects of drugs.\n  There are a whole slew of examples where these patents that are \nissued, not early on but later, could involve an important innovation. \nI will not go through the examples here today, but we have talked about \nthem in our Health, Education, Labor, Pension Committee.\n  So if you have a new drug here, a patent here, and you can improve on \nthat drug later in the life cycle, that improvement needs to be \nprotected in some way. Furthermore, you need to give a pharmaceutical \ncompany an incentive, which is what this patent protection is. That is \nwhat patents are all about: an incentive to look at a new formulation \nof that drug that could be important.\n  There was a question, a few minutes ago, about certain populations. \nFor example, this applies very specifically to the pediatric \npopulation. If you have a drug that can either be injected or be \napplied intravenously inside a vein, and you have a patent on that \ndrug, it would be nice to give somebody an incentive to make sure you \ncan use that same drug in a liquid formulation, to give them some \nincentive to develop that liquid formulation. And it may come later in \nthe cycle of that drug.\n  In fact, two weeks ago Dr. Tony Fauci of NIH was quoted in the New \nYork Times about the importance of developing an oral formulation of a \ndrug that was discovered as an injectable drug to treat HIV/AIDS. Forty \nmillion people in the world today with HIV/AIDS are struggling in \ncountries, such as in Africa, where two out of three of these cases are \ntoday. Many of my colleagues, on both sides of aisle, are trying to \nfigure out how we can link prevention, care, and treatment. The problem \nis, treatment today is just so expensive. So we want to incentivize \npeople to take an injectable drug, which is very difficult to \nadminister throughout Africa, and develop an oral formulation of that \nparticular drug.\n  Dr. Tony Fauci talked about the importance of developing and \npatenting an oral formulation of this drug. Unfortunately, that is the \nkind of new patent, on a previously discovered drug,\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nthat would be afforded less protection under this bill. When you afford \nsomething with less protection, it is true that fewer companies, fewer \npeople, are going to be interested in investing and figuring out that \nnew formulation.\n  Again, because the distinguished Senator from Illinois mentioned the \npediatric population, it brings to mind the fact that we worked very \nhard on what is called a pediatric exclusivity bill. We unanimously \npassed it in the Senate. It provides a market incentive for brand-name \ndrug companies to test certain drugs in the pediatric population. Many \nof us were cosponsors of that bill, and it unanimously passed in this \nbody. It provides a market incentive for brand-name drug companies to \ntest certain drugs for pediatric use for which the FDA issues a written \nrequest.\n  We gave certain protections. Now, all of a sudden, we are saying: \nWell, maybe or maybe not in the pediatric population. Let's lower the \nprotections that we are giving instead of increasing the protections--\nwhich was the intent of this body--and give less legal protection just \nbecause of the timing in which a patent was filed.\n  The issue is complex, as Senator Hatch has said. People say, you are \nbeing critical of it. You illustrate the problems. Are there better \napproaches? The answer is, yes, there are better approaches, to my \nmind, that I hope we will have the opportunity to debate.\n  One approach would be to not allow brand companies to automatically \nextend the 30-month stay for patents issued after the filing of what is \ncalled an abbreviated new drug application--what is called an ANDA--by \na generic company.\n  Another alternative would be to allow an additional 30-month stay \nonly for patents that were filed but not approved by the Patent and \nTrademark Office at the time of the NDA.\n  The impact of this would be to reduce incentives for brand companies \nto ``game'' the system, something that all of us want to avoid--\ncompanies coming in and trying to take advantage of whatever structure \nwe set up.\n  The fifth point that I want to bring up, in the hopes that we will be \nable to come back in some form to be able to address these issues, is \nthe broad bar on patent lawsuits. Senator Hatch also raised this point, \nfor the record.\n  I am troubled by provisions in the bill that cause patent holders to \nlose their rights to sue for infringement of a patent if the patent \nholder does not meet certain requirements, including these timing \nrequirements.\n  For example, a patent holder would lose its right to sue for \ninfringement if it does not submit appropriate patent information to \nFDA within the specified deadline, or if it does not bring an \ninfringement lawsuit within 45 days of receiving notice from the \ngeneric applicant that its patents are being challenged.\n  I believe this fundamental change, of which the Senator from Utah \nspoke, to the Hatch-Waxman law will force companies to bring more \nlitigation, not less litigation. In our hearing, we kept saying that we \nwant to see less litigation. It will force more companies to bring more \nlitigation to avoid the risk that otherwise they will waive their \nrights for all time.\n  If they do not sue, they are going to waive those rights for the \nfuture. That is a concern to me, especially as we are looking to \ndecrease the number of lawsuits and decrease overall cost.\n  In fact, as I understand it, this provision alters basic rights that \ngo with a patent, rights that give brand-name drug companies the \nincentives, as I mentioned earlier, to improve upon existing products.\n  I have to ask: What happens if a patent owner does not have a good-\nfaith basis to sue at some point in time, but later learns something \nthat would give him reason to sue for infringement? The answer is that \nthat patent holder is simply out of luck.\n  America's research institutions and academic medical centers would \nclearly suffer under the ``list-it-or-lose it'' or ``sue-or-suffer'' \nprovisions of this bill. Under these provisions, NDA holders are \nrequired to file patents that meet listing criteria whether or not they \nown or have a license under those patents. Under the bill, patent \nowners will be lose their rights to enforce their patents if the NDA \nholder fails to list, and the patent owners can do nothing about that \n(only NDA holders, not patent owners, have the ability to list \npatents).\n  For example, suppose Harvard University owns a patent on a drug \nsubstance discovered by one of its academic researchers. Normally \nHarvard would license that patent to a brand name pharmaceutical \ncompany that would develop the drug and submit an application for \napproval to the FDA. Under the bill before us, if that brand name \ncompany failed to list the patent within the arbitrary 30 day period, \nHarvard, the patent owner, would irreparably forfeit its ability to \nenforce its valuable patent rights against any generic drug applicant \nforever.\n  This is true even if a company completely unrelated to Harvard \ndevelops a drug that might potentially be claimed in a Harvard patent. \nUnder this approach, Harvard, which has not control over the timing of \nthe listing, would suffer a complete loss of its patents rights against \ngenerics without any recourse or ability to remedy the situation. That \nis both arbitrary and punitive.\n  While we are acting, in large part, over these next several days out \nof concerns over health care costs, as I mentioned before, the Senate \nhas no formal cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, or really any other credible source.\n  I mention that only because the overall assumption--and what we would \nall like--is that whatever we pass here will ultimately bring costs \ndown. But we do not have any outside independent evaluation of that.\n  While we are acting aggressively to curb past abuses, we do not have \nthe benefit, as you have heard from Senator Hatch and myself today, of \nthe ongoing information that is being compiled by the Federal Trade \nCommission. The FTC has been specifically charged with the \ninvestigation of potential abuses by brands and generics. I believe and \nI am confident this report will provide crucial additional information. \nAs Senator Hatch has said: We just simply don't have the facts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues. Again, \nSenator Hatch and I have spent a long time outlining our concerns, in \nlarge part, because I do not think we are going to be in the climate--I \nknow we are going to other very important amendments about extending \nprescription drug coverage to seniors--that each of these very \ntechnical issues are going to be able to be adequately debated, but \nalso to write in language that would fulfill the intentions on the \nfloor, and that we are going to reach out and hopefully have that \nopportunity to work together on these.\n  I will likely end up, for the reasons I have outlined, voting against \nthis underlying base legislation, despite the good work and the \nincremental advantages that have been added to this bill by Senators \nCollins--and I mentioned most of them--Edwards, Gregg, Hutchinson, and \nmany of my colleagues.\n  The bottom line is, the balance is critical. Balance has been \nachieved to a very successful degree, much better than I would think \nanybody would have anticipated in 1984 from the Hatch-Waxman \nlegislation. It is the magic as to why it has worked. It is why we have \nseen this proliferation of generic drugs and, at the same time, \npreserving the innovation and research.\n  What I am afraid is that in the legislation as written, we have gone \ntoo far. Going too far could indeed have a detrimental impact on \nresearch and innovation and the public good, without providing the cost \nsavings promised by its supporters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before I am \nrecognized to speak, the Senator from Missouri be recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, over the next 2 weeks, the Senate will address an \nissue that Americans have come to understand far too well--the high \nprice of prescription drugs. We need to do all we can to lower the \nprice of prescription drugs for consumers.\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\n  Senator Stabenow's amendment is one example of a concrete action the \nSenate can take. Her amendment would give the State the flexibility to \nnegotiate Medicaid drug discounts for non-Medicaid-eligible \nindividuals. This amendment would help lower prices for all consumers. \nI am a cosponsor of the amendment and encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  We need to do much more. We need to pass the underlying Schumer-\nMcCain legislation. Today, pharmaceutical companies are making historic \nprofits while average Americans are paying historic prices. Let's look \nat those profits.\n  Earlier this year, Fortune magazine did a comparison of U.S. \nindustries to see how profitable they were in the past year. The \npharmaceutical industry ranked No. 1 in all three of Fortune's \nprofitability measures. Almost 20 percent of its revenues were profits.\n  But now let's look at the prices. In 2001, the prices of the 50 \nprescription drugs used most often by seniors increased on the average \nby nearly three times the rate of inflation. For example, Lipitor, \nwhich is used to treat high cholesterol, rose 13.5 percent, more than \nfive times the rate of inflation. Paxil, which is used to treat \ndepression, rose 11.6 percent. And Celebrex, used to treat arthritis, \nrose 10.4 percent. For seniors who are living on a fixed income, the \nhigh price of prescription drugs means making tough choices every day \nbetween lifesaving medication and food and rent and heat.\n  The No. 1 issue which I hear about in Missouri from our seniors is \nprescription drugs. Whether people live in urban or rural or suburban \nareas, they are all feeling the pain of high prices.\n  Recently, I visited the Terrace Retirement Community in Columbia, MO. \nWhile I was there, I led a roundtable on the topic of prescription \ndrugs. If you could have heard some of those stories. They were \ndefinitely heart wrenching.\n  One of the women I met that day in Columbia was Annie Gardner. She is \nan impressive 63-year-old mother of five children, but she suffers from \ndiabetes and high blood pressure. Her hardship began after taking a \nbuyout from her employer. In this transaction she lost her health \ninsurance and was not able to afford insurance on the private market. \nThis left her unable to afford her prescriptions. Often she had to \nration them by taking half the prescribed amount so it would last \nlonger.\n  Ms. Gardner knows how dangerous this can be because she is a licensed \npractical nurse and has been for 40 years. Later, she had to quit \npurchasing the drugs entirely because of other expenses, such as fixing \nher car and paying increased taxes on her home. Ms. Gardner and \nthousands like her make these tough life-threatening decisions every \nday. But no one should have to make those kinds of decisions.\n  Seniors are not the only ones who have been hit hard. For far too \nmany families, the cost of prescription drugs is a budget buster. \nWorking families without health insurance are paying the highest price \nof all because they do not get the benefits of the negotiated \ndiscounts. This issue also hits employers. They absorb the cost of high \nprescription drug prices in the health benefit packages they provide to \ntheir employees.\n\n  For example, last year General Motors spent $1.3 billion for \nprescription drugs for its employees and retirees. This problem has \nreached such a crisis that companies, including General Motors, have \njoined the Governors to form the Business for Affordable Medicine \nCoalition. Their key issue is the one we are debating today--closing \nthe loopholes in the current law so that generic drugs can compete \nfairly with brand name drugs.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is considering ways to close these \nloopholes with the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act. I \napplaud Senators Schumer and McCain for authorizing this legislation. \nI, too, am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill.\n  It is imperative that we close these loopholes in current law that \nprevents generics from coming on the market. Generics cost on the \naverage one-third the price of brand name drugs. Generics bring \ncompetition into the market and lowers the price for drugs for all \nAmericans.\n  When a brand name drug is under patent, its manufacturer enjoys a \nmonopoly. One company sells the drug; one company sets the prices. Now \nI support patents for drugs. Patents are there for a legitimate \nreason--to allow companies to recoup the cost of research and \ndevelopment that they invest in creating the drugs. But drug companies \nare abusing loopholes under the current law and extending their \nmonopoly on prices sometimes for years at a time.\n  A 1-year delay in a generic coming to market can translate into \nhundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the brand name company. \nIn 1984, Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman act. This act was intended to \nstrike a balance, a balance between brand name drug companies being \ncompensated for their investments and generic companies eventually \nhaving access to the market. But the original purpose of the law has \nbeen distorted.\n  The law is now being used to extend patent protections far beyond \nwhat Congress intended. Balance needs to be restored. American \ntaxpayers deserve better than what they are getting.\n  Over the next 5 years, a remarkable 26.7 percent of the entire 2001 \npharmaceutical market is scheduled to face exposure to generic \ncompetition. If generics are allowed to come on the market, it would \nmean more choices and lower prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Missouri with the consent of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Generics can save consumers over 60 percent per \nprescription. Here are some examples of brand name drugs whose patents \nare supposed to expire in the next few years. Listen to the numbers on \nwhat consumers should be expected to save.\n  The patent on Claritin, an allergy medication, is scheduled to expire \nin December. Annual savings after the generic becomes available are \nexpected to be over $500 million. The patent on Zocor, a cholesterol-\nlowering drug, is scheduled to expire in December 2005. The annual \nsavings after the generic becomes available is expected to be about \n$735 million. The patent on Zoloft, a drug for depression, is scheduled \nto expire in December 2005. The annual savings after the generic \nbecomes available is expected to be $577 million.\n  However, given the amount of money that is at stake, pharmaceutical \ncompanies have a lot of incentive to delay generics from coming on the \nmarket. Unfortunately, current law allows them to do this.\n  If we in this Congress have the courage to act, American consumers \nwill save billions of dollars. If we don't, the money will go directly \nfrom the pocketbooks of American families and on to the profit \nstatements of the drug companies.\n  Congress must move on yet another front. We will soon be considering \na historic addition to the Medicare Program, a prescription drug \nbenefit. The legislation I am supporting would create an affordable and \naccessible benefit administered through the Medicare Program.\n  This Senate plan is simple. Assistance begins with the first \nprescriptions. There are no gaps or limits on coverage, and seniors \nwill pay $10 for generic drugs and $40 for brand name drugs. There is \ncertainty and there is stability.\n  The House bill is the complete opposite. It is complicated. There is \na $250 deductible before seniors get relief. There are months where \nseniors have to pay a premium, but they would not get assistance with \ntheir drug costs. Under the House plan, seniors will pay approximately \na $35-a-month premium but still pay the full price at the drugstore.\n  The House Republican plan would require seniors to use drug HMOs to \nget their benefit. However, there are no guarantees that private plans \nwould provide a benefit in all geographic areas, or that a plan would \neven stay in business.\n  Look at what has happened with Medicare+Choice, Medicare's HMO. Since \n1998, nationwide, 2.2 million Medicare enrollees have lost \nMedicare+Choice as an option because of plans withdrawn from the \nmarket. In Missouri, from 1998 to 2001, eight health plans stopped \nproviding Medicare+Choice options in the State.\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nFurthermore, some options are available in only urban centers and not \nin rural areas.\n  Why would we rely on this same type of system to give prescription \ndrug coverage to rural areas?\n  To me, what the House passed is unacceptable. It is an incomplete \nbenefit with absolutely no effort to lower drug prices. It is \nunacceptable for Missouri's seniors and unacceptable for American \nseniors. We must do better in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri. The \nSenator spelled out in amazing detail what this debate is about. We \ncome to this floor understanding that a miracle has taken place in \nterms of health care in America within the lifetime of most of us. When \nthis Senate considered the Medicare bill back in the 1960s, there was a \nvery limited formula, a limited number of prescription drugs that were \navailable, and they did not include in Medicare the coverage of \nprescription drugs.\n  Look at what has happened since then. There has been a massive \ninvestment by the Government, the taxpayers, and by private industry, \nand we have seen emerging from that brandnew pharmaceuticals that give \nus the hope of conquering diseases that have plagued mankind forever. \nThis new formulary, ever-expanding, has created a new demand. Of \ncourse, it is a demand brought on by people who want to save their own \nlives as well as those of their family members. It is a demand that is \nmonitored by doctors; a doctor will decide whether this particular drug \nis right for this patient at this moment.\n  But at the same time that this miraculous evolution was taking place, \nthe cost of these pharmaceuticals was also rising geometrically, to the \npoint that today many average Americans cannot afford the very \nprescription that their doctor believes will keep them healthy and out \nof the hospital. So many of them put off filling a prescription and \nmaybe take half of what they are supposed to take or they have to make \na sacrifice--whether it is food, shelter, or paying a utility bill--in \norder to pay for their drugs.\n  There has been a demand growing in America for the Congress to \nrespond and to expand the Medicare Program again so we would include \nprescription drugs. That is something that is worthy and is supported \nby Democrats and Republicans and Independents.\n  When you come down to the specific challenge of making it work, one \nof the biggest problems you face is price. If the cost of prescription \ndrugs continues to grow, as it has in the past, there is no way any of \nus in the Senate or in the House can devise a Government program to pay \nfor it and to keep up with that cost. Last year, the cost of \nprescription drugs across America went up some 18 percent. You cannot \ncreate a Government program and fund it properly that will keep up with \nthat kind of geometric growth in price.\n  So there are various ways we can address it. To the north of us, \nCanada has addressed it with a national health system. We can argue \nback and forth about whether doctors or hospitals should be Government \nemployees, but when it comes to prescription drugs, what Canada said to \nthe drug companies in America is: If you want to sell your product in \nCanada, we will bargain with you as to how much you will be paid. The \nAmerican drug companies said: Fine, let's start the bargaining process. \nAs a result of that bargaining process, there are dramatic differences \nin the price of drugs between the United States and Canada.\n  If you look at this chart and go through the drug names, you will \nrecognize some of them. These are the drugs that you find advertised on \ntelevision, on radio, in newspapers, and in magazines almost on a daily \nbasis. Celebrex, for arthritis, goes for $135 for 90 doses in the \nUnited States. In Canada, the same drug, same dosage, and the same \ncompany, it is $83. Lipitor, for cholesterol, is $266 in the United \nStates and $179 in Canada. Nexium, for ulcers--the little purple pill, \nI think it is--is $344 in the United States and $219 in Canada. Paxil, \nwhich we have seen ads for, is for depression and anxiety; it is $236 \nin the United States and $152 in Canada. The list goes on. There is \nPremarin, Prevacid, Vioxx, Zocor, Zoloft--all the names we are familiar \nwith because of advertising.\n\n  The lesson to be learned is that when the Canadian Government said \nthey were going to bargain for the good of people living in Canada, \nthey started saving money for their people and their health system. \nWhat is missing in this picture? There is nobody in the U.S. who is \nbargaining for the American consumer.\n  Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum, argued that is just a price Americans \nhave to pay. It is our responsibility, as he argues, to subsidize the \nprofitability and growth of American drug companies. The fact that \nthese same drugs are costing a fraction--the exact same drugs--in \ncountries around Europe, Canada, and Mexico, he believes is just part \nof their socialized Government-controlled system.\n  I can tell you from the U.S. consumer's point of view, it is cold \ncomfort to be told that for a drug you have to pay 40, 50 percent more \nthan someone living a few miles over the border in Canada because it is \nyour burden to subsidize American pharmaceutical companies. But that is \nthe argument being made by those who are opposing many of the issues \nbefore us today.\n  Now, Canada isn't the only entity bargaining with American drug \ncountries. Mexico and a lot of European countries bargain and say: If \nyou want to come into our health system and sell your drug in our \ncountry, we are going to reach an agreement as to what you can charge; \notherwise, you are not welcome. Well, the companies, by and large, have \nall agreed to do exactly that--enter into this agreement and reduce \ndrug costs in every country but the United States.\n  In the United States, there are certain elements within our society \nthat have bargaining power with the drug companies. A couple of \nexamples come to mind immediately. The Veterans Administration, on \nbehalf of America's veterans and hospitals, bargain with drug companies \nto bring down the cost of drugs. I am glad. The veterans benefit from \nit. Indian Health Service, the same story; Public Health Service, the \nsame story. Many States, through Medicaid, bargain in terms of bringing \ndown the cost of drugs. When you look at it, private insurance \ncompanies reach these same bargains. They say to a drug company: If you \nwant to have an eligible drug for the people we insure, we are going to \nbargain on a price that we think is acceptable. That bargaining takes \nplace to the benefit of another group of Americans.\n  If you look at the population of this country, who is being left out \nin the cold? I will tell you. The first group you will notice is \nMedicare recipients, people over the age of 65. No one is bargaining \nfor them. These people, retired and on fixed incomes, are paying the \nhighest prices, not only in America but in the world, for drugs that \nare being made in the United States. High prices, of course, apply to \nmany other families as well.\n  There are several ways we can approach this. We can decide that, as a \nsociety and as a government, we are going to negotiate on behalf of \nAmerican consumers, the same way it is done in other countries around \nthe world. Well, we have not quite reached that decision. Instead, we \nare trying to inch toward more competition and price justice. I salute \nthe Schumer-McCain bill--the underlying bill--because this bill says we \nare going to try to make certain that generic drugs continue to play a \nmajor role in terms of providing the kinds of protections that \nAmericans need.\n\n  Generic drugs have come a long way in America. We have seen, in a \nvery short period of time, that they have become a substantial part of \nserving America's health needs. Almost 40 percent of the drugs today \nare generic drugs.\n  What is the difference between a brand named drug and a generic drug? \nWell, by classic definition, a brand name drug is under patent \nprotection exclusivity. Only one company can make that drug. But when \nthe patent runs out, expires, other companies can move in and use the \nexact same formula, make the same drug, and the price drops \ndramatically.\n  I will give you an illustration of how it works. I doubt there is a \nperson in\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nAmerica who hasn't heard of Claritin, made by the Scherling-Plough drug \ncompany. The ad shows people skipping through a field of wildflowers \nsaying, I am not sneezing, so go to the doctor and tell him you need \nClaritin. Scherling-Plough spent more money advertising that drug than \nPepsi-Cola spent advertising Pepsi in a given year or Anheuser-Busch \nspent advertising Budweiser. They wanted the Americans to develop an \nappetite for this drug Claritin. Then they got panicky because the \npatent was running out because then someone else could make a Claritin \ngeneric drug at a fraction of the cost. So they would come to Congress \nand try to find, at the midnight hour, a way to slip in an amendment to \nextend their patent another few months or years. We fought them back \ntime and again.\n  And Scherling-Plough wasn't the only group trying to do that. What we \nhave seen happen now is Claritin is coming off patent and the generic \ndrugs are going to compete. Scherling-Plough is thinking: What are we \ngoing to do?\n  What did they do? They tweaked a molecule in Claritin and created a \nnew allergy drug called Clarinex. Have you seen it on TV? It will soon \nbe coming to a television near and dear to you. Now they want to create \nthis appetite for Clarinex because it is back at the price they used to \ncharge for Claritin. The odd thing is, if you had asked, many doctors \nfrom the start would have told you that over-the-counter drugs are as \neffective as Claritin or Clarinex will be ever be for most Americans.\n  The point I am making is, when you are talking about generic drugs, \nyou are talking about affordable drugs for Americans. You are talking \nabout giving them the same type of drugs, bioequivalent, as those under \nbrand name and patents, and making certain they save money in the \nprocess. Senator Schumer and Senator McCain are trying to eliminate \nsome of the abuses as drugs come off patent and move toward generic so \nconsumers can enjoy that benefit.\n  Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, by a vote of 69 to 30, we \nadopted an amendment by Senator Dorgan. Senator Dorgan of North Dakota \nsaid he finds it strange that in Canada, the exact same drug made by \nthe same American company subject to the same inspection sells for a \nfraction of the cost, and why shouldn't we be allowed to reimport these \ndrugs from Canada for the benefit of American consumers?\n  They came here on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry and said it \nis an invitation to terrorism; you are going to bring in counterfeit \ndrugs. One of my colleagues said he had a formula he was holding up \nthat was made out of highway paint. I could not follow the debate very \nclosely, but the suggestion is that drug that moved across the border \nis, all of a sudden, suspect when it comes back.\n  I wanted to ask the critics of the Dorgan amendment why, if we have \nbusload after busload of Americans going into Canada buying these \ndrugs, if there is such a danger, why have we not heard some scandalous \nreport about people dropping dead on the buses or as soon as they got \nhome? It has not happened. It will not happen.\n  In the Senate, by a vote of 69 to 30, we decided to create another \nopportunity, beyond generic drugs, for reimportation of drugs from \nCanada, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nin terms of their safety and the fact they save us money. That was a \nstep forward.\n  Today, I am happy to be a cosponsor of an amendment presently before \nthe Senate which, frankly, has not been discussed for about 3 hours. I \nhave listened to the debate on the floor, and no one has discussed this \namendment by Senator Stabenow.\n  The last two speakers on the Republican side, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Frist, spoke to the generic drug part of the bill, but they are \nnot addressing this bill which I think is a good one by Senator \nStabenow.\n  What this bill says is that States across the Nation, such as Maine, \nVermont, even the State of Illinois, can decide they want to try to \nbargain with the drug companies to bring down prices for everyone \nliving in the State. What is wrong with that? If we are letting it be \ndone in Canada and Mexico, the Veterans' Administration, private \ninsurance companies, the Indian Health Service, why shouldn't a State \ntry to find drug prices more affordable for the people living there? \nThat is what the amendment says. It is as simple and straightforward as \nthat. It is another opportunity for us to put some competition in drug \npricing and to give consumers a break when it comes to paying for the \npharmaceuticals they need to survive.\n\n  I think this amendment moves us in the right direction. It is sad \nthat, once again, we are looking for another alternative to national \naction. That is what we need in this situation. We can think of a dozen \ndifferent ways to reduce prices--by where you live, what State, whether \nyou happen to be a veteran, whether you happen to have access to \nCanada. But shouldn't we as a nation address this in a straightforward \nfashion, understanding that the drug companies are in business to make \na profit?\n  I will concede that point, but for the last 10 years, when one takes \na look at the profitability of drug companies, one finds that it is \nabout 19 percent a year on average. The median income and profitability \nof Fortune 500 companies during the same period of time is 3.3 percent. \nDrug companies are extremely profitable, and they are selling more and \nmore drugs at higher prices and driving up that profitability.\n  We also believe that you should have enough money at a drug company \nto put money back into research--capital investment in research for new \ndrugs. It is obvious. It is not only a question of making a profit, it \nis a question of finding that next generation of drugs to improve the \nlives of Americans. I think that is a very valid thing to do.\n  Senator Stabenow will not be offering the amendment I cosponsored \nwith her that said those companies that are spending more money on \nadvertising than they are on research ought to be held to only \ndeducting the amount of money equivalent to what they spent on research \nfor their advertising. I think that is reasonable, too. It calls the \nbluff of a lot of companies that say: We need to be more profitable for \nresearch. They need to be more profitable for more advertising, \nadvertising creating many times a false appetite.\n  I stand today in support of this legislation on generic drugs. I \nbelieve it is a step in the right direction. The average price paid for \na prescription for a brand name drug is about three times the amount of \nthat paid for generics. The average consumer pays 238 percent more for \nbrand name drugs, an average of $45.96.\n  Last year, 47 percent of all prescriptions were filled with generic \ndrugs. Remember, the doctor makes the ultimate decision. If the doctor \nhappens to believe a brand name drug is better for you or your family \nbecause of some situation, some peculiarity, that is the doctor's call, \nbut having generic drugs available gives that doctor a choice and gives \nyou a chance to find an affordable alternative for safe and efficacious \ntreatment.\n  The underlying bill on generics is sound. I supported the \nreimportation amendment and stand in strong support of flexibility for \nStates to act, which Senator Stabenow has submitted and which I am \nhappy to cosponsor. Let us give to the States the opportunity to reduce \nprices so people can benefit from this competition and bargaining and \nstill remain healthy.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois may yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe I have the floor, and I have agreed to yield to \nthe Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Iowa is in a \nhurry. Maybe I can ask unanimous consent I be recognized immediately \nafter he finishes instead of yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from New York does not have a question, I \nwill be happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Is there objection to the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what was the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York wishes to speak for \n5 minutes immediately following the remarks of the Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nIs there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am so glad we are in a position where \nwe are able to discuss these very important prescription drug issues, \nincluding a prescription drug program for senior citizens as part of \nMedicare.\n  I am also glad that we are in a position on the floor of the Senate \nwhere we are divided in a traditional way, and in that traditional way, \nI do not mean just Republican and Democrat because too often that is \noverplayed.\n  We are divided between a group of Senators. First of all, I think we \nmay not have 100 Senators who favor a prescription drug program for \nsenior citizens, but I surely believe that we have 85 Senators who \nbelieve that we should have a prescription drug program for senior \ncitizens as part of the modernization of Medicare.\n  Within that 85, I suggest we have some traditional division--division \nbetween those who have only confidence in the Government running the \nprogram and those, including myself, who have some confidence in the \nGovernment but not enough to believe that drug prices are going to be \nkept minimal through Government control so that we have confidence in \nthe competition of the marketplace to reduce the price of drugs.\n  We are going to find over the next several days, as we continue to \ndebate this legislation and hopefully bring it to culmination and pass \na bill so we answer the concerns of our senior citizens who sometimes \nhave to choose between food or medicine--and they should not have to \nmake that choice--that we will have a prescription drug program as part \nof Medicare.\n  During that debate, I hope the American public listening will \nconsider, do they have confidence in the Government running a program \nor in the private sector and the competition of the private sector \nkeeping down prices?\n  Quite frankly, I believe when the Government is involved, we are \ngoing to run up the price of drugs. I think I can give evidence from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scoring arm of the \nCongress, to that effect. I can also give evidence that if we have a \nprogram for senior citizens that has competition in it--in other words \ndifferent organizations competing for membership of seniors and, in \nturn, competing for the lowest possible price with the \npharmaceuticals--we are going to bring down the price of pharmaceutical \nmedicines.\n  Since 1965, the Medicare Program has provided lifesaving health care \nservices to our Nation's seniors and disabled populations. Hundreds of \nmillions of Americans have had their quality of life improved and their \nhealth protected because of this Medicare Program. So we must ensure \nthat Medicare continues the exemplary service it has provided \nbeneficiaries since its inception in 1965, and through these program \nchanges, including prescription drugs, improve it vastly.\n  Unfortunately, we have a situation that this is necessary because \nMedicare has not kept up with the advances in medical treatment. \nMedical advances in delivering health care have moved us light-years \nbeyond 1965, but the Medicare Program has not changed to reflect those \nhealth care advances. So in order to ensure that Medicare is meeting \nthe needs of today's and tomorrow's seniors, the program needs to be \nbrought into the 21st century.\n  Very few people drive 1965 automobiles today, but every senior \ncitizen is using a 1965 model of Medicare. So that is why, after a year \nof work, I introduced, with Senators Snowe, Breaux, Jeffords, and \nHatch, a bipartisan bill--or if you look at the political backgrounds \nof all five, a tripartisan bill. Our 21st Century Medicare Act, as we \nhave named it, is designed to bring Medicare up to date by adding a \ncomprehensive prescription drug program and by making other \nimprovements in the program as well. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas estimated our bill will cost $370 billion over 10 years.\n  Now there are other proposals. Senator Daschle, from the other side \nof the aisle, has a bill. As I understand it, it has not yet been \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office. How much does it cost? I \nhave heard figures from introducers of that legislation, maybe $450 \nbillion, maybe $600 billion. We need to know what these programs are \ngoing to cost before we vote for them.\n  I want to take a moment and walk my colleagues through the elements \nof the 21st Century Medicare Act. First, the prescription drug benefit \nadds a comprehensive, voluntary, and permanent drug benefit to \nMedicare. Our monthly premium is $24. It is the lowest premium of any \ncomprehensive proposal before the Congress, as the authors of those \nproposals have expressed what their premium is. Our drug benefit is \nfocused on providing money where it is needed most--to the low-income \nsenior citizen who has to choose in some instances between food and \nmedicine. They will no longer have to make that choice.\n  It also targets those who have very high out-of-pocket expenses. Some \npeople might refer to that as catastrophic coverage. We have other \nnames for it, but I think we know that we are trying to protect people \nwhere the sky is falling in on them because of the need for \nprescription drugs.\n\n  I will describe for seniors with low incomes what this would do, \nstarting with those below 135 percent of poverty. That would be about a \n$12,000 yearly income individually, about $16,000 a year income for a \ncouple. Medicare will first pay the entire amount of their monthly drug \npremiums, no out-of-pocket expenses for them buying into the program.\n  Secondly, Medicare will assist them in paying for drugs at every \nlevel of spending. They will pay only $1 to $2 for their prescriptions. \nOn average, this group of low-income, older people will see a 98 \npercent reduction in their total drug costs, another example of one not \nhaving to choose between food or medicine because they are low-income.\n  Next we would look at seniors with incomes above 135 percent of \npoverty but below 150 percent of poverty. This includes individuals \nwith income a little bit over $13,000 and couples with income of almost \n$18,000. These enrollees will receive Medicare assistance on a sliding \nscale based upon their income to help pay their monthly premium to get \ninto the program, and also Medicare will assist them in paying for \ndrugs at every level of expenditure. There is no gap for these \nbeneficiaries below 150 percent poverty.\n  Let us look at those with incomes above 150 percent of poverty, which \nis above $18,000 for a couple. They will pay an average monthly premium \nof $24 for their immediate care drug benefit--again, the lowest of any \npremiums that have been announced by other authors that we know about. \nThey will pay a $250 deductible, and after they have reached the \ndeductible, Medicare will cover 50 percent of their drug costs up to \nthe benefit level of $3,450 in total drug spending. Furthermore, \nMedicare will cover 90 percent of all drug costs after beneficiaries \nhave paid $3,700 out of their pocket for drugs.\n  Let me say a bit more about our drug benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries above 150 percent of poverty. That is the group I just \ndescribed. First, I wish we did not have a gap in coverage between \n$3,450 and $3,700, but the problem is that we are working within a \nlimited amount of money--$370 billion--which is about halfway between \nthe President's program for seniors and, let us say, the other \nprominent plan before the Senate, the Democrat plan. We are about in \nthe middle. We have adopted a policy of using funds to benefit the \nlargest possible number of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those \nwith low incomes, as I have demonstrated.\n  So helping low-income people as opposed to doing more with incomes a \nlittle bit higher, it requires some sort of a trade-off, and we have \nopted to help lower income and to help less the further up the line one \ngoes. It is important to point out and to stress that even with these \ntrade-offs, fully 80 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries will spend \nless than the initial benefit limit or will have access to low-income \nprotections and therefore will have no gap in the coverage. The \npercentage, again, is 80 percent.\n\n  In the jargon of Washington, DC--and I know our constituents get \ntired of hearing Washington talk; we need to talk Iowa talk, but for my \ncolleagues, that means 80 percent of the seniors in America under our \nplan will not be touched by what we call the doughnut hole. For the 20 \npercent of enrollees exposed to this gap in coverage, our bill\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\nrequires that Medicare drug plans pass negotiated drug discounts along \nto Medicare enrollees all the time. All of those enrollees will be able \nto purchase drugs at a reduced price.\n  Everyone is going to benefit from this legislation. Our bill may \ninclude this small doughnut hole, but proposals from the other side of \nthe aisle seem to me to include a black hole since this drug benefit \nends in 2010, leaving Medicare enrollees without any drug benefit \nwhatever.\n  Again, when we talk about legislation, if it comes to an end, we say \nthat is a sunset. It is my understanding that the proposal from the \nother side has a sunset; in other words, a time when the benefit will \nend unless Congress reenacts it. Seniors are not going to sunset. \nSeniors are going to continue to need prescription drugs after this \nother proposal sunsets.\n  One of the disputes is lack of understanding of our benefit delivery \nsystem. I heard my colleagues describe how we arrived at the approach \nto delivering drugs, as the tripartisan bill does. That reminds me, I \nwant to say another thing because I think we forget how things get \ndone. No Republican plan can get through the Senate. No Democratic plan \ncan get through the Senate. A Republican plan can get through the House \nof Representatives because that is the way that system runs and the \nmajority party rules with an iron hand. There is a Republican plan that \ngot through the House. There is a Democrat plan in the House that \nobviously did not pass the House. We got the President's program that \nis obviously a Republican program because we have a Republican \nPresident. We have a Senate Democrat plan. We do not have a Senate \nRepublican plan, but we have a Senate bipartisan plan. That is the only \nway we will get anything through the Senate, and that is a bipartisan \napproach.\n  Getting back to how did we settle upon our delivery system for the \nprescription drug program for Medicare, we have been working for \nseveral months, to my chagrin, too many months, with the CBO to work \nthrough policy and what a certain policy would cost and changing \npolicy--not basic policy but fine-tuning our policy from time to time \nto fit the realities of what CBO says.\n  The CBO is important in this process. It is an independent, \nnonpartisan congressional staff office that analyzes legislative \nproposals for costs on the one hand and workability on the other hand. \nThe CBO does not have any ax to grind. And they had better not. And we \nin Congress rely on that. They are the bible for a lot of decisions \nmade, particularly budget decisions.\n  According to CBO, spending on drugs for seniors over the next decade \nwill grow at an astronomical rate. Over the next 10 years, there will \nbe a steep rise in the price of pharmaceuticals. The CBO said the only \nway to contain the cost of a drug benefit is to ensure that drugs are \ndelivered efficiently. In turn, the CBO says the only way to have drugs \ndelivered efficiently is to have true competition, two or \nmore organizations competing with the drug prices to get the prices \ndown, as opposed to the other program I am talking about that relies on \na government-run program. I quote the CBO that a government-run program \nwill not bring down the price of drugs but one where there is true \ncompetition. We have a delivery system based on true competition.\n\n  According to CBO, this requires that we must use private plans that \nassume a reasonable degree of risk; in other words, some risk on the \norganization to make sure it is efficiently run, to see there is \ncompetition, as opposed to a government-run program where risk in \npricing of drugs is assumed by the government. What I mean by risk is, \nif they are efficient, they will make money and, if not, they will lose \nmoney. If they drive hard bargains with drug manufacturers, they will \nmake money. If not, they will lose money.\n  A limited degree of risk is all the tripartisan bill requires. People \nwill ask, What sort of risk do you have if there is going to be a 75-\npercent subsidy for the Medicare prescription drug plans in our \nprogram? Because the Federal Government is protecting that 75 percent. \nWe are told by CBO that at 25-percent risk we will be assured this \nlevel of risk is high enough to promote sufficient drug coverage and \nlow enough to assure that plans participate in a stable, reliable drug \nsystem. It is the optimal level of risk.\n  Insurers who are so unhappy with the House bill in 2000 have \nindicated they can live with the level of risk in our bill. They would \nbe crazy not to participate.\n  Our opponents are saying if the Federal Government lays $340 billion \non the table, by far the largest entitlement expansion ever, plans will \nnot participate. Where do our opponents get that? Flatout, according to \nthe CBO, they are wrong. CBO says the insurers themselves say they are \nwrong. Most importantly, common sense says they are wrong. \nUnfortunately for our opponents, no one has invented a prescription \ndrug that gives you common sense.\n  We need to make the dollars we have go as far as we can. Whatever our \nindividual thoughts, the CBO in this case is an arbiter, and they tell \nus our bill, the 21st Century Act, does that; in other words, it keeps \nthe cost of medicine down, guarantees the participation of those \nagencies to deliver the drugs.\n  Now, I know the Presiding Officer is from a rural State. I will \naddress the question of whether the system the bill will establish will \nwork in rural areas. Even if you are from Atlanta, there are a lot of \nrural areas in Georgia, so you ought to be asking, will we take care of \nrural areas? If you are in Montana or North Dakota, it is probably even \nmore of a concern. I represent a rural State--maybe not the most rural \nState--and I would not support a Medicare drug bill that would put the \nrural parts of our Nation in jeopardy of not receiving equal access to \nprescription drugs under the same conditions as people in New York \nCity.\n\n  Our bill guarantees that every Medicare enrollee will have a choice \nof at least two Medicare drug plans, a minimum of two. The Government \nwill establish service areas for plans to offer Medicare drug benefits. \nThese service areas must be the size of a State at a minimum. They can \nbe multistate but at least the size of a State.\n  I stress that because you hear from the other side that plans will \ncherry-pick. You are not going to cherry-pick in the State of Iowa. You \nhave to serve Des Moines just as you have to serve Armstrong, IA.\n  Another point I want to make concerns pharmacists. Pharmacists play a \nvery important role in prescription drug programs for seniors. Not only \nthat, but as we have increasing use of drugs, and seniors taking \nmultiple prescriptions, and the interaction of those, pharmacists are \ngoing to play an even more important role. They are going to be needed \nto protect--I don't know whether the word ``protect'' is right--but \noversee, to some extent, when prescription drugs are given, how they \ninteract. Maybe a doctor won't be on top of that. You might have a \nperson who gets a prescription from two different doctors. Are they \ngoing to interact? The focal point for that determination might be the \npharmacist--ought to be the pharmacist, and will be. So there is going \nto be an increasing need for pharmacists.\n  Another thing I want to point out about the legislation is our \nassurance that Medicare beneficiaries will have convenient access to a \nbrick-and-mortar pharmacy. The standards outlining what is convenient \nwill be determined by our Department of HHS. Furthermore, in developing \nconvenient access standards, our Department is explicitly required to \ntake into account Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas.\n  We ought to consider consumer protection, so I will address that as \nour bill does. Our drug benefit proposal puts into place important \nconsumer protections for our Medicare enrollees.\n  By the way, one of the things I didn't say that the CBO said about \nours, we will have 99 percent of the seniors taking advantage of this \nprogram. That is how high the enrollment is going to be.\n  First, in regard to consumer protections, all Medicare drug plans \nwill be put through a comprehensive approval process to ensure they \nwill deliver quality drug benefits to seniors. The new Medicare \ncompetitive agency in the Federal Department of Health and Human \nServices will have to review and approve the application of the plan \nbefore that plan can participate in the program.\n  Standardized information on each drug plan will be sent by Health and\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\nHuman Services to all Medicare enrollees. If a Medicare drug plan wants \nto advertise for enrollees, all marketing material will have to be \napproved by HHS. All seniors will have access to necessary prescription \ndrugs. Health and Human Services will determine therapeutic classes of \ndrugs. Medicare drug plans will be required to offer drugs in all \ntherapeutic classes.\n  If Medicare drug plans use formularies, they must establish a \npharmacy and therapeutic committee to develop and review the formulary. \nPhysicians and pharmacists must be represented on that committee. The P \nand T Committee shall base formulary decisions on scientific evidence \nand on standards of practice.\n  What I have outlined is a few ways in which our bill differs from \nSenator Daschle's bill. I would like to add a few more ways in which \nour bill differs as well.\n  First, Senator Daschle's plan is overly bureaucratic and I think \nextravagant, therefore it does nothing to curtail or even slow \nskyrocketing prescription drug costs. Why pass a bill if we are not \ngoing to do something to put the damper on the rapidly rising increases \nin the cost of drugs?\n  That is why it is essential that any new prescription drug benefit \ncontain proper cost management controls that moderate growth in price \nwhile ensuring Medicare enrollees' access to prescription drugs.\n  While guaranteeing prescription drug coverage for all seniors, our \nproposal imposes reasonable cost-sharing obligations on beneficiaries \nand does promote competition among prescription drug plans which, as I \nhave said so many times, will lead to a better overall effect on drug \nprices. That is a benefit to Medicare beneficiaries and to all \nAmericans who are not even yet eligible for the Medicare Program \nbecause of age.\n  We have flexibility in Medicare drug benefits that we do not want to \noverlook because under Senator Daschle's plan, seniors face fixed \ncopayments that, in many instances, mean they will actually pay more \nfor drugs than they would under a system such as the one we propose, \nthat gives prescription drug plans more flexibility to offer lower cost \ncopayments.\n  I suggest that before the plan is finally put before the Senate by \nthe other side--I will bet they will have that fixed because they have \nlooked at our plan and they know we are more fair, particularly to low-\nincome seniors, with our flexible drug benefit than what their fixed \ncosts are.\n  Senator Daschle also writes into law the monthly premium seniors will \npay for a drug benefit. But what happens if a plan has been efficient \nand wants to attract more Medicare enrollees by lowering their premium \nbelow that of other plans? Under Senator Daschle's approach, Congress \nwould have to pass legislation for the plan to lower the premium. If \nyou look at most of the problems we have with Medicare developing over \nthe last 35 years, probably those coming directly from reimbursement of \nvarious health care providers, you will find that micromanagement of \nthe Medicare Program by the Congress has led to most of the problems we \nhave. So to the extent that we can have the marketplace be the \ndisciplinarian in premium prices, copayments, in deductibles where \ncatastrophic kicks in, et cetera, et cetera, we ought to allow that to \nhappen.\n  We ought to look at what has benefited us as Senators and 10 million \nFederal employees or retirees or their families. You will see that \ncompetition among several of the Federal employee health benefits \nplans--they have, I don't know how many dozens of plans, but at least a \ncouple of dozen plans, with competition among those plans, flexibility \nin those plans, the tailoring in those plans for particular interest \ngroups of people in Federal employment, including Senators, they have \nbeen able to keep down the price of our Federal programs. That is \ndirectly related to the flexibility in the plans and the competition.\n  Why would you want to write into your plan a certain monthly premium?\n  Our plan then gives the freedom to offer premiums, copayments, and \ndeductibles that are flexible, saving seniors money, or gives them more \nmoney.\n  We also have an enhanced Medicare fee-for-service option that is an \nimproved and strengthened Medicare option--not one that seniors would \nhave to take. If they are satisfied with the 1965 model, they can keep \nit with or without prescription drugs. If they would like to have a new \nand improved 21st century Medicare Program with or without prescription \ndrugs--because prescription drugs are optional on all of these plans--\nwe would give them the opportunity to do that. I will explain that.\n  None of the other proposals on the table do any of this. It creates \nthe enhanced option. It is within the Medicare Program. It is a fee-\nfor-service program. Let me be clear about the fact that it is \ndelivered by the Federal Government just like Medicare. There has been \nsome confusion on that point. It ought to be easily understood.\n  We think it is an option that many beneficiaries might find \nattractive. But the beauty of it is that we are not going to make that \nchoice for them. It is voluntary. It is their choice.\n  Here is the bottom line. Beneficiaries, such as Medicare, have a \nright to keep it--keep it until you die. It is their choice. In fact, \neven future beneficiaries will always have this same choice under our \nplan--20-50. If you are 65 years old and you want the 1965 model of \nMedicare, choose it. But if it is 20-50, you are 65 years old and you \nwant a 21st century model of Medicare, then you can choose the enhanced \noption.\n  I want to make it very clear that there is no sunset of the existing \nMedicare benefit package in our bill--like Senator Daschle's sunset in \nhis drug benefit. We know on our side that senior citizens aren't going \nto sunset. They are going to be around forever.\n  In addition, Medicare enrollees can enroll in the Medicare drug \nbenefit, whether they are in traditional Medicare fee-for-service, \nenhanced Medicare fee-for-service, or the Medicare+Choice.\n  Here is the choice that our bill offers seniors, if they want to take \nit.\n  Existing Medicare Part A and Part B focus on the coverage of routine, \npredictable medical expenses. But the enhanced option, which we are \ngoing to call Part E, focuses on preventive care and protection against \ndevastating costs of serious illness. If beneficiaries prefer what they \nhave now, for the third time, I say they can keep it. But if they like \nthe idea of a better prevention and better insurance when they need it, \nthen, for the third time, I say they can have the new, enhanced \nversion.\n  On the subject of prevention, I would like to explain that we put a \nlot of emphasis on prevention. Medicare's current policy makes \nbeneficiaries reluctant to seek out preventive services that may \nidentify health problems and prevent more expensive care later. Part of \nthat is because they have to pay a deductible.\n  Unlike many private health plans, Medicare today subjects people in \nthis Part B to usually a 20-percent deductible.\n  For those who would elect the new, enhanced option, preventive \nbenefits would not be subject to any deductible, or to any coinsurance.\n  That is an example of moving Medicare from 1965 to the 21st century.\n  I would like to highlight another improvement of enhanced option.\n  Medicare today has no limit on a beneficiary's expenses in a year, \ncreating the potential for crippling costs in the event of a serious \nillness and maybe impoverishing some families. The bill would limit \nbeneficiaries' exposure then to out-of-pocket costs for Medicare \ncoverage services other than drugs to $6,000 per year. Beyond that \namount, Medicare would pay 100 percent of any costs incurred by the \nbeneficiaries.\n  In a given year, it is estimated that 2 to 3 percent of beneficiaries \nmay have costs that reach above that level. Of course, if one looks at \nbeneficiaries over multiple years, the likelihood of such expenses \nincreases accordingly. If beneficiaries want the peace of mind that \ncomes from such protection against serious illnesses, then for a fourth \ntime, I say they have that choice.\n  Another issue our enhanced option addresses is the Medicare \ndeductible structure. Under current law, the Part A deductible will be \nextremely high in the year 2005--$920 every time you go to the \nhospital--while the Part B deductible is going to stay at $100 per\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nyear. The enhanced option includes a unified deductible of $300 per \nyear for all services.\n  Medicare's irrational two-deductible system is unheard of in the \nprivate insurance industry today. Beneficiaries are used to single \ndeductibles from their prior employer-based plan. If they like what \nthey had while they were working, then they have the option, as I say \nfor the fifth time, of taking the enhanced option within Medicare.\n  Here is another benefit from the enhanced option. Because Medicare \nbenefits have so many holes in contrast to private insurance, most \nbeneficiaries are forced to carry supplemental coverage to fill in the \ngap. We call that Medigap. Reducing those gaps will make such \nsupplemental coverage less necessary, but, more importantly, if they \nwant to have it more affordable for the beneficiaries, our bill \nestablishes such new more affordable Medigap plans.\n  By the way, those employers who offer supplemental coverage will also \nfind it less costly to do so under the enhanced option since it will \nhave fewer holes to fill.\n  Is the enhanced option a better deal? From an actuarial standpoint, \nthe answer is definitely yes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us it is a more valuable \nbenefit, largely because of the serious illness protections that it \noffers our seniors. But not all seniors are actuaries. So we are \nleaving it up to the seniors to decide which of the two plans is a \nbetter deal.\n  We make a few changes also in Medicare+Choice improvement. Starting \nin 2005, our bill takes modest steps to improve the Medicare+Choice \nProgram. Medicare+Choice has been a big disappointment in my home State \nof Iowa. Only 1 county out of 99 has it. But seniors elsewhere--\nparticularly in the larger cities and in the Sun Belt--rely on it.\n  Our proposal keeps that option alive without throwing money at the \nprogram as we have so much in the past. Instead, we create a \ncompetitive bidding system under which Medicare+Choice plans will \ncompete with each other but not with the Medicare fee-for-service \nprograms for beneficiaries.\n  I want to emphasize that no one in the fee-for-service Medicare will \nbe affected by this change. We have made this change because today's \nbureaucratic pricing system sets arbitrary and inaccurate rates, and \nthat discourages Medicare+Choice plans from participating. Our approach \nto Medicare+Choice is based on a bipartisan model embraced by the \nClinton administration, and will result in fairer and more accurate \npayments to Medicare+Choice.\n  Before I give up the floor, I would like to comment for a short \nperiod of time on some statements that were made yesterday regarding \nour tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act by people on the other side \nof the aisle. I think in some ways the facts were not given straight. I \nwould like to correct the Record for the benefit of my colleagues.\n  Yesterday, there was reference made to an assets test as if there is \nsomething wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with it. Public policy \nfor low-income Medicare populations has included assets tests since \n1987. Our policy here in the Congress for low-income Medicare \npopulations has included an assets test since 1987.\n  I said it twice so people know that it is not something new being \nthrown out there.\n  Specifically, assets test policies were first included in Federal \npolicy in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 88 to 7 with help from people who, yesterday, \nwere denigrating our plan, and voted for the 1986 plan.\n  Our bill includes an assets test similar to the 1999 President \nClinton--remember he was a Democrat--Medicare bill.\n  Under current law, States have the flexibility to waive this assets \ntest. Nine States and the District of Columbia have chosen to waive the \ntest.\n  Our proposal allows assets test flexibility, found in current law, to \nbe retained in the Medicare drug benefit program. The assets test \nensures that seniors who need assistance the most are provided the most \nprotection.\n  Also, let me clarify that current law specifically excludes from the \nassets test a person's home and the land the home is on, household \ngoods, personal effects, including automobiles, the value of any burial \nspace, and other essential property.\n  The people attacking our plan also attacked our plan yesterday \nbecause of the flexibility we have in it. So I want to respond to that.\n  Medicare enrollees deserve a quality drug benefit that meets their \nindividual needs. The Daschle-Graham proposal does not allow any \nvariation in cost sharing or premiums and is a one-size-fits-all plan \nwhich will fail to adapt to the needs of seniors, as we are now so far \nbehind with the 1965 plan that was adopted in 1965.\n  It is also important that Medicare enrollees get quality drug \nbenefits at the lowest possible price. The tripartisan plan strikes the \nright balance to ensure Medicare enrollees have access to prescription \ndrugs they need at the best possible price.\n  Anyone wanting to offer a Medicare drug benefit will be required to \nreceive the approval of Health and Human Services. This is not a \ncheckoff approval process. There will be intensive interaction between \nany plan and the Government to ensure that Medicare enrollees are \ngetting what they are paying for.\n  There are five separate places in our bill where the administrator is \nrequired to certify that a plan meets strict standards of actuarial \nequivalence. The plans will not be determining what is the equivalent \nstandard benefit. The U.S. Government is going to make that \ndetermination. If a plan is not equivalent to the standard benefit, it \nis obvious the bid will be rejected, and should be.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has told us our standards of \nequivalence are strict enough that Medicare drug plans will have little \nroom varying in premiums or cost sharing. In their words, that little \nroom to vary is critical to the success of a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit and indicates how the tripartisan bill has found the right \npolicy in Government assumption of risk--just enough--to make sure \nthere is competition out there, to make sure plans are run efficiently, \nto make sure there is competition to drive down drug prices.\n  While the Democrat plan claims to include competition, I do not \nunderstand how Medicare plans will compete if they are required to \noffer identical premiums and identical cost sharing. If drug plans \nwanted to lower their cost sharing or lower their premiums in order to \nattract Medicare enrollees, the only way it could be done is for \nCongress to pass more legislation.\n  The tripartisan bill ensures the innovations of the private sector \nare not stifled by micromanagement, one-size-fits-all, Government-run \ndrug benefits.\n  There is guaranteed access to the plan. We have had Members of the \nother side apparently unaware that the tripartisan bill guarantees \naccess provisions. The tripartisan bill guarantees two Medicare \nprescription drug plans to every Medicare enrollee.\n\n  If the enrollee lives in an area where there is Medicare+Choice, the \nMedicare+Choice plans will not count towards the two-plan minimum.\n  The Medicare plans are not determining their own service areas. The \nGovernment will determine service areas, and the service areas must be \nat a minimum the size of a State.\n  The Government will be covering 75 percent of the value of the \nMedicare drug benefits, equalling $340 billion over the next 10 years. \nSo anyone who says the plans will not participate is simply not \noperating with any common sense--$340 billion of encouragement to \nparticipate. This is a clear attempt, and a failing attempt, I believe, \nto paint the tripartisan bill not as what it is--something that five \nSenators have worked on for a year--but to paint it, instead, as the \nHouse Republican bill, which it is not.\n  Lastly, we have been attacked from the other side about the \ntripartisan's policy toward employers. The tripartisan bill gives \nemployers a 100-percent subsidy to offer drug benefits to their \nretirees, as long as the retiree plan is, at a minimum, as generous as \nthe standard Medicare benefit.\n  In contrast to the tripartisan plan, the Democrat plan only gives \nemployers a two-thirds subsidy to retain their retiree prescription \ndrug plan.\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\n  Listen, from the other side you heard that our plan does not take \ninto consideration protecting retirees who already have a corporate \nretirement plan with health benefits in it, when we pay 100 percent of \nthat. And what does the other side pay? Sixty-seven percent. The other \nside's plan forces a standard benefit on all Medicare beneficiaries. \nWill employers be forced to change their entire drug benefit structure \nin order to obtain the two-thirds subsidy? This could result in \nemployers being forced to charge higher drug expenses for their \nretirees in order to receive the subsidy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator willing to yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will try to answer your question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just wondering about the time that the Senator \nwill use. We have several Senators indicating----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will be done in 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Currently, employers receive no assistance whatsoever \nin paying the drug costs for their retirees. Our 100-percent subsidy \nplan will allow employers who are offering a drug benefit at least as \ngenerous as the standard benefit to receive the full value of the \nstandard benefit.\n  Again, our policy targets dollars where they might do the most good. \nAnd an employer subsidy recognizes the value of employer-sponsored \nretiree drug benefits.\n  In closing, I will simply say something I said when I started. In the \nnext 3 or 4 days, there will be a lot of debate on this subject. It is \nvery important to have a lot of debate on this subject.\n  You are going to find strong advocates for plans where the advocates \nhave great faith in Government-run price programs versus whether or not \nyou ought to have competition from the private sector. Remember, CBO \nsays that a Government-run program is going to raise the price of \nprescription drugs. The alternative is to have competition. The \nCongressional Budget Office says that is going to reduce the price of \nprescription drugs.\n  We should be in the business of having public policy that is going to \ngive seniors the best medical care, including prescription drugs, based \non the least cost to the Government, as well as the least cost to the \nsenior citizen.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we have not had an agreement with \nregard to time, but we have had the opportunity to hear from that side \nof the aisle for about 2 hours 40 minutes of the last 3 hours. So I was \ngoing to see if we could recognize the Senator from New York. And \nalthough our leaders here don't frown on allocating the time and \nindicating individuals, the Senator from New Hampshire has been willing \nto agree to this proposal: The Senator from New York would go for 10 \nminutes, the Senator from Georgia 10 minutes, the Senator from New \nJersey 10 minutes, and I need 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have been waiting here patiently to \nspeak for a particular reason. Earlier this afternoon, the \nadministration came out with its Statement of Administration Policy on \nS. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act sponsored \nby myself, Senator McCain, and 10 others.\n  I have rarely seen a piece of paper so far from reality and so far \nfrom the truth. Let me quote from it:\n\n     . . . the Administration opposes S. 812 in its current form \n     because it will not provide lower drug prices.\n\n  What planet are they on? What are they smoking? Generic drugs will \nnot lower the cost of drugs? If you want to oppose the bill for one \nreason or another, fine. Here are some costs: Claritin, brand name $86; \ngeneric $33; Cipro, brand name $89; generic, $35; Zocor, high \ncholesterol, $116; generic, $45; Zoloft, $69; generic, $27; brand of \nSingulair, $84; generic, $32.\n  That doesn't lower costs? It has been estimated it will save the \nAmerican people $70 billion. It has been estimated it will save our \nState governments hundreds of millions of dollars. And they say it \ndoesn't lower cost. What kind of argument is that? We all know it will \nlower cost. If they want to come clean and say they don't want to \nalienate the pharmaceutical industry, fine. If they want to say there \nis a better plan and better scheme, fine. If they want to say, keep \nthings status quo, fine. But it won't lower costs?\n  I think they have a lot of disagreement even from people normally on \ntheir side. Here are some of the groups that think it will lower costs: \nGeneral Motors, Ford, Chrysler, UAW, AFL-CIO, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Kodak, \nMotorola, Caterpillar, Kmart, Georgia Pacific, Albertson's, UPS, \nKellogg, Sysco. The list goes on and on. These companies are not \nusually supporters of the kind of legislation we are talking about. \nThey are all for this. They are for it for one reason: lower cost. \nTheir own health care plan costs are going through the roof. I am \nutterly amazed. I ask the administration to retract this statement or \nprove why they believe that moving to generic drugs is not going to \nlower cost.\n  They say a few other things, too, which shows you that they really \ndon't know what the bill is. They say in their statement that this bill \nwould encourage litigation around the initial approval of new drugs. \nThe legislation does not allow litigation for the approval of new \ndrugs. They don't know what the bill does.\n  Will it prevent unnecessary litigation when someone files a patent in \nthe Orange Book that is frivolous? Yes. That is not about a new drug. \nIn fact, when it comes to a new drug, that is one of the few places \nwhere, of course, the patent can be contested by our legislation. What \nour bill does is simply force them to play by the rules.\n  The administration says the bill would complicate the process of \nfiling patents. Of course, our initial legislation was clean. There was \nan amendment to change it, mainly to get support from members of their \nparty. But if what the administration means is that it will complicate \nthe process, if that means it makes brand companies comply with the \nFDA's current rules, you bet it will complicate the process.\n  The FDA requires that brand companies only list patents in the Orange \nBook that cover the drug or cover that approved use of the drug. Now \nthe FDA does not enforce this, so the brand companies don't play by the \nrules. Our bill requires them to do it.\n\n  I had hoped that when Senator McCain and I introduced this \nlegislation--and my hopes were heightened when the legislation passed \n16 to 5 and got half the members of the HELP committee from the \nRepublican side--that we could have a debate and come to an agreement. \nThe Senator from Utah, understandably, has pride of authorship. He may \nwant to make some changes. But to just so baldly oppose a bill on \nspecious grounds makes one wonder where the administration is coming \nfrom. Are they so afraid to offend PhRMA that they have to put out a \nstatement that is just patently wrong?\n  We saw in the area of corporate litigation that the administration, \nwhich likes the American people to think it is moderate, is to the \nright of the Business Roundtable. We are finding the same thing here. \nWe are finding that the administration, on the issue of drugs and the \nhigh price of prescription drugs, is to the right of much of corporate \nAmerica.\n  Please, Mr. OMB Chairman, Mr. Vice President, work with us. We are \nnot going to agree on everything, but work with us. This is a serious \nproblem. If this memo is an indication that all we are going to get on \nthe issue of reducing the cost of drugs and increasing the access of \ndrugs is stonewalling, then it is a sad day for the American people.\n  We are going to fight hard for this legislation. The American people \nneed this legislation. It needs to go beyond the original bill. That is \nwhy I have supported other amendments, and I hope the prescription drug \nplan offered by the Senators from Florida, Georgia, and Massachusetts \nprevails. But if even in this modest bipartisan step we get such \nstonewalling and such failure to grapple with the truth, then all those \nAmericans who are paying such high prices for drugs are in trouble.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield for a question.\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is probably not aware of this because this \ninformation has just been forwarded to me. I will actually have a paper \non it. But there have been a lot of different representations as to how \nmuch the underlying bill would save. I have seen numbers that ran from \n$20 billion to $60 billion, and I believe the Senator mentioned it is \nactually a higher number.\n  We have just been advised by CBO that the underlying bill, the \nEdwards-Collins bill, will have $8 billion savings assigned to it by \nCBO. So as we debate this issue--I know some people are planning to use \nthat savings to assist the major movement on the overall drug benefit--\nthis is going to change the dynamics around here a little bit. But just \nso we are all playing off the same song sheet on savings, this bill is \nnow scored by CBO as an $8 billion savings.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I could answer the question, which I know was meant \nto be a question, of the Senator from New Hampshire--the junior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire to correct the error of my ways--first, the $8 \nbillion is the CBO estimate--I guess; I haven't heard it yet--but that \nis just for Medicare. The administration is saying it will not provide \nlower drug prices. The estimates are pretty widespread and pretty \naccepted that when you take not just the Medicare savings but the \nsavings to every consumer who goes and buys the drug, the savings to \nall these companies that have their own health care plans, the savings \nto the States, it is going to be much more than that.\n  I am not debating how much right now. I don't know if that estimate \nis correct. It seems low to me. But let's assume it is. It is in direct \ncontradiction to the Statement of Administration Policy that came out \nthis morning which says: ``will not provide lower drug prices,'' \nperiod--not ``will not lower them enough,'' not ``will not lower them \nfor everybody.'' It says, unequivocally, no lower drug prices.\n  So I would like to thank my colleague from New Hampshire because even \nthough he is making a different point, he makes mine. The \nadministration seems so hardheaded against anything to change the \nstatus quo, even though the vast majority of Americans are unhappy with \nthe status quo, that it leads them to make statements that are patently \nabsurd on their face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KENNEDY). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to let us try to \ncome together on a prescription drug bill in these next 2 weeks for the \nsake of America's seniors.\n  Our seniors are up against a rich and powerful drug industry--an \nindustry that, obviously, will fight tooth and nail against anyone who \nseeks to meddle with its obscene profit margin or its astonishing \nsalaries for its CEOs or its TV media blitz.\n  Our seniors cannot fight this battle alone. Goliath is too big. \nCongress must step in immediately and help America's elderly in their \nday-to-day life and death struggle with prescription drugs.\n  This Senate has already taken a very big step toward helping seniors \nget their medicine at lower prices by passing the reimportation \namendment. Now it is time to give some more help. It is time to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  I was very glad to hear this week that the Nation's largest advocacy \ngroup for seniors, AARP, has declared the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill as \nthe one that, in their opinion, offers the very best value for seniors.\n  Let me take just a few minutes to tell you why they think and why I \nthink this bill is better than the rest.\n  First, we use a system that is now in place--a system that is now in \nplace for most working Americans, a system that the Federal Government \nand most employers use right now for their own workers. This new \nbenefit is too important to risk using an untried, experimental \ndelivery system; but the competing bills do just that.\n  Under our bill, every beneficiary will know how much their premium \nwill cost each month and how much they will have to pay for each drug \nthey buy. We guarantee seniors an affordable premium, while the \nRepublican bill allows private insurers to set the premium cost. That \nmeans insurers would be free to charge seniors whatever premium they \nwant, whenever they want.\n  It is simply a fact that seniors who live in rural America are often \nolder, often sicker. Under the Republican bill, insurers would be able \nto charge them even higher premiums than those who live in urban areas. \nThat would hurt the very people I call my friends and neighbors back \nhome, and that is unacceptable.\n  The private insurers that are the centerpiece of the Republican bill \nwill make profits based on managing drug care for beneficiaries, just \nas HMOs make their profits on managing care. That would result--it \ncould not help but result--in fewer drugs being available to our \nseniors. That is not the kind of benefit our seniors need. That is not \nthe kind of benefit they deserve.\n  Our bill uses a system that is already up and running in every ZIP \nCode in the United States. We guarantee that services will be available \nto seniors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for any emergency that \narises. The competing bills offer no such protection.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill is also the best plan out there \nbecause it has no gaps in coverage. That is very important to me, and \nto AARP, and to every senior in this country. We help seniors pay for \nthe very first drug they buy each year. That coverage continues with no \ninterruption through the last day of each year. No other bill makes \nthe same guarantee.\n\n  There are two gaps in the competing bills. First, under the House \nRepublican plan, all seniors would have to pay a $250 deductible. That \nmeans they would pay premiums but would get no coverage for the first \n$250 of their drug bills. Then, once drug costs reached $2,000, \ncoverage would be cut off altogether. Seniors would get no help from \nthe program until their out-of-pocket spending hit the $4,800 mark.\n  During this huge gap in coverage, seniors would still be required to \npay their monthly premium even though they were not receiving a single \npenny of benefits from the program. And every beneficiary would \nexperience that first gap in coverage because every senior would have \nto spend $250 before they saw the first dollar of benefit.\n  Then, almost half of all the beneficiaries would fall into the second \ncoverage gap. Sixty percent of them would never climb back out of that \ngap to receive coverage again. Let me say that again. Nearly two-thirds \nof seniors who ran up drug bills of $2,000 would never see another \npenny in benefits for the rest of the year.\n  Because of these gaps, the typical beneficiary--let's say an elderly \nwoman whose prescriptions run $2,400 each year--would still have to \ncover 71 percent of her drug bill each year.\n  Beneficiaries with higher drug bills are even worse off. Take an \nelderly man whose drug expenses run $400 a month, or $4,800 each year. \nHe would have to pay 85 percent of his drug costs each year under the \nRepublican bill. That is not much of a lifesaver to be throwing a \ndrowning man.\n  Once again, there are no gaps of any kind in the Graham-Miller-\nKennedy bill. Coverage continues every day, every week, every month, \nall year long, regardless of how high a senior's drug bill is.\n  Once drug costs have reached $4,000, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill \nsays that we will pick up the entire bill for the rest of the year. It \nis what our seniors need. It is the least they deserve.\n  Mr. President, the time has come. It is just like back in 49 B.C. \nwhen Caesar had to ask himself a question: ``Do we cross this \nRubicon?'' Do we make the commitment? Do we take this risk? You know, \nwe throw around the term ``It's a matter of life or death'' pretty \nlightly. Seldom is that really the case. But this time it really is.\n  Many seniors--our mothers, fathers, grandparents, and other loved \nones--will live or they will die because of this vote. Are we going to \npass a meaningful prescription drug benefit as we have been promising \nand talking about for years? Are we going to go home and face the \nseniors of this Nation without doing diddly squat?\n  We have had a lot of sound and fury in this Chamber. Will it signify \nnothing, just a big fat zero? It isn't enough to have just good \nintentions, Mr. President. The road to hell is paved with good \nintentions. It isn't enough to promise good deeds. We must do them.\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate is engaged in probably the \nmost important health care debate in a generation. If we succeed in \nestablishing a pharmaceutical benefit for the American people, it will \nbe the greatest contribution to health care since Medicare.\n  We are engaged in this debate in the middle of an economic and \ncorporate crisis. It would not be honest or even productive to pretend \nthat one event is taking place without the backdrop of the other.\n  It is an extraordinary time to be redesigning the delivery system of \nan industry while corporate America is going through a series of \ntumultuous events.\n  I have an amendment prepared that I will offer to this legislation \nthat is the nexus between the two problems because the pharmaceutical \nindustry requires a transparency and a proper accounting of itself in \nthe delivery and pricing of its products, just as certainly a variety \nof other American industries have suffered from their failure to do the \nsame.\n  I address specifically two persistent problems. First, when an \nAmerican family goes to a pharmacy to buy a prescription product, they \noperate under the assumption that they are getting sound medical \nadvice, that the prescription that is being offered to them is suited \nfor their problem, their malady, it is priced properly, and a medical \njudgment is being made on the merits. That is the assumption of every \nAmerican family. It may not always be sound.\n  Through the years, marketing techniques from sporting events and \ntheater productions to expensive vacations and gifts have become part \nof the routine of marketing pharmaceutical products. American families \nand senior citizens are left not knowing whether a product is being \nprescribed because it is the best for their health or because the \ndoctor is indebted to a marketer or a corporation.\n  The same could be true of a pharmacy. Of all the corporate governance \nissues in America that deserve transparency, nothing could be more \nfundamental than the relationship between an individual American family \nand the delivery of their health care. People want to know, people have \na right to know, is a gift an incentive, part of the prescribing of a \nprescription drug, or is it the quality of the product? Has a doctor \nbeen convinced this is the right drug for your child, for your family, \nfor your health, or is this simply part of a relationship with an \nundisclosed incentive?\n  Under the amendment that I will offer, any corporation providing a \ngift to a doctor or health care provider as part of marketing a \npharmaceutical product will need to disclose it. The incentive can be \nprovided, the gift can be provided, you can offer the vacation, but at \nleast people have a right to know whether the sales of products are \nrelated to price, science, the merits, or the financial incentive to \nconsume them.\n  Some will argue that such techniques are common in industry. It may \nbe true, but it is one thing if a retailer is getting an incentive to \nsell you a shirt or an automobile manufacturer is getting a secret or \nprivate incentive to an automobile dealer. That might be business. It \nmay or may not interfere with the right judgment of the proper pricing, \nbut that is marketing.\n  It is something else when it interferes with the judgment of a doctor \nand the confidence in health care delivery upon which people have come \nto rely, a judgment that involves not simply price but the intangible \nof trust in a health care provider.\n  Second, the amendment expands to deal with pharmaceutical benefit \nmanagers, otherwise known as PBMs. PBMs are essentially health \nmaintenance organizations designed to deal with the delivery of \npharmaceutical products. They are the middlemen who have placed \nthemselves between drug manufacturers, health plans, and pharmacies. If \nthey operate properly, they negotiate better prices, provide service \nand delivery at a superior cost to a beneficiary. For most of the last \n25 years, that is exactly how they have operated.\n\n  A problem has developed, much like the gift, the vacation offered for \nselling a pharmaceutical product, except it happens on a much larger \nscale.\n  Pharmaceutical benefit managers have an obligation to their clients, \nthe people who have contracted with them to buy the best product at the \nbest price. The best product is to be based on a medical judgment. The \nbest price is what can be negotiated. But the law has allowed a \npractice that is as morally wrong as it is reprehensible.\n  Pharmaceutical benefit managers who allegedly represent their clients \ngo to pharmaceutical companies and ask for rebates. That is a polite \nword for a kickback. The client, the senior citizen, the working person \nis left believing they are buying a pharmaceutical product represented \nto them because it will deal with their illness and has the best \nscience and is at the best price.\n  What they do not know is the pharmaceutical benefit manager may be \noffering that product because they are getting hundreds of thousands of \ndollars or millions of dollars in a rebate. Indeed, nothing else would \nexplain what has emerged.\n  Pharmaceutical benefit managers are far less inclined to ever \nrecommend generic drugs. Indeed, at the moment, brand name drugs are \noffered only 46 percent of the time compared with 54 percent of the \ntime by a local pharmacist. The cost of a brand name drug offered by a \npharmaceutical benefit manager can be $47 compared with $37 at a local \npharmacy. So people who believe they are in a benefit plan to negotiate \na better price are paying more, and they are not only paying more, they \nmay be directed to products that are offered not based on a medical \njudgment or on a cost basis but because of a secret rebate.\n  The chart on my left illustrates exactly the problem, in what is now \na four-tiered system from manufacturer to senior citizen. The \nmanufacturer may offer a rebate with the belief that it could lower \nprice and make their product more available through pharmacies to \nsenior citizens, and many of these rebates may be offered by \npharmaceutical manufacturers with the belief that like the rebate from \nan automobile manufacturer to an auto dealer, it is making the product \nmore available, but here is the problem. The law allows the \npharmaceutical benefit manager to keep the money. It does not go to the \npharmacy. It never reaches the senior citizen. It stays here. The \npharmaceutical benefit managers are in a contractual relationship \nsupposedly representing the senior citizen. They are supposed to be \ntheir advocate, getting their price. Instead, they are keeping the \nmoney.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Under the amendment I am going to offer to this \nlegislation in the coming days, as certainly as pharmaceutical \ncompanies will have to disclose any gifts they are giving, any \nincentives they are giving to doctors to influence their medical \njudgments, so, too, pharmaceutical manufacturers will have to disclose \nany rebates given to PBMs so the clients of the PBMs know what they are \ngetting and can demand that those rebates be handed down to senior \ncitizens at a lower price.\n  It is simply transparency. It is what every American is asking of \nevery American corporation. We have a free enterprise system for people \nto price their products, but we do demand truth and honesty. This is a \nminimum of transparency that we can bring to the pharmaceutical \nindustry in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nMassachusetts withholding. The Republican leader is present, and I have \na unanimous consent request that I would like to propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts--he has 20 minutes. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, will speak for probably 20 minutes. Following that, Senator \nGregg will speak for probably 5 or 10\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\nminutes. Following those statements, we would vote on----\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Stabenow would then have the right to close.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to do that before the vote. Following that, we \nwould have a vote on or in relation to Senator Stabenow's amendment; \nthat prior to the vote on Senator Stabenow's amendment, we would have 2 \nminutes for her to speak on behalf of her amendment, and Senator Gregg \nor his designee would speak 2 minutes in opposition to that amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Stabenow would close?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. That upon disposition of Senator Stabenow's amendment \nNo. 4305, Senator Dorgan's amendment No. 4299 be temporarily laid \naside, and Senator Graham be recognized to offer his prescription drug \namendment; that immediately upon the reporting of his amendment, it be \nlaid aside and Senator Grassley, or his designee, be recognized to \noffer his prescription drug amendment; that the two amendments be \ndebated concurrently; that no other amendments or motions be in order \nduring the pendency of these amendments, except motions to waive as \nlisted below; that on Tuesday, July 23, at 2:15 there be 30 minutes \nequally divided between Senators Graham and Grassley; that at 2:45 on \nthat Tuesday, July 23, the Senate vote on waiving the Budget Act with \nrespect to Senator Graham's amendment; that immediately following that \nvote, the Senate vote on waiving the Budget Act for Senator Grassley's \namendment; that if either amendment successfully waives the Budget Act, \nit be further debatable and amendable; that if either fails to waive \nthe Budget Act, it then be withdrawn; and that the preceding all occur \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of Senator Dorgan's amendment that Senator Gregg or his \ndesignee be authorized to offer a second-degree amendment thereto and \nthat upon disposition of Senator Gregg's amendment, Senator Rockefeller \nbe recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to Senator Dorgan's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, will the \nSenator include that the allocation of time be equally divided on \nMonday and then Tuesday morning?\n  Mr. REID. That certainly is fair. We will equally divide the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is it correct there would be a budget point of order \nthat would lie against both the Graham and Grassley amendments?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  I ask that the request be amended so the time be designated, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Gregg, even though the amendments are those of other \nSenators. They are the managers of the bill and that is the way it \nshould be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while I object to the process under which \nthis is being considered--I think we should have had this prescription \ndrug issue go through the Finance Committee. We should have a normal \ndebate, markup, and report out what would normally have been a \nbipartisan bill and probably a tripartisan bill. That is the way we \nshould do business, and I predict right now that eventually the only \nway we are ever really going to get a real prescription drug result is \nwe are going to have to go back and do that.\n  Having said that, the bill before us everybody understood was going \nto be a vehicle to which Senator Daschle and others would be able to \nadd prescription drug amendments or bills. That is what has happened.\n  I think we will have sufficient time for debate later on tonight, on \nFriday, on Monday, on Tuesday morning, I presume, with the votes to \noccur one after the other on Tuesday afternoon. I think that is a fair \nway to proceed.\n  Right up until the last few moments, we are getting people inquiring \nabout what happens then. Well, of course, if one of them does get 60 \nvotes, as is in the agreement, we could go back and have additional \ndebate and amendments, or if they do not, then other options are \navailable, other amendments to the pending issue that is being set \naside or other proposals with regard to a different approach to the \nprescription drug issue.\n  I know Senators Hagel, Ensign, Smith, Allard and Graham are \ninterested in the Hagel amendment, and perhaps other amendments on this \nside.\n  We also retain the right to move to commit this whole issue to the \nFinance Committee with instructions, and at some point it might wind up \nbeing the most reasonable and popular thing to do. But this is not \ncutting off other amendments, not cutting off this issue, just setting \nit aside. It is not blocking other options from being considered. The \ntruth is, both sides have been working for the last couple of days to \ntry to get to this point. So I think it is the fair way to proceed. \nEverybody will be heard. We will have a vote and then see where we are.\n  Mr. REID. I want to express the appreciation of the Democratic \nSenators to the two leaders. It was not easy to get where we are right \nnow, and the reason I appreciate that--I think everyone does on this \nside; I am sure on their side--we have two big issues that will be \ndebated for several days. This issue, prescription drugs, is why we are \nhere--one of the main reasons we are here, I should say. This will give \neveryone a chance to listen to what others have to say.\n  There will be some who do not want either one of these; they want \nsomething else. But they have a right to vote accordingly.\n  I think we have made great progress. If I can get Senator Gregg's \nattention, Senator Stabenow asked if there would be a problem with her \nhaving 5 minutes, and the Senator from New Hampshire having 5 minutes \nimmediately prior to the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is no problem at all.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senators who are watching, this vote will \nprobably occur around 5:30, give or take a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  I thank our leaders, Senator Reid, Senator Daschle, and our \nRepublican leaders, for this agreement we have entered into. This is a \nhistoric time. It will be the first time in over 5 years since there \nhave been prescription drug amendments before the Senate.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Graham-Miller bill and later in this debate, \neither tomorrow, Monday or Tuesday, I will have an opportunity to go \nover why I think that measure is so compelling and deserves strong \nsupport.\n  We were reminded, once again, earlier in the afternoon, of the \npublication of a study that reviewed the different options that are \nbefore the Congress most actively; that is, the Republican proposal \nthat passed the House of Representatives, the tripartite, and the \nGraham-Miller proposal. The study examined the impact of each of these \nproposals on individual States and what impact each would have on \nseniors and others that would benefit from the program. In every single \ninstance, every single State, without a single exception, the one that \nwas embraced by the seniors, the one that provided the greatest \ncoverage for the seniors, was the Graham-Miller proposal.\n  We will have more of a chance to debate that over the next couple of \ndays.\n  It is very important as we come to vote on the amendment of Senator \nStabenow to realize what has happened in the last couple of days.\n  The focus of the underlying legislation--which was originally \nintroduced by Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, and then altered or \nadjusted by Senator Edwards and Senator Collins--basically addresses \nthe egregious situation taking place today all over our country by \nunscrupulous brand name drug companies gimmicking the patent laws in \norder to take unfair advantage of consumers in this country and \nmaintaining higher costs. They are doing it by extending the patent \nprocess with a phony regime called ``evergreening'' and also through \ncollusion with certain generic drug companies. This practice is \nresulting in costs of billions of dollars to our seniors.\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\n  If there are people who are watching this Senate proceeding, if there \nare cancer patients and they have been paying higher prices for various \nprescription drugs dealing with breast cancer, the fact is the \npharmaceutical companies delayed Taxol, the generic drug, for 19 \nmonths. That means consumers paid $1.2 billion more because of the \ndelay of competition. If patients suffer from epilepsy, as a result of \nthis system, those patients have paid $1.4 billion more than they \notherwise would have paid. That has been true with various brand name \ndrugs for depression, and it also includes blood pressure as well.\n  In all those areas, there has been a gimmicking of the system, which \npermitted those companies that had the patents for a period of time, \nand under the old Hatch-Waxman legislation were going to have their \ntime expired and the generics would be on the market, to be able to \ncompete, and would have saved the consumers billions of dollars. The \nactions of those brand name companies have been such as to result in \nhigher prices.\n  That is the basic issue we have before the Senate, whether we will \npass that legislation.\n  The Dorgan amendment was favorably considered in a vote yesterday. It \nwill also have a dampening down in the increase of prices of \nprescription drugs. And American taxpayers are paying taxes, and those \nresources go to fund expanded NIH research, which I strongly support.\n  This is the time of the life sciences, and we will see unbelievable \nopportunities in the future in breakthroughs with prescriptions. It is \nan enormously important time. I believe we will see these breakthroughs \nin the life sciences, as in the physical sciences last century. We have \nseen what is happening with the analysis of DNA, and the sequencing of \nthe human genome, and all the breakthroughs with unlimited \npossibilities, using the high technology available and the advancements \nin biology. The opportunities are virtually unlimited. It is an \nenormously exciting time.\n  That is why it is important to have a policy that will make available \nto all Americans these lifesaving prescription drugs reasonably.\n  We had the excellent presentation made by our friend and fellow \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan. The vote was a clear indication that the \nMembers of this body are prepared to see that prescription drugs that \nare FDA approved, produced in an FDA-approved laboratory, imported here \nwith the safety provisions included in the Dorgan amendment, would be \navailable to American citizens.\n  Today we have the Stabenow amendment. We have had limited debate on \nthe merits of the amendment. I hoped we would have seen an acceptance \nof the Stabenow amendment. It makes eminently good sense. We have heard \na great deal of debate and discussion about the free enterprise system. \nThat is what the Stabenow amendment is all about.\n\n  It is the ability of the States to use their economic power in order \nto negotiate with the various drug companies to try to get the lowest \npossible price for the neediest individuals, the poorest people in the \nUnited States. And the drug companies say no. Yesterday they said: We \nwant to play by the free market system; and now we have a free market \nsystem being utilized and they say: No, no, we want to play by our own \nrules. What does that mean? They have now taken the various States to \ntask and said: We will not permit that because that is government \ninterference in the free market system.\n  The fact is, what is being tried in the State of Maine and the other \nStates is the same kind of market experience we have seen with an HMO \nwhen they negotiate with various brand name companies. It is the same \nkind of negotiations insurance companies have. It is routine, the same \nas major companies. General Motors does this when they buy prescription \ndrugs. It is the same element, to use market forces to try to get the \nlowest possible prices. When they do not want to do that, and companies \ndo want them to do it, there is no reason they have to sell. It is a \nfree and open exchange.\n  That is not good enough. We have seen where the drug industry has \nsued the State of Maine, they have sued the State of Vermont, they have \nsued Michigan, they have sued Illinois, they have sued Florida. The \ndrug industry is waging war against our Governors and our State \nlegislatures to bring them into court.\n  From the NGA statement of July 15, I quote Michigan Republican \nGovernor Engler:\n\n       The nation's governors are extremely disappointed with the \n     course of action chosen by PhRMA. It is unfortunate that \n     their organization feels compelled to use the court system to \n     manipulate public policy.\n\n  I will mention another feature of the attack by the industries on the \nStates. This is what they are about. First of all, the industry sued \nthe State. That probably is not any surprise, given their abuse of the \nHatch-Waxman. The drug industry instructed its front group, the so-\ncalled Citizens for Better Medicare, to run television, radio, and \nprints ads in Maine and Vermont attacking the laws. That is what the \ndrug industry does to keep the prices sky high. They sue our State \ngovernments, and waste taxpayers' dollars defending against frivolous \nsuits, because the States have to defend themselves; they have to use \ntax dollars. And then they run attack ads.\n  Lest anyone question whether the so-called Citizens for Better \nMedicare is anything but a front group for the drug industry, let me \nquote the June 18 Wall Street Journal, Tim Ryan: PhRMA's past marketing \ndirector founded the grassroots sounding Systems for better Medicare at \nthe expense of the major drug companies.\n  So it is a phony organization, but they use the phony organization to \nattack the public officials in those States for resisting their action.\n  Enough is enough. The American people are sick and tired of the drug \nindustry's abuses.\n  I have an IG report from the HHS inspector general, who issued a \nreport in August of last year which documents the fiscal crisis of sky-\nhigh drug prices. Here is the inspector general's conclusion about the \ncurrent Medicaid discounts shared by the States and the Federal \nGovernment:\n\n       We believe it is not a sufficient discount to ensure that a \n     reasonable price is paid for drugs.\n\n  This is done under a Republican administration, a Republican IG, \nAugust of last year.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of IG, Medicaid \npharmacy. This is what he says in paragraph 2:\n\n       Although this discount averaged 10.31 percent nationally, \n     we believe that it is not a sufficient discount to ensure \n     that a reasonable price is paid for drugs.\n       We believe that there is a critical need for States to \n     better control the costs of their Medicaid drug program \n     because expenditures are rising at a dramatic rate. Medicaid \n     drug expenditures increased by slightly over 90 percent since \n     our previous review in 1994.\n\n  I repeat, 90 percent. So says the IG report, a Republican HHS \ndiscussing what is happening in the States.\n  Then we have the Governors try to do something about it and PhRMA \ncomes right in and says no.\n  Senator Stabenow's amendment will clarify that. It will support the \nGovernors--support Republican Governors, support Democratic Governors--\nsupport the findings of a Republican IG to help deal with this issue.\n  Just in the last day we had a meeting of the Governors, actually, out \nin the State of Idaho. The Nation's Governors met out in Idaho and the \nGovernors voiced their concern over the lawsuit that seeks to bar the \nStates from dealing with the Medicaid cost-controlling measures.\n  This is the Governors saying just what Senator Stabenow has been \nsaying, Republican and Democrat alike.\n  This is a serious amendment. Therefore, I am very hopeful it will be \naccepted.\n  Let me bring to the attention of the membership, something that has \ndeveloped in my own State of Massachusetts, in the U.S. attorney's \noffice. One of the developments in recent times is the development of a \nhealth fraud unit, which has been extremely active. I was talking to \nour U.S. attorney recently up there. We were discussing the situation \nabout health care fraud. He mentioned to me this particular case.\n  Just last October, the Federal authorities secured the largest health \ncare fraud settlement in history. Not surprisingly, it was against a \ndrug company for overcharging taxpayers through Medicaid--just what we \nare trying to deal with here in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nSenate. The Top Pharmaceuticals paid $875 million in criminal and civil \nfines for overcharging the States and the Federal Government for the \ncancer drug, Lupron. It is a life-or-death cancer drug, and here you \nhave Top Pharmaceuticals found guilty of overcharging consumers and now \nhaving to pay the criminal fines and civil fines of $875 million. There \nare now class action litigations brought by consumer advocates in \nBoston to further recover the overpayments to this drug company.\n  We need to close ranks with our States, Republican and Democratic \nGovernors alike--consumers against high drug prices. The Stabenow \namendment is the right tool in the hands of the States to lower drug \nprices for low-income people and the uninsured.\n  I want to reiterate two facts. Who are the States looking out for? \nAre they trying to use their bargaining power in terms of a massive \npurchase of drugs for all the people in their States? No. They are \ntrying to use it for the most needy people in their States in most \ninstances--and I think in the State of Maine, in every instance--those \nwho are uninsured, the poorest of the poor who cannot get insurance for \none reason or another, or are not eligible for Medicaid, in order to \nget them lower costs. It is the poorest of the poor trying to get life-\nsustaining drugs, and PhRMA, the industry, is going after that and \nsaying they do not want that to take place. They think that is un-\nAmerican. They think it is price fixing and so forth.\n  We have seen, and I have certainly seen it in our committee because \nit was not believed we would get this legislation out of the committee \nbecause we heard the drug industry is strongly opposed to it--and we \nhave certainly heard that from our friends on this side of the aisle--\nwe understand that--they are opposed to it. They are opposed to the \nSchumer proposal. We understand that. They are opposed to the Dorgan \nproposal. We heard that yesterday. And they are opposed to the Stabenow \nproposal.\n  What we have not heard is what they are for. What we have not heard \nis what they would do. What we have not heard is their sense of outrage \nabout these abuses. We have not heard that.\n  We have been here the better part of the day today, yesterday, the \nday before, and we have not heard that. That is a matter of deep \nconcern to everyone on this side of the aisle. It is the reason the \nmajority leader has brought this up to the Senate, on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I heard my good friend--and he is my friend--the Senator from \nTennessee, talk about the process and procedure, about whether we are \ncircumventing the procedure in order to consider the legislation. Of \ncourse it did not bother him very much in May of 2000 when they brought \nup the energy bill, sponsored by Senator Lott, without committee \napproval; or brought up, on March 20, a bill to eliminate the earnings \ntest for individuals attaining retirement age, without committee \napproval. The list goes on. In June 1999, the Republicans brought up \nSocial Security lockbox without committee approval. It didn't bother \nthem at that time.\n  But what you did not hear about is a prescription drug program for \nthe needy in this country. They were never willing to circumvent the \nrules to try to protect the seniors or try to get lower prices. No, \nthere is no example for that. We have had legislation in the committees \nfor over 5 years. This is the first time--the first time--the only time \nthat we have had the opportunity to debate.\n  Next Tuesday will be the first time we have had the opportunity to \nvote. And people are complaining about process and procedure.\n  We know what happens. Every Member in this body knows what happens \nwhen you get back in those committee rooms, you get out in the \ncorridors--we know what happens. That is the end of the legislation. \nThat is the end of it. We all know it. But we know next Tuesday we are \ngoing to have a chance to vote on this. It will be the first time, and \nwe would not have that opportunity unless Senator Daschle said: This is \na matter of national priority. This is a matter of central concern. \nThis is an issue that ought to be debated and discussed on the floor of \nthe Senate. This is a moral issue of central concern to every family, \nyoung and old--not only those who take the drugs but the families who \nlook at their parents and are concerned about whether they have the \nresources to purchase those drugs.\n  The parents themselves do not want to burden their children about \ntheir own kinds of conditions. They are proud men and women who want to \nlive in dignity and who have paid a price for this Nation--fought in \nthe wars, lifted the country out of the Depression.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The last 5 minutes has expired? I asked to be reminded \nwhen I used 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can use that time now--5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The remaining time.\n  Mr. President, these are people who have built the country. Now we \nare asking whether they have paid into the system. I was here in 1965 \nwhen that commitment was made here on the floor of the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. The President who signed it--President \nJohnson as well--said:\n  Look, play by the rules, pay under the system, and when you turn 65 \nyou will have health security.\n  Everyone in this room understands it. This Chamber understands that \nwe failed the elderly people on that promise. We provided physician \nservices and hospitalization but not prescription drugs. That is a \nthree-legged stool. If you only have two and you do not have the third, \nyou do not have health security. Every family understands that, \neveryone except the Senate.\n  We are prepared to do something about it. Can you imagine if we had \nnot provided hospitalization or physician services? We would certainly \nunderstand it. Would we not be debating that today? Does anybody \nbelieve it to be so? Does anybody believe this is not important?\n  Finally, I remind everyone in this body as we are coming in, and as I \nintend to remind them next week, every Member of this body has a \nprescription drug program.\n  Every Member of this body has a prescription drug program that is \npaid for by taxpayers by 80 percent. We understand that. Any Member of \nthis body who wanted to go down to the clerk's office could go in there \nand say: Take my name off that. I don't want it. I don't believe as a \nmatter of principle that we ought to have the Federal Government \ndealing with this policy.\n  Anyone could do that. I have checked on it. There isn't a single \nMember in here who has done that.\n  All we are trying to do with this particular proposal is to treat the \nAmerican people the same way Republicans and Democrats and this \nPresident are being treated. Is that asking too much for this body to \ndo? I don't believe so.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Stabenow \namendment. I will mention several reasons.\n  First and foremost, it is going to increase in the price of Medicaid. \nI want to make sure our colleagues know that. I am going to say it \nabout 10 times in the course of this debate. If we pass the Stabenow \namendment, the price of Medicaid is going up. The price of drugs going \ninto the Medicaid system is going up. That is just a fact that \neverybody should know.\n  If we think that we are going to pass this amendment and that this is \na great deal for the State--I disagree. The States have to share in the \ncost of Medicaid, and the cost of Medicaid is going up.\n  I heard my good friend--he is my good friend--the Senator from \nMassachusetts say the Governors have united; we need to get cost \ncontrols on Medicaid.\n  This will mean a monumental increase in the cost of Medicaid. I think \nI can say that very plainly and very easily. I want to make sure \neverybody is aware of that.\n  Let me mention a couple of other reasons we should be opposed to this \namendment.\n  Some people say ``process.'' Did we have a hearing on this bill? No. \nDid we have a markup on this bill? No. Was one even requested? I don't \nthink so. The Democrats are in control of the\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nSenate. Senator Baucus is chairman of the Finance Committee. If he \nwanted to have a markup on this bill, he could have done that.\n  I see the sponsor of the legislation. I will ask her. Have we had a \nhearing on this bill, and have we had a markup on this bill in the \nFinance Committee?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I think my friend from Oklahoma knows \nthat in fact that did not have a hearing. That is not unusual. That \nhappens sometimes in the process. I have only been here 1\\1/2\\ years. \nBut there are many times when that has occurred. The Senator is \ncorrect. That has not occurred on this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me ask another question. Is it not correct that your \nbill will increase the cost of drugs going into the Medicaid system?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would argue that that is not the case, absolutely \nnot. Under the program right now, States operate with companies, and I \ndon't have any indication whatsoever that it is going to increase the \ncost of Medicaid. I certainly would have to object to that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will make the case that it does. I believe I will show \nthat GAO happens to agree with me. GAO has studied this issue. They \nbasically said it boils down to the fact that if everybody gets a \ndiscount, nobody gets a discount. That is the economics of it.\n  Right now, you have a system where Medicaid gets the best price. \nMedicaid gets the best price--lowest price--in the country. But if \neverybody gets it, nobody gets it. If everybody gets a 15-percent \ndiscount, that is the price. This is not a discount. That is exactly \nwhat we are doing here. You are going to increase the cost of Medicaid \nby not giving a discount. Does that mean everybody's drug costs are \ngoing down? Actually, no. It means the discount or the best price is \ngoing up.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not yield. I want to make a lot of comments, and \nI will be happy to discuss it. But I only have limited time. I want to \nmake sure I make all of these points.\n  No. 1, this is an important issue. It hasn't had a hearing.\n  This committee is now controlled by the Democrats. It has been for a \nyear and we haven't had a hearing. I don't know that one has been \nrequested. I am on the committee, and I am on the subcommittee.\n  Some people say that is not insignificant, that we do a lot of \nthings.\n  When you are talking about major issues--and we are talking about \nprescription drugs for all of our seniors--we should have a hearing on \nthis. We should have a markup.\n  There happens to be, collectively, on the Finance Committee hundreds \nof years of experience dealing with Medicare, Medicaid, and \nprescription drugs. A lot of us are willing to put some input into it. \nThat is the reason we have the committee process.\n  I am ashamed of the way the Senate is operating today in this \nfashion. We are taking probably the most important and most expensive \npiece of legislation considered in decades and it hasn't had a hearing, \nit hasn't had a markup, and it hasn't had a scoring by the \nCongressional Budget Office--none of the above--and yet we are in the \nprocess of marking it up. We are going to have votes on Tuesday on a \nproposal that nobody has a clue about how much it costs.\n  On one of these proposals, some say it will cost $500 billion. Others \nsay it is closer to $800 billion. Although, they forgot to tell that it \nonly lasts a few years, and it is sunset. Then we will stop paying for \nprescription drugs. No entitlement sunsets after a few years. If \nsomebody thinks we are going to start paying for prescription drugs and \nthen we are going to stop, that is more than hypothetical. That is \nmisleading.\n\n  If we are talking about trying to put corporate officers in jail for \nmisleading financial statements, we ought it be ashamed of what we are \ndoing in the Senate. We are taking up the biggest expansion of an \nentitlement program, and no one has a clue about how much it costs. And \nwe are going to say we are fiscally responsible? Shame on us. We do it \nwithout a hearing, without a markup, and without scoring from the \nCongressional Budget Office. That is a really poor way to legislate. \nThat is the way you get things started, and you later say: Wow, I had \nno idea it would cost this much.\n  Let me be a little more specific about the amendment of my colleague \nand friends from Michigan.\n  Very seldom do we legislate by intervening ourselves before a case \ngoes before the Supreme Court and say this is the way we mean for it to \nbe. We usually let the Supreme Court make the decision. This issue is \nbefore the Supreme Court. The position of the Senator from Michigan \nlost at the district court level. Then she won at the circuit court \nlevel, which has now brought the case before the Supreme Court. But we \nare going to intervene before the Court and say: Oh, here is what we \nmean. Rewrite the law.\n  Basically, we are going to say: All right, under the Medicaid system, \nwhich gives a discount--the best price for Medicaid beneficiaries, low-\nincome beneficiaries--we are going to say that is applicable to anybody \nthe State deems eligible.\n  Guess what. A lot of States have programs for drugs that have no \nlimitation on income.\n  Senator Kennedy mentioned three times that we need this program. He \nsaid the Senator from Michigan is trying to help the neediest and the \npoorest of the poor.\n  I looked up in the State of Massachusetts. This drug program has no \nincome limitation. You could be a billionaire in Massachusetts and you \nwould be benefitting from this program. This has is no direct \nrelationship to income.\n  In the State of New York, it is 419 percent of the poverty level. \nThat is about $50,000 for a couple.\n  So this idea of saying this just applies to the neediest--no, this is \nhijacking. That happens to be the word used at the district court \nlevel--a program that was targeted to benefit the low-income people and \nsay, wait a minute, we want it to apply to a lot of other people who do \nnot need the income eligibility of Medicaid.\n  We are going to take a discount program that was designed and \ntargeted to help low-income people and say it applies to a lot of \npeople, let's make it apply to everybody.\n  Really, what you are talking about are price controls. But what you \nare talking about is saying, we are going to take a discount right now \nthat is targeted towards low-income people, and we are going to spread \nit around to a lot of other people who aren't low-income, and who in \nsome cases have unlimited income. Does that really make sense?\n  Let me give you an analogy. Maybe sometimes economics arguments are \nhard to follow, and maybe with prescription drugs it is harder than \nothers. Let us take an example.\n  I see my good friend and colleague from New Hampshire. He is the \nformer Governor of New Hampshire. As Governor, he purchased automobiles \nfor the highway patrol and for the State police. My guess is that, as \nGovernors, they get a good deal for the automobiles that are sold to \nthe highway patrol and to the State police. He probably buys hundreds \nof them. Certainly, in a large State such as New York, or Michigan, \nthey buy hundreds, and maybe thousands. So they get a good discounts. \nThey get a better deal than the average consumer.\n  But if you are going to say, wait a minute, let us not just give this \nto the police, and a volume discount to the State, let us just give \nthis to basically anybody in the State. That sounds pretty good, \ndoesn't it? We are all going to get a good deal.\n  Guess what happens now. The price at which they were selling to the \nState before has just gone up.\n  In other words, if everybody gets the discount, nobody gets a \ndiscount. You are going to find out that the savings that the highway \npatrol had by buying several hundred vehicles just disappeared because \nthey are not going to get any better deal than anybody else on the \nstreet.\n  That, in effect, is what is going to happen if we adopt the Stabenow \namendment. This is a costly amendment if we are going apply this \ndiscount that Medicaid now gives on best price for Medicaid to every \nState program--and some State programs are quite generous. I mentioned \nfor the State of New York it applies to individuals up to 419 percent \nof poverty; for a couple, incomes up to $50,000. In Massachusetts, \nthere is no income limit.\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\n  So if you make it apply--incidentally, under this amendment, a \nGovernor could say: For any drug sold in my State, I am going to have \nit come under this agreement because I want to offer low-priced drugs \nto anybody who comes in the State of Oklahoma. So if that is the State \nprogram, then every drug would fall under this program. So the net \nresult is, everybody gets a discount. Let's break out the champagne. \nThis is a great deal.\n  What you have done is, you have taken away--if that is the case--the \ndiscount for the low-income people on Medicaid and just taken it and \nspread it out to everybody else. Is that really what we want to do?\n  If we adopt the Stabenow amendment, I am just telling you right now, \nyou are eliminating the discount, you are eliminating the low-targeted \nsubsidy that we are now giving low-income people. So if everybody gets \nthe discount, nobody gets the discount. You have just targeted and, \nquite frankly, greatly increased the cost of the Medicaid Program. You \nhave increased the cost of what is targeted towards low-income people, \nthe people who really need the help.\n  Keep in mind, this is not targeted to seniors. I have read the \nStabenow amendment very closely, and it does not say anything about \nincome limits. As a matter of fact, it says: Hey, you don't have to \nmeet income limits in Medicaid. You don't have to meet eligibility. You \ndon't have to be unemployed. You don't have to be uninsured to benefit \nunder this amendment. It applies to almost everybody.\n  If the Governor and the legislature write a program broad enough, \nanybody can apply. Anybody would. So everybody gets a discount. How \ngreat is that? It means that nobody gets a discount. This is the impact \nof this amendment.\n  It is going to increase costs, as well as costs to the Federal \nGovernment. Maybe this thing will become law. Mark my words, we will \njust write it down. Today is July 18. Don Nickles says if this \namendment passes, you are going to see Medicaid costs go up. We will \nfind out. Some of us will be here for a while. Sometimes we do things \nthat have results. This will result in Medicaid costs going up.\n  So the very people we think we are trying to help--whoa, wait a \nminute, we are not helping Medicaid people; we are hurting Medicaid \npeople because they will have to pay more for their drugs. They will \nlose their discount. This discount will be spread out amongst a lot of \nother people.\n  Let me make a couple other comments.\n  It not just me saying it. This is not my hypothetical situation: \nWell, Don Nickles says: Wait a minute, this may backfire.\n  The General Accounting Office did a report. I will read part of this \nand then include it in the Record:\n  In an August 2000 report, the GAO determined:\n\n       The larger the group that would be newly entitled to \n     receive a federal price, the greater the incentive for drug \n     manufacturers to raise that price. The Medicaid rebate \n     experience suggests how federal and nonfederal drug price \n     discounts could change if Medicare beneficiaries had access \n     to the same price discounts available to federal purchasers. \n     Following the enactment of the rebate program, discounts for \n     outpatient drugs decreased significantly because \n     manufacturers raised the prices they charge large private \n     purchasers.\n\n  That is from the General Accounting Office. That is looking at the \nfacts after we enacted the discount program some time ago. They are \nsaying, if you expand that base of people eligible for a discount, \ncosts are going to go up. It is just a fact.\n  The other thing is, the Stabenow amendment harms Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. It will raise drug prices in Medicaid and raise Medicaid \nProgram costs at a time when States can least afford it.\n  I will mention something from the administration. I have a note from \nthem:\n\n       The administration opposes any change in the Medicaid law \n     that would increase Medicaid drug prices and reduce Medicaid \n     coverage. This is what the Stabenow amendment would do. \n     Medicaid law has always focused on what is best for Medicaid \n     beneficiaries. The administration opposes changes in the \n     Medicaid law that would harm Medicaid beneficiaries. The \n     administration said this is what the Stabenow amendment would \n     do. That is exactly what this amendment would do--exactly.\n\n  I do not find this to be rocket science. You just tell everybody they \nare going to be able to get a discount, then nobody gets a discount. \nMedicaid? Sorry, you are going to have to pay more. They do get a \ndiscount now. They do get the best price. They do get the lowest price \nof anybody in the country. But if you make that applicable to everybody \nin the country, then nobody gets it. That is what is going to happen.\n  I am just kind of against that people think: Oh, yeah, we will just \ndo this, and this will save money. It is going to cost money. It is \ngoing to cost money from people who can least afford it. And it is \ngoing to greatly exacerbate the problems that many of our States right \nnow are struggling with, and struggling with greatly. So I just wanted \nto mention that. I think it is important.\n  I will mention two or three things. Let's not increase the cost of \nMedicaid. That is what this amendment would do.\n  No. 2, let's not intervene in a case before the Supreme Court. That \nis pretty foolish.\n  How many of us really studied this case? How many of us have studied \nthe Maine law? How many of us have studied the idea that: Oh, yes, we \nare going to say that this program, that was designed for Medicaid, \nshould really be applicable to all programs?\n  Is that really a smart thing to do? Does it have some delusion or \nsome negative impact on one small group if you say it applies to \neverybody? I think it is very shortsighted.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. And if, for \nwhatever reason, this amendment is adopted, I will tell my friend and \ncolleague from Michigan, I am going to offer an amendment, and the \namendment is going to have the effect to guarantee that the amendment \nwould not have an adverse impact on Medicaid.\n  My colleague stated, with assurances: Oh, I am sure it will not \nincrease Medicaid costs. The administration says it would. GAO says it \nwould. I think anybody who looks at it says it would. But if she is \nthat confident, then I hope she will accept my amendment that says the \nproposal will not be effective if it is proven to have an adverse or \nincreased cost in Medicaid drug prices.\n\n  I will have that amendment later should her amendment prevail. I hope \nit does not prevail. I think it is a mistake.\n  There is a reason we have a committee process. The reason we have a \ncommittee process is we have two different ideas on this and two \ndifferent opinions. We could have experts come in and testify, and they \ncould say exactly what they think the results would be of the Stabenow \namendment.\n  We have not had that opportunity. I would love to have that. I will \nbe happy to participate in a hearing on it next week, next month, 2 \nmonths from now, and find out what the experts think, the people who \nare in charge of CMS, the old HCFA. Let's see what they have to say. \nLet's see what other experts say.\n  Let's hear from Governors who not only have Medicaid that they are \nwrestling with, but other programs. Hey, there are some pluses and \nminuses in it for them. After all, they have to pay part of it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am wondering if you are saying for the future, then, \nany amendment that comes to the floor that has not gone through a \ncommittee or subcommittee, you intend to oppose from here on out? Is \nthat correct, for as long as you and I are here in the Senate, you \nwould, in fact, oppose any amendment that comes before us that way?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I tell my friend and colleague, I think the committee \nprocess is being totally ignored by the present leadership in the \nSenate.\n  Ms. STABENOW. But does that mean you will, in the future--as opposed \nto what has happened in the past--object to anything that comes to the \nfloor, any amendment that comes to the floor that has not gone through \nthe committee process? I would be interested in knowing if, in fact, \nthat is your position.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would not go that far. But I tell my colleague, I will \nbe\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nhappy to join her in requesting Senator Baucus to have a hearing on her \nproposal as soon as possible. Let's bring in the experts. Let's see \nwhat they have to say.\n  I am a little bit chapped at the fact that I had been in the Senate \nfor about 16-some years before I even got on the Finance Committee, and \nnow it is not working. It has the reputation of being one of the most \npowerful, great committees, and it does not meet.\n  The chairman of the committee does not call meetings on this. We have \nnot had a markup on the prescription drug bill. I would liked to have \ninput. I would like to be able to offer an amendment. And I would like \nto have testimony so we can find out what the substance of the proposal \nis, what the impact will be. How much will it cost States? How much \nwill it increase Medicaid costs?\n  I heard somebody say: Well, we think it would increase Medicaid costs \nby $1 billion or a couple of billion dollars. I think it may be a lot \nmore than that. But I would like to know. Well, we don't know. We have \nnot had estimates. It would be nice to have CMS give us an estimate.\n  Have we had the chance to do that? No. Because we have not had a \nhearing. I don't believe a hearing was requested, but it should have \nbeen. And the chairman of the committee should have agreed.\n  I will just tell my colleague, I am happy to participate in a hearing \nso we can get the facts out. But to change a program totally, and say, \nOK, we are going to have price controls and discounts for one group, \nand now we are going to expand it for everybody, with these great \nsavings, assuming that everybody is going to get the savings--the net \nresult is, nobody is going to get the savings. Instead of everybody \ngetting a discount, nobody is going to get a discount. And that is the \nunfortunate result.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield.\n  That is the unfortunate result of her amendment. It is just too bad \nthat we bypassed the committee. I don't know why the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the ranking member are not saying: Wait a minute, \nthis might be a good proposal. Let's have a hearing on it. We will mark \nit up. We will consider it.\n  We haven't done that; again, for something that involves State after \nState, a Supreme Court decision that will be made in probably a few \nmonths. We are going to interject ourselves with a trivial amount of \ndebate on the floor, and we will have Senators vote on it and probably \nnot half a dozen Senators have looked at the amendment in any detail. \nThat is not a good way to legislate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do not support Senator Stabenow's \namendment No. 4305 to S. 812 to amend section 1927 of the Social \nSecurity Act. As my colleague Senator Nickles pointed out during \ndebate, this amendment raises important policy and budgetary questions \nthat have not yet been considered by the Senate during a hearing or a \ncommittee mark-up. The far-reaching nature of this amendment deserves \nserious consideration by Congress prior to a vote. Additionally, at \npresent there are pending legal decisions related to matters addressed \nin this amendment, and I believe it is worthwhile to await the decision \nof the courts prior to enactment of this amendment. For these reasons, \nI do not support this amendment, but I reserve the right to re-evaluate \nthe matter at a later date.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, what is the order now? We were \nallocated time to different individuals, and then at the conclusion of \nthat we were going to recognize the Senator from Michigan to make final \ncomments. I think Senator Gregg is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes \nand the Senator from Michigan has 5 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it was my understanding that I had 5 \nminutes plus 7 minutes which would have been 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That was my understanding as well. I think the Senator \nwas recognized for 5 minutes and then when they extended the time of \nthe Senator from Michigan, I think they extended the time of the \nSenator from New Hampshire as well. I would ask that he be accorded the \n12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand there is a desire not to have us go to a vote \nuntil 5:40 or so. So there is extra time here. I would suggest that I \ntake 12 minutes and the Senator from Michigan take 12 minutes, that we \nequally divide the time between now and 5:40, and then, at 5:40, \nproceed to a vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is satisfactory to me. I generally try to check \nwith our leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think, for the benefit of the Members, the time for \nthe vote will be at 5:40.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me first associate myself with the excellent comments \nmade by the Senator from Oklahoma who has made most of the points I \nwould have made but made them with more energy and eloquence.\n  If you look at this proposal which has come forward, offered by the \nSenator from Michigan, essentially its outcome will be that the \ndiscounts allowed under Medicaid, which States get for their Medicaid \nrecipients, which are significant discounts--nobody should \nunderestimate, these are big discounts which drug companies that make \nyour product are required to give to the States through the Medicaid \nprocess--those discounts under the proposal of the Senator from \nMichigan, those discounts will now be transferable to a whole new \npopulation of people, a very large, potentially very large population \nof people.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma pointed out rather correctly, that \npopulation is not necessarily going to be means tested, not necessarily \ngoing to be of need. It could simply be a population which qualifies \nfor this new discount under a State plan.\n  As a result, what you are going to do is end up for those drugs \nsignificantly reducing the revenues which flow to whoever produced that \ndrug. What is the impact of that? Assuming that this is not a situation \nwhere the people who produced the drug are charitable organizations but \nare, rather, organizations which, in order to be able to produce that \ndrug, had to go out and borrow money from somebody through the capital \nmarkets or through actual borrowing in order to be able to raise enough \nmoney to be able to bring that drug to market, remembering that the \naverage cost to bring a drug to market in America today is somewhere \nbetween $500 million and $800 million and it takes somewhere between 10 \nand 12 years, assuming that this is not a charitable organization, then \nthat company, in order to be successful, those people who invented that \ndrug, who created that drug, who put their life into that drug for 12 \nyears, managed to manufacture it after going through all the hurdles--\nand believe me, there are an unlimited number of hurdles, an incredible \nnumber of hurdles, at incredible expense, had to go out and line up \ntheir financing to do this--those people are going to have to raise the \ncost to somebody else. Because they still have to pay off the people \nwho financed the drug. They have to give a reasonable return to the \npeople who invested in that company or they are not going to be able to \nproduce another drug. The drug that they produce may put them into \nbankruptcy for all intents and purposes, if they can't get a fair \nrecovery on it.\n\n  What is the practical implication? Essentially what we are doing here \nis another example of saying: The big, bad, greedy drug companies, they \ncan take the hit no matter what. They can take the hit. We have seen it \nhappen out here on the floor. We have heard the argument from the other \nside. We can just do this because the big, bad drug companies are going \nto take the hit.\n  Let's remember what we are talking about. We are talking about one of \nthe most important elements of our society, organizations which are \nproducing products which are making American lives better, longer, and \nmore healthy. Is it our goal to fundamentally undermine the capacity to \ndo that? If we continue on this course--and this is obviously not the \nmost extreme example of it, but this is a clear example of price \ncontrols and an attempt to drive\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\ndown the return on the ability of somebody to produce a product, which \nsaves lives--if we continue on this process, we are essentially going \nto be plucking the feathers, rather aggressively, of the guys who are \nlaying the lifesaving drug.\n  In the end we are not going to have a whole lot of gooses or they are \ngoing to be geese that don't have enough ability to produce those \nlifesaving drugs anymore because they don't have any feathers left on \ntheir bodies. This is really pretty obvious, if you think about it \nlogically.\n  Capital in a marketplace system--I understand this is an elementary \nconcept which has escaped some people in the Government--flows where it \ngets a return. That is just simple fundamentals. By capital I mean \nmoney which allows people to invest in products, which creates jobs, \nand create items that give us as a nation a better chance to compete \ninternationally but, more importantly, gives our American people a \nbetter standard of life.\n  Capital flows where it gets the best return. If you reduce radically \nor even if you reduce incrementally but in a way that is basically \npyramiding on top of itself like straw on a camel's back, if you \ncontinue to reduce the ability of the people who are creating the new \ndrugs which are saving lives to have a viable market to go into and get \ncapital; in other words, to be able to go to somebody who is willing to \nlend them money or willing to invest in their business and expects a \nreasonable return, if you reduce their ability to get a reasonable \nreturn or to pay that debt, you inevitably reduce the amount of drugs \ncoming to the marketplace that will benefit citizens.\n  In the process, you cut our productivity, cut our national \ncompetitiveness, and take what is a very vibrant part of our economy \nand undermine it.\n  I realize it is great politics to come to the floor of the Senate and \nclaim that if we do this we will be helping the poor. We will be \nhelping the indigent, helping people who need help. That is great \npolitics. But if you are not producing the drugs, you are not helping \nanybody. If that lifesaving drug, that drug that is going to give \npeople a better way of life, isn't going to come to market because the \npeople who produce it can't get the money to make it because they can't \ngo in the capital markets and get a decent return, then you are not \nhelping anybody. It is a fraud to come to the floor and claim you are \nhelping all these people. There was a statistic, which I found most \ninteresting, cited today by a colleague on the other side of the aisle. \nThey said that in the biotech industry today there are a thousand \nfirms, but only a hundred of them have products on the market, and we \nare really excited to think the next 900 are going to come to market \nwith their products.\n\n  Well, if we continue to pluck this goose, those 900 firms are not \ngoing to come to market with their products because they are not going \nto have the financial strength to survive the 9, 10, 11, 12 years it \ntakes to get to market with their product. It takes money, cash, \ncapital flowing into those companies--and paying the employees, by the \nway. It doesn't happen to go to somebody making a gazillion dollars; it \ngoes to the employee. It takes money, cash, and capital to fund that \nperiod from the time you think of the product, from the time you invent \nthat concept, from the time it germinates as an idea in some wonderful \nscientist's mind, to get it to the market, and $500 million to $800 \nmillion. So those 900 companies that are out there that don't have a \nproduct on the market, but if those products come to the market--this \nwas their point--those products will save hundreds of thousands of \nlives.\n  Those products are not going to be there if we continue on this path \nof, every time we turn around, taking another nick--a fairly \nsignificant nick--out of the ability of those companies to be viable.\n  Are those companies evil and greedy because they want to bring to the \nmarketplace something that is going to improve the lives, or extend the \nlives, and improve the quality of life of Americans--and, well, yes, be \nsold in Canada for less because they take advantage of all our \nresearch, in a very mercenary way, as does the rest of the world? No. \nThey want to produce a product that is going to improve the quality of \nlife of Americans; and they are willing to do it, willing to put at \nrisk their time, effort, brain power, and their resources, including \ncash and capital.\n  But the argument on this floor is they are greedy, so let's just shut \ndown their capacity to do that. And then, at the same time, we are out \nhere claiming: But we are going to have a wonderful, viable drug \nindustry in this country, and we are going to continue to be on the \ncutting edge.\n  Well, we are not. We cannot continue to say to people who are \nproducing products you can't get a fair return on your product and \nexpect that they are going to continue to produce their products.\n  This amendment is not overwhelmingly egregious, but it is one more \nstraw on the back of the ability of the marketplace to move their \ncapital into the production of quality health care products versus \nmoving it into who knows what--software for video games or movies that \nare violent or whatever else for which the capital gets a better \nreturn.\n  The basic element of this amendment is that we are going to take a \nvery limited program, which demands that people sell a product at \nsignificantly less than what the market will bear, and should bear, in \norder to give a reasonable return and demand that it be spread across a \nwhole new population. And as a result, that population will get a lower \ncost drug, no question about it. But somebody else is going to have to \npay more for the ones that come to market and are put under that \nsystem. It is like a balloon, when you squeeze it in one place, it pops \nout in another place. Other people--probably those on an insurance \nprogram--will pay more. So their insurance will go up and maybe they \nwill become uninsured. We can also talk about that. More importantly, \nfewer people are going to be willing to pursue the path of producing \nquality drugs because you are not going to be able to go into the \nmarketplace and get the capital to do it. That is what this debate \ncomes down to--whether this feel good, ``I care about everybody'' \nconcept that says that the way you feel good and you care is you \nbasically say the drug companies are greedy, the production is greedy, \nthe biotechs are greedy, and you drive their price down so they can no \nlonger compete, but for a while at least people get a lower cost drug.\n\n  I will admit there will be a window where you will be successful. But \n4 or 5 years from now, or 8 years or 10 years from now when that drug \nthat might have addressed the issue of Alzheimer's, or of arthritis or \naddressed the issue of arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or any \nnumber of diseases, that drug didn't come to the market because the \nperson who had the idea could not get the money in the capital market \nto finance the 8 to 12 years and the $500 million to $800 million to \nbring it to market because there was not a market that generated that \nkind of return. Have we done a lot of good for the American people \nthen? I don't think so.\n  So as we move down this road, we have to be balanced. Good ideas may \nflow, things that seem appropriate to the moment. We can throw them \nout, but let's evaluate them in the context of what their ultimate \noutcome will be.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I may use all my 10 seconds. I will reserve that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is difficult for me to know where to begin with all \nof this what I view as misinformation. I will at least clarify what I \nbelieve to be the facts regarding the situation in the bill and, beyond \nthe bill, the general issue regarding the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Clinton and Leahy be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I find it interesting, there is great concern about \nexpanding discounts to people who are not on Medicaid. Do you know what \nis unfair in this country right now? The only people who pay retail, \nthe only people who pay the highest prices in the world are people who \nare uninsured. No insurance company pays retail. Every insurance \ncompany, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, or any company, gets a \ndiscount. The States as well--when we\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\nbuy for the VA hospital, the Federal Government--we negotiate a \ndiscount. Under Medicaid, we have given the States the ability to get \nwhat is, frankly, a modest discount--15 percent on brand name drugs, 11 \npercent on generics. So they don't pay retail. Nobody pays retail. \nEverybody gets a discount, except for one group--the uninsured in this \ncountry.\n  The majority of those using prescriptions who are uninsured are our \nsenior citizens--the seniors and the disabled of this country. How \nunfair that we would think they, too, should get a discount. This \namendment only affects those who are uninsured. Why? Because everybody \nelse already gets a discount. So if you vote no on this, you are saying \nthis system right now that allows States to get discounts under \nMedicaid, the Federal Government for the VA, Blue Cross Blue Shield, \nand every other system--our own insurance system as Federal employees, \nwe don't pay retail--if you vote no, you are saying the only people who \ndon't deserve a discount from retail are uninsured seniors and \nfamilies. The folks who are not seniors--most of those who are \nuninsured work and they work for small businesses. Those small \nbusinesses are struggling every day to provide health care and they are \nseeing premiums go up 30 to 40 percent a year, and most of that is \nbecause of prescription drugs.\n  This is a modest amendment. This is an amendment that simply says our \nStates that are struggling right now, both to pay for Medicaid and also \nto provide some kind of lower cost prescriptions for their citizens, \nmostly seniors who don't have insurance, ought to be able to use the \ncreativity of a State, the great ``laboratories of democracy'' that I \nhear about all the time from my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--let them continue to do what they are doing, be creative to \nlower prices.\n  I might just quote something that was quoted earlier today by my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, and that is my own Governor of the State \nof Michigan, who is leading the National Governors Association. We have \nmeeting now Governors who are concerned about prescription drug costs \nand wanting to provide programs for their citizens, being sued, many of \nthem, because they want to expand the discount for lower prices, to be \ncreative like Maine and Vermont.\n  We had from Governor Engler:\n\n       The Nation's Governors are extremely disappointed with the \n     course of action chosen by PhRMA, said NGA chairman Michigan \n     Governor John Engler. It is unfortunate that their \n     organization feels compelled to use the court system to \n     manipulate public policy. With pharmacy costs alone rising 15 \n     to 20 percent each year, all purchasers, including the \n     manufacturers themselves, are using tools that manage costs \n     while maintaining quality and access to affordable \n     pharmaceuticals.\n\n  That is about an optional program to say to the States: If you choose \nto be creative and use your leverage under Medicaid to expand a \ndiscount to people who do not get a discount, who are the only people \nwho do not get a discount, who are the uninsured, mostly seniors, that \nyou can do that.\n  I commend the administration because under this administration, the \nBush administration, the Solicitor General, Theodore Olson, went to \ncourt in support of the Maine plan. He said in his brief:\n\n       The initiative should be allowed to go forward without \n     further intervention.\n\n  Olson argued:\n\n       States enjoy a broad measure of flexibility in tailoring \n     the scope and coverage of their Medicaid plans and that court \n     review of Maine Rx was not warranted.\n\n  I commend him and the administration for stepping in on the side of \nStates rights, which is what this is all about. This is about States \nrights. It is not about concerns about the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I understand they will fight everything, they have been fighting \neverything, they will continue to fight everything. There is no \nquestion about that. We fully expect their arguments to be put forward \non this floor.\n  I wish to make two other points; that is, when we talk about the \nindustry as a whole and the concern that maybe the uninsured would get \nthe same discounts as people with insurance, and what that would do to \nthe poor pharmaceutical companies, we need to look at what the real \npicture is today economically with this industry as we are concerned \nabout making sure our seniors pay, when they walk into a local \npharmacy, the highest prices in the world.\n  A study that was put out yesterday by Families USA shows some \nstartling comparisons. We all want research. We want those new \nlifesaving drugs. Unfortunately, 80 percent of the new patents being \napproved by the FDA are ``me too'' drugs, not new lifesaving drugs, but \nwe want those.\n  I am deeply concerned about the direction of the companies. The \npharmaceutical company is more about being a sales machine, sales and \nmarketing, quarterly reports and profits than about creating new \nlifesaving drugs, and that is of deep concern to me as to the future \nfor all of us in health care.\n  A number of companies were outlined yesterday. As an example, Merck \nspends 5 percent on research and development; 15 percent profits last \nyear, there were three times more profits than what was spent on R \nand 13 percent was spent on advertising, marketing, and administration. \nIt is almost three times as much on advertising and marketing and three \ntimes more in profits than they are spending on R\n  Pfizer received 1\\1/2\\ times more in profits than they spent on \nresearch and development, more than two times more on advertising, \nmarketing, and administration than on research and development. It is a \npattern that continues. R is not the top expenditure of the companies \ntoday.\n\n  When we look at the individuals, it is difficult for me, representing \nthe great State of Michigan where people work hard every day for a \nliving, most people working hard for that paycheck, concerned about \ntheir kids, whether they are going to be able to send them to college, \nwhether they can afford their health care, working hard every day, and \nthen we hear we cannot possibly lower prescription drug prices, we \ncannot possibly even get them down to the rate of inflation--they are \ngoing up an average of three times the rate of inflation--we could not \npossibly give a 15-percent discount to uninsured seniors.\n  Then we look at the numbers, and we see astounding salaries in the \ndrug companies. I mentioned this morning--not to be personal but this \nis public information--the comparisons are astounding. The former \nchairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers, $74.9 million last year in earnings \nand, in addition, $76.1 million in unexercised stock options.\n  We have been talking in this Chamber about corporate responsibility \nand integrity and, I would argue, morality. What is the morality of \nhuge, tens of millions of dollars in salaries and huge amounts of \nprofits, and when we say just get the prices in line so people can \nafford these new lifesaving drugs so they are not cutting the pills in \nhalf, taking them every other day--worst yet, not affording them at \nall--and we are told, no, nothing can be done, nothing can be done. \nThey fight every single attempt to rein in prices or expand coverage.\n  This is a fundamental battle, I believe. I think we are needing to \nhelp an industry save itself and get back to its soul, which is \nresearch and development in new drugs, and to get back in touch with \nthe American people.\n  I commend the States that are involved right now. They are close to \nthe people. They are close to the people in their States and they know, \nthey hear the stories every day, and they are trying to do something. \nThey want us to act. I do not know if we are going to be able to get \nthis all the way through. I certainly hope so, and I will do everything \nI can humanly do to work with my colleagues to make it happen.\n  In the meantime, the States are trying to help. We have 30 States \nthat are doing something in the area of prescription drugs trying to \nhelp, and we have States being sued by the drug lobby because they are \ntrying to help.\n  I will simply say, as we bring this debate to a close, that this is \nan amendment that does not force a State to do anything. It only \naffects the States that want to expand their drug discounts to those \nwithout coverage. It is an issue of flexibility.\n  The administration has gone on record in support of the Maine project \nwhich we use as an example of what can be done, and we appreciate that. \nIt will stop unnecessary litigation. I know there is a great deal of \nconcern by my colleagues about unnecessary\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nlitigation. It will allow States to stop spending money on litigation \nand put money in essential services, such as being able to make \navailable prescription drugs to their citizens.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in support of this bipartisan--\ntripartisan--amendment this evening and send a message that we support \nour States and we support their right to be involved in putting \ntogether efforts to lower prices and make lifesaving medicine available \nto their citizens.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 97, the nays are 1. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With today's vote, the Senate will confirm its 11th judge \nto our Federal Courts of Appeals and our 59th judicial nominee since \nthe change in Senate majority little more than\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\none year ago. The Senate confirmed the first Court of Appeals judge \nnominated by President Bush on July 20 last year and now, less than one \nyear later we are confirming the 11th. That is almost one per month.\n  By contrast, the Republican majority that preceded us averaged seven \nCourt of Appeals confirmations every 12 months. During an entire \nsession of Congress, 1996, the Republican majority allowed no circuit \ncourt nominees to be confirmed, not one. The Republican majority \nconfirmed 46 Court of Appeals judges in 78 months. While they were in \nthe majority vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than doubled, \ngoing from 16 to 33. Since the change in majority the numbers are going \nin the right direction--vacancies are going down and confirmations have \nsignificantly increased. We would be doing even better with a little \ncooperation from the Administration and the Republican leadership, \nwhich created roadblocks to the consideration of all judicial \nnominations by the full Senate since May.\n  The nominee voted on today, Richard Clifton, was one of the 78 \nnominees to receive a hearing in the first year since the \nreorganization of the Judiciary Committee on July 10, 2001. In that \nperiod, we held more hearings for more circuit court nominees than in \nany of the prior six years of Republican control. In fact, we have had \nhearings for more judicial nominees in the past year than in 20 of the \nlast 22 years under Republican or Democratic presidents. Those who wish \nto paint the Senate as obstructionist ignore the facts and the fair \ntreatment by the Senate of President Bush's judicial nominees. They \nfocus instead on the most controversial nominees who do take more time, \nrather than the vast majority who have received hearings and been \nconfirmed in bipartisan votes of the Senate. They would rather use \nmisleading percentage calculations that obscure the fact that the \nDemocratic-led Senate is considering President George Bush's nominees \nat one of the fastest paces in recent history.\n  I commend Senators Inouye and Akaka for the statesmanship they have \nshown in connection with this nomination. I remember very well their \nimportant efforts to establish the Hawaii seat on the Ninth Circuit and \nto try to fill it with a qualified nominee. I voted with them and \nsupported their effort to ensure that every State, even States as small \nas Hawaii and Vermont, are represented on our Courts of Appeals.\n  I recall the saga of the nomination of James Duffy to fill the Hawaii \nseat on the Ninth Circuit, how hard they worked to find a consensus \nnominee and how that nomination was stalled for years. Despite the \n``Well Qualified'' rating he received from the ABA and the strong \nsupport of both his home-state Senators, Mr. Duffy never received a \nhearing or a vote. He was nominated at the beginning of 1999 and \nremained pending for over two full years until it was withdrawn by \nPresident Bush in March 2001 without any Senate action of any kind.\n  Despite that recent history, the Hawaii Senators support Mr. Clifton \nfor that same vacancy. In contrast to the treatment that Mr. Duffy \nreceived, Mr. Clifton's nomination was scheduled for a hearing less \nthan 60 days after his file and paperwork were completed. Mr. Duffy \nwaited 791 days and never got a hearing. When partisan critics charge \nDemocrats with tit-for-tat and seeking revenge, they ignore the facts. \nThe confirmation of Richard Clifton is another example of Democrats \ntreating President Bush's judicial nominees far better than Republicans \ntreated President Clinton's.\n  Today's vote on Mr. Clifton's nomination should provide some relief \nto the Ninth Circuit, which has four vacancies that have been \nclassified as ``judicial emergency'' vacancies by the U.S. Courts. Two \nof those vacancies are more than five years old. They date back to 1996 \nand 1997, and there were two outstanding nominees to those seats. I \nhave mentioned the nomination of James Duffy. The other nominee was \nBarry Goode of California, whose nomination also languished for years \nwithout ever getting a hearing or a vote.\n  When Barry Goode was first nominated to a Ninth Circuit vacancy in \n1998 it was already a judicial emergency. Both of his home-state \nSenators supported the nomination but the Republican leadership refused \nto act. Mr. Goode was nominated not once, not twice, but three times to \nthe Ninth Circuit and he never was given the courtesy of a hearing or a \nvote during almost 1,000 days (998 days). In March of 2001, President \nBush withdrew Mr. Goode's nomination but he has not nominated anyone to \nthis judicial emergency vacancy. It remains one of a number of judicial \nemergency vacancies for which there is no nominee and one of the 43 \njudicial vacancies for which there is no nominee.\n  The Ninth Circuit vacancies are a prime and unfortunate legacy of the \npartisan obstructionist practices during the Republican control of the \nSenate. Some are now complaining that a few nominees are waiting a year \nfor hearing. Even though the anniversary of the reorganized Judiciary \nCommittee with a Democratic majority was July 10, and we have already \nheld hearings for 16 Court of Appeals nominees among the 78 total \njudicial nominees who had hearings in our first year.\n  I also recall how all confirmations to the Ninth Circuit from \nCalifornia were stalled by the demands of a Republican Senator not from \nthat State to be given the ability to name a Court of Appeals judge \nfrom his State. With the support of the Republican leadership in the \nSenate, that Republican Senator succeeded in getting President Clinton \nto accord him that prerogative in order to break that logjam.\n  Just as the May 9th hearing on Mr. Clifton's nomination was the first \nhearing on a Ninth Circuit nominee in two years, earlier this year we \nhad the first hearing for a Sixth Circuit nominee, Judge Gibbons, in \nalmost five years. Similarly, the hearing we held on the nomination of \nJudge Edith Clement to the Fifth Circuit last year was the first on a \nFifth Circuit nominee in seven years and she was the first new \nappellate judge confirmed to that Court in six years. When we held a \nhearing on the nomination of Judge Harris Hartz to the Tenth Circuit \nlast year, it was the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit nominee in six \nyears and he was the first new appellate judge confirmed to that Court \nin six years. When we held the hearing on the nomination of Judge Roger \nGregory to the Fourth Circuit last year, it was the first hearing on a \nFourth Circuit nominee in three years and he was the first appellate \njudge confirmed to that court in three years.\n  Large numbers of vacancies continue to exist on many Courts of \nAppeals, in large measure because the recent Republican majority was \nnot willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's Courts of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was \nnot willing to confirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during \nthe entire 1996 session. Democrats have broken with that recent history \nof inaction.\n  I would like to commend in particular the Senators from Hawaii and \nalso the members of the Judiciary Committee for their efforts to \nconsider scores of judicial nominees for whom we have held hearings and \non whom we have had votes during the last several months.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of \nRichard R. Clifton to be U.S. Circuit Court Judge for the Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit. Before I speak directly about him and \nhis nomination, however, I would like to take just a moment to make a \nfew comments about the Ninth Circuit.\n  I think it's safe to say that everyone in the Senate agrees that the \nNinth Circuit decision in Newdow v. U.S. Congress, striking down the \nPledge of Allegiance as unconstitutional because it contains the phrase \nunder God, was out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. After \nall, the Senate voted 99 to 0 to reaffirm the reference to One Nation \nUnder God in the pledge of allegiance--right after the decision was \nannounced.\n  But to me, the decision was more than wrong. It was an outrageous \nexample of judicial activism and overreaching--of inappropriate, \nresults-oriented policymaking from the bench. And it is a clear example \nof how the Ninth Circuit is failing to serve the best interests of the \nwestern states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, \nWashington, Oregon, Alaska, and Hawaii.\n  The Ninth Circuit has 28 authorized judgeships. There are 23 active \njudges,\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nand thus 5 vacancies. Seventeen of those 23 were appointed by Democrat \nPresidents--14 by President Clinton alone--and only 6 were appointed by \nRepublicans.\n  The Administrative Office of United States Courts has labeled all \nfive vacancies on the Ninth Circuit as ``judicial emergencies'' given \nthe enormous per-judge caseload on the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Ninth Circuit takes several months longer than other circuits to \ndispose of cases. The average time from filing to disposition is \napproximately 14 months.\n  In addition, as is well known and has been widely observed, including \nby several Supreme Court Justices, the Ninth Circuit has often decided \ncases in a manner that is well outside the mainstream of American law \nand entirely inconsistent with binding Supreme Court precedent. In \n1999-2000, the Supreme Court considered 10 Ninth Circuit cases and \nreversed 9 of them. In 1998-99, the Supreme Court considered 18 Ninth \nCircuit cases and reversed 14 of them. In 1997-98, the Supreme Court \nconsidered 17 Ninth Circuit cases and reversed 13 of them. And in 1996-\n97, in an extraordinary Term, the Supreme Court considered 28 cases \nfrom the Ninth Circuit and reversed 27 of them.\n  All of this makes clear why it is so important for the Senate to \nconsider--and confirm--President Bush's nominees to the Ninth Circuit. \nWe have two excellent candidates pending in the Judiciary Committee \nright now.\n\n  Judge Carolyn Kuhl has extensive experience in federal and state \ngovernment, in the Executive and Judicial Branches, in public service \nand private legal practice. She has a superb legal background and broad \nexperience that makes her ideally suited to be an excellent circuit \njudge. And the same goes for Jay Bybee, who currently serves as \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. I urge the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings \non these nominees without further delay.\n  Now, I would like to turn to the matter directly at hand, the \nconfirmation of Richard R. Clifton to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Shortly following graduation from Yale Law School, Mr. Clifton \nmoved to Hawaii to clerk for the Honorable Herbert Y.C. Choy of the \nU.S. Circuit of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the first and only \nHawaiian to serve on that court. Notably, Mr. Clifton will be the \nsecond.\n  After his clerkship, Mr. Clifton joined the Honolulu law firm of \nCades Schuttle Fleming & Wright, one of the oldest and largest firms in \nHawaii. He has remained with that firm since then, becoming a partner \nin 1982. His practice has focused on business and commercial \nlitigation, with an emphasis on complex litigation and appellate \npractice.\n  Mr. Clifton has ably handled cases in the areas of condemnation, tax \nlaw, securities transactions, class actions, debtor/creditor law, and \ntrademarks.\n  Mr. Clifton is the sold male director with the Hawaii Women's Legal \nFoundation, a member of the Hawaii Women Lawyers, a member of the \nHawaii Chapter of the American Judicature Society, and director of the \nNinth Judicial Circuit Historical Society.\n  For approximately ten years, Mr. Clifton was an adjunct professor at \nthe University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law, where he \ntaught appellate advocacy. He served as Chairman of Hawaii Public Radio \nfor five years and remains a director and member of its executive \ncommittee. He has served as pro bono general counsel to the Hawaii \nRepublican Party since 1991.\n  Mr. Clifton has a reputation for excellence. Among other honors, Mr. \nClifton was named as one of the 18 finest lawyers in Hawaii for \nbusiness litigation in 2001. He is widely respected by the legal \ncommunity in Hawaii.\n  I proudly join my distinguished colleagues from Hawaii, Senators \nInouye and Akaka, in supporting Mr. Clifton's nomination to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. \nRichard Clifton will serve well on the federal bench in Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Mr. Rick Clifton to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  I commend our Majority Leader, the Deputy Majority Leader, and the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee for the progress made on judicial \nnominations during the 107th Congress. Hawaii has waited a number of \nyears for Senate confirmation of a Hawaii resident for a position on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  In 1995, I introduced legislation to require representation on the \ncourt from each State within the jurisdiction of the court. We have \nwaited many years for this opportunity. I am pleased that Hawaii will \nfinally have a Justice on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Rick Clifton has had a distinguished legal career. The Hawaii State \nBar Association found him to be highly qualified for this position. A \ngraduate of Princeton University, he received his juris doctorate from \nYale Law School in 1975. Mr. Clifton has practiced law in Hawaii since \n1975 and has been a partner with the law firm of Cades Schutte Fleming \n& Wright in Honolulu, HI, since 1982. He has extensive legal experience \nin civil litigation, primarily business and commercial litigation. I \nbelieve he will be an asset to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit and urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  The confirmation of Mr. Clifton will help to alleviate hardships \nconfronting the Ninth Circuit brought about by four long-term vacancies \non the Court. A number of these vacancies date back over five years, \nspanning a period where the previous Senate majority refused to act on \nthese judicial emergencies despite President Clinton's nominations of \nseveral well-qualified individuals supported by their home-state \nSenators and local legal communities.\n  I congratulate and commend Chairman Leahy for his leadership in \nworking to confirm qualified nominees to the Federal bench and rectify \nthe doubling in circuit court vacancies that occurred between 1995 and \n2001. In this instance, the Judiciary Committee scheduled a hearing on \nMr. Clifton's nomination less than 60 days after his file and paperwork \nwere completed. As both Chairman and Ranking Member, Senator Leahy has \nworked with Senator Inouye and me to fill the Hawaii seat on the Ninth \nCircuit. I appreciate his commitment to ensure that every State is \nrepresented on our Courts of Appeals.\n  As the Chairman recently noted, Mr. Clifton's confirmation concludes \na long and regrettable saga in confirming a qualified nominee from \nHawaii. In 1999, the President nominated James Duffy of Hawaii to the \nNinth Circuit. He was selected after an exhaustive screening process, \nfollowing an admirable effort by the White House to consult widely with \npolitical, legal, and community leaders in Hawaii. Mr. Duffy was \nendorsed as ``the best of the best'' by the Hawaii State Bar \nAssociation. Despite his sterling reputation, the nomination languished \nfor 791 days in the Judiciary Committee without ever receiving a \nhearing. Mr. Duffy is one of the well-qualified and talented men and \nwomen nominated by the President to the Ninth Circuit and other Courts \nof Appeals, individuals with bipartisan and home-state support whose \nnominations were never acted on by the Senate.\n  I mention this unfortunate chapter not to air past grievances, but to \nunderscore the challenges facing the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Majority Leader in bringing nominations before the \nSenate for action. In an exceptionally evenhanded manner, they have \nworked to overcome the partisanship and stalling practices that \nprecipitated many of the judicial emergencies and vacancies some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have recently come to this \nfloor to decry.\n  Today's confirmation vote for Mr. Clifton's nomination attests to the \nfairness that the Majority Leader and Senator from Vermont have \nrestored to the judicial confirmation process in the past year. I thank \nthem for their support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nRichard R.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this amendment represents the essence of \nS. 2625, which currently, in addition to those who cosponsored this \namendment, has 29 other colleagues' sponsorship.\n  This legislation is designed to provide to American seniors \naffordable, comprehensive, and reliable universal prescription drug \ncoverage. This coverage will be available to 39 million older Americans \nand disabled citizens who are covered by Medicare--citizens who \nvoluntarily elect to participate in this new Medicare benefit. More \nthan 2,750,000 of those 39 million live in my State of Florida and, as \nhave citizens across America, been waiting year after year after year \nfor Congress to finally deliver on the commitment that we have made to \nmodernize Medicare through the provision of a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  When I made remarks on this issue on Tuesday of this week, I based \nthose remarks on six principles that I believe should be the touchstone \nfor an affordable, comprehensive universal prescription drug benefit \nfor senior Americans. Let me briefly reiterate those six principles.\n  First, we must modernize the Medicare Program. We must bring Medicare \ninto the 21st century. In my judgment, the provision of a prescription \ndrug benefit is the single most important reform of the Medicare \nProgram that we can make. Why is this benefit so central? Because in \nthe 37 years since the Medicare Program was created, the practice of \nmedicine has been fundamentally altered by the use of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Prescription drugs have improved the quality of people's lives. They \nhave reduced long recovery periods, and they sometimes can even avoid \nsurgeries and disabling illnesses, such as strokes and heart attacks.\n  We must convert Medicare from a program which, since its inception in \n1965, has focused on sickness. If you are sick enough to go to the \ndoctor or to the hospital, Medicare will pay 77 percent, on average, of \nyour costs. But if you want to maintain the highest level of health, \nwhich generally involves screening, early intervention, and \nprescription drugs to monitor the condition, Medicare will pay nothing.\n  Medicare must be converted from a sickness program to a wellness \nprogram if it is to serve the needs of senior Americans in the 21st \ncentury. That is the first principle.\n  The second principle is that beneficiaries must be provided with a \nreal benefit. To be successful, this program must attract a wide \nvariety of beneficiaries.\n  The program will be voluntary, so it must attract enrollment with \nreasonable and reliable prices and a benefit that pays off from day \none. In this manner, we will be able to attract all seniors, from those \nwho today have high drug needs to those who are healthy but might be \nconcerned that they, too, could be struck down with a heart attack or \nother disabling condition.\n  If we are able to have a program that will attract that broad range \nof elderly in terms of their current state of health, then we will have \na program that will be actuarially solid for years to come.\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\n  Seniors must be able to understand the benefit they receive. The \ncoverage should be consistent, and seniors should receive that coverage \nwithout any unexpected gaps or omissions. In other words, it should \noperate as much as possible as the employer-provided coverage which \nthey had during their working years.\n  The third principle is that beneficiaries must have choice. All \nAmericans deserve choice in how they receive their health care. We must \noffer choice in who delivers their prescription drugs, which is why we \nmust assure that each region of the country has an adequate number of \nproviders of the prescription drug benefit. This will encourage \ncompetition, helping to keep costs down for seniors, as well as the \ntaxpayers of the Medicare Program, and assure a sustainable \nprescription drug benefit for this and future generations of America's \nseniors.\n  Principle No. 4 is we must use a delivery system upon which seniors \ncan rely. It must be a tried-and-true system, not an untested scheme \nthat will turn older Americans into laboratory animals upon which to be \nexperimented. We want to model our delivery system on what private \nsector plans have used and with what seniors are familiar.\n  Principle No. 5 is the program must be affordable. The reality is the \nmajority of seniors live on fixed incomes. In my State of Florida, \nwhere many people have the idea that all or most of the seniors live at \na level of luxury, the median income of our 2,750,000 seniors is \n$13,982 a year, and 770,000 seniors in our State live on incomes below \n150 percent of poverty.\n  These fixed-income seniors need a prescription drug benefit that has \na low premium, that does not require a deductible, has reasonable \ncopayments that are easy to calculate, and will avoid wide variations \nfrom month to month in their coverage.\n  Finally, principle No. 6 is we must have a fiscally prudent program. \nWe must find that balance between giving seniors what they need, that \nbalance between a realistic assessment of what prescription drug costs \nare likely to be over the next 10 years for our seniors, and, finally, \nthe balance of what our overall Federal budget will allow.\n  The Graham-Miller-Kennedy-Corzine amendment meets these six criteria. \nAs a result, it has the support of the major organizations that \nrepresent America's seniors, including AARP.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record eight letters of \nsupport of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                             AARP,\n\n\n                                        National Headquarters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hon. Zill Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are pleased to restate our position on \n     your revised Medicare prescription drug proposal. Action on a \n     bipartisan prescription drug benefit is a top priority for \n     AARP, our members and the nation.\n       Medicare beneficiaries have waited long enough for access \n     to meaningful, affordable prescription drug coverage. We know \n     from our membership that in order for a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit comprehensive coverage it must include:\n       An affordable premium and coinsurance;\n       Meaningful catastrophic stop-loss that limits out-of-pocket \n     costs;\n       A benefit that does not expose beneficiaries to a gap in \n     insurance coverage;\n       Additional assistance for low-income beneficiaries; and\n       Quality and safety features to curb unnecessary costs and \n     prevent dangerous drug interactions.\n       AARP supports your initiative to incorporate these goals. \n     We commend you for including key elements in your proposal \n     that Medicare beneficiaries and our members have indicated \n     they find valuable. For instance, your proposal includes a \n     premium that many Medicare beneficiaries view as affordable \n     and a benefit design that does not include a gap in insurance \n     coverage. Your proposal also now includes co-payments \n     specified as dollar amounts, an approach that our research \n     shows our members prefer to coinsurance. In our view, this \n     plan could provide real value to beneficiaries in protecting \n     them against the high costs of prescription drugs.\n       It is important that any prescription drug benefit be made \n     a permanent and stable part of Medicare, and we want to work \n     with you to achieve this before enactment.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues as the \n     legislation moves forward. AARP will continue to urge \n     Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to enact affordable, \n     meaningful Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli,\n     Executive Director and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Generic Pharmaceutical\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     524 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), we would like to commend \n     you and Senators Miller and Kennedy for your leadership in \n     introducing legislation to create a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit for our nation's seniors. We agree with you that \n     the passage and enactment of a voluntary Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit is long overdue. We are strongly \n     supportive of your innovative tiered co-pay structure, as \n     well as the other provisions advocated by you and your \n     colleagues, that are designed to increase the utilization of \n     high-quality, affordable generic medicines.\n       Generic pharmaceuticals have a proven track record of \n     substantially lowering drug costs. Studies have shown that \n     for every 1 percent increase in generic drug utilization, \n     consumer, business, and health plan purchasers save over $1 \n     billion. The increased use of generics can play an invaluable \n     role in helping Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and other Federal and private \n     plans assure that beneficiaries have access to quality, \n     affordable medications. A tiered co-pay system with a \n     significant differential between brand and generic \n     pharmaceuticals will ensure an appropriate incentive is in \n     place for seniors to consider more cost-effective options \n     when making choices about pharmaceutical therapies. We \n     believe an explicit dollar co-pay will also provide seniors \n     with the comfort of knowing they will pay a fixed cost to \n     have their prescriptions filled.\n       With your leadership, the Graham/Miller/Kennedy bill \n     employs a number of private sector best practices that are \n     now widely used to assure access to cost-effective, quality \n     affordable medications. These provisions not only encourage \n     the appropriate and beneficial use of these products, but \n     provide unbiased and greatly needed educational information \n     to the public about the benefits of these medicines.\n       The Graham/Miller/Kennedy bill adheres to GPhA's principles \n     for creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit and steers \n     the Medicare reform debate down a prudent public policy path. \n     We look forward to working with you, your cosponsors and with \n     other Members of the House and Senate of both parties to \n     further our common objective of providing our nation's nearly \n     40 million Medicare beneficiaries and the taxpayers who help \n     support them with the most affordable and highest quality \n     prescription drug benefit possible. If the rest of the \n     Congress and the Administration follow your lead in \n     recognizing the role generics must play in reaching this \n     objective, we are confident we will achieve this goal.\n       Thank you again for your efforts. If we can be of any \n     assistance to you, please do not hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kathleen Jaeger,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                The National Council on the Aging,\n                                    Washington, DC. June 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     524 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging (NCOA)--the nation's first organization formed to \n     represent America's seniors and those who serve them--I write \n     to commend and thank you for your proposal to provide \n     meaningful Medicare prescription drug coverage to America's \n     seniors. The Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of \n     2002 is consistent with the principles supported by the vast \n     majority of organizations representing Medicare \n     beneficiaries. It provides the foundation for a vehicle that \n     we hope can achieve bipartisan consensus on this issue this \n     year.\n       NCOA is particularly pleased that your legislation would \n     provide prescription drug coverage that is universal, \n     voluntary, reliable, and continuous. Other proposals being \n     offered include significant coverage gaps and would fail to \n     solve the problem. Under such bills, a significant number of \n     beneficiaries would not want to participate in the program, \n     and many of those who do participate would continue to be \n     forced to choose between buying food and essential medicines.\n       We commend many of the modifications you have made to your \n     Medicare bill from last year. These improvements include a \n     significantly lower premium, the option to provide a flat \n     copayment, an earlier effective date, and assistance with the \n     very first prescription. We believe these changes will make \n     the coverage affordable and attractive to the vast majority \n     of beneficiaries, which is so critical to making a voluntary \n     prescription drug program work. While we have concerns about \n     the need to reauthorize the program after 2010, we understand \n     the budget trade-offs needed to provide meaningful and \n     attractive coverage, and fully expect that the Congress would \n     reauthorize the program.\n       NCOA is also pleased that your proposal does not include \n     price controls and that the\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n     program would promote stability and efficiency through \n     administration by multiple, competing Pharmacy Benefit \n     Managers (PBMs), using management tools available in the \n     private sector in which PBMs would be at risk for their \n     performance, including effective cost containment.\n       NCOA deeply appreciates your efforts to move this critical \n     debate in a direction that guarantees access to meaningful \n     coverage--even in rural and frontier areas of the country--\n     and responds in a constructive manner to many of the specific \n     concerns that have been raised regarding other Medicare \n     prescription drug proposals.\n       It is impossible to have real health security without \n     coverage for prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage \n     is the number one legislative priority for America's seniors. \n     Virtually every member of Congress has made campaign promises \n     to try to pass a good prescription drug bill. The time has \n     come to get serious and to work together to achieve consensus \n     on the issues in controversy. Your proposal provides us with \n     an excellent starting point.\n       NCOA looks forward to working on a bipartisan basis with \n     you and other members of Congress to pass legislation this \n     year that provides meaningful, continuous, affordable \n     prescription drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Firman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Families USA,\n                                    Washington, DC. June 13, 2002.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     524 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: We congratulate you and Senators \n     Miller, Kennedy and Rockefeller on the introduction of your \n     bill, ``The Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act,'' \n     which provides prescription drug benefit for Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       This is an issue of utmost important to all Americans who \n     need prescription drugs, especially to seniors and people \n     with disabilities. As you well know senors' ability to afford \n     prescription drugs is a particularly difficult problem today. \n     In our 2001 report entitled, ``Enough to Make You Sick: \n     Prescription Drug Prices for the Elderly, ``we concluded that \n     the 50 top drugs used by seniors rose 2.3 times the rate of \n     inflation between 2000 and 2001. We are in the process of \n     updating this report for last year, and our preliminary data \n     shows that this devastating rate of price increases \n     continues. Millions of seniors have limited income and no, or \n     limited, drug coverage and will find themselves deciding \n     whether to buy drugs or pay for other essentials.\n       Your bill addressees many important design issue that we \n     care about in a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The \n     benefit is universal, comprehensive, and is delivered through \n     the Medicare program, ensuring that seniors know it will be \n     available to them when it is needed. Low-income people get \n     extra assistance. Also, there are provisions to assure that \n     costs will be contained and quality maintained.\n       Please let us know how we can assist you to move this bill \n     toward enactment so that all Medicare beneficiaries can have \n     access to the prescription drugs they need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                                    Washington, DC. June 12, 2002.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Senate Hart Office Building 524, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the millions of members \n     and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I write in support of your Medicare \n     prescription drug legislation that will provide much needed \n     relief to seniors. Your bill contains all of the elements \n     that seniors need in a comprehensive drug benefit under \n     Medicare, such as universal, voluntary, affordable, not means \n     tested and most importantly, with a defined benefit, so that \n     seniors can plan accordingly. Prescription drugs prices are \n     increasing over 17% per year (faster than inflation) and \n     seniors are spending more on out-of-pocket drug expenditures \n     than ever. The time is now to enact a drug benefit that will \n     provide the Medicare beneficiary with some assistance.\n       We are pleased that your plan would be available for \n     seniors, no matter where they live. Our members have \n     expressed to us that a prescription drug benefit must be \n     affordable. We believe that a plan such as yours, with no \n     annual deductible and a $4,000 cap on out of pocket \n     expenditures, is reasonable and one that most seniors would \n     be able to afford.\n       We applaud you for your leadership in this area. Please let \n     me know how we can further support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barbara Kennelly,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                          AFSCME ,\n\n\n           American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n                                           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Senator Zell Miller,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I am writing to express our support for the \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit proposal you unveiled \n     today.\n       AFSCME has long supported the creation of a Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit that is comprehensive in coverage, \n     affordable and voluntary for all Medicare beneficiaries. We \n     believe that your proposal is a solid step forward in meeting \n     these standards.\n       In particular, we applaud your proposal's provisions for \n     continuous coverage. We believe that it is one of the most \n     critical components of a meaningful prescription drug \n     benefit. Beneficiaries must have coverage they can count on, \n     with no gaps in coverage. Doing anything less would force our \n     seniors to pay all prescription costs out of their own pocket \n     when they will need the coverage the most.\n       Since Medicare was started over 35 years ago, many \n     illnesses that were once only treatable in a hospital can now \n     be effectively treated with prescription drugs. Adding a drug \n     benefit to the program is the most urgently needed Medicare \n     reform. We applaud you for not holding the prescription drug \n     benefit hostage to force radical privatization proposals that \n     would cut benefits and increase costs for retirees.\n       We look forward to working with you and the other sponsors \n     of this important legislation. A Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit is long overdue, and our nation's seniors deserve no \n     less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Legislative Alert\n\n         American Federation of Labor and,Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, 524 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham. On behalf of the 13 million members of \n     the AFL-CIO, I am writing to commend you for your efforts to \n     provide much-needed relief to Medicare beneficiaries. Your \n     proposal to create a voluntary drug benefit within the \n     Medicare program represents an encouraging and solid step \n     toward enacting the one reform most urgently needed for \n     Medicare.\n       Seniors need a real benefit that provides comprehensive, \n     continuous and certain coverage. The Graham-Miller-Kennedy \n     bill provides that benefit, giving seniors coverage they can \n     count on. A Medicare drug benefit must also be affordable for \n     beneficiaries. The $25 monthly premium and zero deductible in \n     your proposal means seniors need only pay an affordable \n     premium to begin getting coverage immediately. And no senior \n     will have to pay more than $40 for the drugs they need and \n     often will pay less.\n       In addition, your proposal would not put at risk those \n     retires who currently have some prescription drug coverage \n     through an employer. Retiree heath care is the primary source \n     of prescription drug coverage for seniors, and your proposal \n     rightly provides from relief for employers that choose to \n     continue that coverage.\n       A proposal widely reported under consideration by House \n     Republican leaders offers only unreliable, expensive and \n     unworkable coverage through private plans, with an enormous \n     gap in coverage that leaves seniors without any coverage at \n     all for drug costs between $2000 and $4500. And the only \n     relief for employers is if they drop the coverage they now \n     offer. Such a proposal will not move us any closer to a real \n     benefit.\n       As this debate moves forward, we want to work with you and \n     your co-sponsors to enact the best possible Medicare drug \n     benefit. We appreciate your role in advancing that process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         William Samuel, Director,\n     Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Alliance for Retired Americans,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the over 2.7 million \n     members of the Alliance for Retired Americans, I want to \n     thank you for your tireless work on behalf of older and \n     disabled Americans to create a Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit program. I also want to express our views on the \n     Medicare prescription drug legislation proposed by you and \n     Senators Graham and Miller. The Alliance supports this \n     proposal as a positive step forward in the effort to create a \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit program.\n       The Alliance for Retired Americans believes that all older \n     and disabled Americans need an affordable, comprehensive, and \n     voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit now. Such a \n     benefit program should have low monthly premiums, annual \n     deductibles, and be administered as part of the Medicare \n     program. Your proposed legislation meets these Alliance \n     principles. Unlike other proposals that would begin in 2005, \n     your plan would start in 2004, which gives beneficiaries the \n     coverage they need a full year earlier.\n       The Alliance will work to enact your legislation. During \n     legislative deliberations, the Alliance will seek to improve \n     benefits because we believe that an 80/20 co-insurance\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\n     payment system, like the rest of Medicare, will provide the \n     best benefits for older and disabled Americans. The Alliance \n     also supports a $2,000 annual catastrophic cap. We will \n     continue to work to improve any legislation that moves \n     through Congress in order to reach these goals.\n       Older Americans will spend $1.8 trillion on prescription \n     drugs during the next decade. The inflation rate for \n     prescription drugs will continue at an annual double digit \n     pace as well. Our members and indeed all Americans simply \n     cannot afford these costs. We look forward to working with \n     you and Senators Graham and Miller to enact a comprehensive \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Edward F. Coyle\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, what does our plan provide? Our plan \nwill require of seniors who voluntarily elect to participate a $25 \nmonthly premium to do so. There will be no deductible. There is an \neasy-to-understand copayment system, which is $10 per prescription for \ngeneric medication and $40 per brand name, medically necessary drug.\n  I will pause at this point and point out the connectedness of this \nplan and this structure of benefits to the underlying legislation we \nhave been discussing throughout the week to make it easier for all \nAmericans to gain access to generic drugs.\n  Our legislation has a strong incentive for the use of generic drugs \nby having the $10 copayment for generics, $40 for brand names. To the \nextent that more generics are available, which, of course, is the \npurpose of the underlying bill, we will reduce the cost of this program \nand make it even more affordable to senior Americans.\n  We set a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $4,000 per year. Above \nthat, all of the senior's drug cost, including copayments, will be \ncovered. This is the so-called catastrophic coverage.\n  Seniors with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty level will pay \nno premiums, and beneficiaries with incomes between 135 and 150 percent \nof poverty will pay reduced premiums. We want all senior Americans to \nbe able to participate in this program.\n  Our plan uses the same delivery model that America's private \ninsurance companies utilize. It happens to also be the same model used \nby the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, a plan that covers \nvirtually everybody in this Chamber.\n  We use pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, to deliver and manage \nprescription drug benefits, just as they do in virtually every major \nprivate and public sector employee health insurance plan. PBMs are \ncompanies that negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to get \ndiscounted prices based on their volume purchase.\n  We would allow all seniors a choice of which PBM to join. This would \ngive choice to seniors, and it would give them the opportunity to shop \namong the PBMs that are competing for their business so that they, the \nsenior, can decide which PBM best meets their particular needs, \nincluding factors such as the availability of mail order delivery and \naccess to local pharmacies.\n  PBMs would be accountable to the Medicare Program and to all \ntaxpayers. They would be required to demonstrate their ability to keep \ncosts down through effective purchasing practices and provide quality \nservice in order to win and keep a Government contract.\n  CBO has given us an estimate of our plan today. CBO estimates that \nour plan through the year 2010 would cost $421 billion. Taking into \naccount, in addition to the base cost, the benefits that would flow by \nthe adoption of the underlying generic bill, that figure is reduced to \n$407 billion through the year 2010.\n  That date is important because part of our legislation is a required \nreauthorization by the Congress in 2010. In much the same way as we are \nnow reauthorizing Welfare to Work after it has been in place for 6 \nyears, we would require the reauthorization of this prescription drug \nbenefit so we can take into account the experience we will have gained \nand make an assessment as to what kind of prescription drug benefit we \nwant to carry into the future.\n  If the program is extended, then the 10-year cost of the plan through \nthe year 2012 would be an additional $173 billion.\n  Because this prescription drug benefit would represent the largest \nexpansion of the Medicare Program in its 37-year history, we believe it \nis important for Congress to review the program to see how well it is \nworking and whether it has given seniors the coverage they need.\n  Madam President, our good friend and colleague from Utah has \nintroduced legislation which has a similar objective to the one we are \nproposing; that is, to assure that seniors would have access to a \ncomprehensive, universal, affordable prescription drug benefit.\n  I have comments to make about the plan which has been introduced. I \nwill defer those comments, however, until Monday.\n  To conclude tonight, I want to say we are still hearing the \nbackground noise that all of this is theater, that there is no real \ncommitment to passing a prescription drug benefit in the year 2002, as \nthere was not in 2001, 2000, and on for the many years which seniors \nhave been promised by different people seeking office that if elected \nthey would deliver on a prescription drug benefit.\n  What we are committed to today--and I believe this feeling also \ncarries to my good friend from Utah and those who have joined him in \nhis legislation--is we are not interested in election year posturing. \nWe want to actually accomplish a result. We want to be able to say to \nour senior Americans, we have turned the corner. No longer are you \nparticipating in a sickness program, but you are now participating in a \nprogram which has as its primary commitment assuring that all senior \nAmericans can live in the highest state of good health.\n  Our Nation's seniors have waited too long for the help they need to \npurchase their prescription drugs. An unconscionable number of these \npeople are forced every day to choose between filling a doctor's \nprescription for a needed medication and paying for other basic needs. \nThese people are not numbers in a statistical database. They are not \nstrangers. These people who have been waiting and waiting are our \nparents and our grandparents. They are our neighbors. They are the \npeople we used to work with. They are our friends. They are the \nAmericans of the great generation.\n  We now have a challenge, an opportunity, a responsibility to respond \nto this great need that they have of some assistance in paying for what \nhas become the fastest growing segment of our health care costs--\nprescription drugs. If we do not act on the prescription drug benefit \nthis year, I fear the American people will lose confidence in the \nCongress and our ability to make the tough choices necessary to address \nour country's priority domestic issues.\n  Certainly, I do not claim that our bill is perfect, but I do suggest \nthat it is as good as our collective efforts have been able to make it \nat this point. I believe this amendment justifies the support of our \ncolleagues, as it has already received the support of virtually every \nmajor organization which represents the interests of America's seniors.\n  So I look forward to a full discussion and debate in the best \ntradition of this great deliberative body. I hope at the end of that \ndebate we not only will have a better understanding of the options \nbefore us, but we will have reached a conclusion that will command the \nvotes of a sufficient number of Members of this Senate that we can tell \nour senior constituents we have heard their long call for assistance in \npaying the costs of increasingly expensive prescription drugs; that we \nunderstand the importance of that call, and that we are now responding \nto that call. That is the challenge and that is my hope of what will be \nthe conclusion of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to express my appreciation to my colleague from \nFlorida. He is an eminent member of the Senate Finance Committee. He is \na very serious, reflective Member. He has worked hard to come up with \nhis bill. I respect him for it, and I wish him well with it. However, I \nwill say a few things about Senator Graham's bill before I finish.\n  Tonight, I introduced an amendment that is called the tripartisan \nbill. I introduced it on behalf of Senator Grassley for himself, \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords, Breaux, Collins, Landrieu,\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nHutchinson, Domenici, and myself. We believe this tripartisan bill is \nthe only nonpartisan bill being considered by the Senate at this time. \nIt is a very important effort by people of goodwill on both sides and, \nof course, the only Independent in the Senate.\n  I want to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the \ntripartisan bill. Many of these points were raised two nights ago, when \nI spoke on the Senate floor about our tripartisan proposal. Tonight, I \nwill raise them again because I believe that all of them are extremely \nimportant and worth listening to again.\n  While drafting this legislation, we tried to reach out to everyone \nwho has an interest in this issue. We have taken this very seriously, \nand we have worked on it for well over a year. This has required many \nhours of meetings, among all of the sponsors of the bill and our staffs \nalong with other interested parties. Let me assure everyone that this \nhas been a unified effort, one which has required some give and take \nfrom all of us.\n  We have worked with CBO to come up with a cost-efficient solution. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has told us that our bill will cost \n$370 billion over 10 years. As far as I know, the Daschle-Graham-Miller \nbill, S. 2625, does not have a CBO score, but I suspect that it is \nextremely expensive. The distinguished Senator may have some idea of \nwhat that score is because he has indicated that the amendment that he \njust introduced will cost around $600 billion, if I understand it, over \n10 years. The prescription drug program in the Graham legislation would \ninclude a sunset at the end of 2010, which is one of the problems with \nthis legislation.\n  On the other hand, there are no sunsets within our bill. Our \ntripartisan bill is a permanent solution, not a temporary solution. CBO \ninforms us that once our bill is implemented, 99 percent of all seniors \nwill have drug coverage. That would be truly remarkable. And that is \nCBO, not us.\n  Again, this is a nonpartisan approach to providing prescription drugs \nto Medicare beneficiaries. On the other hand, the Daschle-Graham-Miller \nbill sunsets after 2010. So in my opinion, that bill is only a \ntemporary solution.\n  Does a temporary solution truly help seniors in the long run? I do \nnot think it does. Our tripartisan bill provides all Medicare \nbeneficiaries with affordable prescription drug coverage because we let \ncompetition determine the prices, not Government bureaucrats. That is \nhow we keep prices of drugs down. It is not a good idea to let the \nGovernment set the price, which is what I predict will happen if the \nDaschle-Graham bill becomes law.\n  We also provide additional subsidies to low-income seniors so they, \ntoo, can afford to pay for their drugs. I find it absolutely appalling \nthat there are people in our country who have to choose between buying \nfood and eating, and having prescription drugs. The tripartisan group's \ngoal is to put an end to that. Through our bill, we will provide \nadditional assistance to those seniors who need it. For example, the 10 \nmillion beneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of poverty will \nhave 95 percent of their prescription drug costs covered by this plan \nwith no monthly premium. They will not have to pay a monthly premium. \nIn addition, these seniors are exempt from the deductible and will pay \nwell under $5 for their brand name and generic prescriptions. Finally, \nthese beneficiaries who reach the catastrophic coverage limit will have \nfull protection against all drug costs, with no coinsurance.\n  The 11.7 million lower income beneficiaries with incomes below 150 \npercent of the poverty level are also exempt from the $3,450 benefit \nlimit. Enrollees between 135 percent and the 150 percent of the Federal \npoverty level will also receive a generous Federal subsidy that on \naverage lowers their monthly premium to anywhere between 0 and $24 a \nmonth. The beneficiary's monthly premium will be based on a sliding \nscale, according to his or her level of income.\n  It also cuts in half their annual drug bills. All other enrollees \nwill have access to discounted prescriptions after reaching the $3,450 \nbenefit limit and a critically important $3,700 catastrophic limit \nwhich protects seniors from high out-of-pocket costs. It is also \nimportant to note that 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will never \nexperience a gap in coverage.\n  Let me take a few minutes before we finish this evening to talk about \nmy views on S. 2625, the Daschle-Graham-Miller Medicare Outpatient \nPrescription Drug Act of 2002. I understand that a new Graham bill has \nbeen filed and we are currently reviewing the details. We have not been \nable to review it very thoroughly, but we have a quick preview of it, \nand perhaps I can express my thoughts this evening just so people will \nhave something to consider over the weekend.\n  Again, I commend my good friend, a person I admire greatly, Senator \nBob Graham, for his bill. I know he has worked hard. I know he has \ntried his best. I know he is representing his people in Florida very \nwell and he has worked long and hard on this issue. I respect him for \nthat. I respect him personally. He knows that. He, like those in the \nSenate in the tripartisan group, has the same goal: To provide Medicare \nbeneficiaries with prescription drug benefits. But that is where the \nsimilarities end.\n  My biggest concern with the new version of the Daschle-Graham bill is \nstill the cost. My understanding is that this bill costs close to $600 \nbillion, over a 10-year period. We all agree a Medicare drug proposal \nwill cost a lot of money, but the Daschle-Graham-Miller bill is, in my \nopinion, too expensive to both current and future generations because \nof the magnitude of its costs.\n  And bear in mind, this bill is still not a permanent program. It \nsunsets. It sunsets after 2010, which makes it a less than 10 year \nbenefit for approximately $600 billion. That is if I am right on the \nscoring. I believe having the sunset on such an important bill just to \nget a decent score from CBO is not being as fiscally responsible as I \nwould like to be. I understand there is some window-dressing language \nthat attempts to address the sunset, but to me that is all it is--\nwindow dressing.\n  Having said that, I am absolutely astounded that the AARP has come \nout and ask its members to support a bill that does not have a \npermanent benefit. That is just irresponsible on the part of the AARP. \nThey are, in my opinion, not looking out for the best interests of \nseniors by asking their members to support this type of a bill. I am \nvery disappointed in the AARP for making what I believe is a poor \njudgment call.\n  Again, one of my top concerns with the both versions of the Graham \nbill is the cost. It is not going to get better as drugs become more \nexpensive and more and more baby boomers retire. I remind my \ncolleagues, our Government is in a Federal deficit. Figures from last \nweek reveal that the Federal deficit could be as high as $150 billion \nfor fiscal year 2002. Passing a bill that I believe could cost well \nover $600 billion over 10 years is going to increase our deficit. That \nis, in my opinion, a step in the wrong direction.\n  The new Graham bill is still a one-size-fits-all bill that very well \ncould lead to having the Federal Government set drug prices, although I \nknow that is not the intention of my dear friend and colleague from \nFlorida. That is, in my opinion, the wrong direction, as well. And why \non earth should the Federal Government be making coverage decisions for \nseniors? I trust senior citizens to make their own decisions about \ntheir health coverage. Apparently, the authors of the Daschle-Graham-\nMiller bill do not agree and that is why they continue to put the \nGovernment in charge.\n  I look forward to the debate on Monday where we can discuss these \nissues more fully. If I am wrong on some of these suggested \ninterpretations of my friend's bill, I would like him to set me \nstraight on Monday when we debate this bill even further. I would like \nto know why anybody believes a sunset is necessary. That means the drug \nbenefit ends. I hope we will have a CBO cost estimate we may review \nregarding the Graham legislation.\n  Again, I wish to point out that I continue to be concerned that under \nboth versions of the Daschle-Graham legislation, the drug benefit is \nrun by the Federal Government. I don't think that is a good idea, to \nlet the Government run a drug benefit because the Government will end \nup setting prices for drugs. Keep in mind, Canada sets prices for \ndrugs, and where is their pharmaceutical industry today? They have to \nlook to us because we do not set prices for drugs and we have a \ncompetitive\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\nsystem. Yes, some say it has flaws, but it is the best in the world, \nbar none. Frankly, with whatever flaws there are, we should be very \nproud of the system we have in our country.\n  In the tripartisan Medicare drug bill, we allow Medicare \nbeneficiaries to make choices for themselves. They decide whether or \nnot they want drug coverage. As I mentioned earlier, we allow Medicare \nbeneficiaries to choose from at least two drug plans, and it maybe \nmore, but at least two, competing plans, allowing them to select a plan \nthat best suits their own personal needs.\n  Another difference between the Daschle-Graham bill and our \nTripartisan bill is that we include reforms to the Medicare program and \nthey do not. The current Medicare benefit package was established in \n1965. While the benefits package has been modified occasionally, it now \ndiffers significantly from the benefits offered to those in private \nhealth plans. Our plan gives seniors a choice in their Medicare \ncoverage seniors may remain in traditional Medicare or they may opt for \nthe enhanced Medicare fee for service option which is similar to \nprivate health insurance. We do not force seniors to enter into the new \nenhanced fee for service plan. It is just an option. If beneficiaries \nwant to stay in traditional Medicare that is fine.\n  We need to give seniors choices concerning their health care \ncoverage. Seniors must be given improved health care choices through \nthe Medicare program. It is extremely unfortunate that the Daschle-\nGraham-Miller bill does not recognize that the Medicare program needs \nto be improved so seniors can take advantage of the benefits that are \noffered by private health insurance. Keep in mind, our bill only costs \n$370 billion as scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Yet we still \nreform Medicare in addition to providing high quality prescription \ndrugs to our people. There is nothing in the Daschle-Graham-Miller bill \nto improve the Medicare program. It just tacks on a prescription drug \nprogram and ignores the larger problem. Medicare beneficiaries deserve \nbetter.\n  Senator Breaux deserves an awful lot of credit for our bill in this \narea. He has wanted to reform Medicare for a long time and has come \nclose from time to time. This is the best opportunity to do it. I think \nhe sees the value of what we have tried to do. He not only sees it, he \nhelped implement it.\n  The larger problem is the overall Medicare benefits package which is \noutdated, inefficient and it does not provide seniors with decent \nhealth care options. Let me give you an example. Today, Medicare \nbeneficiaries do not have any serious illness protection. Beneficiaries \nwho are seriously ill end up paying a lot of money out of pocket for \ntheir health care coverage each year. In our Tripartisan legislation, \nif a beneficiary is covered under the new enhanced fee for service \nprogram, once that beneficiary reaches a catastrophic limit of $6000, \nthe Medicare program pays 100 percent of any costs incurred by the \nMedicare beneficiary. I feel that is only fair. Those Medicare \nbeneficiaries with serious health conditions should be offered a choice \nin benefit coverage so if they want serious, illness protection, they \nmay have it. The Graham-Daschle-Miller bill does nothing to assist \nMedicare beneficiaries in these types of situations. The Daschle-\nGraham-Miller bill's answer is to provide seniors with a government-run \nprescription drug benefit that is extremely expensive, and, isn't \neven permanent. That just is not enough.\n\n  These issues that I have raised about the Daschle-Graham-Miller \nshould have been debated by the Finance Committee. I admit the issues \nwe have raised by the Tripartisan bill should have been debated by the \nFinance Committee. Who knows, maybe we could have come to some \nresolution. Maybe the authors of the Tripartisan bill and the Daschle-\nGraham-Miller bill could have come to some agreement through the \nCommittee mark-up process. Maybe not. Sadly, we will never know because \nthe majority leader wouldn't even give us an opportunity to mark-up a \nprescription drug bill in the Finance Committee.\n  I have been here for 26 years and, trust me, it is rare for the full \nSenate to be considering such an important bill before it is even \nconsidered by the Committee of jurisdiction. I am bitterly disappointed \nat how much the Senate has changed.\n  At the beginning of the 107th Congress, we all talked about working \ntogether in a bipartisan spirit because that is truly what the American \npeople want from us. What happened to that bipartisan spirit? Why are \nwe on the floor debating a bill that will affect the lives of over 33 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries and millions of future beneficiaries \nwithout a Finance Committee mark-up? I just do not understand why \nmembers of the Finance Committee were not even given that opportunity \nand, in fact, completely excluded from the process, other than that we \ncan file whatever bill we want to, which we have done.\n  I want to do everything I can to pass a Medicare prescription drug \nbill into law this year. But it appears that election year politics are \nmore important than passing a well-thought out prescription drug bill \nwhich is extremely unfortunate.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues so that we can provide \naffordable prescription drug coverage to our Medicare beneficiaries \nthis year. We need to have Medicare available for today's seniors, our \nchildren and our grandchildren. So let's stop playing politics and \nstart working on getting a Medicare prescription drug bill signed into \nlaw this year. I have no doubt if the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida and I could sit down together we could just work it out--I have \nno doubt about that. Unfortunately, it has gotten embroiled in some \npolitical aspects.\n\n  Again, I call attention to the tripartisan bill which has Democrats, \nRepublicans, and the sole Independent. I believe that bill literally \ncould provide an affordable drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, \nalthough it is still expensive. It could do what we really need to have \ndone--not only on the prescription drug benefit aspect of this matter \nbut also on the Medicare reform as well--and Medicare+Choice as well. \nTo me, that is very important.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Florida and others \non the floor and hope we can come to a resolution this year, so the \nmillions of American citizens will have the benefits that we really \nshould be delivering to them and which they need and which are right \nand just.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as I indicated, I restricted myself this \nevening to discussing the essence of our proposal and what I think are \nthe six principles against which every proposal should be evaluated. I \ndefer until Monday a close evaluation of the legislation that has been \nintroduced by our good friend from Utah and others. One of the things I \ndo not want to do is to create a poisoned environment which will make \nit difficult, if not impossible, to do what I think seniors want, which \nis to arrive at a reasonable compromise that will provide them with a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  They have heard us too many times, as candidates, place in their \nliving rooms on their television screens ads that pronounce our \ncommitment to a prescription drug benefit for senior Americans.\n  Now is the time to deliver. I recognize that in a democracy that \nmeans we have to have at least a majority, and probably under the rules \nof the Senate not just a majority but three out of every five Senators \nbe prepared to vote for a single piece of legislation.\n  Therefore, I reach my hand out across the aisle to two of my favorite \ncolleagues, the Senator from Utah, who is now being joined by the \nSenator from Iowa, with whom I worked on many issues in the past, to \nsay we look forward to engaging in that compromise.\n  I do want to have printed in the Record, and I ask unanimous consent \nto do so, the CBO estimate of our bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n            Democratic Drug Bill--Preliminary CBO Estimates\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n\n                          Full Score (2005-12)\n\nGross estimate......................................................594\n  Score with % drug reduction from GAAP \\1\\.........................584\n  Score with Federal GAAP savings \\2\\...............................576\n\n                    Score with Contingency (2005-10)\n\nGross estimate......................................................421\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\n  Score with % drug reduction from GAAP \\1\\.........................415\n  Score with Federal GAAP savings \\2\\...............................407\n\n\\1\\ CBO estimate of Democratic drug bill assuming lower drug prices for \nMedicare beneficiaries that would result from enactment of the GAAP \nbill (S. 812).\n\\2\\ Estimate of Democratic drug bill assuming lower drug prices for \nMedicare beneficiaries that would result from enactment of the GAAP \nbill (S. 812) and savings from lower costs associated with prescription \ndrugs that the government current pays for under the Medicaid, \nveterans, and other programs.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the estimate of our bill is that, in \nconjunction with the underlying generic drug bill, if that passes and \nmakes generic drugs more available, our bill, which would only charge a \n$10 copayment for generic drugs as opposed to a $40 copayment for brand \nname drugs--our bill would have a cost over the next 8 years of $407 \nbillion--not $600 billion, or $800 billion, or, as some have even said, \n$1 trillion--and over the next 10 years would have a cost of $576 \nbillion.\n\n  I might point out that this is the same program for 8 years that will \ncost $407 billion, and for 10 years will cost $576 billion.\n  That differential is a reflection of how significant two factors are: \nOne, inflation of prescription drug costs; and, second, the change in \nthe demographics of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I happened to have been born in 1936. I was 65 years old on November \n9 of last year. I belong to the second lowest birth rate year in the \n20th century. Only 1933 had a lower birth rate than 1936. Therefore, \nthere are not very many people my age. We are not putting a particular \ndemand on Medicare or on the Social Security Program. But, in 10 years, \nit will be the people who were born in 1946--not 1936--which was the \nbeginning of one of the greatest demographic revolutions in America \nhistory.\n  We are going to begin to feel the impact of that revolution at the \nouter years of the 10 years. We are now calculating the cost of this \nprogram. It is my judgment that it is critically important that we now \nget started on this prescription drug benefit so that we can learn as \nmuch as we possibly can about what the implications are of delivery \nsystems, of methods of providing benefits, and how to attract healthy, \nolder citizens to participate in a prescription drug benefit--all the \nthings that will be critical to the long-term stability of a \nprescription drug benefit. We need to start that process today when the \ndemand is relatively low--not 5 or 10 years from now when the demand \nwill begin to rapidly escalate.\n  We have before us two different visions of how to get to the same \ndestination. The Senator from Utah has outlined a number of issues of \nconcern to him. I look forward to having a full debate on Monday. \nHopefully, we can frame each one of these issues, such as the relative \nbenefits of using the Medicare system as a means of delivering \nprescription drugs, or delivering it through subsidized private \ninsurance policies--the relative benefits of having what I call a \n``defined benefit plan'' where seniors would know what they are buying \nas opposed to a defined contribution plan where there would not be that \nassurance.\n  Those are all legitimate issues for us to debate.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that they might take the time over the \nweekend to read the letters of endorsement from groups such as the \nAARP, which clearly has no interest other than representing the best \ninterests of their millions of members--most of whom are part of this \n39 million Americans who are Medicare participants because they are \nover the age of 65. There is no reason to suspect their motives, or \nthat they have some hidden agenda other than what they think is in the \ninterest of senior Americans.\n  I recommend reading their rationale for reaching the conclusion of \ntheir support for our proposal.\n  I conclude tonight with a sense of optimism. We have gotten further \nthis week than we have gotten in a decade in terms of closure on \nproviding our older Americans with a key but missing part of their \nhealth care coverage; that is, assistance with their prescription drug \ncosts.\n  I hope next week we can complete this by the passage of a \nprescription drug bill recognizing that we have to negotiate with the \nHouse, and then secure final passage, and hopefully gather in the Rose \nGarden where I suspect that the President will, with great enthusiasm, \nbe there to sign this bill into law and provide what America's older \ncitizens have so long sought, an affordable, comprehensive, and \nuniversally available prescription drug benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am surely glad that this debate has \nbegun. It is too bad we could not have started the debate on this bill \non Monday or Tuesday of this week when the majority leader led us to \nbelieve that we would be doing nothing but prescription drugs until we \ngot it done.\n  I am glad that we now have Senator Graham's alternative before us.\n  I thank Senator Hatch, who took the position as manager, while I was \non the CNN program just a few minutes ago, to introduce the tripartisan \nbill on my behalf. That bill is a comprehensive prescription drug bill \nthat represents a year of hard work by dedicated members of the Finance \nCommittee, the committee that has jurisdiction over Medicare.\n  We have Senator Graham's bill that you have heard about tonight. Then \nwe have this tripartisan bill. People wonder what the term \n``tripartisan'' means. It means three Republicans, one Democrat, and \none Independent in the Senate, but it also implies bipartisanship, or \nacross-party cooperation that must be done to get any bill passed in \nthe Senate.\n  Our legislation is called the 21st Century Medicare Act. It makes \nessential improvements to Medicare by adding the comprehensive \nprescription drug benefits, and a new Medicare fee-for-service option \nto the 1965 program. These are all first improvements in Medicare since \nit was introduced in 1965.\n  As I indicated to you, I have been honored to work with a top-notch \ngroup of Senators on this bill. That tripartisan group is Olympia \nSnowe, a Republican; John Breaux, a Democrat; Jim Jeffords, an \nIndependent; and Orrin Hatch, a Republican. The group has dedicated \ncountless hours to this effort.\n  I must express my disappointment that the Senate Finance Committee \nhas not had an opportunity to consider legislation as part of the \ncommittee process. I trust that Senator Graham of Florida will feel the \nsame way. However, the bottom line is America's seniors have waited too \nlong--and too long already--for Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  The House has acted in their fashion. The Senate must act as well. We \ncannot afford to waste a single day.\n  I look forward to debating this important issue over the next few \ndays and hope that the same bipartisan spirit of cooperation and \ncompromise that guided the tripartisan group over the last year to \nwrite this bill will guide all Senators in this Chamber to an agreement \nthat will give long overdue help to our seniors.\n  Since the tripartisan bill is now introduced, since we have the \nDemocrat version, and Senator Graham's bill is introduced, and since \nthere is some misunderstanding of the differences between the two, I \nwill take just a little bit of time to go over those. I also will take \njust a little bit of time to express some differences between the bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives because some people have \nalluded to that bill as something just exactly like the tripartisan \nbill, which it is not.\n  In regard to differences between Senator Graham's proposal and the \ntripartisan proposal that I have offered, the first would be cost.\n  The sheer magnitude of Federal spending in the Senate Democrat bill--\nan amount that is obscured by a sunset provision that kills the benefit \nin 2010--threatens Medicare's long-term stability. As such, the Senate \nDemocrat bill gives seniors temporary help, not a permanent \nentitlement.\n  By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office official estimate \nconcluded that the tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act totals $370 \nbillion over 10 years, a figure that guarantees permanent, affordable \ndrug coverage without breaking the Medicare bank.\n  There is also the issue of choice that separates the tripartisan plan \nfrom the Democrat plan. The Democrat plan relies on the Government to \npick one standard prescription drug plan for over 40 million seniors \nwith Medicare. The one-size-fits-all approach means seniors cannot shop \nfor a prescription drug plan that best suits their needs.\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\n  Under the tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act, seniors are \nguaranteed to have at least two competing prescription drug plans in \ntheir community, even in rural areas, using local pharmacies as well. \nSeniors will have the choice of picking plans on the basis of cost, \nbenefits, and quality. All plans will be required to meet Federal \nquality standards and to provide a standard benefit package, or its \nactuarial equivalent, including a $3,700 cap on out-of-pocket drug \nexpenses for seniors.\n  There is a difference in drug pricing. Because the Democrat plan is \noverly bureaucratic and excessively generous, that plan does nothing to \ncurtail or even slow skyrocketing prescription drug costs. That is why \nit is essential that any new prescription drug benefit contain cost \nmanagement controls that moderate growth in price.\n  While guaranteeing a comprehensive drug coverage for all citizens, \nthe tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act imposes reasonable cost-\nsharing obligations on beneficiaries and promotes competition among \nprescription drug plans. And with competition being promoted in the \nbill, that then leads to a better overall effect on drug prices. And \nthat, again, is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice that does policy analysis and scoring for the Senate.\n  The other issue is affordability, affordability for seniors. Under \nthe Senate Democrat plan, seniors face fixed copayment amounts that, in \nmany instances, mean they will actually pay more for many of the most \ncommonly prescribed drugs than they would under a system that gives \nprescription drug plans more flexibility to offer lower cost \ncopayments.\n  That flexibility is a feature of the tripartisan 21st Century \nMedicare Act because it gives plans the freedom to offer copayments and \ndeductibles that save seniors more money. Moreover, the tripartisan \nproposal has a lower average premium than the Democrat plan, and that \nwould be $24. Again, this is according to a Congressional Budget Office \nestimate.\n  We have Medicare enhancements in the tripartisan bill that the Senate \nDemocrat plan does not have because that plan leaves current Medicare \nas it is and simply dumps a massive entitlement expansion, which would \nbe the prescription drug plan, into the old 1965 model.\n  The tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act takes long overdue steps to \nstrengthen and improve Medicare's basic benefit package. In addition to \nadding prescription drug coverage, the bill offers seniors a new \nenhanced option, including catastrophic protection and free--let me \nemphasize, free--preventive care; in other words, adopting the \nprinciple that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\n  This entire enhanced option is voluntary. If seniors like what they \nhave had since 1965, they do not have to sweat it. They do not have to \ndo it. They can keep what they have. Even 50 years from now they will \nstill have that same choice, but they can also have the enhanced \ncoverage as well. So it is voluntary. And Medicare, as we know it \ntoday, will always remain available to seniors who prefer to keep what \nthey have, if they like it.\n  Improvements are made to yet another coverage option. That coverage \noption exists today. Medicare+Choice plans are also included. \nBeneficiaries need not elect the enhanced option in order to have \naccess to the drug benefit plan.\n  I will finish, then, with a short description of why what the House \nof Representatives passed has nothing to do with the tripartisan plan.\n  The tripartisan plan was adopted on principles and pricing and costs, \nthe way the five of us decided to do it. For instance, the House bill \nhas a higher average premium. This is according to the CBO estimate. \nThe average premium under the House bill is $34 per month. The average \npremium under the tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act is \nsubstantially more affordable, at just $24 per month.\n  We have a much better benefit. The House bill limits the initial \nprescription drug benefit to $2,000 before exposing seniors to a gap in \ncoverage. The tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act basic drug benefit \nis better and is richer than that in the House bill. Seniors will have \ndrug coverage under the tripartisan plan worth 50 percent of their drug \nspending up to $3,450 after the deductible is met, and that is $1,450 \nmore than what the House bill offers, even in its initial benefit.\n  We have greater protection for low-income seniors in this Senate \nversion. The tripartisan 21st Century Medicare Act steps in to give \nmore help to low-income seniors where the House bill does not. It \nprovides full assistance with premiums and substantial assistance with \ncost sharing for seniors below 135 percent of poverty with no gaps in \ncoverage. For seniors between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty, \nassistance with premiums and cost sharing is provided on a sliding \nscale, also with no gaps in coverage. This critical additional coverage \nfor our most vulnerable seniors is an important distinction that \nreflects the tripartisan commitment to universal, affordable drug \ncoverage for all.\n  And then, lastly, I will speak about our enhanced option to which I \nhave already referred. The House bill leaves the 1960s-style Medicare \nlargely as it is today. It does provide $30 billion in additional funds \nto Medicare providers, but it does little to strengthen or improve \nMedicare's basic benefit package.\n  Rather than addressing provider payment issues, the tripartisan 21st \nCentury Medicare Act addresses Medicare's benefit flaws. It offers \nseniors a voluntary enhanced option, including catastrophic protection, \nfree preventive care, and better Medigap plans.\n  The new option would be offered alongside current fee-for-service \nMedicare and a strengthened Medicare+Choice. Seniors can keep what they \nhave if they like it or choose the new option. In all three settings, \naccess to affordable prescription drug coverage would be guaranteed.\n  I just mention the difference, that the House bill does not have a \nnew and improved and modernized Medicare option that we have in the \ntripartisan bill.\n  (Mr. Jeffords assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since the distinguished Senator from Vermont has now \ncome to the chair to be the Presiding Officer of the Senate, it gives \nme an opportunity to say that this provision in the tripartisan bill, \nof improving Medicare, bringing Medicare from a 1965 model to a 21st \ncentury model, improving it beyond the prescription drug provisions, \nwas very much a concern of the Senator from Vermont, the Independent \nmember of the Senate, Mr. Jeffords. I thank him very much for his \ncontribution to that.\n  It really has probably done as much for Medicare as the prescription \ndrug provisions will, as we look to the day when we have baby boomers \ngoing into transition from their employer's health plans to Medicare. \nThere will be a smooth transition if they choose the enhanced option; \nwhereas all the other plans, including the Republican plan in the House \nof Representatives, including even the President's plan, Medicare will \nstill be a 1965 model. And for baby boomers going from their modernized \nemployer's health plan to the 1965 model of Medicare, if that is the \nonly choice they had, it would not be a very good day for those baby \nboomers going into retirement.\n  It has been such a pleasure to work with Senator Jeffords on this \nwhole package, but most importantly, to have his leadership on this \npart that deals with the enhanced option, the new and improved and \nstrengthened Medicare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record this letter to Mr. Carl Feldbaum of the Biotechnology \nIndustry Organization.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 2002.\n     Mr. Carl B. Feldbaum,\n     President, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Feldbaum: I was surprised to receive you letter of \n     July 15, 2002, opposing S. 812. The Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act (the GAAP Act or Schumer-\n     McCain). The record is abundantly clear that the \n     pharmaceutical industry is exploiting loopholes in our Hatch-\n     Waxman drug patent laws to block less costly generic drugs \n     from coming to market. As our hearings revealed, these \n     actions hurt millions of American patients who are burdened \n     with rising health care costs.\n       The exciting new cures brought forward each day by \n     America's biotech companies are paving the way for what I \n     believe is the new\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n     century of the life sciences, and I remain a proud champion \n     of the biotechnology industry in Massachusetts and across the \n     nation. It is important, therefore, as an industry concerned \n     about the health of all Americans, for BIO to acknowledge the \n     harm to American patients and consumers caused by today's \n     Hatch-Waxman abuses. Clearly, collusive agreements between \n     brand-name companies and generic companies to block cheaper \n     generic drugs from coming to market do not serve the public \n     interest. Similarly, patients are harmed when generic drugs \n     are stymied year after year by unfounded patent evergreening \n     for brand name drugs. I would strongly encourage BIO to be \n     part of the solution to these challenges.\n       The Schumer-McCain legislation addresses these abuses and \n     restores the balance intended under the Drug Price \n     Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the \n     Hatch-Waxman Act). As your letter expresses concerns about \n     the legislation, this letter describes in further detail the \n     Committee's intent in addressing them,. The issues you raised \n     include incorrectly listed patents or patent information with \n     the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), use of patents to \n     trigger multiple thirty month stays that delay effective \n     approval of generic drugs, collusive agreements between brand \n     and generic pharmaceutical companies to block subsequent \n     generic applicants from gaining effective approval of their \n     drug products and litigation attacking FDA's bioequivalence \n     regulations that have delayed entry of generic versions of \n     drugs.\n\n\n               the 45 day period to assert patent rights\n\n       You express concern that a patent owner's rights will be \n     forfeited under Schumer-McCain. I want to reassure BIO that \n     this is not the case.\n       Section 4 of Schumer-McCain says that a patent owner that \n     does not sue within 45 days of receiving notice that a \n     generic drug applicant has challenged its patent will be \n     barred from suing that generic drug later.\n       This provision provides the patent owner with the \n     opportunity to protect its patent rights. It also clarifies \n     those rights in relation to the generic drug product at issue \n     if the patent is not defended, thereby enabling the generic \n     drug product to be marketed immediately. The 45 day period \n     may be thought of as a statute of limitations, and Congress \n     has plenary authority to establish statutes of limitations \n     for federally created rights such as patents. In addition, \n     comparable periods of time for claiming or defending property \n     rights have been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n       This provision does not eliminate the patent owner's rights \n     against the generic drug applicant and its generic drug \n     product. Rather, it specifies the time within which the \n     patent owner must assert those rights against that applicant \n     and its drug product.\n       I cannot overemphasize that the bar on enforcing the patent \n     right under this 45 day rule applies only to the particular \n     generic product of the particular generic company that has \n     challenged the patent in its generic drug application. It \n     does not affect the ability of the patent owner to enforce \n     its rights with respect to any other generic company, or with \n     respect to a licensee who strays beyond the bounds of a \n     licensing agreement under which the patent owner has licensed \n     use of the patent.\n       That being said, I also point out that the bar does protect \n     downstream distributors of the particular generic drug \n     product, such as wholesalers and pharmacies, as well as \n     doctors and patients who will use the generic drug product \n     for treatment.\n\n\n             enforcement of the patent listing requirement\n\n       Seciton 3 of Schumer-McCain says that a patent owner cannot \n     enforce its patent against a generic drug company, or a \n     person who manufactures, develops, uses, offsets to sell, or \n     sells a generic drug, if the patent owner has failed to list \n     the patent information at FDA. This provision provides an \n     effective enforcement tool for a current requirement.\n       Drug companies are required currently to list patents at \n     FDA, and I am not aware of any complaints about this \n     requirement from the brand pharmaceutical industry. We \n     understand that now companies generally comply with this \n     requirement because patents can trigger 30 month stays of the \n     effective approval of generic drugs.\n       As you know, however, Section 4 of Schumer-McCain limits 30 \n     month stays to one per generic application, and on only \n     certain patents. The Committee's concern was that limiting 30 \n     month stays in this way reduces the incentive to list \n     patents. We therefore concluded that we needed to provide an \n     effective incentive for compliance with the current \n     requirement to list patents at FDA. Otherwise, we were \n     concerned about increased abuses of the listing requirement.\n       Currently, under section 505(e)(4) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), FDA can withdraw a drug \n     from the market if the patent information is not filed after \n     the agency gives written notice of failure to file the \n     information. FDA has never used this enforcement tool, and it \n     would not withdraw a drug from the market for this reason \n     when the drug presumptively is being used safely for \n     treatment of patients by health care providers. I believe \n     that Section 3 of Schumer-McCain provides effective \n     enforcement of the FDA listing requirement.\n       Your letter raises the real concern about situations in \n     which a patent is not listed, or the information is \n     incorrect, because of an oversight or a clerical error. But \n     Schumer-McCain addresses this problem as well.\n       Section 3 of Schumer-McCain allows FDA to extend the date \n     for listing patents if there are extraordinary or unusual \n     circumstances. An honest administrative or clerical error is \n     clearly such a circumstance. Because FDA publishes patent \n     information immediately upon receipt, the drug company and \n     the patent owner can promptly check that patent information \n     is published and that it is correct. If there is an error, or \n     a patent was not listed, the error can be spotted quickly and \n     immediately corrected. Accordingly, Schumer-McCain allows \n     patent owners to avoid the consequences of the inadvertent \n     failure to list a patent with the FDA.\n\n\n           the cause of action to delist or correct a patent\n\n       Your letter also raised questions about the cause of action \n     in Section 3 of Schumer-McCain to delist patents from FDA's \n     Orange Book or to correct patent information. In particular, \n     BIO is concerned that generic companies will bring these \n     cases unnecessarily, to harass a drug company or patent \n     owner. I do not believe that this will be the case.\n       A generic drug company must certify to the patents listed \n     on a drug when it files a generic drug application. A generic \n     company must do so even if it intends to seek the correction \n     or delisting of a patent.\n       If a generic wants to delist a patent or correct \n     information, it will likely chose to make a paragraph III \n     certification to the patent, saying that the applicant does \n     not contest the patent and requesting that its drug approval \n     be made effective when the patent expires. The generic \n     applicant will then sue to have the patent delisted or \n     corrected.\n       If it wins, the patent is delisted, or the patent \n     information is corrected so that the generic applicant may \n     make a statement that the applicant is not seeking approval \n     for a use claimed in the patent. In either case, no \n     certification is necessary and the paragraph III \n     certification essentially goes away.\n       Should the generic applicant lose a delisting case, \n     however, it will have to recertify and challenge the patent \n     under paragraph IV. This could trigger a 30 month stay, and \n     at a minimum would delay the resolution of the patent issues \n     involved. It is therefore my view that there are strong \n     incentives for generic applicants to bring these delisting \n     cases only when there is strong merit to the case. Because \n     this is the case, it is difficult to argue that delisting \n     cases will be either unnecessary or harassing.\n       To the contrary, in such cases, the delisting of a patent, \n     or correction of patent information, serves a public good. \n     This is because a patent to which other generic drugs would \n     otherwise have to certify is instead either delisted or \n     corrected so that no certification is necessary. In such \n     cases, generic drugs may get more quickly to market, to the \n     great benefit of consumers.\n\n\n                             bioequivalence\n\n       BIO requests that section 7 of Schumer-McCain be stricken \n     in its entirety. I do not believe this provision raises the \n     concerns that BIO thinks it does.\n       Section 7 allows FDA to amend its regulations, but it does \n     not say that those amended regulations are legitimate \n     exercises of authorities under the FFDCA. Only the current \n     regulations are identified as continuing in effect as an \n     exercise of authority under the FFDCA. Should FDA ever amend \n     its bioequivalence regulations, they would be subject to \n     judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n       Indeed, earlier drafts of section 7(a) covered the FDA's \n     current regulations and successor regulations. But we did not \n     intend to protect amended regulations from judicial review, \n     so the language on successor regulations was removed.\n       Also, under section 7(a), the application of the current \n     regulations in any particular case would be legitimate issues \n     for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n     So FDA can be challenged if its application of those \n     regulations will pose potential risks to patients or to \n     public health.\n       Finally, BIO believes that section 7(c) is inadequate. This \n     language, which we added in part in response to concerns from \n     BIO, says that section 7 shall not be construed to alter the \n     authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     regulate biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act. Any such authority shall be exercised under \n     that Act as in effect on the day before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       This language is very similar to a statement that Senator \n     Jeffords and I made on December 3, 1997, in a letter to \n     Michael Friedman, then Lead Deputy Commissioner at FDA. It \n     makes it clear that we are not changing FDA's authority under \n     the FFDCA over biological products--in particular that we are \n     not making changes to newly authorize the approval of generic \n     biologics under the FFDCA. That was good enough in 1997 and \n     should be good enough today.\n       I remain committed to the reforms of the Hatch-Waxman Act \n     provided for in Schumer-McCain, just as I remain committed to \n     a strong and vibrant biotechnology industry, both in \n     Massachusetts and throughout the nation. I believe that the \n     adjustments to the Hatch-Waxman Act found in Schumer-McCain \n     correct imbalances in and will stop abuses of the generic \n     drug approval process that have arisen in recent years. I do \n     not believe that these reforms will adversely impact in any \n     way a company or patent owner\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n     that diligently sees to its legal rights and obligations \n     under Federal law.\n       I hope that this letter addresses your concerns, and I \n     remain willing to work closely with my many friends in the \n     biotechnology industry in Massachusetts and elsewhere as this \n     legislation moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward M.

COOKE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late \nDavid O. Cooke, Defense Department Director of Administration and \nManagement. I would like to offer my condolences to Mr. Cooke's three \nchildren, Michele, Lot and Davis, along with his other family members, \nfriends, and coworkers. Mr. Cooke has truly imprinted an everlasting \nlegacy on the American defense system and our great Nation. Although \nour Nation mourns for this tragic loss, we must remain strong in \nhonoring such an outstanding individual. For six decades, David O. \nCooke served the federal government distinguishing himself as one of \nthe most exceptional and honorable civil servicemen of our time. He was \ntruly a visionary, epitomizing the core values of exemplary public \nservice. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \narticle from the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 27, 2002]\n\n               David Cooke, `Mayor of the Pentagon,' Dies\n\n                         (By Graeme Zielinski)\n\n       David O. ``Doc'' Cooke, 81, the high-ranking administrative \n     director who was known as the ``Mayor of the Pentagon'' for \n     his work over six decades to keep the gargantuan complex \n     humming, died June 22 at the University of Virginia Medical \n     Center.\n       He died of injuries received June 6 in a car accident two \n     miles north of Ruckersville, Va., when his vehicle veered off \n     Route 29 and rolled over several times, Greene County Sheriff \n     William Morris said yesterday. It wasn't known what caused \n     the accident, Morris said.\n       Mr. Cooke had served at the Pentagon since the late 1950s \n     and as its top civil servant had a hand in every major \n     Defense Department reorganization during that time. He knew \n     virtually every inch of the 20 miles of corridors in the \n     building and was the department's highest-ranking career \n     civil servant.\n       As Defense Department director of administration and \n     management, he had a vast institutional memory and numerous \n     friends spread throughout Washington's power structure. It \n     meant that he had the ear and respect of flag officers, \n     members of Congress and Cabinet officials--and not only \n     because he dispensed office space and the Pentagon's 8,700 \n     parking places.\n       In a 2001 edition of Government Executive Magazine, editor \n     Timothy B. Clark called Mr. Cooke ``a force for good in the \n     federal government.''\n       Mr. Cooke's many honors included seven awards of the \n     Defense Medal for Distinguished Civilian Service. In 1999, he \n     was given the President's Award for Distinguished Federal \n     Service, the highest government service award.\n       Mr. Cooke called in some of his considerable chits in the \n     late 1980s and early 1990s as he argued vociferously for a \n     billion-dollar renovation of the Pentagon. Up until Sept. 11, \n     it was scheduled for completion in 2004.\n       The hijacked airliner that slammed into the side of the \n     building that day, killing 189 people, hit a wedge of the \n     Pentagon that had undergone upgrading. Some of those features \n     supported by Mr. Cooke have been credited with saving many \n     lives.\n       ``The steel that we used to strengthen the walls, the \n     blast-resistant windows, the Kevlar cloth, all those things \n     working together helped protect countless people,'' Walker \n     Lee Evey, the program manager for the Pentagon renovation, \n     said. ``Doc Cooke strongly supported all of these.''\n       Mr. Cooke also was a strong supporter of the government as \n     an institution and was active in good-government groups and \n     community service projects.\n       He served on the President's Interagency Council on \n     Administrative Management and was a leader of the Combined \n     Federal Campaign and an active member of the American Society \n     for Public Administration.\n       In the early 1990s, he worked to create a Public Service \n     Academy at Anacostia High School that has been credited with \n     improving the school's graduation rates. He also was known in \n     the Pentagon as a strong promoter of employment opportunities \n     for minorities, women and disabled people.\n       Mr. Cooke was born and raised in Buffalo, where his parents \n     were teachers. He began following their path, receiving a \n     bachelor's degree from the New York State Teachers College at \n     Buffalo and later a master's degree in political science from \n     the State University of New York at Albany.\n       His teaching career was interrupted by World War II, when \n     he served as an officer aboard the USS Pennsylvania, a \n     battleship that saw action in the Pacific.\n       Mr. Cooke returned to teach high school in Buffalo in the \n     late 1940s, but was recalled to the Navy during the Korean \n     War. After getting his law degree from George Washington \n     University in 1950, he served as a Navy attorney and \n     instructor.\n       His Pentagon career began in 1958, when he was assigned as \n     a civilian to a Defense Department reorganization sought by \n     then-Secretary Neil McElroy.\n       Mr. Cooke retained his professorial ways throughout his \n     career, but his humor often helped leaven the serious \n     atmosphere in the Pentagon. Mr. Cooke was just as likely to \n     quote a Greek philosopher as a pithy joke or homespun tale.\n       Evey, the Pentagon renovation manager, recalled an aside at \n     a dedication ceremony last summer. ``He said that he took it \n     as a sign that the building needed to be renovated when the \n     fungus on the wall took the shape of Elvis,'' he said.\n       Mr. Cooke was not laughing when he argued in the 1980s for \n     the renovation and for the Pentagon to be transferred from \n     under the auspices of the General Services Administration to \n     the Defense Department. He said it was a crucial step in \n     rehabilitating the world's largest office building.\n       Mr. Cooke would make routine trips to Capitol Hill with \n     what he called his ``horror board,'' a convincing collage of \n     fallen asbestos or rotted piping from the Pentagon.\n       In 1998, Mr. Cooke testified before a federal grand jury \n     about alleged leaks by then-Assistant Defense Secretary \n     Kenneth Bacon of\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\n     personnel information about Linda Tripp to a reporter. With \n     characteristic good humor, he told reporters after he \n     testified that Tripp's name came up ``now and again.''\n       Mr. Cooke was a presence on Sept. 11, rushing to aid rescue \n     and recovery operations. In the months after the rebuilding \n     began, the usually low-key administrator began making more \n     public appearances, speaking in memory of the victims.\n       At a speech in November, he told an Albany, N.Y., crowd: \n     ``The damage to the building will be rebuilt. You'll never \n     know the difference eventually.''\n       His wife of 52 years, Marion McDonald Cooke, died in 1999.\n       Survivors include three children, Michele C. Sutton of \n     Springfield and David Cooke and Lot Cooke, both of Fairfax; \n     and four grandchildren.\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7029-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. DONALD L. DURHAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding leader, Dr. Donald L. Durham, upon \nhis retirement from the Senior Executive Service as Deputy Director of \nthe Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command at the John C. Stennis \nSpace Center. Throughout his career, Dr. Durham has served with \ndistinction. It is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments \nand to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Navy, the \ngreat State of Mississippi, and our Nation.\n  Dr. Durham received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics and \nMathematics from Centre College, Danville, KY in 1964; a Master of \nScience Degree in Oceanography, Math, from Texas A University in \n1967; and a PhD in Physical Oceanography, Geophysics and Math, from \nTexas A University in 1972.\n  Following his doctoral thesis, Dr. Durham joined the Army Corps of \nEngineers as a research oceanographer at its Waterways Experiment \nStation in Vicksburg, MS. In 1978, he joined the staff of the Naval \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory, NOARL, at the John \nC. Stennis Space Center, MS as an oceanographer responsible for \nanalyzing and assessing numerous Navy oceanographic research programs \nand special projects, including several environmental acoustic/\noceanographic studies and tactical fleet exercises. From 1981-1986 at \nNOARL, Dr. Durham was Head of the Mapping, Charting and Geodesy, MC, \nDivision, which was responsible for project management and technical \nperformance of the integrated Navy Research Development, Test and \nEvaluation, RDT, program in MC\n  In 1986, Dr. Durham joined the staff of the Naval Meteorology and \nOceanography Command, Stennis Space Center, MS and served as Assistant \nChief of Staff for Program Integration until his selection as \nTechnical/Deputy Director on January 1, 1989. As Technical/Deputy \nDirector, Dr. Durham was the senior civilian manager and top scientific \nadvisor responsible for the planning, coordination, management, \ndirection and administration of broad, multi-disciplinary scientific, \nengineering and technical programs of the command. Under his guidance, \nthe command has made tremendous inroads in the fields of basic and \napplied Oceanography through the application of supercomputing \ntechnology, providing detailed environmental analysis that our naval \nforces could have only dreamed about a few years ago. His persistence \ntowards achieving excellence in his field of expertise is highly \ncommendable.\n  Dr. Durham's many awards include the Distinguished Executive \nPresidential Rank Award, Meritorious Executive Presidential Rank Award, \nDoD Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Award, Secretary \nof Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, Department of the Navy \nMeritorious Civilian Service Award, three Army Corps of Engineers' \nSpecial Act/Service Awards, Presidential Letter of Commendation, two \nNavy Commendations for Special Achievement, Marine Technology Society \nSpecial Commendation Award, Defense Mapping Agency Research and \nDevelopment Award, Kiwanis International Distinguished Service Award, \nCenter College Distinguished Alumnus Award, Danville High School \nDistinguished Alumnus Award, Mississippi Academy of Sciences Research \nAward, Who's Who in the South and Southwest, International Who's Who of \nProfessionals and the International Who's Who of Intellectuals.

Mr. President, last month more than 25 cyclists made the \n190-mile trip from Hampton, VA, to Washington, DC, to honor and \nremember victims of gun violence. According to the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, the People Pedaling Peace cyclists rode not only \nin honor of the victims of gun violence, but they rode for stronger, \nmore sensible gun safety laws in America.\n  Sandra and Mike McSweeney started People Pedaling Peace last year \nafter their daughter, Stephanie, was killed while walking out of a \nroller rink in Hampton, VA. Money raised by this year's bike ride will \nbe used to build a new playground in Stephanie's neighborhood so \nchildren can have a safe place to play. Elisha Encinias, a Columbine \nsurvivor who narrowly escaped the two gunmen in her classroom that \ntragic day in 1999, and Amber Hensley, who witnessed the 1999 rampage \nat Thurston High School in Springfield, OR, also joined in this year's \nbike trip. Unfortunately, the number of people like them is likely to \ngrow. They represent only a small number of Americans who have lost \nfamily and friends to gun violence.\n  According to the Detroit Free Press, through July 14th of this year, \n10 children under the age of 16 have been killed by gun fire and 25 \nchildren have been wounded by gunfire in metro Detroit. This past \nSunday, a 3-year-old boy found a shotgun, picked it up, and it \ndischarged. He wounded two other children, his 11-year-old sister and \n9-year-old cousin. A week ago on Detroit's east side, an 11-year-old \nboy was accidentally shot in the chest by his 13-year-old neighbor \nafter they found a handgun. Last month, a 14-year-old boy shot a 13-\nyear-old girl while the two were arguing in a Detroit home. Thankfully, \nthey all survived, but many have not. The need for sensible gun safety \nlegislation and vigorous enforcement of our gun laws is desperately \nneeded.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in recognizing the participants in \nthe People Pedaling Peace bike ride and expressing our thoughts and \nprayers to family, friends, and communities across America that have \nbeen affected by gun violence. And I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7029-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7029-S7030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 13, \n2001 in San Antonio, TX. A 39 year old man was attacked because he was \nthought to be a homosexual, according to police. The victim was \nattacked in a park by a man with a knife. The man held the victim in a \nbear hug before stabbing him in the chest with what was described as a \nthree-inch Buck knife. The suspect was heard to call the victim anti-\ngay names as he stabbed him.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7030-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DROUGHT EMERGENCY IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to a dire \nsituation in my state. North Carolina is in the midst of a severe \ndrought, and there is no significant rainfall in sight.\n  North Carolinians are used to hot, dry summers. But the dry spell has \nlingered and transformed itself into one of the worst droughts in the \nstate's history. The entire State is under drought condition and most \nareas are experiencing ``extreme drought.'' A significant portion of \nthe Piedmont is experiencing an ``exceptional drought,'' according to \nthe U.S. Geological Survey. In fact, the Piedmont is short almost a \nfull year's worth of rain and the city of Greensboro has a little more \nthan 100 days supply of water.\n  The damage estimates are already staggering. This drought has put \nmany of our farmers on the edge of financial ruin. At a time of the \nyear when you can drive down any rural North Carolina road and see \nlush, green crops ready for harvest, farmers are struggling to find \nenough water to save what hasn't already withered in the blazing sun. \nFarmers in more than half of North Carolina's 100 counties have already \nexperienced more than 35 percent crop loss and it is still early in our \ngrowing season.\n  But it is not just North Carolina's farmers that are suffering. Small \nbusinesses are particularly impacted by the mandatory water \nrestrictions. Believe it or not, drought is not a recognized disaster \nunder the Small Business Administration's Disaster Assistance Program.\n  Of course, we can't make it rain. We can't cool the weather and slow \nthe evaporation of our lakes and streams. But there are things we can \ndo to help those impacted by this disaster. There are steps we should \ntake immediately. I have asked Secretary Ann Veneman to certify our \ncounties as disaster so our farmers can get the crop loss assistance it \nis clear they will so desperately need. I urge the administration to \nquickly act to help my farmers. President Bush is scheduled to travel \nto Greensboro, one of the most parched areas of North Carolina next \nweek. I hope by then his administration will have recognized the dire \nconditions and approved my State's request for help.\n  In the meantime, I am proud to cosponsor the Small Business Drought \nRelief Act, S. 2734. This is a straightforward measure that will bring \nimportant relief to thousands of small business owners by expanding the \nSmall Business Administration's definition of disaster to include \ndroughts.\n  Another measure that I am supporting is the National Drought \nPreparedness Act of 2002, S. 2528. This measure creates a Federal \ndrought preparedness and response policy, one that is so obviously \nneeded. We in North Carolina know all too well the expertise and \nassistance the Federal Emergency Management Agency provides following a \nhurricane or tornado. We need that same clear, concise policy for \ndroughts.\n  But these measures can't help with the impact this drought is having \non my State right this moment. North Carolinians are doing their part. \nUnder the leadership of Governor Easley, cities and towns are advancing \nreasonable water-use restrictions. Residents are conserving, and we are \nall hoping and praying for a good rain.\n  We need the administration to act quickly on the state's disaster \nrequests. We need to get these residents the help they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7030-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PESTICIDE HARMONIZATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senators Conrad and \nRoberts for holding an important hearing today in the Senate \nAgriculture Production and Price Competitiveness Subcommittee \nconcerning S. 532, the Pesticide Harmonization Act. It is my pleasure \nto cosponsor this important legislation.\n  Differences in the prices of agricultural pesticides in the United \nStates and Canada are one of the most important issues in bilateral \ntrade discussions. Grains harvested in the United States compete on the \nopen market against grains grown in Canada. Much of Canadian grain is \ntreated with pesticides substantially less expensive than those used in \nthe United States. I feel it is necessary for the United States to \nallow growers to access Canadian pesticides in order to remain \ncompetitive on the open market. I commend Senator Dorgan for his \nleadership on this issue, as lead sponsor of this legislation, which \nwould allow U.S. farmers to access chemicals approved in the U.S. but \nsold at discounted rates in Canada.\n  Currently, farmers pay 117 to 193 percent higher pries in the U.S. \nthan in Canada for virtually identical products. Canadian producers are \napplying less expensive pesticides to their crops and exporting their \ncommodities to the U.S., where the same chemicals cannot be legally \npurchased at the Canadian reduced price by American producers. Our \nfarmers are not allowed access to these pesticides, but must still \ncompete with Canadian crops grown with these products.\n  American farmers are at a clear disadvantage to Canadian farmers due \nto the price differences in agricultural pesticides. This is another \nexample of how NAFTA has put American producers at a disadvantage. I \ndid not support or vote for NAFTA, even though supporters claimed that \nthe trade agreement would create free, equal trade between the U.S., \nCanada and Mexico. In fact, NAFTA contributes to the present \nagricultural pesticide differential pricing problem. Allowing Canada to \nexport millions of bushels of grain into the U.S. without restriction \nwas intended to create equal trade, but has instead placed our \nagricultural industry at a disadvantage.\n  Furthermore, the agricultural disadvantage that hinders American \nfarmers in this situation, benefits no one other than the pesticide \nindustry. This industry sells the same product to Americans for twice \nthe price that it is sold to the Canadians producers across the \nboarder.\n  S. 532 would eliminate the competitive advantage Canadian producers \nhave over American producers by amending the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act. This legislation would permit a State \nto register a Canadian pesticide for distribution and use within that \nState if the pesticide is substantially similar or identical to one \nalready registered in the U.S.\n  I am confident the time to act on this matter is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7030-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7030-S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE NATIONAL FARMWORKER JOBS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge Congress to support \nfull funding for the National Farmworker Jobs Program.\n  Zeroing out funding for the National Farmworker Jobs Program as \nproposed in the Bush Administration's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would be \nwrong for our country and wrong for New Jersey. Close to 600 migrant \nworkers make Cumberland County in southwestern New Jersey their \npermanent residence, with another 6,500 migrant workers estimated to \narrive in the county for farm work each year. If the proposed cut is \nultimately enacted, I am convinced that the quality of life for these \nworkers and workers throughout the State and country will fall \nsubstantially.\n  The National Farmworker Jobs Program was created in 1964 to address \nthe specific problems migrant workers face. By the very nature of their \nemployment, migrant workers often find\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nthemselves unemployed or underemployed, scraping by on an income well \nbelow the poverty line. Language and educational barriers often prevent \nthese workers from receiving permanent employment or attaining economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  Because their work takes them across various State and municipal \nborders, only a national program can address the problems faced by the \nmigrant farmworker population. The National Farmworker Jobs Program \nprovides housing, healthcare, and childcare assistance to workers they \ncan remain employed and provide for their families. Considering that \nmany of these hardworking families are not fluent in English, obtaining \nthese services would otherwise be a daunting if not impossible task.\n  The National Farmworker Jobs Program has assisted migrant workers \nwith education and job training since its inception. It has also played \nan active role in job placement, minimizing the amount of time migrant \nworkers remain unemployed. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, 85 \npercent of the National Farmworker Jobs Program enrollees received \nservices that enabled them to retain or enhance their agricultural \nemployment or secure new jobs at better wages. And that is with a \nbudget of just $80 million.\n  The National Farmworker Jobs Program services a vital social role, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7031-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING GENERAL BENJAMIN O. DAVIS, JR.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago as America celebrated the \nbirth of our Nation, one of its greatest military leaders passed away. \nGeneral Benjamin O. Davis Jr., 89, the legendary commander of the \nTuskegee Airmen, died at Army Reed Medical Center on the Fourth of \nJuly. Yesterday, General Davis was laid to rest in Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  From his youth Davis knew that he wanted to become a pilot and serve \nhis country. In 1932 he entered the U.S. Military Academy at West \nPoint. Throughout his years at West Point he was shunned by his fellow \ncadets who refused to speak with him. Think of it, 4 years at one of \nthe Nation's best institutions of higher education where no one spoke \nto you and you ate all of your meals alone. Davis once spoke of the \nintimidation and harassment he endured at the academy, saying, ``I \nwasn't leaving, this is something I wanted to do and I wasn't going to \nlet anybody drive me out.'' In 1936, Davis became the first African \nAmerican in the 20th century to graduate from West Point.\n  After graduation Davis applied for the Army Air Corps but was \nrejected because of his race. He became professor of military science \nat the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. In 1940, President Roosevelt \nissued an order allowing African Americans to fly for the military, and \nDavis immediately began his training at the Tuskegee Army Air Base. In \n1942 he took command of the first all-black air unit, the 99th fighter \nsquadron. Due to his excellent service in North Africa and Italy during \nWorld War II, he was promoted to colonel of the 322nd fighter group. As \na colonel, Davis led 200 air combat missions. Davis would tell his men, \n``We are not out looking for glory. We're out to do our mission.'' \nDuring his first mission, his 38 pilots held off over 100 German \nfighters. Davis's fighter group boasted an inspiring 100-percent \nsuccess rate. None of the bombers he protected was ever lost to enemy \nfire. Despite his success, he was not allowed to command white troops \nand was turned away from segregated officers' clubs.\n  After World War II, Davis led a fighter wing in the Korean War and, \nin 1953, was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the first black \ngeneral in the Air Force. Over the next 13 years he would rise in rank \nto lieutenant general and serve as deputy-commander-in-chief of U.S. \nStrike Command. When Davis retired from the Air Force in 1970, he was \nthe highest-ranking African American officer in the military.\n  After hanging up his uniform Davis continued serving our country. He \nsupervised the Federal Air Marshal Program and, in 1971, was named \nAssistant Secretary of Transportation.\n  In 1998 President Clinton awarded Davis his fourth star. ``One person \ncan bring about extraordinary change'' President Clinton said when \nspeaking of the general. At the White House ceremony then-Defense \nSecretary William S. Cohen stated that ``General Davis is often held up \nas a shining example of what is possible for African Americans. But \ntoday we honor him not only as a great African American. We honor him \nbecause like his father before him, he is a great warrior, a great \nofficer, and a great American.'' Indeed like his father, General \nBenjamin Oliver Davis Sr., he served his country with great patriotism \nin the face of discrimination. His father was the first African-\nAmerican general in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Even in his 80s, General Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr. still spoke with \nthe strong, dignified and commanding manner he was known for during his \nprofessional career. Steve Crump, an Emmy-Award-winning journalist in \nCharlotte, NC who did a documentary on the Tuskegee Airmen, recalled a \nspeech by General Davis to many of his fellow airmen. Crump said that \nthe general's attendance was a surprise to the audience and that upon \nseeing him walk out on to the stage, they snapped to attention just as \nthey had done more than 50 years earlier.\n  At Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, NC there is a KC-135 \ntanker with a portrait of Davis on its nose. The aircraft is dedicated \nto all the Tuskegee Airmen.\n  One of the greatest of the greatest generation is gone. As those who \npassed on before him did, General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. left us with a \nsimple template on how to conduct ourselves in service to our country. \nBe of great courage, character and humility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7031-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY BROWN\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the days of the \npioneers, when folks from miles around would gather to participate in \ncommunity barn-raisings, the spirit of neighbor helping neighbor has \nbeen part of the Oregon story. That spirit is alive and well today, as \nin every Oregon community you can find individuals who give their time \nand their talent to make that community a better place in which to \nlive, work, and raise a family. For the past 35 years, in the community \nof Grants Pass, that individual was Larry Brown, who passed away last \nweek after a courageous fight against cancer.\n  Larry was a forester by profession, and served in leadership \npositions for the Southern Oregon Timber Industries Association, the \nOregon Small Woodland Owners Association, and the Oregon Board of \nForestry Forest Practices Commission.\n  Larry was not only dedicated to growing healthy trees, he was also \ndedicated to growing healthy children. He served 5 years on the Grants \nPass School Board, and was a passionate advocate for programs \nbenefitting youth during his many years of service and leadership in \nthe Grants Pass Rotary Club.\n  Larry's love for his country could be seen in his 20 years of service \nin the Oregon National Guard. Larry retired from the National Guard as \na major in 1982, and during his service he was awarded the Meritorious \nService Medal and the Army Commendation Medal with 5 bronze oak leaf \nclusters.\n  Larry was also a passionate Republican. I am just one of many elected \nofficials who was constantly calling on Larry to organize an event or a \nmeeting. I knew that when I called on Larry, I was calling on someone \nwho knew and loved his community, and who would get the job done right.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, ``To live fully is to be engaged in \nthe passions of one's time.'' There can be no doubt that Larry Brown \nlived a full life, because he truly made a difference in the passions \nof his time.\n  I extend my condolences to Larry's wife, Georgette, who continues the \nfamily tradition of public service through her service as Josephine \nCounty Clerk, and to his daughters Monique and Martie.\n  I am just one of many elected officials who relied on Larry's \ncounsel, advice, and friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7031-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7031-S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MAJOR W. WHEELOCK\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a man that has dedicated the last 7\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nyears of his life to helping those less fortunate than himself, Major \nW. Wheelock.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Major Wheelock has most recently \nserved as the President/CEO of Crotched Mountain foundation in \nGreenfield, New Hampshire and has previously served as Executive Vice \nPresident/Treasurer of Franklin Pierce College. Major Wheelock retired \nin June of this year. As part of his tireless service to others, Major \nparticipates in the River Mead Retirement Community as a board member; \nthe Yankee Publishing, Inc. as a board member; New Hampshire 2002 \nHealth and Educational Facilities Authority as Board Vice Chair; and \nNew Hampshire Hospital Association as a Board Vice Chair.\n  The service Major Wheelock has provided Crotched Mountain School was \ndoubtless a devotion to those that receive an education there. Crotched \nMountain School provides outstanding rehabilitative programs for \nstudents with disabilities in Kindergarten through twelfth grade. His \nduty and service are apparent through his love and devotion for the \nstudents at Crotched Mountain.\n  More than doing an exceptional job, Major Wheelock is to be commended \nfor his service to such a worthy organization.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the life of a dear friend William Ruger, one of the greatest gun \ndesigners and manufacturers in the nation.\n  Joining with Alexander McCormick Sturm in 1949 Ruger founded Sturm \nRuger & Co., the largest firearms designer, manufacturer, and \ndistributer in the United States. At the time Ruger's company produced \nmore varieties of sport firearms than any other firm in the world. \nTurning out his first design in 1949, Ruger's pistol soon became one of \nAmerica's favorite hand guns, still widely used by many gun owners \ntoday.\n  Ruger would soon design a light machine gun for the United States \nArmy and would continue designing and patenting dozens of guns \nthroughout the last 53 years. ``Ruger was a true firearms genius who \nmastered the disciplines of inventing, designing, engineering, \nmanufacturing and marketing better than anyone since Samuel Colt,'' \nsaid R.L. Wilson, a firearms historian and Ruger Biographer. ``No one \nin the 20th century so clearly dominated the field or was so skilled at \narticulating the unique appeal of quality firearms for legitimate \nuses.''\n  Recently as chairman emeritus Ruger oversaw the manufacturing of \nhigh-quality rifles, shotguns, pistols, and revolvers that law \nenforcement and sporting enthusiasts have come to expect. Ruger kept a \nwatchful eye on the company as it prospered, building manufacturing \nfacilities in a number of New Hampshire's towns providing work for \nmany.\n  I have found great friendship with Ruger throughout the last years of \nhis life and continue to admire and cherish the friendship that I have \nwith his family. He was not only a great husband and father but a great \nbusinessman, American patriot, and friend.\n  It was an honor representing William Ruger in the U.S. Senate and \nremains a distinct privilege in serving his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7032-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE MOUNT WASHINGTON HOTEL & RESORT CELEBRATES A CENTURY OF GRANDEUR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire's. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate The Mount Washington Hotel & Resort on 100 years of New \nEngland splendor.\n  Located in New Hampshire's White Mountains, The Mount Washington \nHotel & Resort emanates the elegance and style of a bygone era. \nBeginning as a dream of Joseph Strickney in 1902, this superlative of \nSpanish Renaissance architecture quickly became the place to hobnob \nwith poets, presidents and princes.

A bill to improve the provision of telehealth services under \nthe Medicare program, to provide grants for the development of \ntelehealth networks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce, \nalong with Senator Conrad of North Dakota, legislation that would \ngreatly enhance the use of telehealth technology to bring badly-needed \nhealth care services to rural and underserved areas throughout the \ncountry.\n  This bill would allow for greater reimbursement for telehealth \nservices under Medicare and calls for a valuable investment in the \ndevelopment of new and more advanced telehealth networks in underserved \nareas. Telehealth is the future of rural health care. Access to quality \nhealth care in rural areas is at a critical stage. Today, many ill and \ndisabled people must drive hundreds of miles, often in bad weather on \ndangerous roads, just to receive the most basic of health care. Access \nto specialists is even more prohibitive. However, by using much of the \nsame technologies that we use to communicate with our constituents from \nhere in Washington, we can bring quality health care, and specialty \ncare, to their local health care provider.\n  I would like to thank Senator Conrad, who has been a longtime \nsupporter of telehealth services, for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation. Our bill would allow a wide variety of health \ncare practitioners to provide telehealth services under Medicare. One \nof the biggest challenges for rural practitioners is obtaining the \nresources and infrastructure to provide technologically advanced \ntelehealth services. Our bill would also provide valuable resources for \nthe development of new telehealth networks in rural and underserved \nareas.\n  Technology in America is booming. We must embrace this technology as \na cost-effective way to improve health care in rural and underserved \nareas. This legislation takes a large step in providing a modest \ninvestment toward the improvement of rural health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Breaux, \n        and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2752. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the establishment of medicare demonstration programs to \nimprove health care quality; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntoday on an issue that has been and will continue to be important and \nvital to the health of all Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare's origins \ndate back to 1965; since that time little has changed in the \nrelationship between incentives to provide care and quality of care \nreceived. The current system does not reward or provide incentives for \nproviding quality health care. Instead, what has evolved over the last \nyears is a perplexing data base of well documented facts concerning \nquality and utilization. This information is very difficult to explain \nbut hard to ignore. Why is it that the utilization of some surgical \nprocedures varies tremendously from one part of the country to the \nnext? Why is it that the cost of care per beneficiary varies from \nlocation to location without clear differences in outcomes, survival, \nor quality? Today, after much work with numerous health systems, \npatient advocacy organizations, and medical quality researchers, my \ncolleagues Senators Frist, Gregg, Breaux and Feingold and I are pleased \nto announce the introduction of legislation to create Medicare \ndemonstration projects to address these issues.\n  The incentives, both financial and non-financial, to provide best \nhealthcare to Medicare beneficiaries are complex and poorly understood. \nThese incentives have historically been rooted in the longstanding \nMedicare fee-for-service payment model. In an effort to better align \nthe incentives to provide care with best practice guidelines, \nappropriate utilization, adherence to best medical information, and \nbest outcomes we have written legislation to address these issues \nthrough a Medicare demonstration project. This project will implement \ncontinuous quality improvement mechanisms that are aimed at integrating \nprimary care, referral care, support care, and outpatient services. The \nbill will encourage patient participation in care decisions; strive to \nachieve the proper allocation of health care resources; identify the \nappropriate use of culturally and ethnically sensitive services in \nhealth care delivery; and document the financial effects of these \ndecisions on the medical marketplace.\n  As we enter an era of rapidly increasing numbers of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, it will be increasingly important that we re-evaluate \nthe Medicare program to insure that the quality of care received is \nuniformly exceptional in its delivery and quality. It is appropriate \nthat we continue to find better ways to insure that the norms of \nquality health care are established and followed. It is my sincere hope \nthat my colleges will join me in this endeavor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nQuality Improvement Act--a bill to help revitalize the Medicare Program \nby providing for the alignment of payment and other incentives. I want \nto thank Senators Jeffords, Gregg, and Breaux for their work in helping \ncraft this crucial legislation.\n  To meet the needs of the 21st century health care system, it is \ncritical that payment policies be aligned to encourage and support \nquality improvement efforts. Even among health professionals motivated \nto provide the best care possible, the structure of payment and other \nincentives may not facilitate the actions needed to systematically \nimprove the quality of care, and may even prevent such actions. For \nexample, redesigning care processes to improve follow-up for \nchronically ill patients through electronic communication may reduce \noffice visits and decrease revenues for a medical group under some \npayment schemes.\n  Current payment practices are complex and contradictory; and although \nincremental improvements are possible, more fundamental reform will be \nneeded. In this report, ``Crossing the Quality Chasm,'' the Institute \nof Medicine encouraged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nand the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to develop a \nresearch agenda to identify, test, and evaluate options for better \naligning payment methods with quality improvement goals. The \ndemonstration project authorized by this legislation is part of that \nlarger research agenda--to help us understand the appropriate alight of \npayment and other incentives and improve the quality of health care in \na way that will not increase the overall costs of Medicare.\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\n  We already have identified appropriate ways to align provider \nincentives. Research supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \nhas noted at least 11 different incentive models--models that can be \nimplemented by a wide variety of organizations and applied to a range \nof medical groups, providers, and health plans. In many circumstances, \nkey components of these models have been implemented in several health \ncare markets, and the research has shown that both financial and \nnonfinancial incentives, such as technical assistance, are important in \nmotiving appropriate care. However, we do not know how these incentives \nmight apply to Medicare, and that is why this demonstration is so \nvital.\n  It has been an honor and a pleasure to work closely with my \ndistinguished colleagues on this bill, and I look forward to continuing \nto work with them and others as we move forward on the debate about how \nto more appropriately reform Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Carnahan:\n  S. 2753. A bill to provide for a Small and Disadvantaged Business \nOmbudsman for Procurement in the Small Business Administration, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a critical \npiece of legislation intended to help small businesses receive their \nfair share of the Federal procurement pie and to ensure that they are \nbeing treated fairly within the Federal procurement system. I would \nlike to thank my cosponsors, Senators Bond, Cleland, Cantwell, Bingaman \nand Carnahan for working with me and small business groups to craft \nthis legislation, as well as Congressman Albert Wynn, for his \npartnership on this legislation. Congressman Wynn will soon be \nintroducing companion legislation in the House.\n  In my time as Chairman of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship and previously as Ranking Member, two facts regarding \nsmall business procurement have made themselves very clear, small \nbusinesses are not getting their fair share of Federal procurement and \nthere is no one in the entire Federal Government with the sole \nresponsibility of advocating for small businesses, governmentwide, in \nthe procurement process and ensuring that Federal agencies and large \nbusiness prime contractors treat small businesses fairly. Some \nindividuals are responsible for portions of this job, but no one \nperforms this role as their primary job function or has the authority \nto do so solely.\n  I felt this was a glaring oversight and looked to the current make-up \nof the SBA to see if it could be rectified. My solution is a new \nposition modeled along the Small Business Administration's, SBA, \nregulatory ombudsman, which could focus solely on procurement matters. \nA new ombudsman for small business procurement, or the Small and \nDisadvantaged Business Ombudsman, is needed to fill this role for \nprocurement matters, just as the SBA's National Ombudsman does for \nregulatory issues. By creating a parallel position, each ombudsman can \nfocus on his or her key mission, without detracting from either \nregulatory or procurement issues important to the small business \ncommunity.\n  While no legislation alone can ever solve the complex problems faced \nby small businesses in today's Federal procurement environment, I \nbelieve the creation of a Small and Disadvantaged Business Ombudsman at \nthe SBA will put us firmly on the right track and address several \nprocurement issues raised through program oversight and communication \nwith small business owners.\n  For example, small businesses frequently contact my office to report \nproblems they are having with a prime contractor or a contracting \nagency. Too often, these businesses are afraid to come forward and make \nan official complaint for fear of being blackballed and denied future \ncontracting opportunities. The SDB Ombudsman will provide one solution \nfor these small businesses who fear being blacklisted by allowing them \nto submit confidential complaints. The SDB Ombudsman will have the \nresponsibility of tracking these complaints and trying to rectify them.\n  The SDB Ombudsman will also work to change the culture at Federal \nprocuring agencies by tracking and reporting on the training of \nprocurement personnel and working to ensure that this training not only \nincludes the ``How to's'' of small business participation, but also \nincludes training on why small business participation is crucial to \nagency success and the national economy.\n\n  Until the Federal Government, at all levels, realizes the importance \nof doing business with small business, small business participation in \nFederal procurement will continue to decline, our Nation will lose its \naccess to a wide range of small business suppliers, and small \nbusinesses across the country will continue to lose billions of dollars \nin procurement opportunities year after year. Of critical importance in \nthe legislation is the first statutory consequence of an agency failing \nto meet its small business goals. Under the legislation, if an agency \nfails to meet any small business goal, the agency would be required to \nsubmit a report and an action plan to the SDB Ombudsman detailing why \nthe agency failed to meet its small business goal or goals, and what \nthe agency intends to do to remedy the situation.\n  The SDB Ombudsman will also be responsible for tracking compliance \nwith Section (k) of the Small Business Act, which stipulates, in part, \nthat the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \nUtilization at each Federal agency shall report to the head or deputy \nhead of the agency. Late last year, with the support of Ranking Member \nBond, I sent a letter to 21 Federal agencies to gauge compliance with \nthis provision. Using a very lenient standard of compliance, I have \nconcluded that at least nine of the Federal agencies surveyed are in \nviolation of Section (k) of the Small Business Act. This is \nunacceptable.\n  On June 19, 2002, the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship help a roundtable to discuss Federal procurement \npolicies. The roundtable, title ``Are Government Purchasing Policies \nHurting Small Business?'' was attended by a wide range of small \nbusiness advocates, small business owners and government officials. One \nof the topics discussed during the roundtable was my draft proposal, \nthe SDB Ombudsman Act, to create a new position at the SBA to monitor \nFederal agency compliance with certain provisions of the Small Business \nAct and serve as a focal point to assist small businesses that were \ntreated unfairly in the Federal procurement process.\n  During the Roundtable, I asked the participants for their \nrecommendations on how to improve the legislation to ensure that the \nSDB Ombudsman serves as the most effective advocate possible for small \nbusiness. The Committee record was also kept open for two weeks so that \nparticipants could submit further comments.\n  I have now reviewed the Committee record and further submissions and \nam pleased to say that the responses were very positive. Several \nimportant suggestions were made to strengthen the Office of Small and \nDisadvantaged Business Utilization at each Federal agency as an \nimportant corollary to the creation of the SDB Ombudsman, since the SDB \nOmbudsman would be relying on each OSDBU to fulfill his or her \nstatutory responsibilities.\n  Many other small businesses have come to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship and requested that we strengthen the \nOSDBUs at each agency as well. This legislation fulfills that request \nby including six new provisions.\n\n  First, the legislation clarifies that OSDBU Directors shall report to \nthe highest level at each agency. In the study I mentioned previously, \ntoo often, an agency cited a bifurcated reporting system whereby the \nOSDBU Director reports to the head or deputy head on small business \nmatters, but to other, lower-ranking personnel for budgetary or \npersonnel matters. The Small Business Act does not envision such a \nsystem. Therefore, I felt it necessary to clarify, in no uncertain \nterms, that the OSDBU Director must report to the head or deputy head \nof his or her agency only, for all matters.\n  Second, the legislation requires that all OSDBU Directors now be \ncareer personnel. The Director's position is one\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\nof advocacy, which often entails challenging co-workers and political \npersonnel, including superiors. Under current law, OSDBU Directors may \nbe political appointees. While this has worked in some instances, I \nbelieve the small business community would be better served by career \npersonnel with job protections.\n  Third, the legislation requires the OSDBU Director to be well-\nqualified in assisting small businesses with procurement matters. No \none disputes the expertise of Federal procurement officials; however, \nprocurement expertise does not always translate to small business \nprocurement expertise. This provision will help ensure that small \nbusinesses are being served by those who understand their particular \nprocurement needs.\n  Fourth, the legislation requires that, at major Federal agencies, the \nOSDBU Director have no job responsibilities outside the scope of the \nauthorizing legislation. This provision was included because far too \nmany agencies assign the OSDBU Director title to their procurement \nchief or another official with similar responsibilities, while the \nactual OSDBU program is run by someone else. This provision will stop \nthis abuse.\n  Fifth, the legislation requires that a procurement chief not serve as \nthe Director of the OSDBU program at a Federal agency. I firmly believe \nthat the OSDBU Director's goal is fundamentally different from, and at \ntimes even opposed to, that of a chief procurement official who must be \nfair to all Federal contractors. An OSDBU Director's role is one of \nadvocacy. He or she must take the side of small business, and no \nprocurement chief can do this and perform both jobs fairly and \neffectively. While OSDBU Directors at major Federal agencies are barred \nfrom having additional responsibilities under this legislation, non-\nmajor Federal agency OSDBU Directors may. This provision will help \nensure that at our non-major Federal agencies, the OSDBU Director can \nact fairly on behalf of small businesses.\n  Sixth, the legislation provides statutory authority for the OSDBU \nCouncil. Under the legislation, each OSDBU Director will have \nmembership on the Council, which will meet at least once every two \nmonths. The Council's role is to discuss issues of importance to the \nOSDBUs and the small business community they serve. OSDBU Directors \nserving at major Federal agencies have as a part of their \nresponsibilities an obligation, under this legislation, to attend \nCouncil meetings. This provision was included to once again prevent \nFederal agencies from circumventing the Small Business Act. Attendance \nat Council meetings will help ensure that Federal agencies are \ncomplying with the law and that OSDBU Directors are small business \nadvocates, not simply procurement personnel with two hats.\n\n  One final note on the legislation is that the inclusion of a \nprovision to increase the governmentwide small business prime \ncontracting procurement goal from 23 percent to 30 percent has been \nretained, although it will now be phased in over three years: 26 \npercent in FY 2004, 28 percent in FY 2005 and 30 percent in FY 2006 and \nthereafter.\n  When I first made the suggestion that the small business procurement \ngoal should be increased seven percentage points, my office received \nnumerous calls, both in support of the increase and in opposition. Some \neven suggested raising the goal to a level of 40 percent. But, by and \nlarge, those in opposition pointed to one fact: The Federal Government \nhas never achieved such a level of small business procurement \nparticipation. And while that is true, no one said that it was \nimpossible. Given the disappointing achievement of the Federal \nGovernment on the current small business goal of 23 percent, I believe \nit is time to raise the bar.\n  When Congress enacted goals as part of the Small Business act, the \ngoals were intended to be a minimum standard of achievement. For too \nlong, the goals have been treated as a target for attainment, not a \nminimum level of acceptable small business participation. This too must \nchange. Almost every year the Federal Government comes very close to \nhitting the small business prime contracting goal of 23 percent right \non the head. Some years it does slightly better, and some years, \nunfortunately, it does slightly worse. However, this trend demonstrates \none important principle, the government is firmly shooting for 23 \npercent, no more--no less.\n  By raising the statutory goal, it is my hope that the Federal \nGovernment will shoot for the higher target and succeed. But I ask my \ncolleagues to look at this critically in that the goal for small \nbusiness isn't so much being raised as the 77 percent of Federal \nprocurement that now goes to large businesses, which represent only a \ntiny portion of all Federal contractors, is being reduced to 70 \npercent. So if the small business goal should increase to 30 percent, \n70 percent of all Federal procurement will still be awarded to a \nrelatively small number of all Federal contractors. Is this fair to \nsmall business? No. But it is an improvement.\n  I am pleased to say that my legislation is supported by groups \nrepresenting primarily small businesses or small business contractors, \nsuch as the National Small Business United, NSBU, Women Impacting \nPublic Policy, WIPP, and the Association of Small and Disadvantaged \nBusiness, as well as advocacy groups such as the Latin American \nManagement Association, LAMA, the Minority Business Enterprise Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, MBELDEF, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nVFW.\n  I thank them as well as the cosponsors of this legislation, Senators \nBond, Cleland, Cantwell, Bingaman and Carnahan for their assistance, \ninput and support, and I look forward to continuing to work with them \non this and other important issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Small and Disadvantaged \nBusiness Ombudsman Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Presidential Commission on the United \nStates Postal Service; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``United \nStates Postal Service Commission Act of 2002.'' This legislation will \nestablish a Commission to examine the challenges facing the Postal \nService and develop\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nsolutions to ensure its long term viability and increased efficiency.\n  The Postal Service's problems have reached a near crisis level. In \n2000, the Postal Service lost nearly $200 million, while in 2001, this \nloss ballooned to $1.68 billion. Losses are projected to be $1.35 \nbillion this year, despite the $675 million in appropriations from \nCongress to cover the unanticipated costs associated with the September \n11 attacks and the anthrax incidents. The Postal Service is mandated by \nlaw to break even on its operating expenses and its capital needs, both \nof which continue to grow.\n  The Postal Service is also fast approaching its $15 billion statutory \nborrowing limit. Given its recent history of increasing rather than \npaying down its debt, increasing the Postal Service's debt ceiling is \nnot the answer. In addition, the Postal Service's long term liabilities \nare enormous, to the tune of nearly $6 billion for Workers Compensation \nclaims, a staggering $32 billion in retirement costs and perhaps as \nmuch as $45 billion to cover retiree health care costs. Meanwhile, on \nJune 30, consumers experienced a third postal rate increase in just 18 \nmonths.\n  How could the Postal Service have landed in such dire straits? The \nPostal Service's problems stem from many causes. For example, the \noverall growth rate of mail has been declining since 1997, and first \nclass mail volumes actually have declined over the past four years. \nThis is particularly significant, as first class mail accounts for 48 \npercent of total mail volume. In addition, revenues from first class \nmail cover more than two-thirds of institutional costs, such as post \noffices. Shortfalls must be made up by decreasing costs, increasing \nvolumes in other categories of mail or by increasing postal rates.\n  Some of this declining volume can be attributed to the increasing \nforms of electronic communication, particularly the Internet, which has \nrevolutionized the way we communicate and transact business. For \nexample, while financial statements, bills and bill payments constitute \nabout half of first class mail revenue, or about $17 billion annually, \nelectronic bill payment is quickly becoming a major means of doing \nbusiness. It is estimated that 75 percent of banks will provide online \nbanking services by 2003. This is in addition to other competing \nmethods of communication such as faxes and telephones. In addition, \nfiling tax returns, receiving Social Security payments, and many other \ntransactions are also available electronically.\n  The Postal Service also faces significant labor-related costs. Indeed \nnearly 80 percent of its expenses are related to compensation and \nbenefits. By comparison, 56 percent of FedEx's expenses and 42 percent \nof UPS's expenses are related to compensation and benefits.\n  The need to preserve a viable Postal Service is clear. Americans rely \non affordable, reliable and universal mail delivery as their primary \nmeans of communication. The Postal Service delivers more than 200 \nbillion pieces of mail each year to nearly 140 million addresses, which \naccounts for more than 40 percent of the world's mail. Moreover, 1.7 \nmillion new delivery points are added each year--roughly the equivalent \nof adding the number of addresses in Chicago. More than seven million \nAmericans visit post offices each day.\n  In States with large rural areas, such as Maine, it is vital that \npostal services remain in place. If the Postal Service were no longer \nobligated to provide universal service and deliver mail to every \ncustomer, six days a week, the affordable communication link upon which \nmany Americans rely would be jeopardized. Most commercial enterprises \nwould find it uneconomical, if not impossible, to deliver mail and \npackages to these areas at rates that the Postal Service has been \noffering.\n  In addition to providing a critical service to consumers, the Postal \nService is the eleventh largest enterprise in the Nation with $66 \nbillion in annual revenues. This is more than Microsoft, McDonald's and \nCoca Cola combined. While the Postal Service itself employs more \nthan 700,000 career employees, it is also the linchpin of a $900 \nbillion mailing industry that employs nine million Americans in fields \nas diverse as direct mailing, printing and paper production.\n\n  Affordable postal rates are vital to the economic health of many \ncompanies, especially magazines, catalog houses and the service \nproviders they use. The June 2002 rate hike alone represents a ten \npercent increase for periodicals, and a nine percent increase for \ncatalogs. It is estimated that the combined effect of the past three \nrate increases, totaling 22 percent over just 18 months, have cost the \nmagazine industry about $400 million.\n  In May I met with a group of about twenty Maine businessmen and women \ninvolved in the mailing industry, who described for me the impact that \nrising postal rates have on their businesses. One magazine publisher \ntold me that postage represents ten percent of her costs. I was amazed \nto hear that one of the catalog busineses pays more for postage a year \nthan it pays to any one of the companies that supply the raw materials \nfor its products. It was also startling to hear from one printer that \nhis postage costs have doubled over the last ten years.\n  Most of the people I met with are small business owners, and there \nare millions more across the country, all grappling with the same \neffects of rapidly rising postage costs.\n  At the request of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and House \nCommittee on Government Reform, the Postal Service produced a \ncomprehensive Transformation Plan, which it presented to Congress in \nApril. The Plan addresses general measures that the Postal Service \nbelieves it needs to take to ensure its survival, but it fails to lay \nout specific steps the Postal Service will take and a timeline for \naction. It is also unclear whether these measures will result in the \ncost savings necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the Postal \nService.\n  Many attempts have been made to reform the Postal Service over the \nyears. My colleagues in the House of Representatives have tried for \nnearly eight years to pass postal reform legislation, but to no avail. \nStakeholders have widely diverging views on what shape postal reform \nshould take, if any. This lack of consensus on how or whether to deal \nwith divisive issues has led only to stalemates in Congress.\n  To take a fresh look at these difficult issues, I rise today to \nintroduce legislation establishing a Presidential Postal Commission \ncharged with examining the problems that the Postal Service faces, and \ndeveloping specific recommendations and legislative proposals that \nCongress and the Postal Service can implement. Precedent exists for \nsuch a commission. In the late 1960s, the Kappel Commission was formed \nto resolve the crisis situation that the former Postal Department then \nfound itself in, train cars of undelivered mail, strikes, and a host of \nother problems. The Kappel Commission's efforts laid the groundwork for \nthe Postal Service we have today, which has functioned admirably for \nmany years but is now in serious trouble.\n  Mindful of the body of work that has been done in this area by my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate, by the General Accounting Office, \nby the Postal Service itself and by others, I intend that this \ncommission have a short life of one year, during which it will carry \nout its study and produce legislative proposals for consideration by \nthe Administration and the Congress.\n  Finally, I intend that the commission consider all relevant aspects \nof the Postal Service. Everything should be put on the table and \nevaluated. We need to ensure that the Postal Service will stand up to \nthe challenges it is facing today and will face tomorrow.\n  These and many more issues must be examined in depth, if we are to \npreserve this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for \ncommunication and for their livelihood. The Postal Service has \nsuccessfully overcome numerous difficulties over its 226-year history, \nand has continued to deliver the mail faithfully. Yet it has reached a \ncritical juncture and once again, it is time for a thorough evaluation \nof the Postal Service's operations and requirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. SPECTER):\n  S. 2755. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the opening of the National Constitution \nCenter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania scheduled for\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\nJuly 4, 2003; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President I am pleased to introduce legislation \nalong with my colleague Senator Specter to establish a one dollar \nsilver coin that will benefit the National Constitution Center in \nPhiladelphia, PA.\n  As the first national center of its kind in the country, the National \nConstitution Center will promote understanding of the United States \nConstitution and its values. The events of the past year in our nation \nas well as recent judicial rulings have brought increased attention to \nthose principles and values that define and bind us as Americans. All \nwould agree that the United States Constitution is central to defining \nour country, who we are, and how we live as Americans. Even as we often \ndebate in the halls of Congress and the Supreme Court those policies \nand laws that best reflect the values and intent of the Constitution, \nwe all recognize the freedoms and opportunity that this remarkable \ndocument secures for us.\n  The National Constitution Center has been an important project in \nPhiladelphia with which Senator Specter and I have been involved. \nConstruction began on September 17, 2000. When the Constitution Center \nis completed as expected on July 4, 2003, it will be a key feature of a \nrevitalized Independence Mall where it will join Independence Hall and \nthe Liberty Bell. The issuance of this coin would coincide with the \nopening of the Center.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support the National Constitution \nCenter by cosponsoring this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nrecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Constitution Center \n     Commemorative Coin Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a Constitutional Convention was convened in the summer \n     of 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the purposes of \n     replacing the failed Articles of Confederation as a framework \n     for governing the 13 American colonies newly independent from \n     Great Britain;\n       (2) the United States Constitution produced by the \n     Convention would set the United States of America on a unique \n     course of experiment in self-government that would profoundly \n     impact the United States and the world;\n       (3) in its deliberations and promotion through such \n     literary works as The Federalist Papers, the United States \n     Constitution drew upon the successes and failures of nations \n     and peoples dating as far back as the city-state republics of \n     ancient Greece in forming representative governments;\n       (4) the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, known as \n     the Bill of Rights, comprise the best written set of legal \n     protections of the rights and dignity of the individual in \n     the history of human civilization and continue to be the \n     benchmark for nations' adherence to human rights standards;\n       (5) the principles of the United States Constitution have \n     been enacted into the governing laws of numerous free \n     countries around the globe, and are reflected in the founding \n     documents of the United Nations;\n       (6) the United States Constitution created the framework \n     for what is now the oldest representative democracy in the \n     world;\n       (7) in its wisdom, the Constitutional Convention created a \n     mechanism through which the United States Constitution can be \n     perfected, as it has been 27 times to date, to better reflect \n     its founding ideals, as well as to accommodate changing \n     circumstances;\n       (8) the rights and freedoms secured to Americans by the \n     United States Constitution have and continue to draw millions \n     from around the globe to the shores of this Nation;\n       (9) all Americans should gain an understanding of and \n     appreciation for the United States Constitution and the role \n     this remarkable document plays in the freedoms and quality of \n     life they enjoy;\n       (10) the National Constitution Center was established by \n     the Constitution Heritage Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 407aa et \n     seq.), which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan \n     on September 16, 1988, to provide for continuing \n     interpretation of the Constitution and to establish a \n     national center for the United States Constitution; and\n       (11) the National Constitution Center, located at the site \n     of the birth of the Constitution, only steps away from the \n     Liberty Bell and Independence Hall in the Independence \n     National Historic Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the \n     only center in the world solely dedicated to promoting \n     understanding of the Constitution and its values and ideals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage \nPartnership in the States of Vermont and New York, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce the \nChamplain Valley National Heritage Act of 2002. I am joined by Senator \nLeahy and\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nSenators Schumer and Clinton of New York. This bill will establish a \nNational Heritage Partnership within the Champlain Valley. Passage of \nthis bill will culminate a process to enhance the incredible cultural \nresources of the Champlain Valley.\n  The Champlain Valley of Vermont and New York has one of the richest \nand most intact collections of historic resources in the United States. \nFort Ticonderoga still stands where it has for centuries, at the scene \nof numerous battles critical to the birth of our Nation. Revolutionary \ngunboats have recently been found fully intact on the bottom of Lake \nChamplain. Our cemeteries are the permanent resting place for great \nexplorers, soldiers and sailors. The United States and Canada would not \nexist today but for events that occurred in this region.\n  We in Vermont and New York take great pride in our history. We \npreserve it, honor it and show it off to visitors from around the \nworld. These visitors are also very important to our economy. Tourism \nis among the most important industries in this region and has much \npotential for growth.\n  The Champlain Valley Heritage Partnership will bring together more \nthan one hundred local groups working to preserve and promote our \nheritage. Up to $2 million a year will be made available from the \nNational Park Service though the Lake Champlain Basin Program to \nsupport local efforts to preserve and interpret our heritage and \npresent it to the world. Most of the funding will be given to small \ncommunities to help preserve their heritage and develop economic \nopportunities.\n  This project has taken many years for me to bring to the point of \nintroducing legislation. This has been time well spent working at the \ngrass-roots level to develop a framework to direct federal resources to \nwhere it will do the most good. I am confident that we have found the \nbest model. This will be a true partnership that supports each member \nbut does not impose any new Federal requirements.\n  The Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership will preserve our \nhistoric resources, interpret and teach about the events that shaped \nour Nation and will be an engine for economic growth. I am hopeful that \nthis bill soon become law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my Senate \ncolleagues from Vermont and New York as we introduce the Lake Champlain \nHeritage Act of 2002. With this legislation, we will take an important \nstep in recognizing the importance of the Lake Champlain Valley in the \nhistory of America.\n  I want to thank Senator Jeffords and his staff for all the work they \nhave put into this effort. I know that many hours have gone into the \nresearch, discussion and editing to get where we are today. I also want \nto thank Senators Clinton and Schumer who are our valuable New York \npartners in all things related to Lake Champlain.\n  Over the July 4th recess, I was able to participate in the Lake \nChamplain Maritime Museum's opening of a new exhibit featuring \nartifacts recovered from the 1776 Revolutionary War Battle of Valcour. \nIt was just 1 year ago that Senator Clinton and I were at the site of \nthe Battle to take part in the recovery and beginning of the \nconservation process of those artifacts.\n  The Valcour Bay Research Project followed the 1997 discovery of the \nmissing American gunboat from the Battle. I bring this up because our \npurpose today as we introduce this legislation underscores to the rest \nof our Nation a message we Vermonters and New Yorkers have long \nproclaimed: the role of Lake Champlain in the cause of American \nindependence cannot be overlooked.\n  The evidence of the struggle for this strategic waterway from the \ndays of Native American excursions, through the colonial rivalry \nbetween Britain and France, our War of Independence, until the end of \nthe War of 1812, constantly surrounds those of us who make our homes in \nthis Valley.\n  This act is intended to advance the cultural heritage goals of \n``Opportunities for Action,'' the comprehensive plan developed under \nthe Lake Champlain Special Designation Act by the Lake Champlain Basin \nProgram with broad public input and support as well as with the \ninvolvement of local, State and Federal Governments.\n  We envision activities such as locally planned and managed heritage \nnetworks and programs, a management strategy for the Lake's underwater \ncultural resources and strengthening the links between cultural \nresources and economic development. This legislation will also help \nprovide assistance as the 400th anniversary of Samuel De Champlain's \narrival in the Valley is commemorated in 2009.\n  Today, we are taking a significant step in helping all Americans \nbetter appreciate the full history of the Lake Champlain Valley which \nholds such an extensive collection of historic sites and artifacts.\n  As Vermonters and New Yorkers the stewards of Lake Champlain, we have \na serious responsibility to conserve this evidence for future \ngenerations. We believe that what we do here, how we manage the \ncultural heritage of the Valley, can contribute to the growing debate \non how present generations can live and prosper on the same ground that \nwe conserve as our natural and cultural heritage.\n  Our Vermont and New York Champlain Valley communities share this \nheritage and have helped us develop a vision to enhance the \nconservation, interpretation and enjoyment of our shared history and to \nmake it more readily available to residents and visitors alike. We can \nhelp revitalize local economies and promote heritage tourism as we \nimprove the stewardship of the Valley's cultural legacy by making \nadditional resources available to communities and organizations through \nthe Lake Champlain Basin Program.\n  I think it is most fitting that we have come here together to \nintroduce this long-awaited bill, reasserting our partnership for Lake \nChamplain: Vermont and New York engaged in a cooperative effort to \nconserve, interpret, and honor our common heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2757. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to add \noutpatient prescription drug coverage as a new and integral benefit \nunder Part B of Medicare. Under this bill, like the rest of the \nservices under Part B, Medicare will pick up 80 percent of the cost of \nprescription drugs. This would be the case until a beneficiary hits a \n$4000 annual out-of-pocket limit, at which point the government picks \nup 100 percent of drug costs. Moreover, beneficiaries will not have to \npay increased monthly premiums or annual deductibles as a result of \nthis new drug benefit.\n  Now, we have been discussing prescription drug coverage for seniors \nin this chamber for many years, and there have been numerous proposals \nbrought forward. Some might ask, why do you feel the need to propose \nyour own prescription drug plan; what is wrong with the many previous \nproposals.\n  Well, to my way of thinking, we have lost our focus on this issue. In \ndeveloping a drug plan, we have concentrated too much on such things as \nbudget allotments, philosophy of government, desires of committee \nchairs, election politics, and other related issues, while ignoring the \none thing that really counts: what do the citizens of this country, the \nones who are supposed to use this plan, really want? All of these \nprescription drug plans will be voluntary, and yet unless a plan is \nattractive enough to ensure the participation of close to 100 percent \nof those eligible, it probably won't work from an economic point of \nview. Those of us who were around in 1988 for the debates about \ncatastrophic health care remember with great clarity the consequences \nof passing a health-related bill that the citizens don't want.\n  Frankly, I have some doubts about whether any of the prescription \ndrug proposals to date provide what the citizens in Delaware or \nelsewhere really want. And I think I have a pretty good idea of what \npeople want in a prescription drug plan, at least people in my home \nstate of Delaware. I live in Delaware, and I commute back and forth on \nAMTRAK every day between Delaware and Washington DC. I have been a \nSenator for 30 years and people in Delaware know me well. They have no \nreluctance about walking up to me at the local diner, on the train, or \nat the drugstore, to give me a piece of their\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nminds. And here is what Delawareans want in a prescription drug bill.\n  They want something simple and easily understandable. They don't want \na plan with a lot of fine print, exclusions, complicated payment \nformulas, gaps in coverage, lengthy paragraphs filled with whereases \nand wherefores. They don't want to be in a state of constant anxiety \nbecause they really don't know what they have signed up for and what \nthey are covered for. They don't want to have to spend hours on the \nphone listening to music while waiting for an insurance company clerk \nto answer the phone and try to explain what the benefits are. They \ndon't want to spend a whole day filling out paperwork to try to get \nreimbursed for their expenses when they could just as well be playing \nwith their grandchildren. They don't want to be caught in the middle of \na fight between their drug insurance plan and their Medicare over who \nis going to pay for what.\n  They want a plan that provides meaningful and substantial financial \nhelp towards the cost of their medications. For most people I talk to, \na cut in prescription drug costs from $5000 per year down to $4700 per \nyear is not very helpful; they are still faced with choosing between \npaying for medications and paying for rent. With the increasing costs \nof prescription drugs these days, this is a criterion that is just as \nimportant to the middle class as it is to those with low incomes.\n  They want a plan that is stable, reliable, and predictable. They \ndon't want to sign up with an insurance company and then have the \ncompany pull out of the state the following year. They don't want the \nspecifics of their benefits to be changing every year. They want to \nknow what they are getting.\n  They want a guarantee that a plan will be available to them. They \ndon't want a guarantee that a plan will be available only if an \ninsurance company decides it will offer a plan or if an insurance \ncompany decides they are a good risk.\n  They want a plan that is uniform, not one whose benefits change \ndrastically if they happen to move a few miles. Delaware is a small \nstate, and people who live or work in Delaware move back and forth \nacross state lines with great frequency.\n  My prescription drug bill is focused on what consumers want, and it \nfulfills all of these requirements. People are already very familiar \nwith Medicare Part B, so the addition of a prescription drug benefit \nwill not add any confusion. People know that Medicare is stable, \nreliable, predictable, and the same all over the country. People know \nthat Medicare Part B covers a substantial 80 percent of their medical \nexpense. We know that people like Medicare Part B, since 94 percent of \nthose eligible have voluntarily signed up for it. The addition of a new \nprescription drug benefit to Part B, without any change in monthly \npremiums or deductibles, is almost certain to increase the voluntary \nparticipation rate close to 100 percent.\n  Can we afford such a bill? Absolutely. It's just a matter of \npriorities and choices. And these choices simply reflect our values. My \nvalues tell me that providing life-saving prescription drugs to the \nseniors and disabled is a higher priority than, say, making permanent a \ntax cut for the well-to-do that they probably don't need and have not \nreally requested.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate, and a large number of their \nstaff, have been working enormously hard to develop a Medicare \nprescription drug bill that satisfies everybody's concerns. However, I \nam reminded of the statement by the noted British engineer Sir Alec \nIssigonis, who commented that ``A camel is a horse designed by \ncommittee''. If the public is expecting a horse, we better not end up \nwith a camel.\n  Our current situation here in Congress brings to mind a story related \nby a local TV weatherman here in Washington, DC. This weatherman works \nin a very high tech underground office with fancy color radars, \ncomputers, split-second communications devices, and state of the art \ngraphics. Yet before each broadcast, the weatherman goes upstairs and \nlooks out the window to make sure it is not raining. I would ask my \ncolleagues, as they work through their cost estimates, economic \nprojections, and so forth in developing a prescription drug plan, to \nwalk upstairs and look out the window. Policy makers must not work in \nprotective isolation, in a vacuum; they need a strong dose of reality \nto inform their deliberations.\n  I believe that my bill provides the kind of prescription drug plan \nthat Medicare beneficiaries in Delaware, and around the country, really \nwant. I encourage my colleagues to keep the wants of their constituents \nforemost as they move to craft a vitally-needed prescription drug bill \nfor Medicare beneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Snower, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 2758. A bill entitled ``The Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAmendments Act''; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Snowe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Reed, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Clinton, Senator Murray, and Senator Edwards today in \nintroducing the new Access to High Quality Child Care Act.\n  On April 11, I introduced, S. 2117, which represented a bipartisan \npartnership with the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee to both improve the \nquality of child care and expand the availability of child care. The \nbill that we are introducing today further strengthens and improves \nthat legislation.\n  Compared to S. 2117, the new legislation we are introducing today: \nfurther strengthens the coordination among agencies and outreach about \nthe availability of child care assistance, so that the child care \nagency and TANF agency coordinate in providing information to eligible \nparents about the availability of child care assistance; includes a new \nsection to improve parent access to the process of obtaining child care \nsubsidies; strengthens accountability for the use of quality funds by \nrequiring States to set State child care quality goals, set \nquantifiable measures for each goal; and requires States to describe \ntheir progress in meeting each goal in an annual report; strengthens \nprovisions to improve the quality and availability of child care for \ninfants and toddlers, child care for disabled children, and child care \nfor children who need care during nontraditional hours; allows States \nto operate an At Home Infant Care program to improve the quality of \ncare for infants, currently successful in Montana and Minnesota; \nconsolidates the general quality setaside and the child care workforce \ndevelopment setaside under S. 2117 into one 10 percent quality setaside \nto be used by States to improve the quality of care that children \nreceive, regardless of setting; consolidates data collection under \ncurrent law to make data collection and reporting requirements easier \nfor States while retaining useful information for policymakers; deletes \nthe section on school readiness incentive grants under S. 2117, \ninstead, replacing these grants with the text of S. 2566, the Early \nCare and Education Act authorized separately under Title III of this \nnew legislation; shifts the text of the Child Care Centers in Federal \nFacilities Act and the Technical and Financial Assistance Grants Act \nunder S. 2117 to Title II of the new bill as separate authorizations; \nadds the text of the Book Stamps Act to Title II as a separate \nauthorization; and, authorizes $1 billion in FY2003 and such sums as \nnecessary in the out years 2004-2007.\n  In short, the Access to High Quality Child Care Act is about putting \n``Development'' back into the Child Care and Development Block Grant.\n  The fact is that 78 percent of school-age parents are working today; \n65 percent of parents with children under 6 are working today; and, \nover half of mothers with infants are in the workforce today.\n  That means about 14 million children, including 6 million infants and \ntoddlers, under the age of 5 are in some type of child care \narrangement. Many of them are in child care every week for many hours.\n  While their parents work, children are being cared for in a variety \nof settings. Some of them are very good, but sadly, some of them are \nnot. What we know is that 46 percent of kindergarten\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nteachers report that half or more of their students enter kindergarten \nnot ready to learn.\n  This new legislation that we are introducing today further \nstrengthens our efforts to improve the quality of care to promote \nschool readiness while expanding child care assistance to more working \npoor families.\n  We filed this legislation yesterday in the HELP Committee and will \nproceed to markup next Wednesday, July 24th. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this legislation that so many working families \nwith children need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that summary of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The 2002 Access Act--The Access to High Quality Child Care Act Brief \n                                Summary\n\n       Background: The Access to High Quality Child Care is about \n     putting ``Development'' back into the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant. About 14 million children, including \n     6 million infants and toddlers, under the age of 5 are in \n     some type of child care arrangement. Many of them are in \n     child care every week for many hours. The fact is that 78% of \n     school-age parents are working today; 65% of parents with \n     children under 6 are working today; and, over half of mothers \n     with infants are in the workforce today. While these parents \n     work, their children are being cared for in a variety of \n     settings--some of which are very good, but sadly, some of \n     them are not. What we know is that 46% of kindergarten \n     teachers report that half or more of their students enter \n     kindergarten not ready to learn. This reauthorization bill is \n     geared toward improving the quality of care to promote school \n     readiness while expanding child care assistance to more \n     working poor families.\n       Key Provisions: The Child Care and Development Block Grant \n     is designed to give parents maximum choice among child care \n     providers. The bill retains parental choice, but provides \n     states with a number of ways to help child care providers \n     improve the quality of care that they provide. The 2002 \n     Access Act will: Strengthen the coordination among agencies \n     and outreach about the availability of child care assistance; \n     Promote greater coordination among federal, state, and local \n     care and early childhood development programs, including the \n     transition from early care programs to elementary school; Set \n     aside 10% of CCDBG funds to improve the quality of child care \n     for any of the following activities--initiatives to improve \n     recruitment, education, and retention of child care staff; \n     initiatives to improve the quality and availability of care \n     for infants and toddlers, children with disabilities, or care \n     during nontraditional hours; resource and referral services; \n     training and technical assistance; grants or loans to improve \n     provider compliance with state or local law; support for \n     states to monitor compliance or other activities deemed by \n     the state to improve the quality of care, including the \n     provision of emergency child care.\n       Improve the accountability of the use of quality funds by \n     requiring states to set quality improvement goals that are \n     measurable to ensure that states are making progress in \n     improving the quality of child care. Set aside 5% of CCDBG \n     funds to help states increase the reimbursement rate for \n     child care providers to ensure that parents have real choices \n     among quality providers. Under current law, CCDBG payment \n     rates are supposed to be sufficient ``to ensure equal access \n     for eligible children to comparable child care services in \n     the state or substate area that are provided to children \n     whose parents are not eligible to receive assistance''. But, \n     current low state reimbursement rates do not offer parents \n     comparable care for their children.\n       Allow states to operate an at-home infant care program to \n     promote the quality of care for infants.\n       The children of working parents need quality child care if \n     they are to enter school ready to learn. Yet, 30 states \n     require no training in early childhood development before a \n     teacher walks into a child care classroom. 42 states require \n     no training in early childhood development before a family \n     day care provider opens its home to unrelated children. The \n     2002 Access Act will: Require states to set training \n     standards, just as they are required to do now for health and \n     safety under current law. Such training would go beyond CPR \n     and first aid to include training in the social, emotional, \n     physical, and cognitive development of children.\n       Exempt relatives from the training requirements, but \n     through the quality funding in CCDBG states could partner \n     with colleges and R to provide training to relatives and \n     informal caregivers on a voluntary basis. Initial evaluations \n     in Connecticut of such efforts show that relatives and \n     informal caregivers are voluntarily participating and are \n     feeling better about themselves and their interactions with \n     the children have improved.\n       Reduce administrative barriers and improve coordination \n     among agencies so that low income working parents can more \n     easily access the process for obtaining and retaining child \n     care assistance.\n\n\n       Separate Authorizations for Quality Child Care Initiatives\n\n       Separate authorizations include the following measures: the \n     Child Care Centers in Federal Facilities Act, the Technical \n     and Financial Assistance Grants Act, the Book Stamps Act, and \n     the Early Care & Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2759. A bill to protect the health and safety of American \nconsumers under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act from seafood \ncontaminated by certain substances; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today as Chairman of the \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee to introduce the Seafood \nSafety Enforcement Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined by the \nRepublican minority leader, Senator Trent Lott, and by Senator John \nBreaux, both distinguished members of the Commerce Committee. This Act \nwould ensure that imports of seafood into the United States are meeting \nthe same food safety standards imposed on seafood that originates from \nthe United States.\n  Shrimp and other seafood harvested and processed in the United States \nis some of the best quality seafood in the world. I know how hard the \nshrimpers in my State of South Carolina work to bring good, wholesome \nproducts to our tables. To preserve the quality of seafood, the United \nStates has established rigorous food standards to protect the health \nand well-being of American consumers. As part of that approach, we have \nbanned the use of certain harmful substances in food-producing animals \ndue to the extreme hazards they pose to human health. While these \nstandards also apply to imported foods that cross our borders, these \nprotections cannot be enforced without adequate inspection and testing.\n  Unfortunately, not all countries are applying the same rigorous \nstandards that the United States demands for our consumers. In the last \nfew months, one of the banned substances, namely the antibiotic \nchloramphenicol, was detected in shrimp and other food product imported \nfrom several countries to the United States, the European Union and \nCanada. Shockingly these substances have not been detected by the \ninspectors for the federal Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the \nagency responsible for protecting U.S. consumers from adulterated food \nimports. Rather, these substances were detected in the United States by \nindependent testing done by State authorities in Louisiana.\n  While these products are prohibited by law, FDA testing has never \ndetected such substances in food imports. We were alarmed to discover \nthat FDA currently tests only 1 to 2 percent of all food imports for \ncompliance with food safety standards. This failure to detect such \nsubstances may be due not only to inadequate frequency of testing, but \nalso may be attributed to inadequate testing methods employed by the \nFDA. While the testing protocol used in Europe and Canada can detect \nsuch substances to 0.3 parts per billion ppb, FDA until very recently \nused a technique that only measures up to 3 ppb, and now is using a \ntest that only detects to 1 ppb.\n  It is vital that we close this inspection gap at our borders and \nensure the safety of our food supply, while not placing unreasonable \nburdens on the men and women who are tasked with this huge inspection \njob. This bill would ensure that U.S. consumers are protected from \nserious health risks associated with harmful substances, while allowing \nthe continued flow of imports that are shown to be free of these \nharmful substances. It would require FDA to ensure that imports \nsuspected of containing such substances are demonstrated to meet food \nsafety standards. Such demonstration would be made by the importer or \nexporter, and subject to FDA approval.\n  Due to the health threats posed by such substances in our food \nsupply, and the national interest of having a uniform inspection and \ntesting standard, federal action is appropriate. This bill provides the \nsafety and security we seek, while not placing unreasonable burdens on \nour federal food safety inspection system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Seafood Safety Enforcement \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (1) Chloramphenicol, a potent antibiotic, can cause severe \n     toxic effects in humans, including hypo-aplastic anemia, \n     which is usually irreversible and fatal. The drug is \n     administered to humans only in life-threatening situations \n     when less toxic drugs are not effective.\n       (2) Because of these human health impacts, chloramphenicol \n     and similar drugs are not approved for use in food-producing \n     animals in the United States. However, other countries have \n     been found to use these drugs in the aquaculture of shrimp \n     and other seafood, including Thailand, Vietnam, and China.\n       (3) The majority of shrimp consumed by the United States is \n     imported. The nation imports 400,000 metric tons of shrimp \n     annually, and the percentage of shrimp imports rises each \n     year. Thailand and Vietnam are the top two exporters of \n     shrimp to the United States, and China is the fifth largest \n     exporter of shrimp to the United States.\n       (4) Upon detection of chloramphenicol in certain shipments \n     of seafood from China and other nations, in 2002 the European \n     Union and Canada severely restricted imports of shrimp and \n     other food from these nations.\n       (5) The United States Food and Drug Administration inspects \n     only 2 percent of all seafood imports into the United States \n     and utilizes a testing procedure that cannot detect the \n     presence of chloramphenicol below 1 part per billion. The \n     European Union and Canada use testing protocols that can \n     detect such substances to 0.3 parts per billion.\n       (6) While Food and Drug Administration import testing did \n     not detect chloramphenicol in shrimp imported from these \n     nations in 2002, independent testing performed by the state \n     of Louisiana detected chloramphenicol at a level of over 2 \n     parts per billion in crawfish imported from China.\n       (7) Imports of seafood from nations that utilize substances \n     banned in the United States pose potential threats to United \n     States consumers. Denial of entry to contaminated shrimp and \n     other products to the European Union and Canada will likely \n     redirect imports to the United States of contaminated \n     products turned away from these countries.\n       (8) Immediate and focused actions must be taken by the \n     Federal government to improve enforcement of food import \n     restrictions of seafood imports in order to protect United \n     States consumers and ensure safety of the food supply.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONTAMINATED SEAFOOD.\n\n       Section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 381) is amended by--\n       (1) striking all of the text in the third sentence of \n     subsection (a) after ``section 505,'' and inserting ``or (4) \n     such article is seafood that appears to bear or contain one \n     or more substances listed in section 530.41(a) of title 21, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, or (5) such article is seafood \n     originating from an exporter or country that the Secretary \n     has identified in guidance as a likely source of articles \n     subject to refusal of admission under clause (4) of this \n     sentence, then such article shall be refused admission, \n     except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and, \n     with respect to articles subject to clause (5) of this \n     sentence, except as provided in subsection (b) of this \n     section.'';\n       (2) redesignating subsections (b) through (n) as \n     subsections (c) through (o), respectively; and\n       (3) inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b)(1) Notwithstanding clause (5) of the third sentence \n     in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may permit \n     individual shipments of seafood originating in a country or \n     from an exporter listed in guidance to be admitted into the \n     United States if evidence acceptable to the Secretary is \n     presented that the seafood in that shipment does not bear or \n     contain a substance listed in section 530.41(a) of title 21, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n       ``(2) The Secretary may remove a country or exporter listed \n     in guidance under clause (5) of the third sentence of \n     subsection (a) of this section only if the country or \n     exporter has shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that \n     each substance at issue is no longer sold for use in, being \n     used in, or being used in a manner that could contaminate \n     food-producing animals in the country at issue.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 41. A joint resolution calling for Congress to consider and \nvote on a resolution for the use of force by the United States Armed \nForces against Iraq before such force is deployed; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to introduce a joint \nresolution on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself calling upon the \nCongress to consider, vote on, and enact a joint resolution authorizing \nthe use of force by the U.S. Armed Forces against Iraq before such \nforce is used.\n  This resolution takes no position as to whether the use of force \nshould be authorized or it should not be authorized, but goes to the \nessential authority of the Congress under the Constitution to declare \nwar.\n  The President's powers as Commander in Chief are reserved for an \nemergency where Congress does not have an opportunity to deliberate and \ndecide. It is obvious that concerning the current situation with Iraq, \nthere is ample time for a resolution of the issue by the Congress.\n  There have been repeated statements by the administration relating to \nmilitary action against Saddam Hussein. It is known that Saddam has \nweapons of mass destruction, such as chemicals which he used against \nthe Kurds, and there exists evidence of biological\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nweapons that he possesses. The best thinking is Saddam does not now \nhave nuclear bombs but is trying to acquire them.\n  The President of the United States, in his State of the Union speech, \nidentified Iraq, along with Iran and North Korea, as the ``axis of \nevil.'' Secretary of State Powell in congressional testimony then \ntestified that the United States was not going to go to war against \neither Iran or North Korea, raising the inference that war against Iraq \nby negative implication was a distinct possibility.\n  There have been repeated requests for regime change by the \nadministration. In lieu of the limited time, I will not enumerate them, \nalthough they are set forth in some detail in my prepared statement.\n  On February 13, 2002, I spoke on the floor calling for hearings by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and/or the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and by letters dated February 14, 2002, and March 12, 2002, \nwrote to the respective chairmen of those committees. I am glad to note \nthat Senator Biden, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has \ncalled for a September hearing on the Iraq issue.\n  The power of the Congress on the declaration of war has been eroded \nvery materially, with the President taking unilateral action in Korea, \nVietnam, Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Somalia, and Kosovo. But in a \nsituation where there is ample time for the Congress to deliberate and \ndecide, the Congress should assert its constitutional authority.\n  Among the many issues regarding the separation of powers, none is \nmore important than this basic power to declare war and the separate \npower which the President has as Commander in Chief which sometimes \nconflict, but not in the situation such as the one at hand where we \nhave time to deliberate and decide.\n  Earlier this month, I conducted some 19 town meetings across my State \nof Pennsylvania and found a great deal of citizen concern. People are \nunaware of the details and would like to know more.\n  In my February 13, 2002 floor speech, I enumerated a number of issues \nwhich are worth repeating. First, hearings would identify with greater \nprecision what Saddam has by way of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Secondly, we would get into the details as to what Saddam and Iraq \nhave done by way of thwarting the United Nations from conducting \ninspections. Earlier this year, I met with Secretary General Kofi Annan \nto get a firsthand briefing and to press the U.N. to do everything it \ncould to get those inspections.\n  Another issue which I think needs to be subjected to analysis and \nhearings and national debate is what the cost would be of toppling \nSaddam, including the cost in casualties.\n  Fourth, what will happen after a regime change? What will happen if, \nas and when Saddam goes?\n  There is also the critical issue as to what we may expect from Saddam \nby way of reprisal or by way of anticipatory action. We know that \nSaddam Hussein is ruthless. We have seen him use chemicals against his \nown people, the Kurds. We have his statement just yesterday on the 24th \nanniversary of the July revolution when Saddam came into power. It is a \nbelligerent, bellicose statement.\n  I had an opportunity to meet with Saddam Hussein in January of 1990 \nat a meeting with Senator Richard Shelby. There is no doubt in my mind, \nfrom that contact--a meeting of about an hour and a quarter--that we \nare dealing with someone who has a mindset and a determination, having \ninvaded Kuwait, having acted against the Kurds, that should give us \nevery reason to be concerned about what he may do in light of the \nadministration's repeated statements about a regime change; a concern \nif there is action by the United States against Iraq that there may be \nretaliation against Israel or others in the Mideast.\n  Consideration by the Congress also would be very helpful in \naddressing the concerns which the international community has expressed \non the unilateralism of President Bush and President Bush's \nadministration. We have had instances of that: the International \nCriminal Court, Kyoto, the U.N.-Bosnia peacekeeping force, and others \nwhich I have enumerated in greater detail in the written statement \nwhich I will include at the conclusion of these remarks.\n  If there are Members of the Senate and House who come forward and \nsupport the President--people in this body with extensive experience in \nthe field over many years, respected international reputations--I think \nthat would give credence to a position that the President may wish to \ntake and would allay some of the concerns internationally on \nunilateralism, and perhaps persuade some of our allies that this is the \nright course of conduct.\n  In considering what to do about Saddam, we have the example fresh in \nour mind of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. We have learned that 20/20 \nhindsight always being very good that we should have acted against bin \nLaden before September 11. We had ample warning and ample cause to do \nso. Bin Laden was under indictment for killing Americans in Mogadishu \nin 1993. Bin Laden was under indictment for the East Africa Embassy \nbombings in 1998. We knew he was involved in the U.S.S. Cole terrorism. \nHe had made pronouncements about a worldwide jihad. The United States \nand the United Nations made demands on the Taliban to turn over bin \nLaden, which were refused. So we had a right under international law to \nproceed against bin Laden.\n\n  There is obviously great concern about Saddam Hussein or what the \nfuture may hold if he goes unchecked. But these are all complicated \nissues. There ought to be full hearings. The American people ought to \nbe informed. We have learned from the bitter experience of Vietnam what \nhappens when there is military action where the American people are not \nsupportive and the Congress is not supportive.\n  Obviously, in a representative democracy, the matter first comes to \nthe Congress. There is the precedent of President George H.W. Bush in \n1991, when the Congress authorized a resolution for the use of force. I \nknow the Presiding Officer remembers it well, as do I. It was a \nhistoric debate, and has been so characterized by the media and other \ncommentators. President Bush, in 1990, had originally said he did not \nneed congressional authorization. Then Senator Harkin took the floor on \nJanuary 3, 1991, during a swearing-in ceremony, and procedurally the \ncourse that then followed, without going into great detail now, was \nthat we had the debate on January 10, 11, and 12 and voted 52 to 47 in \nthis body authorizing the use of force to repel Iraq from Kuwait. So \nthat precedent is with us.\n  There is no doubt that Congress is reluctant to step into the breach \nand to take a position. I urged in 1998 that the Congress authorize the \nuse of force before President Clinton moved in with the missile attacks \nagainst Iraq in December of 1998. My written statement goes into detail \nas to what I have done on this issue going back to 1983, when I \nconducted a debate with Senator Charles Percy on the question of Korea \nand Vietnam being a war, and the questioning of Justice Souter in 1990 \non whether Korea was a war. There has been a reluctance on the part of \nCongress to step forward. If we do nothing and it all works out, \neverything is fine, the Congress is happy. If the President acts \nunilaterally and is wrong, he gets the blame and we do not get the \nblame.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to step forward. We have a \nresponsibility institutionally under the Constitution to declare war, \nand we have a responsibility to acquaint the American people as to what \nis involved, and I think a responsibility to have this debate, to tell \nour European allies what our reasons are for what we may do.\n  If there is to be military action against Saddam and Iraq, there is \nno doubt it would be much stronger with a congressional resolution, \nwhich implicitly carries the support of the American people. I think \nthe hearings which I have called for and the debate on the resolution \nwill do a great deal to inform the American people and the people of \nthe world as to what we are up to, and whatever justification it is we \nhave.\n  I understand that my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, will be \na cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Repeated statements from the administration carry the strong \nsuggestion that President Bush intends to take military action to \nchange the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. There\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\nare good reasons to be concerned about Saddam Hussein's developing \nweapons of mass destruction. Iraq's exclusion of UN inspectors raises \nthe inference he has something to hide.\n  On February 13, 2002, in a Senate floor statement, I urged that the \nSenate Armed Services and/or Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold \nhearings as much as possible in public with some necessarily in closed \nsessions, to determine:\n  (1) The specifics on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction;\n  (2) Precisely what happened on the United Nations efforts to conduct \ninspections in Iraq and Iraq's refusals;\n  (3) What type of a military action would be necessary to topple \nSaddam, including estimates of U.S. casualties;\n  (4) What is anticipated in a change in regime in Iraq including \nSaddam's prospective replacement.\n  Congressional Record, S730-731, February 13, 2002.\n  On April 4, 2002, I met with United Nations Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan urging the UN to press Iraq to submit to wide-open, including \nsurprise inspections, to determine the facts on Iraq's possession and \nefforts to create weapons of mass destruction. Meetings between UN \nofficials and Iraqi representatives on May 1 and 3, 2002 produced no \nresults. Subsequent meetings between UN officials and Iraqi \nrepresentatives in early July produced no results.\n  A ranking U.S. intelligence official advised that wide-open and \nsurprise inspections in Iraq could provide reasonable assurances as to \nwhat Iraq has by way of possessing and/or developing weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Presidents have acted unilaterally in the past half century in \ninitiating military actions in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Lebanon, \nPanama, Somalia and Kosovo. In some of those situations where there was \nnot time for the Congress to deliberate and decide on a declaration of \nwar or an authorization for the use of force, it was appropriate for \nthe President to utilize his authority as Commander-in-Chief in an \nemergency. There is now ample time for the Congress to hold hearings, \ndeliberate and take whatever action Congress deems appropriate \nregarding Iraq.\n  There is a need for the American public to understand the issues \ninvolved in the use of military force against Iraq. There has been some \npublic discussion, but relatively little. Congressional hearings would \nstimulate a national dialogue on the nation's op-ed pages, radio and \ntelevision talk shows and in town halls across the country. I am glad \nto see that Senator Joseph R. Biden, Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, has announced his committee will hold hearings on Iraq in \nSeptember.\n  In 19 town meetings, which I conducted across the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania this month, I heard considerable public concern and \nconfusion over the President's intentions as to Iraq. Public support, \nreflected through the elected members of the House and Senate, is \nindispensable to successfully carry out an extensive military action. \nThe United States learned a better lesson in Vietnam that a war cannot \nbe successfully fought without public and congressional support.\n  Consideration by the Congress on these key issues would provide a \nbasis for international understanding of our position and perhaps even \nsupport in some quarters. There is a world view that President Bush too \noften acts unilaterally on critical international issues such as the \nInternational Criminal Court, the UN/Bosnia peacekeeping force, the \nKyoto Protocol, ABM Treaty withdrawal, and the Biological Weapons \nConvention. If congressional consideration was followed by the \nauthorization for the use of force supported by thoughtful and \nexperienced members of the House and Senate, the international \ncommunity might well be reassured that the U.S. military action was not \nthe decision of just one man, even though he is the President of the \nUnited States.\n  There is solid precedent for President George W. Bush to request \ncongressional authority for the use of force against Iraq, just as \nPresident George H.W. Bush did in January, 1991. On December 21, 1990, \nand as late as January 9, 1991, President Bush was quoted as saying a \ncongressional authorization was not necessary. See Weekly Compilation \nof Presidential Documents, January 14, 1991. Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 24-25. \nMany Senators, including Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Richard Lugar \nof Indiana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, \nJoseph R. Biden, Jr. of Delaware, Brock Adams of Washington and I \nsought to force debate on a resolution that would require congressional \nauthorization for the use of force against Iraq. Congressional Record, \nS 48, January 4, 1991; Congressional Record, S119-120, January 10, \n1991; see also New York Times, October 18, 1990, page A1, ``Senators \nDemand Role in Approving Any Move on Iraq;'' Washington Post, January \n4, 1991, page A19, ``Canceling Recess, Lawmakers Prepare to Debate War \nPowers.''\n  On January 3, 1991, the date that Senators who were elected and re-\nelected the previous November took the oath of office, Senator Harkin \nsuccessfully sought Senate debate and a vote on a use-of-force \nresolution. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell scheduled Senate \nfloor action for consideration of a resolution for the use of force on \nJanuary 10, 1991. Following a Senate debate which was characterized as \n``historical'' by the Washington Post, the Senate authorized the use of \nforce against Iraq by a vote of 52 to 47. Congressional Record, S1018-\n1019, January 12, 1991. Similarly, the House of Representatives passed \nsuch a resolution by a vote of 250 to 183. Congressional Record, H1139-\n1140, January 12, 1991.\n  With the repeated public commentary on the President's plans to use \nforce against Iraq, there has been public concern about what Saddam \nHussein might do in anticipation or retaliation. Saddam is well known \nfor his ruthlessness and his disdain for life by use of chemicals \nagainst his own people, the Kurds. Saddam is widely reported to have \nstockpiles of biological weapons. In a struggle for his own survival, \nwhy should we expect Saddam Hussein to refrain from using every weapon \nat his disposal against an announced attacker? A lengthy article in the \nNew York Times on July 6, 2002 concerning U.S. plans for widespread \ninoculation for smallpox carried the implicit suggestion of a concern \nfor a bioterrorism attack.\n  Consideration by Congress on a resolution for the use of force \nagainst Saddam would not impact on any potential element of surprise \nbecause there is no element of surprise left. The news media has been \nfull of notice to Saddam of potential U.S. plans such as: The New York \nTimes February 16, 2002, edition which quoted Vice President Cheney as \nsaying, ``The President is determined to press on and stop Iraq . . .  \nfrom continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction'' and intends to \nuse ``the means at our disposal--including military, diplomatic and \nintelligence to address these concerns'';\n  The Los Angeles Times on May 5, 2002, reported that the defense \nIntelligence Agency has produced an operational support study on Iraq \nincluding maps and data on geography, roads, refineries, communication \nfacilities, security organizations and military deployments;\n  The Washington Post reported on May 24, 2002, General Tommy R. \nFranks, Commander of the U.S. Central Command, has briefed the \nPresident concerning troop levels necessary to invade Iraq and oust \nSaddam Hussein;\n  The New York Times on July 5, 2002, reported on an American military \ndocument calling for air, land and sea based forces to attack Iraq and \ntopple Saddam Hussein;\n  The New York Times on July 9, 2002, quoted President Bush as saying \non Iraq: ``It's the stated policy of this government to have regime \nchange and it hasn't changed. And we'll use all tools at our disposal \nto do so.''\n  In considering a pre-emptive strike against Iraq, we should \nconsider--not that it is determinative--the consequences of not acting \nagainst al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden before September 11, 2001. We had \nreason in that situation to anticipate a terrorist attack and we had \nrights under international law to move against bin Laden and al-Qaeda \nin a pre-emptive strike before September 11, 2001.\n  Prior to September 11, Osama bin Laden was under U.S. indictment for \nkilling Americans in Mogadishu in 1993. He was further under U.S. \nindictment for the attacks against American embassies in 1998. He was \nknown to have been involved in the terrorist attack of the USS Cole. \nOsama bin Laden\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\nhad spoken repeatedly and publicly about his intention to carry out a \nworldwide Jihad against the United States.\n  When the Taliban in control in Afghanistan refused to turn over bin \nLaden to the United States after demands by the United States and the \nUnited Nations, the United States had rights under international law to \nuse military force against al-Qaeda and bin Laden.\n  With congressional hearings as a start, the American people should be \ninformed about Iraq's threat and all our efforts to deal with this \nthreat short of use of military force. We should do our utmost to \norganize an international coalition against Iraq, which President \nGeorge Bush did in 1991, specifying as much of the evidence as possible \nin public congressional hearings in order to create American and \nworldwide public support for appropriate action. Such public hearings \nwould be supplemented by classified information given to the leaders of \nthe prospective coalition.\n\n  Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provides that \n``Congress has the authority to declare war.'' Article 2 Section 2 of \nthe United States Constitution provides that the President ``shall be \ncommander in chief of the army and navy of the United States. . . .''\n  In the past half century, there has been a consistent and \nconsiderable erosion of Congress' constitutional authority to declare \nwar with a concomitant expansion of the President's powers as \nCommander-in-Chief. My concerns about the erosion of congressional \nauthority to declare war first arose in 1951 when I was called to \nactive duty in the United States Air Force after having received in \nR.O.T.C. commission as a second lieutenant upon graduation from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. I was glad to serve state-side from July \n29, 1951 to July 31, 1953 as a special agent in the Office of Special \nInvestigations, noting that President Truman had acted on his authority \nas Commander-in-Chief to order a ``police action'' without \ncongressional authorization.\n  Early in my Senate career, I participated extensively in floor debate \non the War Powers Resolution concerning U.S. military action in \nLebanon. On September 27, 1983, I questioned Senator Charles H. Percy, \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, as to whether Korea and \nVietnam were wars. Senator Percy stated that both Korea and Vietnam \nwere wars even though undeclared. Congressional Record, S. 12995, \nSeptember 27, 1983.\n  In 1983, I prepared a legal document for a declaratory judgment \naction to take to the Supreme Court of the United States on the issue \nof the constitutionality of the War Powers Act and seeking a judicial \ndetermination of the respective authority of the President as \nCommander-in-Chief and the Congress to declare war. It was my thought \nthat if the Congress and the President asked the Court to take \njurisdiction and decide this issue, the Court might do so although even \nwith such a joint request, the Supreme Court might be unwilling to be \ninvolved in the so-called ``political thicket''. The Reagan \nAdministration was unwilling to join in such a request and \ncongressional leaders were reluctant to do so although no final \ndetermination was made since the issue was rendered moot by the Reagan \nAdministration's declination. Understandably, the parties preferred to \nleave the issue ambiguous with a resolution on a case-by-case basis in \nthe political process without a finite judicial determination.\n  I pursued my inquiries by questioning Supreme Court nominees as to \nwhether Korea was a war. In confirmation hearings for Justice David \nSouter on September 14, 1990, I questioned him as to whether Korea was \na war, whether the Presidents exceeded their constitutional authority \nin military action in Korea and Vietnam and whether the War Powers Act \nwas unconstitutional in violating presidential powers as Commander-in-\nChief. Justice Souter declined to express an opinion stating, in \neffect, that there was no law to guide him in answering these \nquestions. See Hearings Before the Committee on the Judiciary, United \nStates Senate, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess., on the Nomination of David H. \nSouter to be Associate of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  In the Fall of 1990 and in early January 1991, I joined other \nsenators in successfully taking the position that the President needed \ncongressional authorization for the use of military force against Iraq \nand the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolution 678. \nCongressional Record, S. 405-490, January 10, 1991.\n  I took up this question again on September 13, 1994, taking the \nposition that the President did not have the constitutional authority \nto order an invasion of Haiti without prior congressional \nauthorization. Congressional Record, S. 12760, September 13, 1994.\n  On June 5, 1995, I introduced S. Res. 128, which stated it was the \nsense of the Senate that no U.S. military personnel should be \nintroduced into combat or potential combat situations in Bosnia without \nclearly defined objectives and sufficient resources to achieve those \nobjectives. Congressional Record, S. 7703, June 5, 1995. That \nresolution noted that there was ample time for Congress to deliberate \nand decide that matter, stating that such a decision was a matter for \nthe Congress and that there should be no further erosion of that \nauthority by the Executive Branch.\n  On November 1, 1995, noting the military action in Somalia without \ncongressional authority and the military action in Haiti without \ncongressional authority, I urge the President to follow the precedent \nof the Gulf war and seek congressional approval for incursions into \nBosnia since there was ample opportunity for Congress to consider and \ndecide the issue. Congressional Record, S. 31102, November 1, 1995.\n  On September 17, 1996, I spoke on the Senate floor on the use of \nforce with missile strikes against Iraq on September 3, 1996, noting \nthat this was another example where the President did not seek \ncongressional authorization or even consultation in advance of that \nmilitary action. Congressional Record, S. 10624-10625, September 17, \n1996.\n  When there was speculation about additional military action against \nIraq in early 1998, I spoke on the Senate floor on February 12, 1998, \nnoting that an air attack or a missile attack constituted acts of war \nwhich required congressional authority. Congressional Record, S. 791-\n792, February 12, 1998. The President then ordered missile strikes \nagainst Iraq in December 1998 without seeking congressional authority.\n  On February 23, 1999, during Senate debate on the President's use of \nforce in Kosovo, I noted my concern that air strikes constituted acts \nof war which required authorization by Congress. Congressional Record, \nS. 1771-1773, February 23, 1999. I again noted the continuing erosion \nof constitutional authority and the need for Congress to debate, \ndeliberate and decide these issues when there was ample time to do so. \nI noted the tendency on the part of Congress to sit back and avoid such \ntough decisions. If things go wrong, there is always the President to \nblame. If things go right, we have not impeded Presidential action.\n  On March 23, 1999, the Senate voted 58 to 41 to authorize air strikes \nin Kosovo after the President's request for such congressional action. \nCongressional Record, S. 3118, March 23, 1999. I voted in favor of air \nstrikes even though I had concerns about the President's reliance on \nthe ``humanitarian catastrophe'' which was a departure from recognized \nU.S. policy to use force where there was a vital U.S. national security \ninterest. The House deadlocked 213 to 213 on the same vote to authorize \nforce. Congressional Record, H. 2451-2452, April 28, 1999.\n  On May 24, 1999, I proposed an amendment to S. 1059--the Department \nof Defense Authorization bill--calling on the President to ``seek \napproval from Congress prior to the introduction of ground troops from \nthe United States Armed Forces in connection with the present \noperations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or funding for \nthat operation will not be authorized.'' Congressional Record, S. 5809-\n5811, May 25, 1999.\n  While supporting air strikes proposed by the President against the \nformer Yugloslavia, I opposed any open-ended authorization, such as \nS.J. Res. 20, which would have ``authorized [the President] to use all \nnecessary force and other means in concert with\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\nUnited States allies to accomplish the United States and North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \nSerbia and Montenegro''. I thought the broad wording of that resolution \nconstituted a blank check which was unwise. Instead, the President \nshould seek specific congressional authority after specifying the \nobjectives and the means for accomplishing those objectives.\n  There is an understandable reluctance on the part of Members of the \nHouse and Senate to challenge a President, especially a popular \nPresident, on his actions as Commander-in-Chief to protect U.S. \nnational interests. The constitutional issues on separation of powers \nand the respective authority of the Congress vis-a-vis the President \nare obviously important. Of even greater importance, however, is the \nvalue of a united front with the President backed by congressional \nauthorization and American public opinion on an issue where most, if \nnot virtually all, of the international community is in opposition.\n  If the Congress sits back and does nothing and the President is \nright, then there is public approval. If the President turns out to be \nwrong, then it is his responsibility without blame being attached to \nthe Congress. There is an added element that the President may, and \nprobably does, know more than the Congress. Hearings, in closed \nsession, could address that discrepancy in knowledge.\n  The current issue of Iraq is another chapter, albeit a very important \nchapter, in the ongoing effort to define congressional and Presidential \nauthority on the critical constitutional doctrine of separation of \npowers. In the present case, there is ample time for Congress to \ndeliberate and decide. With the stakes so high, Congress should assert \nits constitutional authority to make this critical decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7048-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4307.

The bill will be stated by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2037) to mobilize technology and science experts \n     to respond quickly to the threats posed by terrorist attacks \n     and other emergencies, by providing for the establishment of \n     a national emergency technology guard, a technology \n     reliability advisory board, and a center for evaluating \n     antiterrorism and disaster response technology within the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill which had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n  [Strike the part in black brackets and insert the part printed in \nitalic]\n\n                                S. 2037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Science and Technology \n     Emergency Mobilization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, many private-sector technology and science experts \n     provided valuable assistance to rescue and recovery efforts \n     by donating their time and expertise. However, many who \n     wished to help had significant difficulty determining how \n     they could be most useful. They were hampered by the lack of \n     any organizational structure to harness their abilities and \n     coordinate their efforts.\n       (2) A prompt and well-coordinated volunteer base of \n     technology and science expertise could help save lives, aid \n     rescue efforts, and rebuild\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\n     critical technology infrastructures in the event of a future \n     major terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency. \n     Technology and science expertise also could help minimize the \n     vulnerability of critical infrastructure to future attacks or \n     natural disasters.\n       (3) Police, fire personnel, and other local emergency \n     responders frequently could benefit from timely technological \n     assistance, and efforts to organize a system to assist in \n     locating the desired help should be expedited.\n       (4) Efforts to develop and deploy innovative new \n     technologies for use by government emergency prevention and \n     response agencies would be improved by the designation of a \n     clear contact point within the federal government for intake \n     and evaluation of technology ideas.\n       (5) The creation of compatible communications systems would \n     strengthen emergency response efforts of police, fire, and \n     other emergency response personnel to communicate effectively \n     with each other and with their counterparts from nearby \n     jurisdictions. Some programs, such as the Capital Wireless \n     Integrated Network (CapWIN), have made significant progress \n     in addressing the issue of interoperable communications \n     between emergency service providers in particular urban areas \n     and the Federal government has sought to address the issue \n     through the Public Safety Wireless Networks program. \n     Relatively few States and localities, however, have achieved \n     a sufficient level of communications interoperability.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reinforce, \n     focus, and expedite ongoing efforts to mobilize America's \n     extensive capability in technology and science in responding \n     to the threats posed by terrorist attacks, natural disasters, \n     and other major emergencies, by creating--\n       (1) a national emergency technology guard or ``NET Guard'' \n     that includes--\n       (A) rapid response teams of volunteers with technology and \n     science expertise, organized at the local level; and\n       (B) opportunities for NET Guard volunteers to assist with \n     non-emergency tasks related to local preparedness and \n     prevention, including reducing the vulnerability of \n     government information technology systems;\n       (2) a national clearinghouse for innovative civilian \n     technologies relating to emergency prevention and response; \n     and\n       (3) a pilot program to assist state efforts to achieve the \n     interoperability of communications systems used by fire, law \n     enforcement, and emergency preparedness and response \n     agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``emergency response agency'' \n     includes agencies providing any of the following services:\n       (1) Law Enforcement services.\n       (2) Fire services.\n       (3) Emergency Medical services.\n       (4) Public Safety Communications.\n       (5) Emergency Preparedness.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as America mobilizes to protect itself from \nterrorism, a key weapon in its defensive arsenal is its great \ntechnological prowess. From high-tech ``cyber attacks'' to more \nconventional threats, many of the solutions for reducing America's \nvulnerabilities at home will be rooted in technology. And much of the \ncountry's science and technology expertise resides outside the \ngovernment in the dynamic arena of private sector entrepreneurship.\n  Therefore, it is essential to ensure that America's antiterrorism \nefforts tap the tremendous science and technology talents of the \nprivate sector. To that end, the Science and Technology Emergency \nMobilization Act will help forge strong partnerships between the \ngovernment and private sector science and technology experts, in order \nto provide the best protection and response for the American people.\n  The legislation the Senate is approving today has been in the works \nsince shortly after September 11. The Subcommittee on Science and \nTechnology held a series of hearings in 2001-2002 on the best way to \nmobilize science and technology experts, drawing on first-hand accounts \nof those who sought to offer help in the aftermath of the terrorist \nattacks. The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Senator Allen, joined \nme as a cosponsor and helped to draft the bill. House Science Committee \nChairman Boehlert participated as well, making this a bipartisan and \nbicameral effort. The bill also bears the imprint of various executive \nbranch agencies: we worked very closely with the Office of Management \nand Budget, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Commerce \nDepartment's Technology Administration, FEMA, and NIST to shape the \noriginal legislation into a finely-turned and targeted bill. On May 17, \nit was approved by the Commerce Committee without dissent.\n  The legislation provides for the creation of a database of private \nsector science and technology experts whom government officials may \ncall upon in emergencies. It provides for the creation of National \nEmergency Technology Guard, NET Guard, teams of volunteers with \ntechnology and science expertise, organized in advance and available to \nbe mobilized on short notice, similar to existing urban search and \nrescue teams.\n  It also calls for the creation of a Center for Civilian Homeland \nSecurity Technology Evaluation, modeled on the existing Technical \nSupport Working Group, to serve as a single point of contact and \nclearinghouse for innovative technologies relating to emergency \nprevention and response. The center will have an online portal, so that \nthe numerous small businesses that have been struggling to negotiate \nthe maze of bureaucracy will finally have a way to get their bright \ntechnology ideas into the right hands. In addition, the legislation \nprovides for pilot projects to improve the interoperability of \ncommunications systems used by fire, law enforcement, and emergency \npreparedness and response agencies.\n  The legislation does not create a large bureaucracy, nor does it seek \nto micromanage; instead, it gives the President flexibility to decide \nwhere within the executive branch the different functions set forth in \nthe bill should be placed. This is particularly important in light of \nthe pending proposals for reorganizing the Federal Government's \nhomeland security functions. This bill is flexible enough to fit \ncomfortably within whatever structure is ultimately adopted.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Allen for his efforts on the \nbill; to the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, for his help and support as the bill was considered by the \ncommittee; and to Mitch Daniels, Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, for mobilizing his staff to work with us on the fine points \nof the legislation. I also thank all the private sector organizations \nand individuals who provided important advice throughout the process, \nand in particular those who have expressed formal support for the \nlegislation, including Intel, Microsoft, America Online, Oracle, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and the Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to thank my colleagues for \ntheir unanimous support of S. 2037, the Science and Technology \nEmergency Mobilization Act. I also thank Senator Wyden for his \nleadership and continued tenacious work on pushing this important \nmeasure through the Senate.\n  S. 2037 highlights the vital role technology and innovation play in \nour Nation's war to protect our homeland from terrorism. As this body \nhas highlighted time and time again, new technologies are being \ndeveloped every day that can help save lives and improve the ability of \nour firefighters, police, and first responders to react quickly and \neffectively to a catastrophic event.\n  As our Nation becomes more dependent upon technology in nearly every \naspect of our lives, the level of vulnerability to technological \ndisruptions rises accordingly. We all saw with the problems following \nthe attacks of September 11, the promptness and quality of the \ntechnological response to terrorist attacks or natural disasters could \nmean the difference between life and death.\n  S. 2037, the Net Guard bill, will play a major role in preventing \nmany of the problems that occurred during the attacks against New York \nand the Pentagon. September 11 taught us two things: (1) how much \ntechnological improvements are needed for State, local, and Federal \nservices, and (2) the depth of the reservoir of American goodwill to \nprovide solutions.\n  S. 2037 will call upon the ideas of the best and the brightest minds \nin the American technology workforce to act as an all-volunteer force \nto help restore communications and infrastructure operations after a \nmajor national disaster. Like all Americans, I was heartened by the \nvolunteer efforts of companies, like Verizon, Intel, IBM, Accenture, \nand Cingular Wireless, that volunteered both staff and equipment to \nrestore communications in New York and the Washington, DC area.\n  This bill will simply add structure to private sector efforts and \nencourages the participation of the Nation's science and technology \nexperts to respond to national emergencies. Additionally, this bill \ncreates a ``virtual technology reserve'' consisting of a database of \nprivate-sector expertise and equipment that can be called upon, at any \nmoment, by emergency officials during a crisis situation.\n  I believe the all-volunteer teams of science and technology personnel \nin conjunction with the virtual technology reserve that are created by \nthis legislation will help many Americans by restoring vital services \nin times of need.\n  There are many enterprises and commercial applications that can be \nadapted to meet the Government's needs, however currently there is no \ncentral location for evaluation or mechanism for recommendation within \nthe Government. I, along with other Senators, receive volumes of \ninformation from numerous companies on their different products and \nideas regarding the defense of our homeland. As public servants we want \nto be sure the Government has the necessary structure and process in \nplace to test and apply new technologies to meet our homeland security \nneeds.\n  S. 2037 establishes of a Center for Civilian Homeland Security \nTechnology Evaluation and an online, Internet portal within the \nExecutive Branch. This Center will perform the important task of \nmatching the inventions of the private sector to the needs of our \nNation's homeland defense. Additionally, the Internet portal will \nprovide individuals and companies with a single point to access the \ncenter and a single point of\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\ncontact at each federal agency participating in the Center for Civilian \nHomeland Security.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to see the Senate come together and pass \nthis important legislation and again thank my colleague from Oregon for \nhis leadership. I have truly enjoyed working with him for the \nsuccessful passage of this positive, constructive utilization of the \nadvances in technology to improve the security of Americans.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Wyden and Allen have an amendment \nat the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, the committee substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record as if read, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senators have all the time that \ncan possibly be needed to talk about these two important amendments.\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\n  There will be no rollcall votes tomorrow or Monday. As I indicated in \nthe request the Chair has granted, we will vote at 10:45 a.m. on \nTuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/18/senate-section/article/S7085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
