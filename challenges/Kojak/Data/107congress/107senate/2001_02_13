Mr. President, yesterday I was in Rome and Watertown, \nNY, to speak with members of the Rotary Clubs and chambers of commerce \nabout the upstate New York economy and how we can work together to \npromote investment and job creation in these communities. I will carry \ntheir concerns about the economy to the Budget Committee on which I am \npleased to serve and where we are fashioning the framework for the next \nFederal budget.\n  We are hearing about surplus projections and words of caution, about \nhow much faith to place in them. We are hearing about President Bush's \ntax cut plans and words of caution from colleagues who voted for big \ntax cuts in the early 1980s, cuts which helped contribute to the \nruinous deficits and high interest rates that hobbles our Nation's \ncapacity to create jobs, invest in people, and pay down our national \ndebt. The budget resolution we create sets the stage for how much we \ncan invest in health care, schools, and the other pressing needs of \nfamilies throughout our country. Later this week, I will return to the \nfloor to talk about the budget in greater detail.\n  Today I would like to discuss a topic that transcends party, \ngeography, and\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nideology. It is an issue that is important to the people in Rome and \nWatertown, Rochester and Brooklyn, and everywhere I have been in recent \nweeks. It will be foremost in my mind as the outlines of the 2002 \nbudget take shape; that is, improving access to quality, affordable \nhealth care for New Yorkers, for all Americans, and especially for our \nchildren.\n  In this session of Congress, we will need to focus on many aspects of \nhealth care, medical privacy, Medicaid funding, genetic discrimination, \nproviding prescription drug coverage for our seniors, and long-term \ncare for our families, among others. Today I will talk about the \nimportance of insuring more Americans, particularly our children, and \nprotecting the rights of those who are insured.\n  In all corners of New York, I have met countless people who have told \nme powerful stories of the cruel inequities of our health care system. \nLast August, at the Dutchess County Fair, a single mother told me how \nhard it was to keep her family afloat because her medical bills totaled \nmore than $30,000. She was worried she would become impoverished and \nforced to go on welfare.\n  In Massena, an uninsured woman suffering from cancer told me how much \ntrouble she had finding a doctor who would treat her for free. In the \nMonteFiore Children's Emergency Room in the Bronx, I saw children who \nhad come there for asthma treatments because they had no health \ncoverage and, therefore, no doctor of their own. From Buffalo to Bay \nShore, the people of New York have urged me to go to the Senate to \nfight for better health care.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember when I came to Capitol Hill 7 \nyears ago with an idea or two about how to improve health care in our \ncountry. At that time, I was privileged to work with the Acting \nPresident pro tempore's father, who served not only Rhode Island, but \nour entire country so well for so many years. We were not successful \nthen, but I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative \nprocess, the importance of bipartisan cooperation, and the wisdom of \ntaking small steps to get a big job done.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration took such steps, and with the help of \nboth Democrats and Republicans we made progress: the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nHealth Insurance Portability and Protection Act, the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the help we gave to \nyoung people leaving the foster care system under the Chafee bill--to \ngive them eligibility for Medicaid health coverage through their 21st \nbirthday, ending drive-by deliveries, mental health parity, helping to \nprevent breast cancer by waiving cost sharing for mammography services \nin the Medicare program--and providing annual screening for \nbeneficiaries age 40 and older, advances in federally funded medical \nresearch, and the human genome project.\n  Even with such progress, however, there are still 40 million \nAmericans who are uninsured. Adults with health insurance are three \ntimes more likely to receive care when they need it. People with no \nhealth insurance are 50 to 70 percent more likely to be hospitalized \nfor routine illnesses such as pneumonia. Children with no health \ninsurance are twice as likely to be hospitalized for illnesses such as \nasthma and ear infections. Americans without health insurance are 4 \ntimes more likely to seek care in emergency rooms.\n  It has only been 3 months since my election and 6 weeks since I was \nsworn in, but already I have received hundreds of letters from New \nYorkers urging me to help them, their families, and their neighbors get \nthe care and coverage they need. One such letter is from Kevin Pispisa, \na Boy Scout from Troop 207 in North Babylon, whose parents are nurses. \nKevin wrote to me:\n\n       It seems that the poor working class do not have the means \n     to receive adequate health care. Some of them cannot afford \n     to go to the doctor or pay for medication that they need.\n\n  Elsie Doetsch from Binghampton wrote to tell me about her friends who \nare dairy farmers. She is concerned about them because, as she writes \nin her letter to me:\n\n       They work every day to help put the food we eat and enjoy \n     on our tables, yet cannot afford the ``luxury'' of health \n     insurance, which I feel is a necessity for anyone in their \n     hazardous occupation.\n\n  These letters serve as an important reminder to us all as we think \nabout President Bush's tax cut plans and as we deliberate over the \nshape of our new budget. We must not forget to invest in the people we \nrepresent. We must help them find affordable quality health care. \nHealth insurance should not be a luxury; it should be a fact of life \nfor Americans everywhere.\n  Let me be specific. We should expand the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. If we change the poverty threshold to include children and \nfamilies with annual incomes up to 300 percent of the national poverty \nlevel and extend the program to parents of eligible children, we can \nprovide health care to more than 5 million parents and nearly 2 million \nmore children. Merely expanding CHIP, however, is not enough. We need \nto do more to encourage the enrollment of the 7 million children who \nare eligible for CHIP, or Medicaid.\n  I am very pleased that in New York, CHIP outreach efforts include \nradio PSAs in a number of languages, from Greek to Russian to Albanian \nto Creole to Chinese. We should provide a financial bonus to States \nthat meet CHIP enrollment targets and reduce the CHIP-enhanced matching \nrate for States that fail to do so.\n  There are other creative ideas to provide greater access to health \ncare for all Americans. As we consider them, I believe we should adhere \nto certain principles. First, we must develop policies that cover more \nuninsured Americans without encouraging businesses to drop or reduce \ntheir employees' health benefits. Second, we should make improvements \nto our health care system without setting up burdensome new Federal or \nState bureaucracies. Third, we should not penalize States such as New \nYork that have been leaders in expanding coverage. Fourth, we should \nencourage flexibility for States to expand coverage while enacting \nstrong accountability provisions so that taxpayer dollars are \neffectively invested.\n\n  As we work to expand health care coverage, we must also work to \nimprove the quality of coverage. That is why it is past time to pass a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, and I am very pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patient Protection Act of 2001.\n  President Bush recently set out his principles for a Patients' Bill \nof Rights, and this legislation meets every one of them with only one \nexception: The President wants to preempt State laws that allow people \nto seek relief in State courts when they are injured by bad HMO \ndecisions. That objection should not stand in the way of progress. I \nbelieve President Bush can transform the rhetoric of leadership into \nthe reality of accomplishment by embracing this bipartisan patient \nprotection act. Across this aisle and across our country, Democrats and \nRepublicans are joined together in support of this Patients' Bill of \nRights. Say the word, President Bush, and we can make this bill a law.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak today, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on improving the health of our Nation in the \ncontext of a budget that is balanced and prudent.\n  I would also like to take this occasion to pay special thanks to my \npredecessor, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose legacy of service \nto New York and our Nation is unparalleled and who has always been a \nsource of inspiration, not only to me and my colleagues but to people \nliterally around our world.\n  Finally, I am so grateful to the people of New York who have given me \nthis extraordinary opportunity to serve them. Over the course of the \nnext 6 years, I will work hard each and every day to listen to their \nconcerns and to fight for their futures.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1242-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1242-S1243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SENATOR CLINTON'S MAIDEN SPEECH\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to talk \nabout the proposed tax cut that is, of course, the main focus of a lot \nof our attention in the Congress since the President sent us the tax \ncut proposal this last week, and give some thoughts as to my \nperspective on it at this point. I am sure that perspective will evolve \nas we get closer to actual consideration of the bill on the Senate \nfloor. But I wanted to talk about how I see it at this point.\n  I think there are four obvious questions we need to ask about this \ntax cut proposal. First, should we have a tax cut? That may be the \neasiest question for all of us, but it is a legitimate question. \nSecond, is the President's proposal the right size of tax cut in total, \nhis $1.6 trillion proposal? Third, is it structured appropriately in \norder to accomplish what we want to accomplish for our economy? The \nfourth obvious question is, does the President's proposal constitute a \nfair distribution of the benefits from this proposed tax cut?\n  Let me take a few minutes to deal with each of these. First of all, \nshould we have a tax cut at this point in our Nation's history? To me, \nthe answer is clearly yes. We can afford to have a tax cut because we \nare now projecting substantial surpluses, whereas most of the time I \nhave served in the Senate, we have been dealing with deficits, not with \nsurpluses. But we now have a surplus and a projected surplus; \ntherefore, we can afford a tax cut.\n  Second, if we do properly structure this tax cut and do it quickly, \npass it quickly and send it to the President for signature, it could \nstimulate the economy at a time when our Nation may need a real \nstimulus, perhaps as early as this summer or early this fall.\n  Those are reasons why I believe a tax cut is appropriate.\n  The second question I posed was, was the President's proposed $1.6 \ntrillion the right size of a tax cut at this time.\n  I have some real doubts about that. And my answer has to be at this \nstage based on what I currently know and what I think all of us \ncurrently know. I think the answer has to be that it is not the right \nsize; it is too large.\n  The answer to the question has to be no. We should downsize the \nproposed tax cut before we enact anything here in the Senate.\n  Why do I say this? Let me give a few reasons.\n  First, there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty at this particular \npoint about where our economy is headed. Last Thursday I saw a report \nin the New York Times reporting that many States expect a reduction in \ntheir State sales tax receipts, indicating a slowdown in sales. Of \ncourse, the States are much more dependent upon sales tax receipts than \nthe Federal Government.\n  Many States that were awash with cash a few months ago now are \npreparing for budget cuts. They are seeing their projected surpluses at \nthe State level evaporate as they see the expected revenue coming in \nfrom these sales taxes to be reduced. At the same time, the \nadministration and the Federal Reserve Board are warning about a \nslowdown in the economy. I know Chairman Greenspan is speaking again \ntoday. I believe he testifies before the Banking Committee, and I \nimagine that he will, once again, make the point that he made to the \nBudget Committee a couple of weeks ago, which is that we have a very \nslow growth economy at this particular moment; there has been a \nsubstantial downturn in economic activity.\n  All of this adds to the uncertainty, as I see it, and gives us more \nreason to hold off on locking in a very large tax cut until we get a \nbetter sense of where we are.\n  A second reason is, when you look at the numbers and the size of the \nprojected tax cut, you have to become concerned about, if we go with \nthis large of a tax cut, whether we will have the funds necessary to \npay down the debt.\n  The remaining actions people in my State tell me they would like to \nsee us take, if we have the funds, are a prescription drug benefit and \nincreased defense spending.\n  President Bush is going to military installations this week talking \nabout how we need to put more into national defense. The question is, \nCan we afford that if we go with this very large tax cut, and increased \nfunding for education, and for a variety of needs that we have in this \ncountry?\n  I thought the best exposition I have seen and the best description of \nthe problem and the best reasoned argument against the size of the tax \ncut was in the New York Times op-ed piece that Bob Rubin, our former \nSecretary of the Treasury, wrote. I thought it was extremely \ninsightful. Let me read a paragraph.\n  He says the serious threat of the proposed tax cut to fiscal \nsoundness becomes apparent when you look at the numbers a little more \nclosely. The surplus of $5.6 trillion as projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office is roughly $2.1 trillion after deducting Social Security \nand Medicare surpluses; as many Members of Congress in both parties \nhave advocated, making realistic adjustments to better represent future \nspending on discretionary programs and tax revenues.\n  He says we have a $1.2 trillion surplus that we are talking about \nhaving available for a tax cut. He said since the proposed tax cut \nwould cost $2 trillion, or $2.2 trillion if an alternative minimum tax \nadjustment is included, it would entirely use up the remaining surplus \nwith no additional debt reduction. That leaves nothing for special \nprograms that already have broad support--such as the prescription drug \nbenefit, or greater increased defense spending for a missile defense \nsystem, or other purposes, or additional tax cuts, all of which are \nsure to happen this year, or over the next few years.\n  These spending increases and the additional tax cuts could well cost \nbetween $500 billion to $1 trillion leading to a deficit under this \nanalysis of the Congressional Budget Office projections.\n  My answer to the second question has to be that we cannot afford this \nsize tax cut.\n  The third question that I posed is what the President's proposed tax \ncut should be to accomplish what we want for our economy.\n  Again, I think the answer has to be no.\n  The reality when you look at the President's proposal is that this \ntax cut is not intended or designed or structured to provide tax relief \nto anyone in the near future. It is instead intended and designed and \nstructured to provide tax relief in the distant future.\n  The administration has argued that we need this tax cut to give the \neconomy a boost at a time when we most need it, and when our economy \nmost needs it. But the truth is, it provides absolutely no tax relief \nin 2001. It provides only $21 billion of tax relief in the year 2002.\n  The tax cut proposal we have been sent by the President is \nbackloaded. It is a much, much larger tax cut in future years--5 or 10 \nyears from now--than it is this year. In fact, there is no tax cut this \nyear as proposed by the President. In my view, the structuring of this \ntax cut as well as its size is flawed.\n  The final question that I believe needs to be asked, and undoubtedly \nwill be asked and answered many times in different ways by all of us, \nis, is the President proposing a fair distribution of the benefits of \nthe tax cut.\n  Again, my answer has to be no. The proposal the President sent us is \nheavily weighted to help those with higher incomes.\n  I was reading a magazine that arrived at our house last night--the \nU.S. News & World Report. They had a chart depicting how benefits from \nthe Bush tax plan stack up. I was just trying to analyze that chart.\n  They take a single person, with no children, with a $25,000 adjusted \ngross income and then they go up to $300,000 adjusted gross income, and \na married couple with one spouse working and two children. They go \nthrough a variety of possible taxpayer situations and try to analyze \nhow much actual tax relief will be available.\n  According to their calculation, under the Bush plan, an individual \nwho is earning $25,000 a year adjusted gross income, would get $60 in \ntax relief the first year that this is in effect. That would be 2002. \nYou get a $60 cut in your taxes.\n  If you take the person who has a $300,000 income, what about their \nsituation? They would get $25,679 in tax relief that first year.\n  You say: Well, what is wrong with that? A person with an income of\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\n$25,000 is earning one-twelfth of what the person with an income of \n$300,000 is earning. The tax cut for the person earning $25,000 would \nbe one forty-second as large as the tax cut the person earning $300,000 \nwould receive.\n  Then if you look at the figures 5 years out after their tax cut \nreally begins to substantially impact, the person earning $25,000 would \nget a $300-per-year tax cut. The person earning $300,000 would get \nnearly $10,000 in tax cuts, or 32 times as much tax of a cut as the \nperson who is earning $25,000.\n  I have tried to get some statistics also on the impact of the \nPresident's proposal in my State, to work those up and try to \nunderstand how the people whom I represent would be affected. Of \ncourse, some of it is not that clear. But if you look at the \ndemographic breakdown of the Bush tax cut as it affects the New Mexico \ntaxpayers, the inequity is fairly stark.\n  Based on the statistics that were supplied in the Wall Street Journal \nlast Thursday, while only roughly 4 percent of the Bush tax cut will be \ngoing to the bottom half of the people who file tax returns in my \nState, nearly half the benefits of the tax cut will go to fewer than 4 \npercent of the wealthiest individuals in my State.\n  On the issue of eliminating the estate tax--part of what the \nPresident has proposed is to have no estate tax in the future--in 1998, \nin New Mexico, to give a clear impression as to whom this benefits, \nthere were 166 estates that paid estate tax. If, instead of repealing \nthe estate tax, we would increase the current exemption from the \n$675,000 to $2.5 million, which is one of the proposals some of us have \nembraced, then there would be 26 of those estates that would have paid \nestate tax in my State in that year under that changed law.\n  At a time when the administration is asking charities and private \ncitizens to do more for their communities, we are eliminating one of \nthe largest tax advantages for charitable contributions by wealthy \nindividuals, if we, in fact, eliminate the estate and gift tax.\n  There is serious doubt as to whether this proposed tax cut is fair in \nits distribution of benefits, and we need to study that. We need to try \nto come up with something that is more fair, something that will \nbenefit average working families in the country. We should move quickly \nto try to enact a tax cut because that will help us economically, but \nwe should not move so quickly that we do not take the time to change \nwhat has been sent to us by the President and come up with the right \nsize tax cut, which, as I say, would be substantially less than the \n$1.6 trillion. We should take the time to be sure it is structured in a \nway that the benefit is realized this year, a significant portion of \nthe benefit, so Americans can take money home this year and see \nbenefits in their own checking accounts.\n  We should alter what the President has sent us to make it more \nequitable. We should see to it that average working families and \nindividuals get their fair share of whatever tax cut is enacted. This \ntax cut is not designed to appropriately distribute those benefits. It \nis something that will require substantial work. I hope we can do that.\n  One of the unfortunate things about our political process is that \noftentimes candidates for public office make proposals and get locked \ninto political positions long before they are elected to the office and \nin a position to actually try to work for the enactment of those \npositions. That is what has happened in this case. President Bush \nadopted his proposal for a $1.6 trillion tax cut well over a year ago \nwhen he was in the primaries running against Steve Forbes. There was a \nlot of competition within the Republican Party to see who could propose \nthe larger tax cut.\n  President Bush proposed a very large one, and he has stuck to that in \nspite of the fact that our circumstances have changed, in spite of the \nfact that the economy today is not the robust economy we had a year \nago, and in spite of the fact that there are real uncertainties about \nwhere we are going.\n  I hope we will take the time to analyze what the President sent. I \nhope we will also take the time to revise it so that we can better \nserve the people of this country by giving them a tax cut from which \nthey can benefit quickly, a tax cut that most Americans will consider \nfair. I believe that is in the best interest of the country and that is \nclearly what our constituents have sent us here to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes, after which I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Boxer be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time of the \nSenator is under the control of the Democratic leader until 11 o'clock, \nand at such time, for those who wish to use it, the time is allocated \nto the Republican leader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask--if no one is here at 11--whether \nthe Democrats could speak until the Republicans come at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until 11 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1244-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1244-S1246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ECONOMIC POLICY AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is now a great deal of debate about \neconomic policy, about tax cuts, and a range of issues surrounding \nPresident Bush's proposal for a $1.6 trillion tax cut that he sent to \nthe Congress last week.\n  I would like to speak for a bit on that subject and talk specifically \nabout what I think we are facing. I know it is running down hill to be \ntalking about tax cuts and politics. It is not exactly a tough \npolitical position to say I support tax cuts; in fact, the larger the \nbetter. But I think it is also important for us to understand what we \nneed to do to make sure we retain a strong and growing economy, one \nthat provide jobs and economic opportunities for American families. We \nhave had times in the past in this country where tax cuts have been \nproposed that are so large that we then see significant Federal \ndeficits occur, increases to the Federal debt, the slowdown in the \neconomy, and increases in interest rates that are very \ncounterproductive to the interests of American families.\n  There have been a number of things written about tax cuts recently \nthat I wanted to share with my colleagues.\n  The Wall Street Journal article dated February 8, entitled ``A Tax \nCut That Redistributes to the Rich,'' by Albert Hunt:\n       The gist of the Bush tax plan to be formally presented \n     today is analogous to a familiar baseball riddle: Which \n     brothers hold the Major League record for the most home runs? \n     Answer: Hank Aaron, who hit 755, and his brother Tommy, who \n     hit 13.\n       The wealthy are the Henry Aarons of the Bush tax plan, \n     while working-class taxpayers are the Tommys. But the \n     president packages the cut as equally generous to all.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Most appalling in the Bush plan, however, is who's left \n     out. The president talks about helping the $25,000-a-year \n     waitress with two kids, but the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities, a liberal advocacy group that conducts widely \n     respected research, reported yesterday that under the Bush \n     plan, 12 million lower- and moderate-income families, \n     supporting 24 million children, would get nothing. Over half \n     of African-American and Hispanic kids wouldn't benefit from \n     the Bush initiative.\n\n       Let me show you another piece by the Wall Street Journal, \n     written by Jackie Calmes, published yesterday:\n\n       As president Bush promotes his $1.6 trillion, 10-year \n     income-tax cuts here, back in Texas, state legislators are so \n     pinched after two tax-cut plans he won as governor that they \n     are talking of tapping a state rainy-day fund or even raising \n     taxes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``He got elected president, yet we were left holding the \n     bag here,'' state Sen. Carlos Truan said last week as the \n     Senate Finance Committee began grappling with the fiscal \n     needs.\n       Mr. Truan is a Democrat, so what was more attention-\n     grabbing was the comment of a Republican, Senate Finance \n     Committee\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n     Vice Chairman Chris Harris. ``We made tax cuts because we \n     thought we had this huge surplus,'' he said, adding, ``I \n     might have voted a little differently on all those tax cuts'' \n     had he realized just the Medicaid pressures ahead.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``It will work,'' Mr. Junell says of the budget-balancing. \n     But Mr. Coleman, watching the tax-cut bidding in Washington, \n     suggests the Texas experience ``should give people pause.''\n\n  Next, the Washington Post:\n\n       The bigger problem for middle-income Americans since the \n     Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s has been the payroll tax for \n     Social Security and Medicare, which actually eats up much \n     more of a worker's paycheck. Payroll taxes are not addressed \n     by Bush's 10-year $1.6 trillion tax cut.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Bush hasn't emphasized that the benefit from his plan ends \n     when a worker no longer owes income tax. So, because the \n     single mom making $25,000 pays only at most a few hundred \n     dollars in federal income tax, that would be the extent of \n     her tax cut. The lawyer, now at the 36 percent rate, would \n     benefit from the drop to 33 percent, and from most of the \n     other rate cuts.\n\n  You get the picture.\n  The point is this is a very interesting tax cut proposal that \nsuggests everybody is going to benefit when, in fact, not everybody is \ngoing to benefit.\n  If I might provide another chart that I read last week that also \naddresses a part of this question for the Congress, this is written by \nAlan Sloan of the Washington Post:\n\n       There are weeks when you have to wonder whether the \n     American economic attention span is longer than a sand \n     flea's. Consider last week's two big economic stories: The \n     Congressional Budget Office increased the projected 10-year \n     budget surplus by $1 trillion, and the Federal Reserve Board \n     cut short-term interest rates another half-percentage point \n     to try to keep the economy from tanking.\n       To me, the real story isn't either of these events; it's \n     their connection. The Fed is cutting rates like a doctor \n     trying to revive a cardiac patient because as recently as \n     last fall, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't foresee what \n     today's economy would be like. Meanwhile, although it's now \n     clear that even the smart, savvy, data-inhaling Greenspan \n     couldn't see four months ahead, people are treating the 10-\n     year numbers from the Congressional Budget Office as holy \n     writ.\n\n  Why is this important? Because we are now somewhere in the process of \nthe longest economic expansion in the history of this country, with an \neconomy that is weakening sufficiently so that the Federal Reserve \nBoard is very nervous and is taking quick action to try to stem this \nweakening economy. In fact, 7 months ago, Alan Greenspan felt so \nstrongly that our economy was growing too fast that he increased \ninterest rates 50 basis points. Seven months ago, he felt the American \neconomy was out of control and was growing too rapidly. ``We need to \nslow it down,'' he said. He couldn't see 7 months ahead.\n  We are told, however, that we can see 10 years ahead. President Bush \nsays let's lock in a permanent tax cut the cost of which in 10 years, \nhe says, is $1.6 trillion. But, in fact, the cost is much more than \nthat--about $2.6 trillion. Then he says despite the fact that the top 1 \npercent only pay 21 percent of the federal tax burden--the burden of \nincome taxes, payroll and other taxes--they will get 43 percent of the \ntax cut that is proposed. This President says let's have a tax cut but \nonly take one portion of the tax system and measure our burden by that. \nAnd in that circumstance he says let's provide 43 percent of my tax cut \nto the top 1 percent.\n  One final chart: This is the income tax to show what is happening \nwith this tax cut proposal. Eighty percent of the population would get \n29 percent of the benefit, and the top 1 percent would get over 40 \npercent of the benefit.\n  There are a couple of things wrong here. One, it would be very unwise \nto risk this country's economy, risk jobs and opportunity that comes \nfrom it, risk Social Security and Medicare, risk education and health \ncare investments that are needed by believing we can see 5 or 7 or 10 \nyears out, and that we ought to lock in a large tax cut, the bulk of \nwhich is going to go to the very highest income people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I thank the Senator for his presentation. Now that we are in the \nnational debate over tax cuts, and the question of projections, I heard \na statistic last week which I think the Senator might also have heard.\n  Five years ago, the economists were trying to predict what would \nhappen this year. This whole tax cut is based on our projections into \nthe future of 5 years and 10 years. Five years ago, economists--the \nsame people to whom we are turning--suggested that--I believe these \nnumbers are correct--we would face a $320 billion deficit this year; \nfive years ago, a $320 billion deficit. It is my understanding that \ninstead we have a $270 billion surplus.\n  The same economists that we are basing our projections on for 5 and \n10 years missed it by $590 billion in this year.\n  If that is the fact, when we project where we might be going with \nthis tax cut, I think the Senator makes a good point.\n  Let us be conservative. Let us be sensible. Let us be prudent to make \nsure we don't overspend any surplus in the future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The year before the last recession, 35 of the 40 leading \neconomists in this country said next year will be a year of economic \ngrowth. The point is the same point the Senator from Illinois made. We \ndon't know what is going to happen in the future. The field of \neconomics is a little psychology pumped up with a lot of helium. I say \nthat having taught economics. We don't know what is going to happen in \nthe future.\n  Alan Greenspan, who is canonized in a book, couldn't tell 7 months in \nadvance what was going to happen to this economy. So we don't know what \nis going to happen in the future, and we would be very wise to be \ncautious.\n  There is room to provide a tax cut, and we should do that. At the \nsame time, we ought to be cautious enough to understand that while we \nprovide a tax cut, and one that is fair to working families in this \ncountry, we ought not lock ourselves into a situation that could cut \noff economic growth and opportunity in the future. How would we cut it \noff? By sinking right back into the same deficit ditch we were in \nbefore.\n  What will happen if we do that? We will see higher interest rates, \neconomic growth slowing, fewer opportunities, and fewer jobs. In the \nlast 8 years, we have had over 22 million new jobs created. The 4 years \nprevious to that, when we had growing deficits, higher interest rates, \nand economic trouble all around us, we saw one of the worst periods of \njob growth in history.\n  This is a very important economic decision we are making. The debate \nabout it ought not be partisan. It is just a debate in which we have \ndifferent ideas about how to proceed. My feeling is, proceed \ncautiously. Let us provide a tax cut. Let us do it in a way that is \nfair to working families. Let us have a trigger so that in the event \nthe economy goes sour, we will not sink back into big deficits.\n  Let us also be concerned about the other things we must do. We ought \nnot dip into Social Security or Medicare trust funds. We ought to have \nenough money available to provide a prescription drug benefit through \nthe Medicare program. We ought to invest in schools that are crumbling \nand reduce classroom size. We ought to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights \nand help people who are dealing with health care needs. There are a \nseries of things we can and should do that represent a set of \npriorities that are also important to us.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question, I know in \nthe Senator's home State of North Dakota there are many areas that are \nconservative, as there are in downstate Illinois. I speak to a lot of \nbusiness groups with generally conservative people when it comes to \npolitics. I ask the Senator from North Dakota what kind of reaction he \nfinds from these same conservative businessmen when talking about the \nsurpluses and the tax cut.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The first reaction is, we ought to pay down the Federal \ndebt. That ought to be part of the original priority. If you run up the \ndebt during tough times, then you ought to pay it down during good \ntimes.\n  Second, they feel very strongly that most important is we ought to \nkeep this economic expansion going. We don't want to sink back into \nbudget deficits once again. Almost all of them would say we can't see \n2, 3, or 5 years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The time of the Senator from North \nDakota has expired.\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire if there is a unanimous consent on the \norder of speakers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent. The time from 11 \nuntil 12:30 is under the control of the Senator from Alaska or his \ndesignee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am waiting for one of our associates to \ncome. In the meantime, I want to begin some conversation and discussion \nabout the topic of the week, which the President has been working on \ncertainly, and that is strengthening our national security.\n  I suspect most people would agree that the responsibility for defense \nis perhaps the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government. It is \nthe activity that no other government at any other level can handle. It \nis the thing that, of course, all of us are very aware of. We are \nconstantly grateful for the kinds of things that have been done to \npreserve our freedom by the military over the years. For more than 200 \nyears, the military has been that arm of Government that has preserved \nour freedom. Many people have sacrificed, including the soldiers, \nsailors, and the marines, over the years.\n  So as we face the question of defense and the military, that is one \nof the things with which we are obviously most concerned. The President \nhas put this as one of his high priorities, and I think properly so. \nClearly, over the last 8 years, specifically, the military has not been \nsupported to meet the kinds of needs they have had.\n  I think it is very clear that there are at least two kinds of \nquestions to be answered as we go about funding the military. One has \nto do with improving the quality of life for military personnel. The \nother, then, has to do with the idea of examining the structure, \nexamining where we are in terms of the military and how it meets \ntoday's needs and the changing needs that obviously have happened \naround us.\n  I think the President has been very wise to commit himself to some \npayments soon to help with the quality of life for the military. I \nthink equally as important has been his request for some studies, \nbottom-up analyses, of the military prior to making any substantial \nchanges in the way the military is structured, the kinds of weapons \nthat are necessary and those things that will deal with that aspect of \nit.\n  With regard to quality of life, certainly one of the things that is \nimportant, obviously, is that the military is built around personnel, \naround the idea that you have men and women willing to serve. We now \nhave a voluntary military, of course, so that it has to be made \nsomewhat attractive for people to be interested in joining the \nmilitary, so that recruitment can be kept up. Equally as important, of \ncourse, is after the training that takes place in the military, it is \nnecessary to have the kind of arrangement where people can stay there \nonce trained, whether it be airplane mechanics, or pilots, or whatever, \nto leave the training and their training goes unused.\n  So the President has, I believe yesterday, gone down to Georgia and \ncommitted himself to some things to improve the lives of our troops--to \nraise military pay, renovate substandard housing, to improve military \ntraining, and take a look at health care, as well as some deployments \nin which we have been involved.\n  The President will announce, as I understand it, about a $5.76 \nbillion increase, which will include $1.5 billion for military pay, \nwhich is in the process and should be in the process of causing these \nfolks to be able to come a little closer to competition with the \nprivate sector; about $400 million for improving military housing; and \nalmost $4 billion to improve health care for the military.\n  I believe these things are very necessary and should happen as \nquickly as possible. I have had the occasion and honor over the last \nmonth or so to visit a couple military bases, Warren Air Force Base in \nmy home State, a missile base in Cheyenne, WY, and Quantico, VA, the \nMarine Corps base close to D.C., here, where I went through training \nfor the Marine Corps many years ago. It is an interesting place. In \nboth instances, the first priority on these bases was housing, places \nfor enlisted NCOs, officers, to live on base.\n  As to the housing in both instances, it is interesting. As different \nas these two bases were, and as far as they were apart, the problems in \nhousing were very similar. Housing that had been built back in the \nthirties was still being used. It really had gone to the extent that \nrather than being renovated or repaired, it wasn't worth that; it had \nto be destroyed and replaced. Some, of course, could be fixed up. It is \nvery difficult, particularly for enlisted with families, No. 1, find a \nplace to live, particularly at a place such as Quantico, but more \nimportantly to have it economically reasonably attractive for these \nfolks. As we move toward this, I hope the President will maintain--and \nI want to comment on this later--his commitment to doing something \nimmediately for the personnel, and then to go through this study. I \nthink there is a great deal that needs to be done in terms of how the \nmilitary is structured. It is quite different now.\n\n  Obviously, our big problem now is terrorism. There are problems \naround the world in smaller units. We are not talking about ships full \nof divisions of troops with tanks landing somewhere. We are talking \nabout something that can move quickly and is available to move and \nsustain itself without logistical support for some time. These are \nthings that I think are very important.\n  I intend to come back later this morning and talk more about this. In \nthe meantime, I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his interest in \nthe subject of national defense. As he noted, this is a week in which \nthe President is announcing several initiatives in that regard. One of \nhis primary objectives, he said, is to strengthen the military so we \ncan meet the challenges of this new century.\n  He is beginning, naturally, with the support for the troops, which is \nthe right place to begin, but he has also noted there are a lot of \nother challenges. We in the Congress who have been working with this \nover the years appreciate the warnings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe immediate past Secretary of Defense who have noted we are going to \nhave to spend a lot more on defense in order to bring our defense \ncapabilities up to the level where they need to be to deter threats \naround the world.\n  One of the threats that has received a lot of attention in recent \nweeks on which I want to focus today is the threat of an attack by an \nadversary delivering a weapon of mass destruction via missile. Of \ncourse, there are other ways of creating problems for the United \nStates. We try to deal with each of these different threats.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for example, I have worked hard to ensure we can both detect \nand deter terrorism, whether in the form of delivery of a weapon in a \nsuitcase that people like to talk about or in the case of an attack \ndirectly against an installation or U.S. assets, such as the attack on \nthe U.S.S. Cole. In all of those situations, we have plans and we have \nmade some progress in meeting that threat of terrorism.\n  Where we have been lacking is in a commitment to deal with the other \nequally ominous threat of weapons of mass destruction delivery, and \nthat is via the intercontinental ballistic missile or a medium-range \nmissile. Why would countries all over the globe that mean us no good be \nspending so much money on the development of their missile capability \nand weapons of mass destruction warheads that could be delivered by the \nmissiles? And by that, the WMD--the weapons of mass destruction--we are \nspeaking of would be biological warheads, chemical warheads, or nuclear \nwarheads. Why would\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nthey be spending so much money if they did not intend to either use \nthose missiles against us or threaten to use them?\n  Why do we focus on threats?\n  As Secretary Rumsfeld has pointed out several times recently, one of \nthe advantages of a missile over some other kinds of terrorist acts is \nthat they can threaten other countries, for example, to stay out of \ntheir way as they take aggression against another country, threatening \nthat if they bother them, if they try to intercede in what they are \ntrying to do, they will launch a missile against them.\n  An example is the Saddam Hussein situation in which he goes into \nKuwait. Had he had missiles with longer range capability and warheads \nthat could have delivered weapons of mass destruction, he could have \neasily threatened cities in Europe and made it much more difficult for \nthe United States to have put together the coalition that we eventually \nput together to stop him from further aggression and eventually repel \nhim from Kuwait.\n  It is the threat of the use of these weapons, as much as the weapons \nthemselves, that is an instrument of policy.\n  Another case that nobody likes to talk about because we do not \nconsider China as an enemy of the United States--and it is not--is the \nsituation in which, however, China would potentially, with leaders who \ndecide they have to take aggressive action against Taiwan, begin \ninitiating some form of military threat or action against that island \nand force the United States to choose whether or not to defend Taiwan.\n  One of the elements of whether we might do so is whether we would be \nsubject to attack by the Chinese if we sought to inhibit their \naggressive intentions. At least some in the military in China have \nalready made it perfectly plain that they have missiles that can reach \nthe United States and perhaps we would want to think twice before \ncoming to the aid of Taiwan.\n  Again, this is not something I project or suspect is going to happen \nanytime soon, but the fact is intercontinental or medium-range missiles \nthat can deliver weapons of mass destruction can be used to stop \ncountries such as the United States from interfering in hostile \nactions. That is one of the reasons we have to be concerned.\n  The other reason, of course, is these weapons can actually be used. \nIt is not just the threat of use but the actual use. We know from past \nexperience that countries that see no hope in their situation flail \nout, launching these kinds of missiles against their enemies in a last \ndesperate attempt to at least prove their point, if not to win the war. \nWe know there are some who have indicated they might do this again in \nthe future.\n  For example, a defeated Nazi Germany fired over 2,400 V-1 and 500 V-2 \nrockets at London, causing over 67,000 casualties, including 7,600 \ndeaths.\n  During the Yom Kippur war, Egypt launched Scud missiles at Israel.\n  The so-called ``War of the Cities'' during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war \nsaw almost 300 Scud missiles exchanged between combatants, with little \nor no anticipation that such actions would facilitate victory.\n\n  In 1986, Libya, in response to U.S. air strikes that were in \nthemselves a response to Libyan-sponsored terrorist acts, launched two \nScud missiles at a U.S. facility in Italy. That they landed harmlessly \nin the Mediterranean Sea does not diminish the significance of the \nevent in the context of the use of hostile regimes.\n  While we try to deter countries from launching these kinds of \nmissiles, we know that sometimes deterrence fails and these missiles \nwill be launched. In that case, there is only one thing that is \nsensible, which is to try to have some kind of defense in place to \nprotect our citizens or our troops deployed abroad or our allies.\n  The sad truth is, unfortunately, the United States today cannot \ndefend itself from a hostile missile attack. In fact, we have a very \nhard time defending against even the kinds of missiles launched a \ndecade ago in the Persian Gulf war. Remember the single largest number \nof casualties in that war: 28 American soldiers died because of a Scud \nmissile attack at our base in Saudi Arabia that we could not stop. Yet \nin the interim, between that event and today, we have made precious \nlittle progress in fielding a system which can defend against that kind \nof threat.\n  I just returned from a trip the weekend before last to Munich, \nGermany, the so-called Veracunda, a conference of primarily NATO \ndefense ministers, the Secretary General of NATO, as well as \nrepresentatives of the U.S. Senate and other parliamentarians--\nprimarily of the NATO countries--to talk about the future of NATO and \nthe United States-allies cooperation, among other things, in the \ndevelopment of ballistic missile defenses. The U.S. delegation was led \nby my colleagues John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. All of us, including \nSecretary Rumsfeld who was in attendance, made the point to our allies \nthat the United States had no option but to move forward with missile \ndefense, that our interests were threatened around the world, and that \nwe would have to move forward, but that we wanted to consult with our \nallies so, first of all, they would understand what we are doing, why \nwe are doing it, and perhaps they would have some participation in how \nit would evolve, at least as to how it impacts them.\n  We wanted to make what we did applicable to them as well, to provide \nprotection to them if they wanted it. From a previous position of some \nhostility to the idea, because of their concerns about what Russia and \nChina might do, I believe our allies are moving more to an acceptance \nof the fact that we are going to proceed and a willingness to confer \nwith us on how that system evolves, even in some cases to talk to us \nabout how we might integrate it with their own defense to provide \nprotection to them as well.\n\n  I believe that momentum, in other words, for acceptance of our \nmissile defense system from our allies has definitely picked up. It is \nimportant that the Senate and House support the President in his \ndetermination to move forward with our missile defense. In this regard, \nit will be very important for the administration to move very quickly \nto make it clear that the momentum has not slowed, that we do intend to \nmove forward, and we are not going to let another season go by without \nbeginning the deployment of assets that we can deploy.\n  There are very promising technologies. I will be taking the floor at \nlater times to talk about how these might evolve. I start with the sea-\nbased systems. It was clear that the Clinton administration wanted to \nhave only one system. That system, built in Alaska, would have been \nvery vulnerable. The radar that would have been constructed at Chiniak \nIsland could be useful to us with respect to future systems that we \ndeploy.\n  I think it would be a mistake to assume that is the be all and end \nall of our national missile defense system. Much more productive would \nbe the use of existing assets, the standard missiles we have aboard \nAegis cruisers and use the radars we would have constructed at Chiniak \nIsland and the onboard radars, to take literally anywhere in the world \nto provide defense in theater, both against threats that are medium-\nrange threats today and in the not-too-distant future, to be able to \nactually provide some strategic defense to protect the United States, \nor most of it.\n  As I say, this technology is probably the most advanced but it will \nbe up to the Congress to add money to the defense budget and up to the \nadministration to do the planning to integrate that funding into the \ntesting program, the development program, and the fairly early \ndeployment of that limited kind of missile defense program.\n  At the same time, we should be pursuing the existing plans with \nrespect to land-based systems because I suspect that at the end of the \nday we are going to want to have layered systems where we have sea-\nbased components and land-based components and the radars that \nfacilitate the effectiveness of each. These will be details of plans \nemerging through the administration review, recommendations of the \nDepartment of Defense, and the funding that will be required to come \nfrom the Congress. Again, I will get into more detail on that later.\n  The point I make this morning is we are beginning the conversations \nwith our allies that should have taken place years ago. This \nadministration is committed to that. I am convinced, because of the \nfine statement that Secretary Rumsfeld made at the Munich\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nconference, that our allies are now going to be willing to work with us \nand will be supportive of us at the end of the day. It will be up to us \nto follow through with the support that only the Congress can provide.\n  Let me conclude by going back to the point with which I started. \nThere are basically two reasons to have defense. The first is to deter \naction by would-be aggressors, and you deter not only the use of \nmissiles but also the threat of their use, because the threat of their \nuse is frequently the foreign policy tool of these rogue nations, to \nkeep you out of their way while they engage in their nefarious \nactivities. So you deter the threat and you also deter the actual use.\n  But the second reason is in the event deterrence fails to actually \ndefend yourself--in some cases we know that, especially with regard to \nthese rogue nations which can have very irrational leaders, deterrence \ndoes not work--and the missiles do get launched. If you don't have a \nway of defending yourself, you will suffer extraordinarily large \ncasualties.\n\n  It would be immoral for leaders of the United States today --and this \nis a point Secretary Rumsfeld made over and over--it would be immoral \nfor the President, for the Secretary of Defense, and those in the \nCongress not to do everything we can to facilitate the deployment of \nthese defenses on our watch.\n  If American citizens are killed because we failed in that duty, we \nhave no one to blame but ourselves because the technology is at hand, \nwe have the financial capability of doing it, there is no longer any \nquestion about the threat, and we can work with our allies. All that is \nleft is the will to move forward to do this.\n  The final point I wish to make is this: There are those who say we \nalready have a deterrence; it is our nuclear deterrence; and no one \nwould dare mess with the United States because of that.\n  There are two problems with that. The first is that we need an option \nto annihilating millions of people on the globe. If our only reaction \nto an attack against us is to respond in kind--in fact, more than in \nkind--and annihilate, incinerate, literally, millions of people, most \nof whom are totally innocent and are simply in a country led by some \nkind of irrational rogue dictator--if that is our only response, it is \nan immoral response when we have an alternative, and that is a defense \nthat can protect the United States and deter that aggression in the \nfirst place.\n  Secondly, it is much more effective to have this additional response, \nbecause at the end of the day there gets to be a point where people \nwonder whether that nuclear deterrent is even credible. It is certainly \ncredible against a massive nuclear attack against the United States, \nbut is it credible against a limited attack by some irrational \ndictator, against the United States or our allies, that we would, then, \nin turn, annihilate all of the citizens of his country? That is \nsomething we have never been able to answer and we don't want to answer \nbecause we want to leave out there the notion that we might respond \nwith that kind of nuclear deterrent, but it becomes less and less \nlikely as time goes on.\n  That is why we need this alternative--another option, a moral option, \nthe option of defense--not just the option of massive nuclear \nretaliation.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to address the Senate \ntoday on the threat to the United States from the proliferation of \nballistic missile technology and the debate on deployment of a national \nmissile defense system.\n  I recently had the pleasure, Mr. President, of attending the annual \nConference on Security Policy in Munich, Germany. This conference, for \nthose unfamiliar with it, is a gathering of U.S., European and Asian \nforeign and defense ministers, miscellaneous civilian defense experts, \nand prominent members of the media. Senators McCain and Lieberman led \nthe U.S. delegation. Of particular note, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld \nutilized the conference to make his first major address in his capacity \nas head of the nation's military establishment. The main topic of \nSecretary Rumsfeld's address, not surprisingly, was the Bush \nAdministration's intention to proceed with deployment of a National \nMissile Defense system, in consultation with our NATO allies.\n  The Munich Conference, as has been evident in the plethora of news \nstories that have appeared since, illustrated the scale of opposition \namong our allies as well as among countries like Russia and China. \nFears of precipitating an arms race with Russia and China while driving \nan irreparable wedge between the United States and Europe were \npalpable. They were, however, equally misplaced.\n  Few issues within the realm of national security affairs have been as \ndivisive and prone to alarmist hyperbole than the development of \nballistic missile defenses. It really is, in a sense, almost \nsurrealistic to contemplate a country that will spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars per year on national defense while conceding to its \nadversaries the freedom to destroy our cities if only they develop \nlong-range ballistic missiles. And in anticipating the usual rejoinder \nthat our military superiority will surely deter such adversaries from \nlaunching nuclear-armed missiles in our direction, let us focus a \nminute to two on the history of warfare in the missile age. It really \nis quite illuminating.\n  Deterrence, Mr. President, is a concept. An adversary or potential \nadversary will refrain from taking an action or actions detrimental to \nour national interest if it fears a debilitating retaliatory attack. \nThe history of man, however, is the history of war, and the history of \nwar is the history of deterrence--and diplomacy--failing. A nation at \nwar will rarely refrain from employing those means at its disposal, \nespecially when regime survival is at stake. Moreover, and of \nparticular relevance to discussions of missile defenses, is the \ntendency of defeated regimes to strike out irrationally. A defeated \nNazi German fired over 2,400 V-1 and 500 V-2 rockets at London, causing \nover 67,000 casualties, including 7,600 deaths. During the 1973 Yom \nKippur War, Egypt launched Scud missiles at Israel. The so-called ``War \nof the Cities'' during the eight-year Iran-Iraq War saw almost 300 Scud \nmissiles exchanged between combatants with little or no anticipation \nthat such actions would facilitate victory. In April 1986, Libya, in \nresponse to U.S. air strikes that were in themselves a response to \nLibyan-sponsored terrorist acts, launched two Scud missiles at a U.S. \nfacility in Italy. That they landed harmlessly in the Mediterranean \ndoes not diminish the significance of the event in the context of the \nuse of missiles by hostile regimes.\n  While deterrence should remain a fundamental tenet of our national \nsecurity strategy, it is not enough. Clearly, we cannot assume, nor \nbase the security of our population, on our own estimations of the \ncalculations occurring in the minds of hostile dictators, especially \nduring periods of heightened tensions. The historical record should be \nsufficient to convince all of us that missile proliferation is a \nserious problem--certainly, on that, we all agree--and that those \nmissiles can and may be used, either in the throes of defeat or as the \nresult of a failed attempt to deter the United States from acting in \ndefense of our vital national interests in regions like the Middle and \nFar East. The recent publication of the book ``Saddam's Bombmaker,'' \nwritten by the former chief engineer of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, \nincludes a passage suggesting, based upon the author's personal \nobservations of Saddam Hussein, that the Iraqi dictator fully intends \nto launch nuclear-armed missiles against Israel in the event he becomes \nconvinced that his personal demise is inevitable. Should he attain the \ncapability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile, I think it \nis no stretch of the imagination to add the United States to that list.\n\n  The case of Iran is equally worrisome. Last Fall, we undertook a \nrather impromptu debate on the nature of Russian-Iranian relations when \nthe New York Times ran a series of articles detailing possible \nviolations of the Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act and the subsequent \n1996 amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, which sought clearly to \nsanction foreign entities determined to be transferring destabilizing \nmilitary equipment and technology to Iran and Iraq. The debate that \nemerged focused, of course, given\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\nthe text of the law, on conventional arms transfers from Russia to \nIran. Something of a given, as far as the Clinton administration's \nposture was concerned, with that the Russian-Iranian military \nrelationship had been largely contained courtesy of the former vice \npresident's diplomatic skills.\n  Putting aside the subsequent abrogation of the secret Gore-\nChernomyrdin Pact and the emergence of a more open and vibrant \nconventional arms trade between Russia and Iran, the issue of missile \nand nuclear-technology transfers was clearly presumed to be under \ncontrol. But all available information points to the contrary. More \ndisturbing, the relationship is unquestionably at the government-to-\ngovernment level. The Clinton administration's arguments that \nindividual Russian entities were circumventing good-faith Russian \nefforts at stemming the flow of nuclear and missile technology to Iran, \nthe basis of its veto of the Iran Nonproliferation Act, were wholly \nwithout merit. In defense of this relationship, Russia's most prominent \ndefense analyst, Pavel Felgenhauer, was recently quoted as stating, \n``We are brothers-in-arms, and have long-term interests together.'' And \nDefense Minister Sergeyev's December 2000 visit to Iran to conclude the \nnew arms agreement was trumpeted by Sergeyev as ushering in a ``new \nphase of military and technical cooperation.''\n  A recent CIA report act on foreign assistance to Iran's weapons of \nmass destruction, missile and advanced conventional weapons programs, \nsubmitted pursuant to the requirements of the fiscal year 2001 \nintelligence authorization act, includes the following:\n\n       Cooperation between Iran's ballistic missile program and \n     Russian aerospace entities has been a matter of increasing \n     proliferation concern through the second half of the 1900s. \n     Iran continues to acquire Russian technology which could \n     significantly accelerate the pace of Iran's ballistic missile \n     development program. Assistance by Russian entities has \n     helped Iran save years in its development of the Shahab-3, a \n     1,300-kilometer-range MRBM * * * Russian assistance is \n     playing a crucial role in Iran's ability to develop more \n     sophisticated and longer-range missiles. Russian entities \n     have helped the Iranian missile effort in areas ranging from \n     training, to testing, to components. Similarly, Iran's \n     missile program has acquired a broad range of assistance from \n     an array of Russian entities of many sizes and many areas of \n     specialization.\n\n  Similarly, the Department of Defense's January 2001 report, \nProliferation: Threat and Response, states with respect to Russian-Iran \nnuclear cooperation, that\n\n       Although [the Iranian nuclear complex] Bushehr [which is \n     receiving substantial Russian assistance] will fall under \n     IAEA safeguards, Iran is using this project to seek access to \n     more sensitive nuclear technologies from Russia and to \n     develop expertise in related nuclear technologies. Any such \n     projects will help Iran augment its nuclear technology \n     infrastructure, which in turn would be useful in supporting \n     nuclear weapons research and development.\n\n  Finally, and not to belabor the point, the Director of Central \nIntelligence George Tenet recently testified before the Intelligence \nCommittee that Russian entities ``last year continued to supply a \nvariety of ballistic missile-related goods and technical know-how to \ncountries such as Iran, India, China, and Libya.'' Indeed, Director \nTenet emphasized this point several times in his testimony, stating, \n``the transfer of ballistic missile technology from Russia to Iran was \nsubstantial last year, and in our judgment will continue to accelerate \nIranian efforts to develop new missiles and to become self-sufficient \nin production.''\n  The significance of this relationship is considerable. Opponents of \nmissile defenses have argued both during and after the cold war that \nthe dynamics of warning and response have changed; that we will have \nsufficient strategic warning of serious threats to our national \nsecurity to take the necessary measures in response. The entire basis \nof the Rumsfeld Commission report, and of much of DCI Tenet's \ntestimony, on the threat from foreign missile programs, however, is \nthat strategic--and, indeed, tactical--warning can be severely \ndiminished in the event suspect countries succeed in attaining large-\nscale technical assistance or complete ballistic missiles, which Saudi \nArabia accomplished by its purchase of Chinese CSS-2 medium-range \nballistic missiles and Pakistan did in the case of the Chinese M-11 \nmissile transfer. That is clearly the case with Iran.\n  The impact on U.S. national security policy of the proliferation of \nballistic and cruise missile technology, as well as of so-called \nweapons of mass destruction, should not be underestimated. Presidents \nof either party and their military commanders will undergo a \nfundamental transformation in their approach to foreign policy \ncommitments and the requirement to project military power in defense of \nour allies and vital interests if they possess the knowledge that \nAmerican forces and cities are vulnerable to missile strikes. We have \npondered the scenario wherein our response to an invasion of Kuwait by \na nuclear-armed Iraq would have been met with the response the 1990 \ninvasion precipitated. Similarly, the oft-cited threat against the \nUnited States by Chinese officials in the event we come to the defense \nof Taiwan should be cause for sober reflection--although the commitment \nto Taiwan's security should be equally absolute. The point, Mr. \nPresident, is that the development or acquisition by rogue regimes of \nlong-range ballistic missiles will alter our response to crises in an \nadverse manner. Secretary Rumsfeld summed up the situation well in his \nspeech in Munich when he stated, ``Terror weapons don't need to be \nfired. They just need to be in the hands of people who would threaten \ntheir use.''\n  The need for continued development and deployment of systems to \ndefend against ballistic missile attack is real. We lost eight precious \nyears during which the previous administration stood steadfast in \nopposition to its most fundamental requirement to provide for the \ncommon defense. No where in the Constitution is there a qualification \nfrom that responsibility for certain types of threats to the American \npopulation, and I doubt one would have been contemplated. The Founding \nFathers were unlikely, I believe, to have supported a policy wherein \nthe United States would defend itself against most threats, but \ndeliberately leave itself vulnerable to the most dangerous.\n\n  We can research missile defenses in perpetuity and not attain the \nlevel of perfection some demand. We can, however, deploy viable systems \nto the field intent on improving them over time as new technologies are \ndeveloped. We do it with ships, tanks, and fighter aircraft. The value \nof having fielded systems both as testbeds and for that measure of \nprotection they will provide, while incorporating improvements as they \nemerge, is the only path available to us if we are serious about \ndefending our cities against ballistic missile attack.\n  Yes, I know that a multibillion dollar missile defense system will \nnot protect against the suitcase bomb smuggled in via cargo ship. But \nlet us not pretend that we are not talking actions to defend against \nthat contingency as well. Arguments that posit one threat against \nanother in that manner are entirely specious. As I've noted, the \nhistory of the missile age is not of static displays developed at great \nexpense for the purpose of idol worship. It is of weaponry intended to \ndeter other countries from acting, and to be used when militarily \nnecessary or psychologically expedient. We can't wish them away, and \nthe fact of proliferation is indisputable. The deployment of a National \nMissile Defense system is the most important step we can take to \nprotect the people we are here to represent. They expect nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1249-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1249-S1252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was hoping Thursday afternoon to be on \nthe floor with Senator Byrd as he spoke about some issues dealing with \nthe Defense Department. I ask my fellow Senators and staff of the \nSenators who are interested in defense matters to read Senator Byrd's \nspeech on page 1236 of the Congressional Record of February 8. I will \ncomment, not as comprehensively as he did, about some of the problems \nat the Department of Defense. I will read one paragraph from his \nspeech. It is related to a lot of work that I have been doing in the \nSenate for quite a few years on the lack of accountability in cost \nmanagement and inventory management and just generally the condition of \nthe books in the Defense Department, which is also the basis for my \nremarks today.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n  I quote from Senator Byrd's speech: So here's the question I have. If \nthe Department of Defense does not know what it has in terms of assets \nand liabilities, how on Earth can it know what it needs?\n  We are in the position where the new President of the United States \nis making a judgment of how much money he should suggest over the next \nfew years to increase defense expenditures.\n  The President this week is highlighting that. I think the President \nneeds to be complimented. He has put off for a while until the new \nSecretary of Defense can do a study of Defense Department needs and \nmissions before making the specific judgment of how much money should \nbe spent.\n  This is somewhat different than what President Reagan did in 1981 \nwhen the judgment was that just spending more money on defense \nautomatically brings you more and a better defense. Obviously, at that \ntime more money needed to be spent, but exactly how much needed to be \nspent was not so clear. A lot more money was appropriated, creating a \nsituation where an Assistant Secretary of Defense at that particular \ntime said there was so much money allocated that we piled the moneybags \non the steps of the Pentagon and said to them: Defense contractors, \ncome and get it.\n  I think we look back and know some of that money probably was not \nwisely spent, although we do give credit to President Reagan for \nspending more, and in a sense challenging the Soviets in a way so they \nhad to call a halt to the cold war. That saved the taxpayers a lot of \nmoney in the long term. Now we have a President who has time to think \nabout what should be done and is giving it the proper consideration.\n\n  So I want to start out by complimenting President Bush for his \napproach to ramping up defense expenditures at a time in our history \nwhen there is a general consensus among both political parties that \nmore ought to be spent. Since we are going to spend more, it ought to \nbe spent very wisely. President Bush deserves the thanks of the \nAmerican taxpayers for being very careful.\n  He has stated there is a need for an immediate increase in pay and \nhousing for military people to enhance their morale and keep dedicated \npeople who are already trained, give them a financial incentive for \nstaying in instead of getting out and going into the private sector--he \nis moving ahead on those few things. But on the larger question of \nincreasing expenditures, particularly for enhanced weaponry and new \nweapons, he is waiting until there is a study completed. I thank him \nfor doing that.\n  Regardless, as Senator Byrd said, we ought to have a set of books, an \naccounting system, at the Defense Department that is not only such that \nwe know what the situation is, how much we have in inventory, how much \nis actually being paid for a weapons system, but when we have a bill to \npay, we ought to know what we got for that bill. What goods and \nservices were received? The point is, we do not now have that \ninformation. That was the point of Senator Byrd's question. It is the \npoint of my question today. But my questioning is on ongoing points I \nhave been raising with the Defense Department now for a period of \nprobably 4 or 5 years or longer.\n  I am truly honored to have an opportunity to speak on the very same \nsubject that Senator Byrd spoke on last Thursday. I am hoping the \nSenator from West Virginia and this Senator from Iowa can team up this \nyear in a search for a solution. As many of my colleagues know, I have \nbeen wrestling with this problem for a number of years, and, candidly, \nwithout a whole lot of success in getting the Defense Department to \nchange their bad accounting, and not having a basis, then, on which to \nask for further increases into the future. I have come here to the \nfloor of the Senate and spoken about this many times. I have raised \nthese same concerns during hearings before the Budget Committee.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight, I have investigated this problem and held hearings on it. I \nhave offered legislation on it and some of that legislation has been \nincorporated, thanks to Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the ranking \npeople on the Appropriations Committee, in various Department of \nDefense appropriations bills.\n  The General Accounting Office and the Pentagon's inspector general \nhave issued report after report after report exposing these same \nproblems. In fact, their investigative work has been the basis for some \nof my remarks in the past.\n  So here we have, again, last week, this issue being raised by the \nSenator from West Virginia. I am glad to have somebody of Senator \nByrd's stature asking pertinent questions because then people pay \nattention. People listen up. That also applies to my listening and \nreading what the Senator from West Virginia had to say last week.\n  Senator Byrd started his inquiry maybe months and years ago, for all \nI know, but it came to my attention when he was participating in a \nhearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 11, the \nhearing on the nomination of Mr. Rumsfeld for Secretary of Defense. My \ngut sense tells me Senator Byrd's question sent shock waves through the \nPentagon. When I read about it in the newspaper the next day, I asked \nmy staff to get the transcript and fax it to me because I was home in \nmy State of Iowa. I studied the exchange between Senator Byrd and \nSecretary designate Rumsfeld very carefully. What I heard was music to \nmy ears.\n\n  In a nutshell, Senator Byrd was talking about the Pentagon's \ncontinuing inability to earn a clean opinion under the Chief Financial \nOfficer's Act audit. That act was passed in 1990. So we have been down \nthis road, now, for 10 years. I hope in most departments of Government \nwe have accomplished something. It does not seem as if we have in the \ncase of the Pentagon.\n  Under the Chief Financial Officer's Act, the Pentagon must prepare \nfinancial statements each year. Those are then subjected to an \nindependent audit by the General Accounting Office and the Inspector \nGeneral. Senator Byrd, on January 11, questioned Mr. Rumsfeld about the \nresults of the latest Chief Financial Officer's audit by the inspector \ngeneral. Senator Byrd stated at that time, and I quote from the \ntranscripts:\n\n       DOD has yet to receive a clean audit opinion in its \n     financial statements.\n\n  Senator Byrd went on to quote from a recent article in the Los \nAngeles Times about the Pentagon accounting mess. Again, I quote from \nthe transcript of a statement of Senator Byrd:\n\n       The Pentagon's books are in such utter disarray that no one \n     knows what America's military actually owns or spends.\n\n  As Senator Byrd knows, this quote contains a very powerful message. \nThis is the message that I glean from that quote: The Pentagon does not \nknow how much it spends. It does not know if it gets what it orders in \ngoods and services. And the Pentagon, additionally, does not have a \nhandle on its inventory. If the Pentagon does not know what it owns and \nspends, then how does the Pentagon know if it needs more money? We, as \nSenators, presume already that the Pentagon needs more money--because \nthere is kind of a bipartisan agreement to that, and President Bush won \nan election with that as one of his key points. We need to know more, \nand a sound accounting system is the basis for that judgment.\n  Of course, that is the logic that was the foundation of Senator \nByrd's next question to Mr. Rumsfeld. I will quote again from January \n11:\n\n       I seriously question an increase in the Pentagon's budget \n     in the face of the department's recent [inspector general] \n     report. How can we seriously consider a $50 billion increase \n     in the Defense Department budget when the [Department of \n     Defense's] own auditors--when DOD's own auditors--say the \n     department cannot account for $2.3 trillion in transactions \n     in 1 year alone.\n\n  I agree with Senator Byrd's logic 100 percent. Ramping up the \nPentagon budget when the books are a mess is highly questionable at \nbest. To some it might seem crazy. And, of course, as I said about \nPresident Bush, and I compliment him for it, he appears to be reacting \ncautiously to pressure to pump up the defense budget, at least to do it \nnow. He will do it in his own deliberate way, and hopefully with the \nadequate information to make a wise decision of how much the increase \nshould be.\n  I am encouraged by front-page stories in the New York Times on \nJanuary 31, 2001, and again on February 5. These reports clearly \nindicate there would be no decision on increases:\n\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\n\n       . . . until the Pentagon has completed a top-to-bottom \n     review of its long-term needs.\n\n  I think this was reiterated by the President yesterday in his message \nto our men and women in uniform when he was down at Fort Stewart. So \nthis sounds good to me. I only hope the review the President is asking \nfor includes a searching examination on the need to clean up the \naccounting books.\n  This brings me to the bottom line, Senator Byrd's very last question \non January 11:\n\n       What do you plan to do about this, Mr. Rumsfeld?\n\n  This is where the rubber meets the road. What do we do? What does the \nSecretary of Defense do, because he is in the driver's seat on this, to \nclean up the books? As I said a moment ago, I have been working on this \nproblem for a long time and I am not happy with the Pentagon's response \ntoday, even though I am happy with the response of people such as \nSenator Stevens and Senator Byrd to help us get some language in \nappropriations bills to bring some changes in this behavior.\n  I think the Pentagon has a negative attitude about fixing the \nproblem.\n  The bureaucrats in the Pentagon say that this is the way it has \nalways been. And it ain't going to change--at least not in our \nlifetime. It's just too hard to do.\n  The former CFO at the Pentagon, Mr. John Hamre, compared it to trying \nto change a tire on a car that was going 100 miles per hour.\n  Well, I just can't buy that. That is not acceptable to me.\n  This reminds me of the football team that loses one game after \nanother. If I were the coach, I might say: Hey, it's time to go back to \nbasics--like blocking and tackling drills every day.\n  I think the Pentagon needs to do the same thing--go back to basics--\nlike accounting 101.\n  I will be the first to admit that I lack a full and complete \nunderstanding of the true magnitude of this problem.\n  Bookkeeping is a complicated and arcane field. And it's very boring. \nSo it does not command much attention around here.\n  But over the years, I have learned one important lesson about \ngovernment bookkeeping. Bookkeeping is the key to controlling the \nmoney, and making sure that the taxpayers money is well spent.\n  Bookkeeping is the key to CFO compliance.\n  If the books of account are accurate and complete, it's easy to \nfollow the money trail. That makes it hard to steal the money.\n  By contrast, if bookkeeping is sloppy--as at the Pentagon today, then \nthere is no money trail. That means financial accounts are vulnerable \nto theft and abuse.\n  And that is exactly where the IG and GAO say that the Pentagon is \ntoday.\n  Every one of their reports shows that bureaucrats at the Pentagon \nfail to perform routine bookkeeping functions day in and day out.\n  The IG and GAO reports show that financial transactions are not \nrecorded in the Pentagon's books of account as they occur--promptly and \naccurately.\n  They show that some payments are deliberately posted to the wrong \naccounts. Sometimes transactions are not recorded in the books for \nmonths or even years and sometimes never.\n  They show that the Pentagon regularly makes underpayments, \noverpayments, duplicate payments, erroneous payments, and even \nfraudulent payments. And most of the time, there is no follow up effort \nto correct the mistakes.\n  These reports show that DOD has no effective capability for tracking \nthe quantity, value, and locations of assets and inventory.\n  Double-entry bookkeeping is needed for that, but double-entry \nbookkeeping is a non-starter at the Pentagon. It doesn't exist.\n  In sum, Mr. President, these reports show that DOD has lost control \nof the money at the transaction level.\n  With no control at the transaction level, it is physically impossible \nto roll up all the numbers into a top-line financial statement that can \nstand up to scrutiny and, most importantly, audit.\n  Sloppy accounting generates billions of dollars in unreconciled \nmismatches between accounting, inventory, and disbursing records.\n  Bureaucrats at the Pentagon regularly try to close the gap with \n``plug'' figures, but the IG is not fooled by that trick.\n  Billions and billions of dollars of unreconciled mismatches make it \nimpossible to audit the books.\n  As a result, each year the Pentagon gets a failing grade on its \nannual financial statements required by law. Each year, the IG issues a \n``disclaimer of opinion'' because the books don't balance.\n  This brings me back to where I started.\n  Senator Byrd shined a bright beam of light on this very problem at \nMr. Rumfeld's hearing.\n  I thank him from the bottom of my heart.\n  By asking a few simple questions, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has stirred up a hornets nest.\n  I am hoping that his interest will encourage the new leadership in \nthe Pentagon to move in the right direction.\n  I hope the new leadership will help the bureaucrats find some old \ntime religion.\n  What I am hoping is that we can find a way to convert this inertia \ninto a long-term solution.\n  But Mr. Rumsfeld has to find the will to do it.\n  If the will is there, the way will be found.\n  When I talk about going back to basic accounting 101 stuff, I am not \nsuggesting that DOD break out old-fashioned ledger books.\n  Today, bookkeeping and inventory control is done electronically, \nusing highly integrated computer systems. Large companies like Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. are famous for doing it with ease. Wal-Mart has a \ntransaction-driven system. It is updated instantaneously when a \ntransaction occurs at a cash register anywhere in the system.\n  Why can't the Pentagon do it?\n  I made an all-out effort to fix it two years ago.\n  With the help and support of the Budget and Armed Services \nCommittees, I crafted what I considered to be a legislative remedy.\n  Those provisions are embodied in Sections 933 and 1007 of the FY2000 \ndefense authorization act--Public Law 106-65.\n  I thought my legislative remedy would move the Department of Defense \ntowards a clean audit, and that they would get an OK under the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act from the inspector general and the General \nAccounting Office within 2 years. That was the point of my amendment.\n  Well, guess what. We are two years down the road, and the clean \nopinion is nowhere in sight.\n  And there is nothing coming down the pike or on the distant horizon \nthat tells me that we will get there any time soon.\n  DOD simply does not have the tools in place to get the job done.\n  So I am hoping that the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from West \nVirginia can put their heads together and find a solution.\n  I am hoping we can work together to craft a more successful approach.\n  For starters, I have a recommendation to make to my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  In the near future, I would expect Secretary Rumsfeld to nominate a \nperson to be his Under Secretary for financial management--the \nComptroller and Chief Financial Officer.\n  This is his CFO.\n  This is the person responsible for cleaning up the books and bringing \nthe Pentagon into compliance with the CFO Act.\n  I would like for us to sit down with this individual immediately \nafter nomination--and long before confirmation.\n  I would like us to ask the same question that Senator Byrd asked Mr. \nRumsfeld: Mr. Secretary, what do you plan to do about this?\n  First, I would expect this person to make a firm commitment to \nfinancial reform and to Chief Financial Officer's Act compliance. \nSecond, I would not expect a final solution on the spot. However, prior \nto confirmation, I would expect this individual to provide us with a \ngeneral framework and a timetable for reform. When can we expect to see \na clean audit opinion? I will want the nominee to provide a \nsatisfactory answer to that question.\n  I hope the Senator from West Virginia will think that is a good thing \nfor us to ask the next CFO of DOD. As the new chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, I am deeply troubled by\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\nthe Pentagon's negative--I don't care--attitude towards bookkeeping. I \nsee good bookkeeping as a constitutional responsibility of every \ndepartment of Government. Taking cash out of the pockets of hard-\nworking Americans and appropriating to an agency that fails to control \nit is just not acceptable. That must change.\n  Now, in my new position on the Finance Committee, the Senator from \nIowa is responsible for legislation that authorizes the Government to \nreach deep into every citizen's pocket to get this money. I want to be \ncertain that money is spent wisely, No. 1. And No. 2, I want to be sure \nthat there is an audit trail on that money for all of us to see. That \naudit trail, that accounting system, that information in that \naccounting system on past expenditures is a very necessary basis for \nPresident Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld to make a decision of how much more the \nDefense Department budget should be ramped up.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his willingness to work on \nthis issue. Trying to solve the bookkeeping problem at the Pentagon, \nearning a clean audit opinion, would restore accountability to \nbookkeeping at the Pentagon. This is a worthy cause.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1252-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1252-S1253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE MILITARY BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will continue on with a few more \ncomments about the national security issue, which is being highlighted \nthis week, of course, by the President.\n  We have talked about the most obvious issue dealing with the \nmilitary; that is, having to do something for personnel. Without that, \nwe can't have a military. We can't have defense. Furthermore, it is \nvery unfair. We ask people in the military to serve the country, and \nthey do that willingly. We have a responsibility to ensure that they \nare reasonably reimbursed and their living conditions are kept as high \nas possible.\n  Obviously, the military budget is one of considerable concern. It is \nthe largest item in discretionary spending. We have discretionary \nspending of about $630 billion. Nearly half of that, $300 billion, is \ndefense. It is very large. On the other hand, when we ask our country \nto defend against threats around the world --and this is not \nnecessarily a peaceful world at this time--then we have to expect that \nit will be costly. We are faced with, of course--at least in the notion \nof many--what has been a period somewhat of neglect over the last 8 \nyears where the military has not had the highest priority, has not had \nas high a level of support as many believe it should have.\n  Last year the uniformed Service Chiefs testified to a requirement of \nbetween $48 and $58 billion per year in additional funding above the 5-\nyear projected budget. That is the impression, that is the notion from \nthe military leadership of the amount of dollars that are essential. \nOne of the things that makes that even more obvious in terms of needs \nis that while the military has not been supported as highly and as \nstrongly as it might be, this administration that just passed has \ndeployed more troops overseas than at any previous time during the same \nlength of time. In the past decade, our active duty manpower has been \nreduced by about a third, active Army divisions have been cut by almost \n50 percent. Not all that is bad, of course.\n  As the Senator from Iowa indicated, there are changes that need to be \nmade. Certainly the economic accounting, the management of the \neconomics in the military could stand some strengthening. I am sure \nthat is the case. We ought to expect that kind of expenditure of \ntaxpayer dollars. However, we do find ourselves in a state where we do \nneed to change things. The lack of spare parts for aging systems has \nforced the military to take parts off of other vehicles and other \nairplanes and cannibalize other kinds of things. It is so widespread \nthat personnel in the Air Force apparently spent 178,000 man-hours over \n2 years removing parts from bombers and fighters and transports, some \nof those kinds of things that certainly do not bode well for the kind \nof military we, indeed, want to have.\n  Obviously, there are needs for change. Often bureaucracies--and \nfrankly, the military has its share of bureaucracies--find it difficult \nto make change: We have always done it that way so we are going to \ncontinue to do it that way. Certainly that can't be the case with the \nmilitary, as things have changed substantially.\n  I heard testimony this week before one of the committees that \nindicated there could be a good deal more cooperation and unification \namong the branches of the military to make it more economic. That is \nprobably true.\n  One of the items that is being considered is the national missile \ndefense. There is a great deal of interest in that. It is not a new \nidea. It has been around for about 20 years. It certainly has merit. If \nwe thought we could develop some kind of an overall network of defense \nmechanisms, that would be a wonderful thing to do. On the other hand, \nthere is substantial question about what the costs would be. I think \nthere is substantial question even about the technology. It has not yet \nbeen developed.\n  I favor moving toward a national missile defense. I don't think we \nare ready to sacrifice some of the other things that we do because we \nare talking about doing a national missile defense.\n  First of all, as I mentioned, it is very expensive. We don't really \nknow the cost. I have been to Space Command in Colorado Springs, CO. \nThey indicated that even though they are enthusiastic about it and \ndoing experiments, we haven't reached the technological level where it \nwould work. I think there is a legitimate role for the missile defense \nsoon. However, I think we are going to run into, No. 1, the cost; and \nNo. 2, technology; and, No. 3, certainly we are going to have \ndifficulties dealing with some other countries in terms of the \nagreements that we have.\n  I think we need to understand that, at least from what we know about \nit now, it is going to be a relatively limited defense system, probably \nbased on the islands of Alaska. It will be designed to deal with rogue \nstates that have very limited capacity but certainly have the scary \ncapacity to put a missile in the United States, even though certainly \nthat would not win a conflict for them. But it would do a great deal of \ndamage to us.\n  I think the Space Command is working on the kind of system that would \nbe there in case something came from a couple of the countries that are \nlikely to be out of control in doing these kinds of things. They would \nbe limited to defending against a limited number of reentry vehicles. \nThey would not be able to deal with the whole issue of a major missile \nattack, of course.\n  I guess what I am saying is that we now have a nuclear capacity of \nour own, probably the strongest in the world. We have had it for a good \nlong time. We deal in three areas, of course, land-based missiles, \nship-to-ground missiles, and ground-to-air missiles. They constitute a \nvery important part of our defense in terms of a deterrent. I think it \nis very necessary to continue to do that.\n  The President has talked about reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons. I think that makes sense. We are in the process of doing that \nnow. We are in the process of removing some of our missiles under START \nI, and we are moving toward the restrictions that will be there in \nSTART II, in terms of the land-based missiles we have had over time, of \ncourse, the peacekeepers that have been multiple warhead missiles. \nThese are being changed and replaced by the Minuteman III missiles, \nwhich would be a single warhead. We can do a good deal of reduction \nthrough this ongoing arrangement. There needs, in my view, however, to \nbe the time START II or even START III was agreed to with the Russians, \na minimum of 500 missiles that we would have, which brings us down to \nthat 2,000 missiles that we talked about--the warheads we talked about \nin START I and II. We could do that. There is some talk about the idea \nof a hair trigger alert. There was something on TV last weekend, taken \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\ncommand room in one of these missile silos. I have been through this, \nand the fact is, there is a real system for ensuring that is not a hair \ntrigger kind of a thing. It doesn't happen unless there is approval \nfrom three different areas before that happens. But more important than \nanything, I think it does really take from us the day-to-day deterrent \nthat is out there, and the idea, of course, that if you only had a few \nmissiles, we put your missiles in that place and do away with those--\nwhen you have them spread as we do now, basically about three different \nplaces land-based, then it is possible to do that.\n  I guess I am encouraged that we are talking about a missile defense \nsystem, that it would be there to augment the idea of maintaining our \ncapacity to have this deterrence. I think it is terribly important that \nwe do that as part of our strategy. We can move forward to reduce those \nnumbers and get down to a START II agreement. I hope we do that.\n  We are going to be going forward, of course, on a number of things \nthat all have to do with budgets, all have to do, then, with surpluses \nand taxes. These things are all related, of course, and should be. I am \nhopeful, frankly, from the standpoint of the budget, that the President \npursues the idea that we ought to be able to have a budget that is \nbasically inflation increases, which we overstepped last year \nsubstantially.\n  Occasionally, there are areas--certainly in health care--where we are \ngoing to want to expand. But I think regardless of the surplus it is \nimportant that we try to keep Government spending under control in some \nway. We seem to think if there is money, we ought to spend it. I think \nwhen you go out into the country and talk to people, they are very \nconcerned about having a Federal Government that is continuously \ngrowing, that is more and more involved in our lives. And we would like \nto see these kinds of activities shifted back to the States, counties, \nand local governments, where government is closest to the people being \ngoverned.\n  So when we talk about budgets, we have to look at that in terms of \nthe tax reductions. We are finding from the other side of the aisle a \ngood deal of resistance to returning the money that people have \noverpaid in taxes to the people who paid it. That is a pretty stiff \nargument to undertake. We need, of course, to set up spending to pay \ndown the debt. I think we have an opportunity to deal with these things \nin a balanced way so we can come out of this session of Congress--if we \nare really persuaded as to what we want to do, I hope we may give some \nthought, individually and collectively, to what we want to have \naccomplished when this session of Congress is over. What do we want to \nsay we have done in terms of tax relief? What have we been able to \naccomplish? What do we want to say we have been able to do in terms of \ncontrolling spending? What are our goals in terms of paying down the \ndebt?\n  I think these are some of the things we talk about a great deal. We \ntalk about them kind of independently and, obviously, everybody has a \ndifferent idea, and that is legitimate. It seems to me that we ought to \nbe able to establish fairly and collectively some goals, some vision of \nwhere we want to be, what we want to have accomplished when these 2 \nyears are over, and then be able to measure the things we do against \nthe attainment of those goals.\n  Unfortunately, I am afraid that, from time to time, it is not always \nthe measurement of individual actions as to how they contribute to \noverall attainment. Will there be agreement on all of those things? Of \ncourse not. That is the nature of this place, the nature of any group \nthat makes decisions. They don't all agree. They have different views \nand values, and we have to deal with that. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. But we do want to be able to move toward accomplishing those \nthings that we believe are good for the country, good for the long-term \nmerits, and that, it seems to me, is our challenge.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand there have been speeches \ngiven this morning with respect to the military and the decision by \nPresident Bush to take a very serious look at what is happening in the \nmilitary--a pause, if you will, in the funding and planning until we \nget our hands around exactly where things are.\n  I want to comment about the wisdom of that particular approach. If I \nmay, I want to go back to the most inconsequential military career \nperhaps in the history of America--my own. It will demonstrate what \nhappens in the military and demonstrate the power of inertia because \nonce something gets started in one direction, it continues in that \ndirection until some outside force is put upon it. That is not just \nNewton's law of motion; that is the law of motion in government as a \nwhole.\n  I went into the military in 1957. I joined the Utah National Guard \nand was sent on active duty for training, first to Fort Ord, CA, and \nthen, because my Guard unit was in the artillery observation business, \nto Fort Sill, OK.\n  I went to Fort Sill, OK, to be trained in sound ranging. If that does \nnot mean anything to you, Mr. President, I would not be surprised \nbecause sound ranging is a military skill that reached its apex of \napplicability in World War I. It had some applicability in World War \nII, very little in Korea, and virtually none in 1957 when I was trained \nin it.\n  But the inertia of the military organization was such that no one had \nreviewed the pattern of training people in sound ranging. So going \nforward, as a body in physics, moving in the same direction, it \ncontinued in the same direction. I and my fellow classmates were put \nthrough a program on sound ranging.\n  As it happened, I graduated first in my class. That is not as big an \nachievement as it might sound because I was the only member of the \nclass who had been to college. I was a college graduate; the others \nwere draftees who were high school graduates; and if I had not finished \nfirst, it would have been a disgrace.\n  Having finished first, once again the pattern of inertia in the \nmilitary decreed that I should become an instructor and that the next \nsound ranging course that would go through Fort Sill, OK, would be \ntaught by me. This is very flattering, except that my time on active \nduty with the National Guard would expire before the next class would \nconvene.\n  I spent the remainder of my time in the day room, or at the post \nlibrary, or doing other things because there was absolutely nothing for \nme to do. At the time I wondered: Doesn't anybody review these things? \nDoesn't anybody look at this and say: Wait a minute, this is a program \nthat has long since outlived its usefulness, should be stopped, and we \nshould just forget this?\n  No, nobody did. I got so bored, I went in and volunteered to teach \nother classes and had to go back to school, if you will, on my own time \nto learn logarithms so that I could teach that mathematical skill to \nthe surveyors in the school. Basically, this was the least \ndistinguished and least significant military career in American \nhistory, but it demonstrates what happens when we allow inertia to take \nover. We allow the military to go forward in one direction, and we do \nnot ever stop and say: Wait a minute, are we doing the right thing?\n  Summarizing it another way, there are some historians who say the \ngenerals always fight the last war; they are always prepared for the \nlast battle, not the battle that is to come.\n  The cold war is over. That is a cliche. Like most cliches, it happens \nto be true. Much of our military is geared towards fighting the cold \nwar. Much of our military is geared towards a circumstance where the \nmilitary commanders involved are comfortable with the way things are \ngoing because they are the way things have been.\n  The idea that there should be a careful look at where they are and a \nreassessment of the direction they are taking is a little bit \nthreatening; it is unsettling; it implies uncertainty. The one thing \nmany military men hate worse than anything else is uncertainty.\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\n  As I was going through the airport, flying back for this week's \nsession, a book caught my eye. Tom Clancy is the author. We all know \nTom Clancy. The reason it caught my eye was his mention of a military \nofficer who had helped him write the book, a man named Chuck Horner. I \nmet Chuck Horner when he was the commander of the U.S. Space Command, a \nfour-star general located in Colorado Springs. He was the commander of \nthe air war in the gulf. He was the top Air Force officer with respect \nto the Gulf War.\n  I found him fascinating, and when I saw his name on the cover of this \nbook written by Tom Clancy, I decided to buy the book because I wanted \nto learn more about General Horner.\n  The reason I found him fascinating, among other things, was this \nstatement he made to me during the time I spent with him. He said: The \nGulf War was the first war fought from space. Tanks got positioned by \nvirtue of instructions that came from space. Colin Powell said this is \nthe war where the infantryman goes into the field with a rifle in one \nhand and a laptop in the other. Even that is now obsolete because he \nwould take a palm pilot instead of a laptop; a laptop would be too \ncumbersome.\n  The Army, with its current advertising campaign, is beginning to talk \nabout that. I am not sure it is the right advertising campaign--every \nsoldier is an army of one--but it demonstrates how vastly changed \nthings are.\n  Against that background where those things not only have changed but \nare changing, doesn't it make sense for the Secretary of Defense to say \nit is time for us to pause in the direction we are going in our \nprocurement, in our threat assessment, in our strength establishment, \nand look toward the kind of military we are going to need in the \nfuture? Isn't it time for us to take a break when we do not have an \nimmediate military threat and reassess from top to bottom everything we \nare doing?\n  I think it demonstrates the maturity of the Bush administration that \nSecretary Rumsfeld is engaged in this kind of activity. I think it \ndemonstrates that the Bush administration has a very long-headed view \nof life; that they are not looking to this week or next week; they are \nnot looking to the current polls; they are not looking to what might \nwork in terms of a special interest group that has an attitude toward \nthe military; they are saying: What does America need for the next \ndecade? What kind of long-term decision can we make that will make \nAmerica prepare for the different kind of threat we are facing? I think \nit means a military that will very quickly say we don't need any sound \nranging classes, and we don't need any people sitting around with \nnothing to do. There is far too much to do in terms of planning and \ntraining and direction. I applaud President Bush for this decision, I \napplaud Secretary Rumsfeld for carrying it out, and I wish to make it \nclear that this Senator will do everything he can to support and \nsustain this effort.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1254-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to turn my attention this \nafternoon to something a little bit more immediate in terms of the \nSenate's actions. We all saw the news yesterday of the President's \nvisit to Fort Stewart in Georgia. In fact, I spoke with a colleague of \nours who had been with the President on that trip. She talked about the \nrather sorry state of the military barracks she visited, and the need \nfor improvements to the military quality of life all around the \ncountry, exemplified by the President's visit to Fort Stewart.\n  As a result of his visit, the President has made some very forward-\nleaning announcements about improvement of the quality of life, \nincluding $5.7 billion in new spending--$1.4 billion for military pay \nincreases, $400 million to improve military housing, $3.9 billion to \nimprove military health benefits, $5.7 billion on new spending for the \npeople in our military. I am certain that part of that will have to \ncome through a so-called supplemental appropriations bill.\n  For those who are not totally familiar with the work of the Senate, \nordinarily at about this time of the year, the Senate has to provide \nsome infusion of cash to the military because of unforeseen \nexpenditures and some that really were not so unforeseen but which were \nnot budgeted for. For example, we know we will have to be in Bosnia and \nKosovo and some other places in the world. Unfortunately, the previous \nadministration never budgeted for those operations in advance, so the \nmilitary had to pay for those operations out of hide.\n  They had to not buy certain spare parts, not sail ships during \ncertain hours, not provide for maintenance of facilities and \ninstallations, deferring that for a later day, and use the money \ninstead to support these operations abroad. Each year, we have had, \ntherefore, a supplemental appropriations bill. Basically, the bill \ncomes due. It has to be paid one way or another, sooner or later. We \nwill have to do that same thing this year.\n  The President has decided to wait a little bit to make sure he knows \nexactly how much is needed. By the way, I hope President Bush will say \nto the Congress: I found out that we need exactly--and then give us the \nnumber. Let's assume it is $5 billion, for the sake of argument--I \nwould like the Congress to provide $5 billion in supplemental \nappropriations to get our military through the end of the fiscal year. \nThat is how much we need, and I will veto a bill that is a dollar less \nor a dollar more.\n  In other words, this should not become a Christmas tree for \neveryone's favorite project. I urge the President to give us an exact \nfigure and tell us it is on our shoulders to pass that supplemental \nappropriations bill for him, for the military, and to reject any change \nwe may make, therefore, removing the temptation some of our colleagues \nhave to load those bills up with things that don't really pertain to \nnecessities for the military.\n  I also want to suggest that we are going to need that supplemental \nappropriations bill not just for the quality of life of our military \nbut for readiness. Certainly, the Presiding Officer knows this better \nthan almost anybody in this body. Readiness has suffered during the \nlast several years through a combination of two primary circumstances. \nOne, we are deploying troops far more frequently and far-flung around \nthe world than in the past. Two, we have cut the spending year after \nyear, so we don't have the equipment in top shape to send where we need \nto send it, when we need to send it. Our troops are overstressed. The \nnet result is readiness\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nhas suffered. We would not be able to go tomorrow where we need to in \nthe world with the same degree of confidence we were able to muster, \nsay, a decade ago when we went to the Persian Gulf.\n  I think a few statistics are interesting. The lack of spare parts \nforced our military to cannibalize systems to keep things working. GAO \nfound in 1999, ``cannibalization was so widespread in the Air Force \nthat maintenance personnel spent 178,000 hours over 2 years removing \nparts from bombers and fighters and transports to put into other \nplanes.''\n  I was at Luke Air Force Base in the western part of the Phoenix area \nnot long ago and was told of the 100-plus planes they had there--\nroughly 10 percent were F-16s, by the way, the top of our fighter \nline--were being used for cannibalization. That has gotten some better. \nThat illustrates we are cannibalizing our equipment, and we know that \nis the beginning of the end, in terms of readiness.\n  The Navy, the same thing. We could go through all the different \nservices. I won't take the time to do that. These cannibalization \nrates, not only in the Navy, have doubled in the last 4 years, but the \nproblem is most acute among the jet aircraft that are most in demand.\n  I think there is a broad consensus that we need to be improving our \nreadiness and that those are bills that need to be paid now, equipment \nthat needs to be purchased now. We can't wait until the beginning of \nthe next fiscal year, which is not until October, this fall sometime. I \nhope when the President sends his supplemental appropriations request \nto us, it will include both the personnel quality of life needs he has \nalready announced, which I think all of us will support very strongly, \nand in addition to that some immediate needs to improve our readiness. \nI was going to say ``ensure'' our readiness, but the fact is, we can't \ndo enough in supplemental appropriations to ensure readiness. We can \njust begin to get to the point where we have the state of readiness we \nreally desire.\n\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Congressional Budget Office, and \nvarious independent analysts from groups such as Brookings Institution \nand the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment and former \nSecretaries of Defense, such as Harold Brown and Jim Slessinger--all of \nthese groups and individuals, and many more, have come to the \nconclusion that we are going to need to increase defense spending over \nthe next several years, and we are going to have to do it fairly \ndramatically.\n  I applaud the administration's efforts to examine what we really \nneed, what we can do without, and how we are going to structure our \nforces to meet the new challenges of the 21st century. It is time to \nget out of the old thinking and keep putting money into the same old \nweapons projects.\n  That said--and we all understand the need for this review--it is also \ntrue that at the same time we are doing that review, we can and should \nbe doing things to improve our military, things we know need to be \ndone; and whatever we are going to be doing in 5, 8, 10 years, we know \nwe will need additional funding to support the troops during the next \n5, 6, 8, 10 years.\n  So it is not a matter of either/or, or first we do a review and then \ndecide how much to spend. We know we need to spend some money now and \nwe also need to reevaluate our long-term strategy so we can better fix \nour spending for the future.\n  For those who say we can't do anything until all of that is done, I \nsay listen to those who are expert, who have testified to this in the \npast, the Joint Chiefs and staff and others, who understand our \nmilitary requirements right this minute. We are not talking about \nbuying new weapons systems that have to be reevaluated. Let me make it \nclear that I support President Bush's desire to reevaluate every one of \nthese weapons systems. I have severe doubts about whether some of the \nmost expensive systems we have on the drawing board really need to go \nforward. But we also know, in the meantime, we do have needs, unmet \nneeds, which can only be satisfied through an increase in defense \nspending.\n  That is why I think it is important for us not only to pass the \nsupplemental appropriation at the time the President sends it to us but \nalso to put together very soon a budget for the Department of Defense \nwhich meets some of these short-term needs.\n  Essentially, my bottom line here is the military, the armed services \ndon't have the luxury of waiting until the end of a review to meet some \nof the needs of today. That is my primary point.\n  I talked about a dual problem. One problem is the degree of \ndeployment, the number of overseas missions assigned to our military, \nincreased by just under 300 percent during the previous administration, \nwith President Clinton deploying our forces on such missions 40 times \ncompared to 14 times under former President Bush, and 16 times under \nReagan. The readiness problems have resulted from that, plus \nspending not keeping up with the needs.\n\n  Just a couple of further illustrations of the problem. A recent \narticle in Defense Week quotes at length from an internal Navy audit \ninto the readiness of F-14 squadrons, which are suffering from this \ncombination of high operational tempos and insufficient funding. One of \nthe quotations from that audit is that, ``more and more, forward forces \nare short on planes, munitions, spare parts, and training time. This \ncould result in F-14 squadrons being at high risk while engaging the \nenemy, an unnecessary loss of life and property, and failure to achieve \nU.S. policy goals.''\n  That is pretty serious. When that degree of risk is upon us today, we \ncan't wait until tomorrow to put the funding into the military budget \nto make up for the shortfall in the short run. We have not budgeted for \nexpenses such as our efforts in the Balkans, as I pointed out before. \nThat ought to be budgeted in the general budget and not have to come to \nus each year in a supplemental appropriation.\n  Unless we are able to infuse this kind of money into the defense \nbudget very quickly, then the Navy is going to be forced to cut its \nflying hours; the Air Force is going to have to make adjustments that \nwill erode its readiness, including flying hours, maintenance, air crew \nproficiency, aircraft maintenance and repair, not to mention that spare \nparts and fuel shortages are going to be required to be rectified if we \nare going to have a high state of readiness during the interim period \nbetween now and the time the new force the Bush administration is \ntalking about comes into play.\n  Mr. President, there is something else we are going to have to do, \nand that is to begin doing the kind of research that will be necessary \nto effectuate President Bush's new plans. He asked for a review of \nthese military programs by experts in the Pentagon and outside who will \ncome to him with some very bold ideas, I predict; and they are going to \ncall for modernization of the force, the use of the most recent \ntechnology, the application of that technology in ways that we haven't \neven dreamed of up until now. But unless we are willing to put money \nback into research and development, as we used to do, we are not going \nto be able to effectuate these plans. They are going to look great on \npaper, but we are not going to have the ability to do it. Why? It takes \nskilled people in place. Unless these people believe they have a \nfuture, they don't sign up for these particular kinds of jobs. The \ncontractors themselves can't wrap up with a group of people and \nfacilities to do something for which there is no contract and no hope \nof a contract.\n  You cannot just make this appear out of thin air. That is why we have \nto begin planning today for the defense budget for this coming fiscal \nyear to begin to reestablish a robust research and development program \nthat will be able to service the budgetary requirements that are going \nto come from the administration in the creation of its new \ntechnological military for the 21st century.\n  We have been eating our seed corn in this regard over the last \nseveral years. Again, the Presiding Officer knows better than most in \nthis body that we have cut research and development way back in order \nto put some money into quality of life and to keep our forces as ready \nas we can possibly keep them. The result of that has been to reduce \ndrastically the amount of money available for our research and \ndevelopment.\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\n  That is an area where we are going to have to add to the budget that \ncomes before the Congress this year, and if the administration, \nfrankly, is unwilling to do that, then the Congress has to put that \nmoney in the budget so when the President needs those people and those \nfacilities to begin developing these new high-tech products, we will be \nable to respond to that call.\n  There are some other areas in which we are going to have to add money \nto the budget. I spoke this morning with respect to missile defense. It \nis very clear we are going to be making some decisions early on in this \nadministration to proceed with the development of missile defense. I \napplaud the administration's desire to reevaluate the exact components \nand structure of that defense because, frankly, I do not think the way \nthe Clinton administration was thinking about doing it was the best. It \nwas rudimentary; it was vulnerable; it was effective only in an \nextraordinarily limited sense.\n  As a first step, it might just be fine, but we are going to have to \nreevaluate how to put this together and undoubtedly expend funds for \nresearch and development, as well as deployment of these systems. That \nis not going to happen without money in the budget.\n  When opponents of missile defense say it is going to cost a lot of \nmoney, they exaggerate about how much, but they are right about one \nthing: We are going to have to put more money in the budget for it, \nmore money than has been in the budget in the past. As a result, the \nbudget we put together and send to the President--and I hope the budget \nthe President puts together for our review--will include additional \nsupport for ballistic missile defense, especially in an area which has \nbeen robbed in the past, and that is the sea-based missile defense.\n  Mr. President, you may have been one of our colleagues--I believe you \nwere--who supported a lawsuit that I filed against the Secretary of \nDefense several years ago for refusing to spend money that the Congress \nauthorized and appropriated for specific missile defense programs, \nspecifically, the sea-based systems of the Navy and the THAAD Program \nof the Army. The Secretary of Defense at that time said: I understand \nthat you have appropriated and authorized this funding, but I am not \ngoing to spend the money.\n  Subsequently, he began to spend a little bit of it. That, plus the \nfact that money that which had been in those programs was taken from \nthose programs and applied to other programs, has instead resulted in a \nsevere underfunding of these missile defense programs.\n  These are theater missile defense programs, and the Navy program \nespecially has been robbed and shortchanged. Unless we are willing to \nput money into the budget to ramp those programs back up to where they \nshould be, we are not going to be able to deploy the Navy portion of \nthe missile defense system as we should. The irony is that if we put \nthe money into the budget--and it takes a relatively small amount; my \nguess is over 4 years about $1.5 billion as an add-on will do the \ntrick--if we were to put that kind of money into the budget, we could \nactually deploy a Navy missile defense system sooner and more \neffectively than a land-based system. In any event, we have the two to \ncomplement each other. The bottom line is we are going to have to put \nmore money into the missile defense part of the budget.\n\n  Finally, there has been a suggestion the Department of Energy's \ndefense weapons component of the budget is going to have to take a big \nhit. That, too, is a big mistake because when the proponents of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty said we really have a substitute \nfor testing, it is called the Stockpile Stewardship Program, I raised \nseveral questions. First, we are not going to know for more than a \ndecade whether it is going to produce results.\n  Second, I predicted Congress' desire to continue funding for this \nprogram would wane over time. I have been the second staunchest \nsupporter, by the way, of funding after our colleague, Pete Domenici \nfrom New Mexico. Sure enough, now there is a suggestion that the \nStockpile Stewardship Program should be shorted some funding.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot argue on the one hand we do \nnot need to do any testing and on the other hand we need to change the \nStockpile Stewardship Program.\n  These are three specific areas I mentioned: the need for research and \ndevelopment, the need for proceeding with the sea-based missile defense \nsystem, and the need for stockpile stewardship, all of which are going \nto require more, not less, funding of the defense budget. That is why \nat the end of the day, we are going to have to be willing to add money \nto the defense budget, and if that means it is prior to the \nadministration's determination that funding is necessary, I say so be \nit; it is going to be necessary. Then we are going to have to get \nbehind the President and support his long-term projects, which I know \nwill, in the end, provide a very robust defense for the United States \nbut which, in the meantime, we are going to have to be very watchful of \nwith respect to the readiness both today and the preparation for that \nday that the new force of the 21st century has been developed.\n  These are all matters we will discuss further in the future, but I \nthink they are an important element in discussing this week the \nPresident's plan to strengthen our national security to ensure that our \nmilitary remains the strongest in the world, capable of doing \neverything we ask of it. I know the President would demand no less.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know our time is to run until 3:15 p.m. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be given 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of \ninterest to you, the Senator from Arizona, as well as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire. I do, as you mentioned, chair the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Readiness. The Subcommittee on Readiness has \njurisdiction over training, military construction, the BRAC process, \nand a few other things.\n  It is important during this debate that we say it in terms of reality \nto get the attention of the American people. Since 1996, I have been \nsaying that we in the United States of America are in the most \nthreatened position we have been in in the history of this country. \nMany people do not believe that. Many people shrug their shoulders and \nsay: This is not true, we are the strongest in the world.\n  Yes, we may be the strongest in the world at this given time, but \nwith the number of threats, it is questionable whether or not we would \nbe able to defend ourselves adequately, certainly not meet the minimum \nexpectations of the American people, which is defend America on two \nregional fronts.\n  When I make this statement that we are in the most threatened \nposition--we had before our committee less than a year ago George \nTenet, who is the Director of Central Intelligence and the man who \nknows more about threats than anyone else in this Nation who was, \nincidentally, appointed by President Clinton. I asked George Tenet that \nquestion: Is it true what I have been saying since 1996, that we are in \nthe most threatened position we have been in as a nation? He said: \nThat's exactly right. That is from George Tenet.\n  The reasons we are are threefold. It has been said on the floor but \nnot put together in one thread.\n  First of all, the obvious is that we are at one-half the force \nstrength we were in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf war. What I am \nsaying is we are one-half the force strength--that can be quantified--\none-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical air wings, one-half \nthe ships.\n  Talking about ships, we were cut down from a 600-ship Navy to a 300-\nship Navy. We saw the tragedy that took place in Yemen with the U.S.S. \nCole. When you stop and think about it, some of the ships that were \ntaken out when we downsized the Navy were the oilers, the tankers that \nrefuel our ships at sea.\n  We send our fleets from the Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, \ndown the Red Sea, turn left and go up the Arabian Sea to the Persian \nGulf. That is 5,000 miles. We have to have refueling capacity.\n  After the Yemen tragedy, I could not find one vice admiral who did \nnot say if we had not taken out of service at least two of those \nrefuelers, we would have\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nrefueled at sea, and those sailors would be alive today. We are at one-\nhalf force strength. At the same time, we have more than tripled our \nnumber of deployments around the world. I might add, these are places \nwhere I contend we don't have national security strategic interests at \nstake.\n  In November of 1995, in this Chamber, we were debating whether or not \nto go into Bosnia. We said on this floor, it is easy to go in; it is \nhard to get out. We had a resolution of disapproval. It wasn't until \nPresident Clinton said: I guarantee if you vote down that resolution of \ndisapproval, we will send the troops over there and they will all be \nhome for Christmas, 1996. Guess what. They are still there.\n  It will be very difficult to get them out if the same thing happened \nin Kosovo. Regarding the threat in the Persian Gulf, just to handle the \nlogistics of a war if it should break out in the Persian Gulf, we would \nhave to be 100-percent dependent upon our Guard and Reserve to take \ncare of the defense of this Nation. This is very difficult because the \nGuard and Reserve components also are down in numbers because of the \nretention problems we have.\n  That is serious. When you take that and the number of deployments, \nalong with one-half force strength, the third component is we don't \nhave a national missile defense system. Sometimes, I say it is handy \nnot to be an attorney in this body because when I read the ABM Treaty \nthat was passed, introduced by the Republicans, back in 1972, between \ntwo great superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States, I contend \nthat doesn't exist anymore. Yet that is the very thing that has been \nused for the last 8 years by our previous President to keep us from \ndeploying a national missile defense system.\n  In 1983, we made the decision we were going to put one into effect. \nWe were online to do that until this last administration came in.\n  Next, I think it is important to realize this euphoric assumption \nthat many have--and the press does not discourage this notion; it might \nbe our force strength is down, our deployments are up--we don't have a \nnational missile defense system, but there is no threat out there in \nterms of a national missile defense. Virtually every country out there \nhas weapons of mass destruction. Many countries have missiles that will \nreach the United States of America.\n  Take China, for example. If they fired a missile, it would take 35 \nminutes to get here. We have nothing in our arsenal to stop that \nmissile from hitting an American city. Compare my State of Oklahoma and \nthe terrible disaster, the tragedy that took place. The smallest \nnuclear warhead known to man is 1,000 times greater in explosive power. \nThink about that. China has missiles that can reach here. Do other \ncountries besides Russia, North Korea, and China have the missile? We \ndon't know for sure. They are trading technology and trading systems \nwith countries such as Iran and Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Pakistan, and \nothers. The one thing they have in common is they don't like us. We \nhave a serious problem.\n  We don't have the modernization people think. I heard people say: At \nleast we have the finest equipment in the world.\n\n  I was proud of Gen. John Jumper not too many months ago when he came \nout and said: Right now we don't have anything in our arsenal as \npowerful in terms of air-to-air combat as the SU-27 and the SU-37. It \nis my understanding, if we go on with the SU-22, it is not as good as \nthe SU-37 they are building today.\n  Look at our training and retention. We see our pilots leaving. We see \nour midlevel NCOs leaving. I talked to pilots at Corpus Navy. Forty \npilots said: It is not the competition outside; it is not the money. \nThis country has lost its sense of mission. We are not getting the \ntraining we need.\n  Our Air Force pilots cannot go into the desert and have red flag \nexercises because we don't have the money to do it. The Senator from \nArizona talked about not having bullets, ammunition. We don't have \nbullets and ammunition. RPM accounts, the maintenance accounts, are \nsupposed to be done immediately.\n  I was at Fort Bragg the other day in a rainstorm. Our troops were \ncovering up equipment with their bodies because we don't have the money \nto put a roof on the barracks down there. Our equipment is old. We \nfound some M915 trucks had a million miles on the chassis. They were in \nbad repair.\n  We see the cannibalization rate at Travis--C-5s sitting in the field \nwith rotting parts. It is very labor intensive to get the parts back on \nand to uncrate new parts and replace them. In many areas, our mechanics \nare actually working 14 to 16 hours a day. Our retention is down.\n  I can think of nothing more significant at this time than to start \ndoing exactly what our new President said he would do when he was on \nthe campaign trail; that is, assess the problems we have now and how \ncan we put ourselves back into position, where, No. 1, we can \nadequately protect America from an incoming missile.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, we might have tried the same thing \nwith the sea-based AEGIS system. We have $50 billion invested in 22 \nAEGIS ships, but they cannot reach the upper tier. It costs little to \nget them up to knocking down incoming missiles and they can protect the \ntroops in North Korea and both coasts in America. The opportunity is \nthere.\n  I wish we had proceeded with this 10 years ago. I believe we are on \nthe right step. The single most significant thing we can do as a Senate \nand Congress and the President of the United States is to rebuild our \ndefense system, to satisfy the minimum expectations of the American \npeople; that is, to defend America on two regional fronts.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, each day in America 1,000 World War II \nveterans die. Seven days a week, every day of every month, thousands of \nWorld War II veterans die. It is with this background that today I am \ngoing to be talking about legislation which I introduced a short time \nago.\n  On January 24th I sponsored S. 170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act \nof 2001. This bill addresses a 110-year-old injustice against over \n450,000 of our nations veterans. Congress has repeatedly forced the \nbravest men and women in our nation--retired, career veterans--to \nessentially forgo receipt of a portion of their retirement pay if they \nhappen to also receive disability pay for an injury that occurred in \nthe line of duty.\n  We have, in America, a law that says if you are a career military \nperson and you also have a disability you receive while in the \nmilitary, when you retire you cannot draw both pensions. If you, \nhowever, retire from the Department of Energy, or you retire from Sears \n& Roebuck, you can draw both pensions, but not our dedicated service \nmen and women. They cannot draw both pensions. That is wrong. That is \nwhat this legislation is trying to correct.\n  The reason I did it on the background of a thousand men dying every \nday is because we have to do something before it is too late for those \npeople. We have many World War II veterans who\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nspent a career in the military. They were in the military and received \na disability. In all of these years, they have only been able to, in \neffect, draw one pension. That is wrong.\n  S. 170 permits retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service \nconnected disability to receive military retirement pay while also \nreceiving veterans' disability compensation.\n  Last year, I along with Senator Inouye, introduced S. 2357, the Armed \nForces Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payment Act of 2000. I was \nextremely disappointed that we did not take the opportunity to correct \nthis long-standing inequity in the 106th Congress.\n  Out of 100 percent of what we should have done last year, we did 1 \npercent. We did very little.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Memorial Day is \njust over one hundred days away. There is no better honor this body \ncould bestow upon our nations veterans who have sacrificed so much, \nthan to pass this legislation before Memorial Day.\n  We are currently losing over one thousand WWII veterans each day. \nEvery day we delay acting on this legislation means that we have denied \nfundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. They will never \nhave the ability to enjoy their two well-deserved entitlements.\n  Given the tax and budget debate we are now in, I am gravely concerned \nthat we will not have the resources that will be needed to properly \nfund this legislation and honor those who served our nation--our \nveterans.\n  President Bush rightfully this week is focusing attention on the U.S. \nmilitary. It is very important that he do that. I think the way he is \napproaching things appears to me to be very reasoned. He is saying we \nare going to keep Clinton's budget in effect this year until we have a \nchance to really understand what is happening. But he ordered Secretary \nRumsfeld to take a close look at it.\n  One of the things I want him to take a close look at is not only the \nreadiness of the military and what happens to those people who have \nalready served in the military, but I also say that it is very \nimportant that everyone recognize we do need and deserve and will have \nsome kind of a tax cut. But we have to be aware of the fact we are \nbasing these proposed tax cuts on uncertain forecasts. We are \nforecasting 10 years in the future.\n  A few days ago here in Washington they forecast morning temperatures \nin the midforties. Most mornings I get up and take a little run. So I \nwas kind of happy that we were going to have a break in the weather. \nThe forecast was it would be kind of warm. I got up, put on shorts and \na T-shirt. Out I went. It was 33 degrees. There is a lot of difference \nbetween 40 and 33. I was real cold. I say that because people can't \nforecast very well the weather 1 day ahead. I think we who are \ndepending on the economists to forecast 10 years ahead must approach \nthis with caution. I know we will do that.\n  We also have to be sure this tax cut is proper in size. We have to \nmake sure we do not take away from debt reduction and that we take care \nof Social Security and Medicare.\n  Also, in addition to these projections, and the size that we are \ntalking about with this tax cut, we want to look at fairness. Are we \napproaching this in the right way? Is it really appropriate?\n  This is in the form of a question and not a statement. Is it really \nappropriate that the top 1 percent and the wealthiest 1 percent get 43 \npercent of the tax cut? They pay a lot of the taxes--about 20 percent \nof the taxes. I think there has to be a debate, once we determine the \nprojections, about the size of this tax cut--what we are going to do \nand how we are going to distribute that?\n  I was home this past weekend. Most Americans--in fact 80 percent of \nAmericans--pay more in withholding taxes than they do in income taxes.\n  I also say this: The business community is concerned the tax cuts are \nnot directed toward them but, rather, individuals. We have to make sure \nthe tax cut we come up with is fair. As I said, this Senator supports \ntax cuts for all Americans. I think we have to make sure these tax cuts \nprotect Social Security and Medicare and that we have some money left \nover to invest in health, education, and things such as my taking care \nof veterans.\n  Of course, for me, the biggest tax cut the American people can get is \nto recognize if we pay down that debt, everybody gets a tax cut. The \nmagnitude of the tax cut that President Bush is pushing we hope will \nnot eliminate any ability of increased funding for veterans. This is \ngoing to cost money, but it is going to cost money that is one of the \nfairest ways we could spend some of the surplus.\n  I say to President Bush: We should not leave our veterans behind. I \nsay to Members of this Congress: We should not leave our veterans \nbehind. Our veterans have earned this and now is our chance to honor \ntheir service to our Nation in a different way. I will work very hard \nto ensure that our Nation's veterans receive the dividend of our \ncurrent surplus. Specifically, we have to have a fiscally responsible \ntax cut that allows us to protect Social Security, provide a \nprescription drug benefit, fund education, ensure a strong and stable \nmilitary, and continue to pay down the debt.\n  Today, over a million and a half Americans dedicate every minute of \ntheir lives to the defense of this Nation. The U.S. military force is \nunmatched in the history of the world in terms of power, training, and \nability, and this Nation is recognized as the world's only superpower, \na status which is largely due to the sacrifices our veterans made \nduring this last century. So rather than honoring their commitment and \nbravery by fulfilling our obligations, the Federal Government has \nchosen instead to perpetuate a 110-year-old injustice. Quite simply, \nthis is wrong. It borders on being disgraceful.\n  I hope everyone within the sound of my voice will join in honoring \nthese veterans who deserve what they have earned. They are not asking \nfor a handout. They are asking for what they deserve. They have \ndisabilities. They have fulfilled their commitment in the military and \nare subject to that retirement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on July 27, 1920, in a speech before \nthe Republican national convention in Chicago accepting his party's \nnomination for Vice President, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge \nexclaimed, ``The nation which forgets its defenders will be itself \nforgotten.'' With these striking words, Coolidge chastened the \nconvention delegates to never take lightly the sacrifice of American \nsoldiers, who during World War I, left freedom's shores to defend \ndemocracy abroad. Back then, Coolidge recognized that a great country \nmust honor its guardians, lest it be forgotten.\n  This week, President George W. Bush has come forward under the same \nbanner as Coolidge did in 1920, to declare that America must not forget \nits defenders. In a speech before the brave men and women of the United \nStates Army's 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart Georgia, President \nBush proposed $5.7 billion in new spending for the soldiers, sailors \nand airmen of the Armed Forces. Specifically, the President has \nproposed dedicating $400 million for across-the-board pay raises, $1\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nbillion for re-enlistment bonuses, $3.9 billion for improving military \nhealth benefits, and $400 million to improve military housing. I \napplaud the President on this brave and honorable proposal.\n  I find it appalling that before the President announced this proposal \nmany were criticizing his decision to temporarily freeze program \nspending at last year's appropriated levels. When the President ordered \nthe Secretary of Defense to conduct a thorough review of Pentagon \nweapons programs before proceeding with any requests for supplemental \nfunds, he was attacked in the press for breaking his campaign promise \nto ``bolster our national defense.'' I find such assertions to be not \nonly mean-spirited, but also misguided.\n  Make no mistake, newer and better weapons systems are crucial toward \nmaintaining our national defense. We live in a world where we face real \nand present hostilities. Rogue nations are becoming increasingly \ncapable of striking America's shores, and I look forward to the debate \nwe will have in the Senate this year about building ballistic missile \ndefense systems, and other ``next generation'' weapons to counter these \nterrors. However, I fully realize that without qualified men and women \ntrained in the use and support of these systems, we are merely left \nwith empty threats to counter these real hostilities.\n  Human beings are the driving force behind our national security. \nTanks, ships, and fighter jets do not win wars. Soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen do. Arlington does not honor the memory of our greatest weapons. \nThose hallowed grounds are sacred to the memory of the men and women \nwho have laid down their lives using and supporting those weapons. \nConcern for the individuals who proudly serve our Nation as soldiers \nshould always be our first priority when we debate our national defense \npolicies. By proceeding first to the need of the soldiers ahead of the \nneed for new weapons, President Bush has demonstrated he has his \npriorities straight and I pledge my support for his proposal in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The bond between a soldier and his nation must be reciprocal. The \nUnited States must rely on soldiers to defend against her enemies, and, \nfor over 225 years, these soldiers have never failed. However, we do \nnot always recognize the fact that the favor often goes unreturned. Far \ntoo often throughout our history the United States has relied on the \ndefense of the soldier, while failing, in turn, to defend the soldier \nagainst their own enemies.\n  The enemies of our soldiers are low pay, substandard housing, and \nsecond class health benefits. No one would deny that all of our \ncitizens are in perpetual need of a good wage, a good home, and good \nhealth care, and yet, we often act as if our soldiers are in need of \nless. Addressing the New York State Legislature in 1775, General George \nWashington reminded the legislators, ``When we assumed the Soldier, we \ndid not lay aside the Citizen.'' Our citizens, on becoming soldiers, \nhave not left want and need behind. It is our duty to afford them with \nmeans to not only survive, but to also thrive. We can afford no less. \nFreedom is never free.\n  Mr. President, again, I commend President Bush for coming forward and \ndeclaring the need to support the defenders of the Nation. Again, this \nweek, President George Bush came forward under the same banner as \nCalvin Coolidge did in 1920, to declare that America must not forget \nits defenders. In a speech given to the Army's 3rd Infantry Division at \nFort Stewart, GA, President Bush proposed $5.7 billion in new spending \nfor the soldiers, sailors, and airmen in the armed services. \nSpecifically, the President has proposed dedicating $400 million for \nacross-the-board pay raises, $1 billion for reenlistment bonuses, and \nother benefits to the men and women in uniform.\n  I end my comments by saying that this is long overdue. We have \nseveral military installations in Kansas. We, unfortunately, have \npeople in our armed forces who are not well paid and not paid near \nenough for the job they are doing. It is past time for us to step \nforward and pay our men and women in uniform sufficiently for the work \nthey do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if you would be so kind as to \ntell me when I am down to 5 minutes remaining in my 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1259-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1259-S1262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are faced with a tremendous choice in \nAmerica, and that is whether we want to continue with policies that led \nto an 8-year recovery of our economy which was flat on its back and go \nwith those policies of fiscal responsibility and fairness and \ninvestment or go back to the days of what was called trickle-down \neconomics, where the very wealthy got the most, the rest of us got very \nlittle, the deficits soared, the debt soared, our country was in \ntrouble.\n  I represent, along with Senator Feinstein, the largest State in the \nNation. We have 34 million people. We had a recession that was second \nto none. It was the worst recession since the Great Depression. It took \nus a long time to come out of that. We had double-digit unemployment. \nWe had a terrible situation. But because we followed, in this \nGovernment, finally, a policy of fiscal restraint, we got back on our \nfeet and people have done very well. That is why this discussion about \nthe proposed tax cut by our new President, versus the tax cut that will \nbe supported by the Democrats, is such an important conversation.\n  Last week, President Bush submitted a tax cut plan to the Congress. \nIt was not detailed, but it was a plan. It was like a brochure in which \nhe laid out his vision of a tax cut. He outlined in it a $1.6 trillion \ntax cut plan. I have to say, and I hope people will listen, this tax \ncut is not compassionate and it is not conservative.\n  We remember when President Bush ran he ran as a compassionate \nconservative. So we get his very first proposal--actually it wasn't his \nfirst. His first one was to interfere with family planning throughout \nthe world and put a gag rule on international family planning groups \nthat help poor women get birth control. But for this purpose, it is \ncertainly his first fiscal policy. It is neither compassionate nor is \nit conservative. What do I mean by that?\n  First, it is not compassionate because it benefits the very wealthy \ninstead of the 99 percent, everyone else; that is, those in the middle \nclass, either lower or upper. It helps the very wealthy.\n  His plan is not conservative because it does not do the smart, \nconservative thing of being cautious with the projected surplus. I said \n``projected surplus.'' As Democratic leader Daschle has said, these \nprojections are like the weather forecasts: Don't count on them because \nthey change. They are not dependable. So the conservative thing to do \nis to have a rainy day fund, if you will.\n  Let me go into detail on why I say this plan is not compassionate. I \nhave told you it benefits the wealthy. Mr. President, 31 percent of all \nfamilies with children would receive nothing. If you are among the \nbottom 20 percent of Americans in terms of income, you get an average \ncut of $42. This is the way the tax cut of President Bush breaks down, \nand you tell me if it is compassionate. If you are in the lowest 20 \npercent of earners; that is, earning less than $13,600, you will get an \naverage tax cut of $42. Let me make that even worse. The income range \naverages at $8,600, so at $8,600 a year, you get back $42 in your \npocket on average.\n\n  The next quintile is $13,600 to $24,400. That is an average of \n$18,800 a year. They get an average tax cut of $187.\n  A person earning $31,000 gets $453 back. If you earn an average of \n$50,000, you get back an average of $876. Between $64,000 and $130,000, \nyou get back $1,400. Then, if you earn an average of $163,000, you get \n$2,200, approximately. But hold on to your chairs. Hold on to your \nchairs. If you earn $319,000 or more--the average income is $915,000--\nyou get back $46,000 every year.\n  So how can anyone say that is compassionate? A person earning $50,000\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\ngets $876 back. A person earning $319,000, average $915,000, gets back \n$46,000. I don't know how anybody could say that is compassionate.\n  We are going to show you another way to look at what people get back \nbecause I think it is a startling thing to see. If you are in that \nwealthiest bracket, here is a beautiful new kitchen. It really is quite \nnice. You can get this kitchen for $50,000. That is about what you \nwould get back if you earned that $900,000. It is beautiful. It has a \ngranite top, wood; it is quite lovely--a new kitchen. But what happens \nif you don't earn that? You could afford a pan. It is a nice pan. What \ndo we figure this costs? This is a $200 pan. It is a very nice pan. But \nthis person can get a kitchen; you can get a pan. This is not \ncompassion, and it is not fair and it is not right.\n  Let's show some other examples. We had the Lexus and the muffler, and \nI thought that was good, but I thought we needed some more. Here is a \nbeautiful swimming pool. We are told a swimming pool such as this costs \nabout $46,000.\n  With the Bush tax cut, when it phases in, if you are in that million-\ndollar range, you could put one of these babies in your house every \nyear, by the way. But if you are at that bottom level, the bottom 60 \npercent, average that out and that is under $39,000, you could get an \ninflatable bath tub.\n  How is that compassionate? How is that fair?\n  We have some more to show you. This looks pretty good. This is a \nyacht. According to our figures, $45,000 gets you this yacht. It looks \nvery good.\n  If you get $1 million a year, you are going to get that kind of tax \ncut. But if you are in the bottom 60 percent, you can get this little \nrowboat. I don't even know if you get the oars with it. This costs \n$195.\n  Do we have any more of those? I think you get the idea. But we are \ngoing to show it to you in a different way.\n  If you are in that top bracket of 1 percent, which is the one that \ngets 43 percent of the benefits of Bush's tax cut, you get 43 percent \nof the benefit. Every single day when this tax cut is phased in, you \nget $126. That is pretty good. If you are in the bottom percent with an \naverage of $30,000, you get 62 cents every day. This is another way to \nshow how compassionate this tax cut is.\n  I figure we will make it even a little more stark for you. If you get \nback $126 a day in a tax cut, you and your significant other can go to \na beautiful restaurant, have a little candlelight, order the best in \nthe house and a good bottle of California wine, I hope. It is pretty \nneat. If you are in that bottom 60 percent, it is tomato soup. There is \nnothing wrong with tomato soup. But it is not fair. This is not fair.\n  You say: Well, wait a minute. Didn't the President say the people at \nthe very top pay most of the taxes? Yes. They are getting back 43 \npercent in the tax cut of George Bush. But don't they pay most of the \ntaxes? Wrong. It is 21 percent of the taxes. The wealthy top 1 percent \npay 21 percent of taxes. They are getting 43 percent of the benefit of \nthe Bush tax plan.\n  I just cannot imagine how someone who runs as a compassionate person \ncan come up with a situation where you can get a can of tomato soup if \nyou earn $30,000, and take your significant other to the restaurant \nevery single night and eat out, not to mention the kitchen versus the \npan, and all of the rest. No. This is not compassionate, nor is it \nconservative.\n  We see that this is done for a reason. The stated reason is we are \ngoing to stimulate this economy.\n  As I understand it, there was a hearing today on that. There is a lot \nof dispute about whether or not a tax break to the wealthiest people \nactually stimulates the economy. It was tried back in the eighties. Do \nyou know what it stimulated? Deficits as far as the eye could see.\n  The next time I come out on the floor I will have some charts that \nshow what happened to the deficit when trickle-down economics was the \ncenterpiece in the 1980s. It was a failure, an abject failure. Do you \nknow what trickled down? Misery, recession, and we had terrible \nunemployment. We were paying so much interest on the debt that we \ndidn't have any money to invest in our people.\n  Yet we have a plan from someone who says he is compassionate and \nconservative that just will, in fact, set us up for failure. If I have \nanything to say about it in this Chamber, I want to talk about it. And \nthe Democrats are going to talk about it.\n  Do we want a tax cut? Yes. As Charlie Rangel on the other side said, \nwe want the biggest tax cut we can afford. Do we want to make sure the \npeople who need that tax cut the most get it? Yes. That is the kind of \nproposal we are going to have.\n\n  In this particular proposal, the compassionate President Bush does \nnot make the child care credit refundable. If you really are at the \nbottom of the barrel, you are earning maybe $20,000, or even less, you \ndon't pay any income taxes. You don't get any help with your child \ncare. If we are going to give a child care credit, which a lot of us \nwant to do, let's make it refundable so people can have that effect and \nease the burden.\n  I have an interesting commentary I would like to read.\n  Mr. President, this is a Republican named Kevin Phillips. He is very \nrespected. As far as I know, he has been a Republican all of his life. \nHe is the editor and publisher of the American Political Report. He is \na best selling author who worked for the Nixon administration. I want \nto stress that what I am about to read to you did not come from Barbara \nBoxer, a Democrat from California, but it is coming from Kevin \nPhillips, a Republican who worked for the Nixon administration. I think \nhe has some good credentials to criticize or comment on their Bush tax \ncut. Let's see if he thinks it is compassionate and conservative.\n  I am quoting every word directly from his editorial:\n\n       Although president less than a month, George W. Bush has \n     already achieved a historic first. He has become the first \n     president elected without carrying the popular vote, to \n     propose a far-reaching giant tax-cut bill on behalf of his \n     supporters and his big campaign contributors.\n\n  Parenthetically, let me note that Kevin Phillips is calling this Bush \ntax cut ``a far-reaching giant tax-cut bill on behalf of his supporters \nand his big campaign contributors.''\n\n       None of the three previous presidents elected without a \n     popular margin, John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and \n     Benjamin Harrison, had the temerity to try anything like this \n     kind of revenue reduction. It hasn't bothered Bush, though. \n     It hasn't stopped him that a majority of Americans cast their \n     vote for the two candidates, Al Gore and Ralph Nader, who \n     mocked his tax package. Indeed, both did more than oppose it. \n     They argued rightly that it was a massive giveaway, and that \n     30 to 40 percent of the dollar benefits went to the top 1 \n     percent of US taxpayers, to just one million families.\n\n  I am worried about the other 279 millions of families.\n  To quote Mr. Phillips further:\n\n       This is an illegitimate tax bill for two reasons. The first \n     is that a president selected in Bush's manner has no mandate \n     or standing to undertake such far-reaching legislation. The \n     second illegitimacy, which would tar this legislation even if \n     it was offered by a president with a full claim to office, is \n     the extent of revenue that it gives away--not at first, but \n     as its $1.6 trillion worth of provisions unfold over the next \n     decade. That's more than a trillion dollars that future \n     Congresses could spend on debt reduction, on payroll tax \n     reductions, Social Security, education or prescription drug \n     coverage.\n       Instead, these dollars will be spent by recipients in \n     considerable measure on $100,000 cars, $5 million homes and \n     $10 million financial speculations. Indeed, one of the \n     biggest individual tax giveaways is particularly ironic. Here \n     I'm talking about the Bush proposal to phase out the federal \n     inheritance tax, which in earlier days owed much of its \n     introduction to a pair of Republican presidents picked by \n     voters, not by a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision, whose names \n     were Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. To now end the \n     inheritance tax, as opposed to increasing its exemption to \n     $2 million or $3 million, threatens a cost not only in \n     billions of dollars but in the weakening of American \n     democracy.\n       In the wake of the American Revolution, George Washington, \n     Thomas Jefferson and many others agreed that U.S. law would \n     and did end the British legal provisions that allowed the \n     great landed estates to descend intact from generation to \n     generation. The new United States would not, they say, have \n     an aristocracy of inheritance.\n       The Bush tax bill raises exactly that prospect. It \n     threatens to perpetuate the $8-trillion wealth buildup of the \n     1990s through a new aristocracy of inheritance on a scale \n     that Washington and Jefferson could never have imagined. For \n     such a proposal to come from a President who owes his own \n     office to inheritance rather than popular election is the \n     crowning illegitimacy of them all.\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\n  This is tough stuff. This is tough language. This is tough criticism. \nIt is given by a Republican who cares about a number of things, being \nconservative and being fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope everyone will look at that Kevin Phillips commentary I just \nread into the Record. It is very instructive.\n  I have told my colleagues why this is not a compassionate tax cut. It \nignores 99 percent of the taxpayers, essentially, and gives almost \neverything, or way too much, to the very few of the wealthiest people \nin this country, the biggest break going to those who earn close to $1 \nmillion a year.\n  Let me tell my colleagues why it also is not compassionate. It is so \nlarge, it is so big, it is so huge, there will not be enough left over \nfor the things we need to do to protect Social Security so that these \nkids who are Senate pages now will have a Social Security system, to \nadd a prescription drug benefit to Medicare that everyone seems to \nwant. We don't have the money for that. To really invest in education, \nin early education, in after school, in school construction, and in \nsmaller class sizes, we are not going to have money for that, nor to \nclean up our environment, to fix up our parklands--we could go on--to \nhave a decent air traffic control system that is safe. It is not \ncompassionate because it takes from that.\n  What about it not being conservative? That is something we have to \ntalk about. The fact is, not only will we not have money for the \npriorities the American people want, but the plan leaves nothing to pay \ndown the debt over the long run. That is not conservative. Show me one \nfamily who does not think about a rainy day: Gee, honey, what if \nsomething goes wrong next year? Maybe we should save a few dollars. \nGee, I am a little worried, Tommy doesn't look so great. Maybe we need \nto spend a little of our savings on a second opinion and take him to a \ndoctor outside the HMO. Thank goodness we saved a little bit.\n  What about the families now across this country who are looking at \ntheir natural gas bills--the natural gas that heats their home? They \nare in shock at seeing a twofold increase, a threefold increase. Those \nfamilies are going to have to save from somewhere to pay those bills. \nWe have a 10-year boondoggle tax cut that leaves nothing for \nemergencies, that counts on forecasts that are going to be as crazy as \nthe weather forecasts.\n  I am hopeful that we can get some bipartisanship here. I find it \namazing that only a couple of my Republican friends have said this tax \ncut is too big. I am happy they have. But where is the chorus from \npeople on that side who say they are conservative? How can a true \nconservative go back to deficits as far as the eye can see? How can a \ntrue conservative go back to debt as far as the eye can see, to force \nour children to inherit a debt and have to pay a billion dollars a day \nor more to finance that debt? That is not conservative.\n\n  Let's go back to the drawing boards, I say to the President. Let's \ncome up with a compassionate and a conservative budget, one that rests \non a few foundations that I will talk about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When we talk about our budget and the tax cuts that are \npart of it, we should have a foundation to that budget, a foundation to \nthat tax cut. I think it should show three pillars. One is fairness. \nLet us be fair to the people. Let's make sure that as we look at the \nsize of the tax cuts, where they go, what we spend, what we invest in, \nthat we are fair.\n  The greatest thing we have in our country is a very strong middle \nclass. If we lose that middle class, we will be weak. Yet if we look at \nsome of the numbers, it appears that the gap between the rich and poor \nis in fact growing. That is not healthy for anyone. That is not good \nfor a society, if it gets too big. What we find out is we have people \nwho have lost hope, who may turn to drugs, alcohol. We know what \nhappens when things turn bad and they are not as productive as they can \nbe. They are not living up to their potential because maybe they cannot \neven afford college tuition. Fairness has to be what we are about.\n  Values: What do we value in this country? Do we not value a balanced \napproach, fairness to our people and investing in our people, making \nsure that our children are healthy; that they have a good, free, public \neducation system that is strong; that we create jobs; that we have job \ntraining; that we don't turn our backs on our senior citizens; that we \nhave safe streets? That is a value.\n  Right now we have senior citizens who are under a lot of stress. Not \nonly do they have to meet their bills for their prescription drugs--and \nthe good news here is, there are so many good prescription drugs today \nthat keep people moving and feeling good, but they are expensive. We \nneed a prescription drug benefit. That should be one of our values. \nStrengthening Social Security should be one of our values.\n  So it is fairness, as we look at a tax cut and spending. It is \nvalues, about our families and what they need and how we can help them \nand make life better for them. It is responsibility to the next \ngeneration of youngsters.\n  Yes, we can have a tax cut. It could be a large tax cut. It will fit \ninto the budget. It will be fair. It will have values. It will be \nresponsible. And we could be proud that we are keeping this country on \nthe right track and not turning off on some detour that says: Deficits \nagain, debt again, no money for our seniors, no more safe streets. That \nis not the right path to take.\n  A lot of people have said to the Democrats: Show us your plan. What \nis your plan? We are going to have a plan. It is going to be a good \nplan. It is going to be based on these values: Fairness, a sense of \nvalues, and responsibility--three pillars. It is going to be specific \nas soon as we see President Bush's budget numbers so we know what he is \ncutting to pay for this tax cut. We have to take a look at that. And we \nwill respond.\n  I am reaching my hand across to the other side of the aisle at this \npoint. I say to my colleagues, I heard you so many times on this floor: \nWe need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We need to pay \ndown the debt. These deficits are killing us.\n  We know, if we take a look at this projected surplus and we are \nconservative about it, we will do just fine. If we look at our values \nas a society and we are compassionate, we will be just fine.\n  I will close with a quote from Alan Greenspan who testified today. He \nsaid:\n\n       Given the euphoria surrounding the surpluses, it is not \n     difficult to imagine the hard-earned fiscal restraint \n     developed in recent years rapidly dissipating. We need to \n     resist those policies that could readily resurrect the \n     deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that \n     followed in their wake.\n\n  So today I have quoted two Republicans I admire--Alan Greenspan, \ntelling us to watch out, then be conservative on this tax cut; and \nKevin Phillips, who is warning us the Bush tax plan could lead to a \ncountry that isn't one we will be that proud of because it will \ntransfer so much of what we have to the very top of the income scale, \nforgetting about the great middle class.\n  So I am very hopeful we can come together as the Senate, as \ncompassionate people, as fiscally responsible people, and that we can \nfashion a budget that includes a tax cut we can afford, that includes \nspending priorities our families need, that thinks about our kids, that \ntakes the burden of debt off their shoulders. I think if we can do \nthat, we can add a tremendous amount to this debate.\n  I think President Bush has said he is interested in working with the \nSenate. I think he has reached out to us and said let's work together. \nWell, I am ready to do that. I tell him, if he would come up with a \nbudget that is compassionate and conservative, I will be there right at \nhis side. If he does not, I will work to make it so.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, could you tell me, is there a unanimous \nconsent pending concerning speaking order?\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to address \nthe issue of the moment, which is the tax cut. It is an issue many of \nus have followed closely for a long period of time. Some of us who have \nserved here for a period can recall it wasn't that long ago we were \ndealing with a terrible deficit on an annual basis that started \naccumulating a national debt in record numbers. What was the beginning \nof this national debt? Well, you have to go back to, I guess, President \nGeorge Washington when we started spending more than we had. Over the \nyears, the debt accumulated.\n  In the early 1980s, the national debt in America started \nskyrocketing. We started adding more deficits each year than at any \ntime in our history. In a short period of time--10 or 12 years--we \nended up finding the national debt of this country at the highest \nlevels in our history. It caused great alarm, as it should have, not \nonly in Congress, but across the Nation, and a concern among people as \nto whether or not this would have a negative impact on our economy. Of \ncourse, if the Government spends more money than it brings in, it has \nto borrow the money to spend and then pay interest on the money \nborrowed. We found ourselves, each year, paying more and more interest \non this old debt.\n  The mortgage on America was getting larger and larger and larger. \nToday, it is at $5.7 trillion. That is a frightening number which, when \nI came to Congress 20 years ago, would have been unthinkable. Yet it \nhas happened in that period of time. But the good news to be delivered \nis that we have finally turned the corner. For the first time over the \nlast several years, we have been generating annual surpluses. Our \neconomy is strong. More people are working and they are building homes \nand buying cars and buying appliances. Businesses are more profitable. \nIndividuals have done well with investments, and America is a more \nprosperous Nation. For the last 9 years, we have seen unparalleled \neconomic prosperity. But we have to recall, as we sit here in the year \n2001, that this is a recent turn of events. Only a few years ago, 4 \nyears ago, my Republican colleagues came to the floor asking to amend \nthe Constitution of the United States with a balanced budget amendment \nbecause they thought it was impossible for Congress to get the deficits \nunder control.\n  Well, the economy was helped. Congress did the right thing and the \neconomy has moved forward to the betterment of millions of American \nfamilies.\n  In this time of prosperity and peace comes a new President, George W. \nBush, who suggests we should take the surpluses we anticipate, not this \nyear but for the next 10 years, and spend them. On what would he spend \nthem? Tax cuts--tax cuts in a plan that he has proposed in this \ncampaign and has since proposed after the inauguration which would \nreduce the tax burden of many Americans--not all, but many Americans.\n  You will have to excuse me if I suggest that the President needs to \nreflect that it wasn't that long ago when his father was President that \nthings were a lot different in America, when we were really struggling \nwith an economy that was building up annual deficits and adding to the \nnational debt. It hasn't been that long ago. In fact, go back about 10 \nyears and you will see we appeared to finally be turning the corner.\n  I wonder if 10 years ago, as President George Bush, the first, \nfinished his term in office, he would have been able to predict what \nAmerica would look like for his son, President George W. Bush. I don't \nthink so. Even the best economists could not project 10 years ahead \nwhat the next President Bush would face.\n  In fact, as I said on the floor this morning, the best economists \nlooked at our deficit and suggested 5 years ago this year we would be \nrunning a $320 billion deficit. That was their best opinion based on \nthe information they had. They were wrong. We are running a $270 \nbillion surplus. They missed it by $590 billion, just 5 years ago.\n  The point I am trying to make is this: The best economists in \nAmerica, using the best information available, are often wrong. They \ncome before our committees on a regular basis and make prophesies and \npredictions that turn out to be just flat wrong. If you think there is \nsomething wrong with people talking to agencies of government, or if \nyou happen to be an investor yourself, you know their newsletters give \nadvice every day of every week, and a lot of it is just wrong. They \nguess wrong about next week, let alone next month or next year.\n\n  The reason I bring this up is that President George W. Bush's tax cut \nproposal is based on projections of what the American economy is going \nto look like, not next year but literally 10 years from now. The \nPresident wants to commit us to a tax cut that will literally spend \nsurpluses which his economists imagine will occur 9 or 10 years from \nnow. That, to me, is not sound public policy.\n  In addition, keep in mind that the national debt, the national \nmortgage I talked about earlier, is still there. It is $5.7 trillion. \nThat is a debt which most families in America do not get up in the \nmorning and worry about, nor should they, but it is there.\n  We as policymakers in Washington have a responsibility to deal with \nit in a sensible way. We have to remind the families across America \nthat though things are going very well in this country, we literally \ncollect $1 billion a day in taxes from families, individuals, and \nbusinesses across our country just to pay interest on old debt--$361 \nbillion a year collected in taxes by the Federal Government, taken from \nhard-working Americans, not to build a classroom, not to hire someone \nto be part of our national space program, not to make a stronger \nnational defense or to build a highway, but to pay interest to the bond \nholders of America's debt.\n  Excuse me if I do not make this point clear, but if you had a \nsurplus, wouldn't you want to retire the mortgage first before you \ndecided you were going to put another addition on the house or buy a \nnew house or have a big party? That is part of this debate. If we are \ngoing to deal with the surplus in America and the good times in \nAmerica, let us do it in a sensible and sane way, and let us dedicate \nourselves to paying down this national debt.\n  Many have said what a great gift to give to our children, a tax cut. \nThat is a great gift to give to a child, but isn't it a greater gift \nfor us to retire America's mortgage, to say that this national debt \nshould be taken care of? I think it is.\n  Secondly, if we do that, it is a sensible commitment of the surplus \non an annual basis. If we have the surplus, as we hope we will, we \nretire the debt with it. If we do not have it or go into a recession or \nbad times, then clearly we have not made a commitment with which we \ncannot live. But if we pass a tax cut, change our Tax Code, I can tell \nyou from having served in the House and Senate, it is extremely \ndifficult to change. Once it is in place, we can find ourselves a few \nyears from now facing new deficits, more red ink, and adding to the \nnational debt.\n  I do not want America to go down that road again. I believe we should \nsupport a policy which has a focus on paying down the national debt. I \nbelieve, even if we do that, we will still have resources over the next \n10 years for a tax cut.\n  I support a tax cut. I think it makes sense. The question is, how \nlarge a tax cut. When we take a look at the proposal from President \nBush of a $2.6 trillion tax cut, after we figure out how much of a \nsurplus we are likely to have over the next 10 years, we find that the \nPresident is committing 96 percent of this projected surplus to tax \ncuts.\n  One can argue as to whether there will be a surplus, but assuming for \na moment that every penny of the surplus which we imagine and prophesy \ntoday is there, the President wants to take 96 percent of it and put it \nin a tax cut.\n  That leaves 4 percent of the surplus--only 4 percent of this \nprojected surplus--for a variety of other things which Americans \nbelieve, and I believe, are critically important for our country. Let \nme go through them so there is no doubt that when we talk about \nspending in the future, we are talking\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\nabout investments that most American families understand should be part \nof our national budget.\n\n  I talked about debt reduction. Frankly, $100 billion over 10 years \ndedicated to debt reduction--long-term debt reduction--is not enough. \nWe need to put enough into it so that national debt is reduced as close \nto zero as humanly possible.\n  I thought both parties agreed on a prescription drug benefit for the \nelderly and disabled in this country, but President Bush's tax cut plan \nleaves us no resources to do that; in other words, helping people who \nare senior citizens who need prescription drugs to stay healthy, \nindependent, strong, and out of the hospitals and nursing homes, which \neverybody in the last campaign said we agree on, when it comes to the \nPresident's proposal for a tax cut, and find there is no money left for \nprescription drugs, and no money left for education.\n  The President has had some great speeches and great public \nappearances over the past several weeks talking about new Federal \ncommitments to education. I applaud those remarks. It is sound policy. \nIf America is going to be strong in the 21st century, our schools have \nto be strong, our kids have to have the best education to compete in a \nvery global, competitive economy.\n  Let's take a look at what the President leaves from the surplus for \neducation. Hardly anything. When it comes to education, frankly, he is \nshortchanging kids in the future to provide a tax cut today.\n  He is talking about increasing spending for defense. The national \nmissile defense is a multi-billion-dollar program to protect America, \nand yet the President does not leave money from the surplus for that \npurpose.\n  Expanding health care, with over 40 million uninsured Americans--it \nis a national disgrace that so many people do not have the security of \na good health insurance plan--the President leaves no money from this \nsurplus to even address that issue.\n  I had a conversation with my wife over the weekend. We were talking \nabout the problems and perils of people who are trying to move from job \nto job and wonder if they will have health insurance coverage. In a \nnation this prosperous, in a nation with such a rich tradition of \ncaring for others, how can we continue to ignore the millions of people \nwho have literally no health insurance protection whatsoever?\n  Heartbreaking stories are received in my office from my home State of \nIllinois and across the Nation. Those stories will go unheeded, that \nproblem will go unaddressed, if we devote 96 percent of any projected \nsurplus to a tax cut.\n  The same thing is true for agriculture. Over the last 3 years, we \nhave had agricultural crises across the Midwest and across the Nation. \nWe have responded to them. The President leaves no money in \nanticipation of those even occurring over the next 10 years. I pray \nthey will not, but I bet they will. And if they do occur, we had better \nhave the resources so that America's agriculture, its farmers, can \nsustain a bad year and live to plant again.\n  Medicare reform, Social Security reform, the President does not \nprovide for these. For him it is the tax cut, 96 percent of all the \nsurplus for the tax cut, to the exclusion, to the detriment, of many \nother things.\n  When we take a look at the surplus projections of the Congressional \nBudget Office, we also realize that we are not going to see most of it \nuntil 5 years out, if it is going to cost us $2.6 trillion for the \ntotal tax cut. Take a look at when the money starts coming in. It is \nnot until 2007 that we see most of this projected surplus appearing. We \nare talking 5 or 6 years from now. So all of the guesses about whether \nwe will have $2.6 trillion are grounded on an assumption of the state \nof America's economy in the years 2007-2011. The economists, as good as \nthey are, and the computers, as fast as they are, are not that good to \ntell us what this surplus is likely to be.\n  Sadly, because the President has proposed these massive tax cuts, \nwithout the surplus, again, we find that the President is going to be \nraiding Social Security and Medicare surpluses. He has even proposed \nthis privatization plan for Social Security. If he goes forward with \nthat, it is going to cost us another $1.3 trillion over the next 10 \nyears, taking more money from Social Security.\n  There is also a very serious question as to who will be receiving the \nPresident's projected tax cuts, and this is one about which I feel very \nstrongly. I believe we should have a tax cut. It should be fair to all \nAmericans. It should be part of a responsible and honest budget that \nbalances priorities across the spectrum for America's families, and, \nmost of all, it should be a tax cut that strengthens our economy, not \nweakens it. It should be a tax cut that will allow America's families \nto succeed.\n  Yet when we take a look at the kind of tax cuts proposed by President \nBush, we find, again, they are lopsided. The President has proposed if \nwe are to have this massive $2.6 trillion tax cut, 42.6 percent of this \ntax cut should go to people in the top 1 percent of wage earners. Those \nare people in America with incomes over $300,000 a year. If you are \nmaking over $300,000 a year, you are in the top 1 percent, you have an \naverage income of $900,000 a year, and your tax break by President \nBush's calculation is about $46,000 a year.\n  Sadly, for 80 percent of Americans who have incomes below $64,900, \nonly 29 percent of the tax cuts head in that direction. For those \nmaking less than $39,000 a year, the President's average tax cut \namounts to about $227. They have made this point over and over again: \nFor the top 1 percent, the highest wage earners in America, there is a \ntax cut large enough to buy a Lexus. For those in the lower 60 percent \nincome in America, there is a tax cut large enough to buy a muffler for \na car--probably not a muffler for a Lexus.\n  Some say, wait, the reason the rich get so much of the tax cut is \nthat they pay so much in taxes so they should receive more in terms of \nthe tax cut. Hold on. Look at this. The total Federal taxes paid by the \ntop 1 percent of wage earners in America account for 21 percent of all \nthe taxes collected. The President gives to that group, those making \nthe top 1 percent income, 43 percent of the tax cut, twice the tax cut \nfor their tax burden. Keep in mind, these are people who are making at \nleast $25,000 a month, if not $75,000 a month. The President says these \nare the ones most deserving of a tax cut.\n  I disagree. I know what is going on in my home State and I bet in the \nState of Kansas and many others. There are people now struggling with \nheating bills, paying hundreds of dollars a month for natural gas and \nother sources of heat for their homes. I see them, I run into them when \nI am back in Illinois. I get letters, e-mails, and telephone calls \nabout the problems they face. I think to myself, if you are going to \nhave a tax cut, for goodness' sake, remember those folks, remember the \npeople who are trying to struggle and pay these bills. They are the \nones who need a tax cut much more than someone who is earning $25,000 a \nmonth.\n  If you are making $39,000 a year and your heating bill goes up in \nyour home from $250 to $400 a month, you will notice it. If you were \nmaking $25,000 a month, would you even notice it? When we talk about \ntax cuts, let us focus on helping families who really deserve a helping \nhand.\n  Another area that comes to mind immediately is the question of paying \nfor a college education. The cost of a college education continues to \nskyrocket much faster than the pace of inflation. What we find is that \nmany middle-income families who want to give their sons and daughters \nthe very best cannot afford it. I think we ought to focus on a tax cut \nthat helps those families, that says, for example, you can deduct the \ncost of a college education up to, say, $10,000 or $12,000 a year from \nyour family's income tax. That makes sense to me. I think it encourages \nmore families to send their sons and daughters off to school.\n  It comes down to this: On this side of the aisle, on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, we believe, first, there should be a tax cut after \nwe admit our obligation to pay down the national debt in a responsible \nway. Whatever surplus we have, I believe, should first be dedicated to \npaying down that debt so our children do not have to carry that burden. \nThen the tax cut--if there is to be one, and I believe we can have \none--\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nshould be sensible, it should be one that is not dangerous or risky to \nthe economy, and it should focus the tax assistance to the families who \nneed it the most, those who are in the middle-income category, \nstruggling to pay the bills. The wealthiest of the wealthy will do just \nfine. We have to focus on families struggling to make ends meet and \nstruggling to realize that American dream.\n\n  In addition to that, we can never overlook our obligation with this \nsurplus and with each year's budget to Social Security and to Medicare, \nto health care, and to education. It would be a sad commentary if, \nafter all we have been through over the last 20 years, we found \nourselves once again entertaining the thoughts of a tax cut that this \nNation cannot afford, at a level which we cannot sustain, based on \npromises we cannot prove. That is exactly what we are doing now.\n  The President's tax cut is music to the ears of many voters, but \nthose who step back and take a look at the situation say to most \nMembers of Congress: Of course I want a tax cut. If you are going to \ngive a tax cut, give it to me and my family. We can figure out how to \nspend it. If you say to them, Is a tax cut more important to you than \neliminating and retiring our national debt once and for all, most \nAmericans say: No, put that debt behind us. If this is a chance to do \nit, get rid of America's national mortgage.\n  If you give citizens another choice: Would you prefer a tax cut for \nyour family or would you rather see us invest in education in America, \nto make sure that our schools are modern, the technology is up to date, \nand your kids are taught by the very best men and women available to \nteach in America, that is an easy choice for most families: Put it in \neducation first.\n  What about health care? Should we focus on a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare or a tax cut of $46,000 a year for the upper 1 \npercent of American wage earners? That is an easy call for most \nfamilies: Put it into a prescription drug benefit that is universal and \naffordable, under Medicare.\n  When you bring it down to the real choices we face, not just a tax \ncut or nothing, but a tax cut that is sensible and one that \naccommodates retiring the national debt, investing in America's \nfamilies, making sure they can continue to succeed, I think the choice \nis going to be clear.\n  We made a mistake in 1980 with the new President Reagan supply side \neconomics, the aptly named Laffer curve. All of the things suggested--\nif you just kept cutting taxes, America would prosper--didn't work. As \na consequence of that bad decision and the beginning of that Presidency \nwith all the euphoria of the Reagan years, we started a chain of \ndeficits which literally crippled America.\n  Finally, we are out from under that burden. On a bipartisan basis we \nshould learn a lesson. The lesson is this: The people of this country \nunderstand priorities very well. They understand the lyric call of a \ntax cut may make great music on the nightly news, but there is a lot \nmore to governing America than just being popular and saying popular \nthings.\n  You have to speak straight to the American people, be sensible with \nthem, tell them that the tax cut President Bush has proposed is, \nfrankly, not good for this country in the long term. We cannot base \nthis tax cut on projections of what America will look like 5, 6, 7, 8, \n9, 10 years from now, and be wrong, and find ourself back in deficits. \nWe cannot push a tax cut which inordinately rewards the wealthiest in \nthis country and ignores some 23 million Americans who receive \nliterally no tax benefit from the President's tax cut proposal. We \ncan't be backing a tax cut that is so large that it raids the Social \nSecurity trust fund and endangers the future of Medicare. And we \ncertainly cannot back a tax cut that ends up making certain that we in \nAmerica are spending more and more money to provide tax relief to the \nwealthiest among us and ignoring these important priorities such as \neducation, defense, health care coverage, Medicare reform, and Social \nSecurity reform.\n  Alan Greenspan is a man I respect very much. He came to the Hill last \nweek and made a statement about the future of this economy. He has made \nsome good predictions in the past. He suggested we should consider a \ntax cut. I think he is right. But he also said, if you read his \nstatement very carefully: Don't get carried away; do it in a sensible \nfashion; do it in a way that will keep America moving forward.\n  It is now up to this Chamber, and the 99 other men and women who will \ngather here and debate over the next several weeks, to be honest with \nthe American people. Perhaps not the most popular statements but the \nmost sensible statements will tell us that a tax cut is not the be all \nand end all, not the goal for everything in America. What is most \nimportant is that we create an economy where American families can \nsucceed. I think we have that opportunity. I hope we don't lose it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue \nthat I know is a critical concern for all of my constituents the \nsignificant rise in natural gas prices in Missouri. As we are all \naware, recent brutal temperatures and energy shortages have contributed \nto a dramatic rise in home heating bills.\n  In Missouri, regulators recently approved a 44 percent rate increase \nfor natural gas purchased from one Missouri utility. The increase, from \n$6.81 to $9.82 for a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, is expected to \ncontinue into the summer and has posed serious problems for consumers.\n  Imagine your gas bill doubling almost overnight. People tell me that \nthey are putting off needed purchases because they don't have any extra \nmoney--it's all going to pay the gas bill. I am especially worried \nabout the impact of high heating bills on our retirees who already have \ntight budgets.\n  My phone lines have been barraged with distraught constituents who \ndon't know how to make ends meet this winter. Just yesterday I heard \nfrom James Baldwin, an Army veteran and retired autoworker from \nIndependence, MO. Mr. Baldwin, father of four and grandfather of five, \nworked at the Ford Assembly Plant in Kansas City for almost 36 years. \nLike most constituents, Mr. Baldwin has tried to cut down on energy \nusage by dressing warmer and weatherproofing his home, as he is on a \nfixed income and doesn't have much room in his budget to accommodate \nlarge increases. Mr. Baldwin paid $99 for his gas bill in December \n1999. He was shocked, however, when, one year later, he received his \nbill and realized that his heating costs had almost tripled to $269. \nThe skyrocketing increases continued last month as well. He doesn't \nknow what he will do if increases of this size continue. Mr. Baldwin \ncalled my office to let me know about the hundreds of neighbors and \nautoworker retirees he hears from every day about this problem. He \nworries that many will fall through the cracks.\n  The Mid-America Assistance Coalition, an agency that coordinates \nemergency assistance for the Kansas City metro area, where Mr. Baldwin \nlives, has reported getting 100 to 200 calls per day. Many of the calls \nare from single moms, the elderly and the ``working poor,'' or those \nwho earn too much to qualify for standard energy assistance but cannot \nafford to pay their bills. According to the Coalition, this is the \nfirst time most of the callers have ever had to ask for assistance with \ntheir utility bills.\n  Another constituent, Mrs. Doris Hill from Albany, Missouri, recently \nwrote to share her plight. Mrs. Hill is a low-income, 83-year-old \nwidow. She wrote that she cannot afford to call even her own family \nlong-distance. She lives on $460 a month from Social Security and a \nsmall interest income from savings. She struggles month-to-month and \ncannot afford large increases in her utility bills.\n  This problem is not just limited to certain geographic areas or \nsegments of our population. One letter I received was from Jeremy Lynn, \na Boy Scout\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nfrom Sikeston in Southeast Missouri. Jeremy wrote to share his concern \nabout the effect that the high cost of gas is having on his family. \nJeremy states that his father and other farmers are struggling to cope \nwith fuel and natural gas price increases at a time when the prices \nthey are being paid for their crops are the lowest they have received \nin 14 years. He is worried that many farmers will be forced out of \nbusiness as a result.\n  These and many other stories I have heard over the last couple of \nmonths have touched me deeply. Unfortunately, these stories are much \ntoo common in Missouri.\n  We hear that the cause of these record increases are due to problems \nassociated with supply, demand, industry deregulation and, possibly, \nprice gouging. But this is a complicated issue, and I have yet to meet \nanyone who has an easy solution. The only thing that is clear right now \nis that we need to learn what has caused these sharp increases and \nquickly develop an appropriate response.\n  This is why I have decided to cosponsor Senator Boxer's amendment \nthat would require the National Academy of Sciences to submit a report \nto Congress within 60 days on the causes of the recent increases in the \nprice of natural gas, including whether the increases have been caused \nby problems with natural gas supply or by problems with the natural gas \ntransmission system. The study would identify federal or state policies \nthat may have contributed to the recent spike in prices and determine \nwhat federal action would be necessary to improve the reserve supply of \nnatural gas.\n  We don't know what the results of this study will be, but I am \nhopeful that they will help us to determine a course of action at the \nfederal level to relieve the current crisis that is harming so many \npeople in so many ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1265-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1265-S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF GALE NORTON\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I would like to briefly explain my recent \nvote to support the nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of \nInterior. At the outset, let me say that I did so with serious \nreservations. In fact, I find many of Ms. Norton's past positions, \nstatements and actions most troubling.\n  Gale Norton has built a successful career advocating for the mining, \ntimber, and oil industries. Her record in this respect has led many to \nquestion whether she can strike an appropriate balance between \nconservation and development. She has argued that several fundamental \nenvironmental laws are unconstitutional, including the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Surface Mining Act, two laws that the Secretary of \nInterior is tasked with enforcing.\n  She has advocated opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, \nin Alaska to oil drilling. This vital ecosystem supports hundreds of \nthousands of caribou, bears, wolves and oxen and 160 species of birds. \nIs it prudent to destroy this pristine land for what the U.S. \nGeological Survey estimates is a 6-month supply of oil? I believe not.\n  As Attorney General of Colorado, she was a proponent of the State's \nself-audit law, which allows polluting companies to escape fines if \nthey report their violations and make efforts to correct the problem. \nUnfortunately, the Summitville Mine in Colorado was not as vigilant as \nit should have been and continued to operate even though it still had \nserious environmental problems. Only when the mine leaked cyanide into \na local river did Ms. Norton's office step in. While she worked \nvigorously to clean up the damage and billed Summitville for the cost, \nit was the federal government who had to step in and prosecute the \noffenders. A Secretary of Interior must be vigilant, quick to respond \nto disaster, and pro-active in policy-making. I am troubled by Ms. \nNorton's slow response at Summitville and her inability to articulate \nat the confirmation hearing what she might do to reduce the chances of \na similar disaster.\n  Many have urged me and my Senate colleagues to reject this nomination \nand some have unfairly compared Ms. Norton to former Interior Secretary \nJames Watt. I am one of several current Members of the Senate who was \nhere in 1981 and I remember James Watt. During his confirmation \nhearing, he remained unyielding in his devotion to development and \nextractive industries. That intractable stand, coupled with his past \nstatements and actions led me to vote against James Watt for Secretary \nof Interior. In fact, I am one of six current members of the Senate who \ncast a vote in opposition to Mr. Watt's nomination.\n  I did not detect such a divisive tone during Gale Norton's \nconfirmation hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nI take some comfort from statements she made, under oath, specifically \nher intention to enforce the laws as written and interpreted by the \ncourts, including the Endangered Species Act. Ms. Norton gave \nassurances to several committee members that she would uphold the \ncurrent moratorium that exists on offshore oil and gas leases in \nCalifornia and Florida. She further stated that she was willing to work \nwith other States to achieve similar results regarding offshore oil and \ngas leases.\n  I was pleased to hear Gale Norton's strong support for our National \nParks, including eradicating maintenance backlogs. I look forward to \nworking with her and members of the Senate to ensure proper funding \nlevels in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations for this and other \nenvironmental protection efforts. Finally, I was pleased that Ms. \nNorton supports fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I \ntrust she will work with Congress to achieve that goal and to enact the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, a bill that had broad bipartisan and \nbicameral support in the 106th Congress. Land and Water Conservation \nfunds and the matching grant program have been very important to the \nability of Connecticut and other States to acquire land and enhance \nrecreation areas and parks.\n  I am mindful that some of Ms. Norton's testimony reflects a stark \nchange in policy beliefs. Do I think these newly stated positions make \nher an environmentalist? No, I do not. Do I think positions she has \ntaken in the past could pose harm to our public lands? Yes, I do. \nHowever, the entirety of Ms Norton's record, including testimony given \nat the hearing, demonstrates a sensitivity and an understanding of the \nrole of the Secretary of Interior.\n  The Secretary of Interior has enormous responsibility over our \nNation's public treasures. That person must be a responsible steward \nfor close to 500 million acres throughout the country, including Weir \nFarm National Historic Site and the McKinney National Wildlife Refuge \nin Connecticut. The Secretary must oversee and protect public lands, \nnot plunder them.\n  In many instances Gale Norton has demonstrated a willingness to \nadvocate Federal interests and be an honest and fair broker. As \nAssociate Solicitor for the Department of Interior, she upheld federal \ninterests including habitat restoration at the Como Lake restoration \nproject and the Endangered Species Act on behalf of the California \nCondor. While Colorado Attorney General, Ms. Norton ensured that the \nRocky Mountain Arsenal was sufficiently cleaned up and urged Congress \nto establish a wildlife refuge there.\n  I respect people's strong feelings regarding the nomination of Gale \nNorton, and in fact, I share some of their deeply rooted concerns. I \ndid not cast this vote lightly or without a heavy degree of concern. I \nam not ignorant of the fact that Gale Norton is a nominee who \nrepresents the views of our President or that any other nominee for \nInterior Secretary would share those views. Nor do I agree in sending a \nmessage by voting against a nominee. This is an individual, a Cabinet \nnominee, not a piece of legislation. The President is entitled to a \ndegree of deference in assembling his Cabinet, a bipartisan tradition \nthat most members follow.\n  I have spent a quarter century in Congress fighting for measures to \nprotect our air, drinking water, lakes, rivers and public lands. I \nprefer sending a message by enacting legislation that will strengthen \nour quality of life and opposing policy that would weaken or destroy \nour natural resources. Working together, Democrats and Republicans have \nenacted such lasting laws as the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species \nAct, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act.\n  Gale Norton is undertaking an enormous responsibility, but one that \naffords an opportunity to bring people together. She has given me and \nmy colleagues her word to uphold and enforce\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\nour laws. I trust she will remain true to her word, and I look forward \nto working with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1266-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL DAIRY FARMERS FAIRNESS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today and join my \ncolleague Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania to reintroduce \nlegislation to provide much needed assistance to our Nation's dairy \nproducers who continue to face the lowest milk prices in over two \ndecades.\n  Due to the failures of the Federal order reform process and the lack \nof a meaningful dairy price safety net, this legislation is an \nappropriate and necessary response to the ongoing regional milk pricing \ninequities and the dairy income crisis affecting all producers. In the \npast, the divisive and controversial dairy compact system has hindered \nCongress's efforts to achieve a fair and equitable national dairy \npolicy. I am pleased to join with Senator Santorum and reintroduce this \nlegislation to create a regionally equitable plan that will provide a \nsafety net for small and medium size producers regardless of location.\n  The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act of 2001 has two major goals: \n(1) To create a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all \nregions of the country; (2) provide stability for dairy producers in \nthe prices they receive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this \nlegislation creates a price safety net for farmers by providing \nsupplemental income payments when milk prices are low. A ``sliding-\nscale'' payment is made based upon the previous year's price for the \nnational average for Class III milk. In essence, the payment rate to \nfarmers is highest when the national Class III average is the lowest. \nTo participate in this program, a farmer must have produced milk for \ncommercial sale in the previous year. Payments under the program are \nalso capped for the first 26,000 hundredweight of production. Again, \nall dairy producers would be eligible to participate under this \nscenario.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill provided $667 \nmillion in emergency direct payments to dairy producers for losses \nincurred this year. While this action was absolutely necessary to \nrespond to the dairy market loss crisis, it is time that an on-going \nprogram providing supplemental income payments to farmers when milk \nprices decline be established.\n  This important legislation represents a bipartisan and national \napproach in providing predictability and price stability in this \notherwise volatile industry. Again, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSantorum in introducing the National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act and \nlook forward to working with him in passing this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1266-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO COAST GUARD HELICOPTER AIRCREW\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to \nfour great Americans--Lieutenant Commander Brian Moore, Lieutenant Troy \nBeshears, Petty Officer First Class Mike Bouch and Petty Officer First \nClass John Green, all serving in the United States Coast Guard.\n  Last July, these four extraordinary Guardsmen were conducting a night \nflight over the Gulf of Mexico when they heard a distress call from the \noil rig ``Ocean Crusader.'' Immediately flying to the rig, they arrived \nto find it engulfed in flames from a natural gas fire. Placing \nthemselves in imminent danger, they landed on the rig to rescue the \ncrew of 51. To expedite the rescue, Petty Officer Green left the \nhelicopter to coordinate rescue efforts while his crew mates began the \ndifficult task of ferrying the rig workers to another platform in \ngroups of four. As the helicopter began its first evacuation flight, \nPetty Officer Green began lowering rig workers to a rig supply boat in \ngroups of four using a crane and gondola.\n  After rescuing 12 workers, in three dangerous trips, the helicopter \ncrew was forced to leave the scene to refuel while Petty Officer Green \nremained behind to keep lowering people to the supply boat and safety. \nHe lowered 36 workers that way before another Coast Guard rescue \nhelicopter arrived on the scene and landed to pick up the four men who \nremained on the platform. When told the helicopter could only take \nthree safely, Petty Officer Green courageously volunteered to stay \nbehind. Alone on that platform as the helicopter took the workers to \nsafely, in the distance he could see his own aircraft returning when \nthe rig erupted with fire raging from the waterline hundreds of feet in \nthe air.\n  Committed to rescuing their crew mate, Lieutenant Commander Moore \ndecided to try and rescue Petty Officer Green. With Petty Officer \nBouchard hanging out of their aircraft trying to spot the landing \nplatform in the smoke, he flew the helicopter into the middle of the \ninferno the Ocean Crusader had become, setting down amidst the flames \nto pick up Petty Officer Green.\n  Today people say we live in a world without heroes, one in which \ncynicism and selfishness rule the day. I am proud to say this is not \nthe case in our United States Coast Guard. Guardsmen and Guardswomen \nlike Lieutenant Commander Moore, Lieutenant Beshears, Petty Officer \nBouch and Petty Officer Green put their lives on the line every day so \nthat others may live. In this case, 51 men owe their lives to these \nfour heroes who lived up to the Coast Guard's motto of ``Semper \nParatus--Always Prepared.'' On behalf of those 51 men, their families, \nthe state of Louisiana and Americans everywhere, I am proud to stand \nhere today and say ``Thank you--job well done!'' to these extraordinary \nheroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1266-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NORM BISHOP\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated member of the U.S. Forest Service as he concludes his 39-plus \nyears of service to his country. We are proud to have had this man \nserve on the Medora Ranger District in Dickinson, ND for the past 35 \nyears.\n  Mr. Norman G. Bishop deserves this honor. North Dakotans are grateful \nfor his contributions to the wise and sustainable use of our national \ngrasslands.\n  Norm Bishop's personal and professional career accomplishments are as \ndiverse as they are noteworthy. His loyal service and sacrifices for \nnearly four decades, working in the communities of western North \nDakota, are a testament to all who use and appreciate our public lands.\n  In 1962, Norm moved to Dickinson, ND where he was an Airman, First \nClass at the Dickinson Radar Installation. His very first night in \nDickinson, Norm met Karen Ridl, who he married a year later. After the \nAir Base closed in Dickinson, Norm began his Forest Service career.\n  During the oil crisis of the mid-1970s, Norm was instrumental in \ndeveloping what is now the largest, most productive oil and gas program \nin the entire National Forest System. In fact, Norm became the first \nperson in the entire Forest Service to be certified as an ``Oil and Gas \nResource Specialist.'' For more than 20 years, Norm worked tirelessly \nto insure that oil development on the grasslands was accomplished in a \nmanner that was sensitive to the needs of natural resources. My staff \nand I had the privilege of working with Norm Bishop on the Kinley \nPlateau/Bullion Butte Minerals exchange. Norm's professionalism and \nknowledge were instrumental in making that exchange a tremendous \nsuccess.\n  It is with great honor for me to present these credentials of Norm \nBishop to the Senate today. It is clear through all of his \naccomplishments that he has dedicated himself to furthering the \nbenefits we enjoy on public lands. All of his actions reflect a true \nleader with a sense of purpose, commitment, and conscience.\n  As Norm departs from public service I ask my colleagues to join me in \ndelivering an appreciative tribute from a grateful nation, and best \nwishes to he and Karen for a productive and rewarding \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1266-4", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1266-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PC CONNECTION\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A very high mark for this type of test.\n  Col. Thomas Deppe is the leader of Team Malmstrom. He was absolutely \ncorrect when he said, ``It takes a championship team to accomplish our \nmission across 23,500 square miles of flight line on a daily basis, and \nwe do it well.'' Indeed, they do it well. And they make Montanans and \nAmericans extremely proud.\n  In addition, Col. James Robinson, who is the Combat Capability \nAssessment team Chief, said that the CCA is one of the ``toughest tests \na wing will ever experience.'' He also said that in the three years he \nhas been administering the test, he has ``never seen results this \ngood.''\n  The 20th Air Force Combat Capability Assessment Team discovered what \nwe have known in Montana for years--that Malmstrom is ``excellent.'' \nMr. President, I can tell you from my recent visit to Malmstrom that \nthose folks are very proud of this accomplishment, as they should be. \nI'm proud of them, too.\n  That is why today I want to recognize them in this great Senate \nChamber.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe maximum capital gain tax rate for gains from property held for more \nthan 5 or 10 years; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould reduce the capital gains tax for properties held for more than \nfive or ten years. Such legislation is needed to help increase \ninvestment and to decrease inefficient economic behavior.\n  Under current law, people holding capital property are often \ndiscouraged from selling their property because of the large \nanticipated tax liability. Such a ``lock-in'' of assets is economically \nundesirable. Economists have estimated that perhaps as much as 7.5 \ntrillion dollars are ``locked-in'' the portfolios of American \ntaxpayers. By reducing the tax on certain long term capital gains, we \nwould decrease the ``lock-in'' effect and allow investors to liquidate \nor hold capital assets based on market factors rather than the tax \ncode.\n  Opponents to lower taxation of capital gains argue that reducing \ncapital gains tax rates would result in a revenue shortfall. Such an \nargument fails to recognize the effect that reduced taxes will have on \ninvestment behavior. By lowering taxes on capital gains, we will \nencourage, rather than discourage, capital investment. I believe the \nresulting situation would be a rise in the number of investment \ntransactions and in the amount of gain realized in each taxable year \nwhich will in turn lead to an increase in tax revenue. This trend has \nbeen well-documented as evidenced by the fact that every capital gains \ntax reduction in the last forty years has resulted in increased federal \nrevenue. In addition to increasing federal revenue, a cut in the \ncapital gain tax rates would benefit individual states, as a vast \nmajority of them also tax capital gains.\n  The current capital gains tax dissuades investment and economic \ngrowth.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965, to reauthorize and make improvements to that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with several of my \ncolleagues in offering a comprehensive education reform proposal that I \nbelieve can serve as the foundation for building a bipartisan \nlegislative consensus and ultimately a better future for our children. \nIt is a common-sense strategy that we believe can be the basis for a \ncommon ground solution--reinvest in our public schools, reinvent the \nway we administer them, and restore a sense of responsibility to the \nchildren we are supposed to be serving. Hence the title of our bill: \nthe Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and Responsibility Act, \nor the Three R's for short.\n  Our Senate New Democrat Coalition originally proposed this plan, \nwhich seeks to bring together the best ideas of both parties into a \nwhole new approach to federal education policy, during the debate last \nyear on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. We drew significant interest from Members on both sides of the \naisle, as well as from a number of voices in the education reform \ncommunity, but not enough to overcome the partisan tensions of an \nelection year.\n  We return to this cause now, at the start of this new session, with \nthe same sense of urgency and a new sense of optimism. Our urgency is \ndriven by the growing public concern about the state of public schools \nand the consequences of continued inactions. Our optimism is driven by \nthe growing policy consensus about how we in Washington can help our \npublic schools meet the\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\nnew challenges of this new age and help every student learn at a high \nlevel.\n  We feel strongly that we cannot afford to wait any longer to craft a \nserious national response to what is a serious national problem, not \nwhen millions of our children are being denied the education they \ndeserve and the New Economy demands. International math and science \ntests indicate that our students, even the best of the best, are \nstruggling to keep pace with children in other nations. In fact, the \nmost advanced American 12th-graders ranked 15 out of 16 on the advanced \nmath test and 16th out of 16th on the physics test.\n  Far more troubling, millions of poor children, particularly children \nof color, are failing to learn even the most basic of skills, which is \nto say we are failing them. Thirty five years after we passed the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) specifically to aid \ndisadvantaged students, black and Hispanic 12th graders are reading and \ndoing math on average at the same level of white 8th-graders.\n  This pernicious achievement gap cannot be allowed to persist in this \nland of opportunity. It is not only a matter of equity, but of \neconomics as well. We simply cannot compete in a knowledge-based global \nmarketplace if so much of our future labor force doesn't know how to \nread, write, and reason. As one report states, ``Students are being \nunconsciously eliminated from the candidate pool of Information \nTechnology, IT, workers by the knowledge and attitudes they acquire in \ntheir K-12 years. Many students do not learn the basic skills of \nreasoning, mathematics, and communication that provide the foundation \nfor higher education or entry-level jobs in IT work.''\n\n  We also have to acknowledge that we have not done a very good job in \nrecent years in providing every child with a well-qualified teacher, \nwhich goes a long way toward explaining why this achievement gap \npersists. Specifically, we are failing to deliver teachers to the \nclassroom who truly know their subject matter. One national survey \nfound that one-fourth of all secondary school teachers did not major in \ntheir core area of instruction. What is particularly troubling is that \nwe are failing those children who need our help the most--in the school \ndistricts with the highest concentration of minorities, students have \nless than a 50 percent chance of getting a math or science teacher who \nhas a license or a degree in their field.\n  We are far from alone in feeling strongly about this problem, Mr. \nPresident, and we are encouraged by the bold and innovative reforms \nthat many states and local districts are pursuing to raise standards \nand expectations and improve the quality of education our children are \nreceiving. They are helping to show us what works and how we in \nWashington can help.\n  This is not something we talk enough about, in large part because we \ndo have some serious problems with our schools, but there are in fact \nplenty of positive developments to highlight in public education today. \nOver the past year, I have visited a broad range of schools and \nprograms in Connecticut and around the country, and I can tell you that \nthere is much happening in our public schools that we can be heartened \nby, proud of, and learn from.\n  There is the exemplary Kennelly School in Hartford, Connecticut, \nwhich has to contend with a high-poverty, high-mobility student \npopulation, but through intervention programs has had real success \nimproving the reading, writing and math skills of many of its students. \nIn addition, there is the Side by Side Charter School in Norwalk, one \nof 17 charter schools in Connecticut, which has created an exemplary \nmultiracial program in response to the challenge of Sheff v. O'Neill to \ndiminish racial isolation. Side by Side is experimenting with a \ndifferent approach to classroom assignments, having students stay with \nteachers for two consecutive years to take advantage of the \nrelationships that develop, and by all indications it is working quite \nwell for those kids.\n  And there is the nationally-recognized BEST program, which, building \non previous efforts in Connecticut to raise teacher skills and \nsalaries, is now targeting additional state aid, training, and \nmentoring support to help local districts nurture new teachers and \nprepare them to excel. The result is that Connecticut's blueprint is \ntouted by some, including the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future, as a national model for others to follow.\n  A number of other states, led by Texas and North Carolina, are moving \nin this same direction--refocusing their education systems not on \nprocess but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations \nbut on results. More and more of them are in fact adopting a simple \nformula--investing in reform, and insisting on results. They are \nsetting high standards, dedicating more resources to help schools meet \nthose new demands, providing more flexibility to experiment with \ninnovative practices, and holding schools responsible for improving \ntheir performance.\n  We as New Democrats believe the best thing we can do to encourage and \naccelerate this movement, and spur every state to pursue these bold \nreforms, is to adapt this new approach to the federal level--which is \nto say, to lead by following. And that is just what our Three R's \nproposal aims to do. We want to redefine the federal role in education \nand refocus it on helping states and local districts raise academic \nachievement, putting the priority for federal programs on performance \ninstead of process, and on delivering results instead of developing \nrules.\n  In particular, our plan calls on states and local districts to enter \ninto a new compact with the federal government to work together to \nstrengthen standards and improve educational opportunities, \nparticularly for America's poorest children. It would provide states \nand local educators with significantly more federal funding and \nsignificantly more flexibility in targeting those dollars to meet their \nspecific needs. In exchange, it would demand real accountability, and \nfor the first time impose consequences on schools that continually fail \nto show progress.\n  Part of changing our focus means narrowing our focus. We agree with \nmany critics of the status quo that the current maze of federal \neducation programs is too unwieldy, too bureaucratic, and ultimately \ntoo diffuse. That is why we eliminate dozens of federally \nmicrotargeted, micromanaged programs that are redundant or incidental \nto our core mission of raising academic achievement. But we also \nbelieve that we have a great national interest in promoting broad \nnational educational goals, chief among them delivering on the promise \nof equal opportunity. It is not only foolish but irresponsible to hand \nout federal dollars with no questions asked and no thought of national \npriorities. That is why we carve out separate titles in those areas \nthat we think are critical to helping every child learn at a high \nlevel.\n\n  The first of our restructured titles would strengthen our \nlongstanding commitment to providing additional aid to disadvantaged \nchildren through the Title I program. It would increase funding by 50 \npercent, up to $13 billion annually, and, perhaps more importantly, \ntarget those new funds to schools with the highest concentrations of \npoverty. The second would combine various teacher training and \nprofessional development programs into a single teacher quality grant, \nincrease funding to #2 billion annually, and challenge each state to \npursue the kind of bold, performance-based reforms that my own state of \nConnecticut has undertaken with great success.\n  The third title would reform the Federal bilingual education program \nand hopefully defuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making \nabsolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant \nchildren learn and master English and ultimately to meet the same high \nacademic standards as other students. First, recognizing that may \nlimited English proficient students are not being served at all today, \nwe call for dramatically increasing our investment in English \nacquisition programs, doubling funding to $1 billion a year, which \nwould for the first time be distributed to states and local districts \nthrough a reliable formula, based on their LEP student population. As a \nresult, school districts serving large LEP and high poverty student \npopulations would be guaranteed federal funding, and would not be \npenalized because of their inability to hire savvy proposal writers for \ncompetitive grants.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  The fourth title would respond to the public demands for greater \nchoice within the public school framework, by providing additional \nresources for charter school start-ups and new incentives for expanding \nlocal, intradistrict choice programs. And the fifth would radically \nrestructure the remaining ESEA programs and provide local districts \nbroad flexibility to address their specific needs. We consolidate more \nthan 20 different programs into a single High Performance Initiatives \ntitle, with a focus on supporting and encouraging bold new ideas, \nexpanding access to summer school and after school programs, improving \nschool safety, and building technological literacy. We increase overall \nfunding by more than $200 million to $3.5 billion, and distribute this \naid through a formula that targets more resources to the highest \npoverty areas.\n  The boldest change we are proposing is to create a new accountability \ntitle. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, \non how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if \nany attention to outcomes, on how schools ultimately perform in \neducating children. This bill would reverse that imbalance by linking \nFederal funding to the progress states and local districts make in \nraising academic achievement. It would call on state and local leaders \nto set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous assessments \nfor measuring how each district is faring in meeting those goals. In \nturn, states that exceed those goals would be rewarded with additional \nfunds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would be \nsanctioned. In other words, for the first time, there would be \nconsequences for poor performance.\n  In considering how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run \ninto understandable concerns about whether you can penalize failing \nschools without also penalizing children. The truth is that we are \npunishing many children right now, especially the most vulnerable of \nthem, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are \naccountable to no one, a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. \nWe believe there must be consequences for failure, but we make a \nconcerted effort through this bill to minimize the potential negative \nimpact on students. It requires states to set annual performance-based \ngoals and put in place a monitoring system for gauging how local \ndistricts are progressing, and also provides additional resources for \nstates to help school districts identify and improve low-performing \nschools. If after three years a state fails to meet its goals, the \nstate would be penalized by cutting its administrative funding by 50 \npercent. Only after four years of under performance would dollars \ntargeted for the classroom be put in jeopardy. At that point, \nprotecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad schools becomes more \nlike punishing them.\n  Although money alone won't improve the quality of our public \neducation, we must invest significantly more resources if we expect to \nclose the achievement gap and truly ``leave no child behind.'' That is \nwhy we would boost ESEA funding by $35 billion over the next five \nyears. But we also believe that the impact of this funding will be \nseverely diluted if it is not better targeted to the worst-performing \nschools and if it is not coupled with a rigorous and vigorous demand \nfor accountability. That is why we narrow the federal focus to a few \nselect national priorities, all of them tied to raising student \nachievement, and match our investment in reform with an insistence on \nresults.\n  Judging by what President Bush has said to date, along with \nCongressional leaders, we believe that there is a lot of room for \ncollaboration and a lot of reason to be hopeful that we can reach \nbipartisan agreement on a bold, progressive, comprehensive education \nreform bill this year. We still have some serious differences with the \nPresident--not just on vouchers, but on the targeting of federal \ndollars to the nation's poorest communities, which is critical to our \nhopes of closing the achievement gap. But we do share a commitment to \nclosing that gap as a national goal, just as we share a commitment to \nstrengthening accountability, broadening flexibility for local schools, \nspurring innovation, and promoting public school choice. And as some of \nour colleagues have noted, the framework of our plan shares much in \ncommon with the reform blueprint President Bush recently unveiled.\n  Our bottom line is principles, not programs. We believe we have some \ngood new ideas to realize some great old ideals, chief among them the \npromise of equal opportunity. But we don't pretend to have a monopoly \non them and we are eager to work with both our fellow Democrats and \nRepublicans to find the right balance. There is no one roadmap to \nreform. But we believe the third way we have charted with our Three R's \nplan is a good place to start--and hopefully end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DECLARATION OF PRIORITIES.\n\n       Congress declares that the national educational priorities \n     are to--\n       (1) introduce real accountability by making public \n     elementary school and secondary school education funding \n     performance-based rather than a guaranteed source of revenue \n     for States and local educational agencies;\n       (2) require State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies to establish high student performance \n     objectives, and provide the State educational agencies and \n     local educational agencies with flexibility in using Federal \n     resources to ensure that the performance objectives are met;\n       (3) concentrate Federal funding on a small number of \n     central education goals, including providing compensatory \n     education for disadvantaged children and youth, improving \n     teacher quality and providing professional development, \n     providing programs for limited English proficient students, \n     public school choice programs, and innovative educational \n     programs, and promoting student safety and the incorporation \n     of educational technology into education;\n       (4) concentrate Federal education funding on impoverished \n     areas where elementary schools and secondary schools are most \n     likely to be in distress;\n       (5) sanction State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies that consistently fail to meet \n     established benchmarks; and\n       (6) reward State educational agencies, local educational \n     agencies, and elementary schools and secondary schools that \n     demonstrate high performance.\n\n                      TITLE I--STUDENT PERFORMANCE\n\n     SEC. 101. HEADING.\n\n       The heading for title I (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n\n                   ``TITLE I--STUDENT PERFORMANCE''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n       Section 1001 (20 U.S.C. 6301) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1001. FINDINGS, POLICY AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Despite more than 3 decades of Federal assistance, a \n     sizable achievement gap remains between economically \n     disadvantaged and affluent students.\n       ``(2) The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 was an important step in \n     focusing the Nation's priorities on closing the achievement \n     gap between economically disadvantaged and affluent students \n     in the United States. The Federal Government must continue to \n     build on the improvements made in 1994 by holding States and \n     local educational agencies accountable for student \n     achievement.\n       ``(3) States can help close the achievement gap by \n     developing challenging curriculum content and student \n     performance standards so that all elementary school and \n     secondary school students perform at an advanced level. \n     States should implement rigorous and comprehensive student \n     performance assessments, such as the National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress, so as to measure fully the progress of \n     the Nation's students.\n       ``(4) In order to ensure that no child is left behind in \n     the new economy, the Federal Government must better target \n     Federal resources on those children who are most at risk for \n     falling behind academically.\n       ``(5) Funds made available under this title (referred to in \n     this section as `title I funds') have been targeted on high-\n     poverty areas, but not to the degree the funds should be \n     targeted on those areas, as demonstrated by the following:\n       ``(A) Although 95 percent of schools with poverty levels of \n     75 percent to 100 percent receive title I funds, 20 percent \n     of schools with poverty levels of 50 to 74 percent do not \n     receive any title I funds.\n       ``(B) Only 64 percent of schools with poverty levels of 35 \n     percent to 49 percent receive title I funds.\n       ``(6) Title I funding should be significantly increased and \n     more effectively targeted to ensure that all economically \n     disadvantaged students have an opportunity to excel \n     academically.\n       ``(7) The Federal Government should provide greater \n     decisionmaking authority and flexibility to schools and \n     teachers in exchange for requiring the schools and teachers \n     to assume greater responsibility for student performance. \n     Federal, State, and local efforts should be focused on \n     raising the academic achievement of all students. The \n     Nation's children deserve nothing less than a policy that \n     holds accountable those responsible for shaping the \n     children's future and the Nation's future.\n       ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     ensure that all students receive a high-quality education by \n     holding States, local educational agencies, and elementary \n     schools and secondary schools accountable for increased \n     student academic performance results, and by facilitating \n     improved classroom instruction.\n       ``(c) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       ``(1) To eliminate the existing 2-tiered educational \n     system, which sets lower academic expectations for \n     economically disadvantaged students than for affluent \n     students.\n       ``(2) To require all States to have challenging content and \n     student performance standards and assessment measures in \n     place.\n       ``(3) To require all States to ensure adequate yearly \n     progress for all students by establishing annual, numerical \n     performance objectives.\n       ``(4) To ensure that all students receiving services under \n     this title receive educational instruction from a fully \n     qualified teacher.\n       ``(5) To support State educational agencies and local \n     educational agencies in identifying, assisting, and \n     correcting low-performing schools.\n       ``(6) To increase Federal funding for programs carried out \n     under part A for economically disadvantaged students in \n     return for increased academic performance of all students.\n       ``(7) To target Federal funding to local educational \n     agencies serving the highest percentages of economically \n     disadvantaged students.''.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1)(A) The educators most familiar with schools, \n     including school superintendents, principals, teachers, and \n     school support personnel, have critical roles in knowing what \n     students need and how best to meet the educational needs of \n     students.\n       ``(B) Local educational agencies should therefore have \n     primary responsibility for deciding how to use funds.\n       ``(2)(A) Since the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 was first authorized in 1965, the Federal Government \n     has created numerous grant programs, each of which was \n     created to address 1 among the myriad challenges and problems \n     facing education.\n       ``(B) Only a few of the Federal grant programs established \n     before the date of enactment of the Public Education \n     Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act can be tied \n     to significant quantitative results.\n       ``(C) Because Federal education dollars are distributed \n     through a patchwork of programs, with each program having a \n     set of requirements and restrictions, local educational \n     agencies and schools have found it difficult to leverage \n     funds for maximum impact.\n       ``(D) In many cases, Federal education dollars distributed \n     through competitive grant programs are too diffused to \n     provide a true impact at the school level.\n       ``(E) As a result of the Federal elementary and secondary \n     education policies in place before the date of enactment of \n     the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and \n     Responsibility Act, the focus of Federal, State, and local \n     educational agencies has been diverted from comprehensive \n     student achievement to administrative compliance.\n       ``(3)(A) Every elementary school and secondary school \n     should provide a drug- and violence-free learning \n     environment.\n       ``(B) The widespread illegal use of alcohol and drugs among \n     the Nation's secondary school students, and increasingly \n     among elementary school students, constitutes a grave threat \n     to students' physical and mental well-being, and \n     significantly impedes the learning process.\n       ``(C) Drug and violence prevention programs are essential \n     components of a comprehensive strategy to promote school \n     safety, youth development, and positive school outcomes, and \n     reduce the demand for and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco, \n     and drugs throughout the Nation.\n       ``(D) Schools, local organizations, parents, students, and \n     communities throughout the Nation have a special \n     responsibility to work together to combat the continuing \n     epidemic of violence and illegal drug use, and should measure \n     the success of programs established to address this epidemic \n     against clearly defined goals and objectives.\n       ``(E) Drug and violence prevention programs are most \n     effective when implemented within a research-based, drug and \n     violence prevention framework of

emphasizing the utilization of the technologies \n     in the classroom and the training and infrastructure required \n     efficiently to support the technologies, the full potential \n     of educational technology has rarely been realized.\n       ``(C) The effective use of technology in education has been \n     inhibited by the inability of many State educational agencies \n     and

We stand here today in recognition of the fact that the \nsolutions of the 1960s are inadequate to meet the challenges of the \n21st Century and the years beyond. We stand here today to say the \nstatus quo is not good enough; that we must do better. Congress has an \nhistoric opportunity and responsibility to enact the most sweeping \neducation reform since the 1960s to ensure that no child is left \nbehind. The consequences of any of our children not receiving a quality \neducation are far greater than ever before. For the first time in our \nnation's history, the growing gap between the educational ``haves'' and \n``have nots'' threatens to create a permanent underclass. If we do not \naddress these shortcomings, the knowledge and information gap will lock \nmany of our citizens out of the marketplace and prevent them from \naccessing opportunity in the New Economy.\n  Our proposal breaks with the sterile orthodoxy of the past, in which \ntoo often the left said just spending more money was the answer to the \nproblems facing our schools, and the right said the public schools \ncould not be fixed and, therefore, should be abandoned. Instead, we \npropose a consensus, a synthesis of ideas reflecting the best of both \nthe right and the left to improve the quality of public education \nacross our country. We propose a substantial increase in our nation's \ninvestment in education, because we recognize that we can't expect our \nschools, particularly our poorer schools, to get the job done if we \ndon't give them the tools to get the job done. We propose an increase \nof $35 billion over five years in Federal education spending. But we do \nmore than just throw money at the problem, because we know that \ntaxpayers, parents, and most of all our children, have a right to \nexpect more from us. Instead, we focus on accountability. In return for \nincreased investment, we insist upon results. We focus on outcomes, not \ninputs. No longer will we define success only in terms of how much \nmoney is spent, but instead of how much our children learn. Can they \nread and write, add and subtract, know basic science? No longer will we \ndefine accountability in terms of ordering local school districts to \nspend dollars in particular ways, but instead in terms of whether our \nchildren are getting the skills they need to make a successful life for \nthemselves. This is a significant rethinking from the ideas\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nthat have prevailed here in Washington for several decades.\n  Our proposal also provides a substantial amount of flexibility. We \ndon't agree with the block grants our colleagues on the far right \nadvocate for which would allow money to be diverted from public \neducation or to allow dollars to be diverted from focusing on our \npoorest students. But we do allow for local principals and \nsuperintendents to have a much greater say in determining how best to \nspend those dollars, because we believe that those at the local level \nwho labor in the classrooms and the schools every day, can make those \ndecisions far better than those of us who now work on the banks of the \nPotomac.\n  Finally, our proposal harnesses market forces and embeds them in the \npublic education system to encourage innovation, improvement, and \nincreased accountability without abandoning the public schools and \nthose children who would not do well in a market-based system by going \ndown the path of vouchers. Instead, we support the expansion of public \nschool choice, magnet schools, and charter schools. We believe in the \nenduring American principle of a quality public education for all of \nour nation's children--not just the lucky few under a market based \nsystem.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson who said that a society that expects to be \nboth ignorant and free is expecting something that never has been and \nnever shall be. So we put forward this proposal because we know that \nthe cause of improving public education is critically important to our \neconomy, critically important to the kind of society that we will be, \nand essential to the vibrancy of our democracy itself.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am proud to again be an original cosponsor \nof The Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility \nAct of 2000--better known as ``Three R's.'' I have been pleased to work \nwith the education community in Wisconsin, as well as Senators \nLieberman, Bayh, and our other cosponsors, on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Perhaps this year, the three ``R's'' should stand for: ``right, \nright, and right.'' It is the right time to keep promises we all made \nduring the election to make bipartisan education reform our first order \nof business. It is the right policy to give schools more flexibility \nbut ask for more accountability. And it is the right thing to do to \nmake our students a number one federal priority.\n  We have come a long way since we started this effort more than a year \nago. Unfortunately, in the 106th Congress, we were unable to rise above \nthe usual partisan sniping and have a serious education debate. But \nlast year's fighting has given way to this year's opportunity to do \nwhat's right by our children. If we learned anything from the last \nelection, it is that the American people want real education reform--\nand they want to see results.\n  None of us would deny that we have made great strides in recent years \ntoward a better public education system. Nearly all States now have \nacademic standards in place. More students are taking more challenging \ncourses. Test scores have risen slightly. Dropout rates have decreased.\n  In Wisconsin, educators have worked hard to help students achieve. \nStudents are showing continued improvement on State tests in nearly \nevery subject, particularly in science and math and across all groups, \nincluding African Americans, the disabled, and the economically \ndisadvantaged.\n  But despite our best efforts, our public schools still face huge \nchallenges. Too many students do not have the skills they need to \ncompete in the 21st century economy. And the achievement gap between \npoor and more affluent students remains alarmingly wide.\n  Mr. President, in the past some have called for reducing or \neliminating the Federal role in education. I think that would be a \nmistake. As a nation, it is in all of our best interests to make sure \nour children receive the best education possible. It is vital to their \nfuture success, and to the success of our country.\n  But addressing problems in education is going to take more than \ncosmetic reform. We risk our children's future by defending the tired \nprograms of the past. We need to let go of the partisan bickering and \nfocus on what the American people are focused on: Results.\n  Results are what the 3 R's bill is about. We make raising student \nachievement for all students--and eliminating the achievement gap \nbetween low-income and more affluent students--our top priorities. To \naccomplish this, our bill centers around three principles.\n  First, we believe that we must make a strong investment in education, \nand we need to target those funds to the neediest schools and students. \nSince Federal funds make up only 7 percent of all money spent on \neducation, it is essential that we target those funds where they are \nneeded the most.\n  Second, we believe that States and local school districts are in the \nbest position to know what their educational needs are. The 3 R's give \neducators more flexibility to decide how they will use Federal dollars \nto meet those needs.\n  Finally--and I believe this is the key component of our approach--we \nbelieve that in exchange for this increased flexibility, there must be \nincreased accountability.\n  For too long, we have seen a steady stream of Federal dollars flow to \nStates and school districts--regardless of how well they educated their \nstudents. This has to stop. We need to reward schools that do a good \njob. We need to provide help to schools that are struggling to do a \nbetter job. But we need to stop subsidizing failure. Our highest \npriority must be educating children--not protecting broken systems.\n  I am pleased that there is an emerging consensus around these core \nprinciples of 3 R's. Already, President Bush has expressed interest in \npursuing many of these same ideas that our group laid out over a year \nago, and I look forward to joining with both parties to get this done.\n  The Three R's bill is a strong starting point for this debate. This \nbill--by using the concepts of increased funding, targeting, \nflexibility--and most importantly, accountability--demonstrates how we \ncan work with our State and local partners to make sure every child \nreceives the highest quality education--and a chance to live a \nsuccessful, productive life. I look forward to working with both sides \nof the aisle as Congress debates education reform in the coming months.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and others of the Senate New Democrats \ntoday in introducing the Three R's bill: the Public Education \nReinvestment, Reinvention and Responsibility Act of 2001.\n  This legislation is important for several reasons:\n  It re-establishes the education of our children, all our children, as \na national priority.\n  It is a sterling example of ``finding the center.'' We take the best \nof many ideas, and forge what we hope will be common ground.\n  It is ``unfinished business'' from last year. The 106th Congress had \nthe responsibility to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nAuthorization Act. We debated for a while, gridlock set in, and all \nprogress ended for the year. By coming forward early in the 107th \nCongress with a centrist proposal--we hope for a different outcome in \n2001.\n  The concepts in the Three R's are simple, but resonant with teachers, \nparents and administrators:\n  More money is needed. State and local governments have the primary \nresponsibility toward funding K-12 education, but the federal \ngovernment can do more. We offer $35 billion more over the next five \nyears.\n  Accountability assures that we are getting the most effective use of \nfederal dollars in education. There is strong accountability here. \nStruggling schools are offered extra help, but then they must show \nresults in student progress. Schools that exceed goals are rewarded.\n  Flexibility is essential so that each local school district is able \nto meet specific local needs and challenges. The three R's ensures that \nfederal priorities in education receive a focus, but allow state and \nlocal decision makers to implement what they most need.\n  In the first week of February last year, I hosted a roundtable \ndiscussion of parents, teachers and administrators in Tampa, Florida. \nAll of them asked for the same thing: more resources more flexibility, \nand a focus on results--not procedure. simply put, that's what we try \nto do here.\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\n  My discussion in Tampa also highlighted the urgent need for the \nfederal government's commitment to education.\n  The latest National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, scores \nshow:\n  Only 17 percent of 8th graders in Florida score at or above the \nproficient level in mathematics.\n  Only 3 percent of African American 8th graders score at or above \nproficient standards in math.\n  Only 23 percent of 4th graders are at or above proficient standards \nin reading.\n  18 percent of the classes in Florida are taught by instructors who \nlack a college major in the subject matter that they teach.\n  The ``achievement gap'' is real. White students in Florida on average \nscore 1001 points on the SAT. African American students, on average, \nscore 856 points. Hispanic students score a 957.\n  We need to do more to give all Florida's students, and all of our \nnation's students, the best education possible.\n  The introduction of this legislation is the first step toward finding \nthe common ground and making the changes that are needed. I look \nforward to working with each of my colleagues as we focus on this in \nthe 107th Congress.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues to \nintroduce an innovative education reform proposal, the Public Education \nReinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act, or Three R's for \nshort. Three R's aims to help states and districts raise the academic \nachievement of all children by increasing the federal government's \ninvestment in public education, by highly-targeting those resources \ntoward to most economically disadvantaged children, by increasing the \nflexibility with which states and districts use federal dollars, and by \nholding schools accountable for results.\n  I believe that it is past time to break the partisan gridlock in \nWashington over education reform and to come together around programs, \npolicies, and initiatives that members of both parties can agree are \ncritical to improving education for our neediest children. I am very \npleased that President Bush agrees with my colleagues and I on the \nfundamental principles underlying this legislation--that meaningful \neducation reform requires more resources, more flexibility, and more \naccountability. I look forward to working with President Bush and my \nRepublican colleagues to reach a bipartisan consensus on education \nreform. I believe that the Three R's legislation provides a great \nframework for finding the common ground necessary to reach a consensus.\n  Bipartisanship means compromise, not capitulation--and education \nreform is an issue for compromise. We've been pushing for three years \nfor real education reform for our kids--we've been willing to put aside \nhot button issues--and now I hope that President Bush will join us by \nputting aside his voucher proposals and working toward meaningful \npublic education reform that both parties can agree on. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree that the federal government should \nfocus on helping states improve academic results for our children \ninstead of developing more rules, on encouraging states and schools to \nenact bold reforms instead of passively tolerating failure. It is time \nto step back from mico-managing public education from Washington, and \ntime instead to give states and school districts the flexibility they \nneed to improve public education. And we must hold those schools and \nstates accountable for results.\n  Members of both parties know that we must increase our investment in \npublic education so that schools can meet high standards, that we must \nmaintain our commitment to the most economically disadvantaged \nstudents, that to be successful schools must have capable leaders and \nfully certified teachers, and that schools must be held accountable for \nproviding children with a quality education.\n  I have worked on education reform in a bipartisan way in the past. In \nthe last Congress Senator Gordon Smith and I introduced education \nreform legislation and were supported by many of our colleagues. Our \nproposal represented an education reform agenda that members of both \nparties could support and contained initiatives that many agreed were \nfundamental to improving public education. The Three R's legislation--a \nfocus on increased investment, increased flexibility, and increased \naccountability--is also an education reform agenda on which many can \nagree and I want to reach out in the next few weeks and ask those \nRepublicans, like Gordon Smith, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe, to \njoin in this effort to reform education in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today in support \nof the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility \nAct. I want to congratulate my good friends, the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Indiana, for their strong leadership \non this issue. When they first introduced this legislation back last \nyear, the prospects for bipartisan education reform looked far \ndifferent than they do today. Members on the two sides of the aisle \nwere sharply divided over the future of the federal role in education. \nAs a result, the Congress failed last year to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act for the first time in its 35-\nyear history.\n  Last year, it took courage and foresight for the supporters of this \nlegislation to step into the partisan breach in the way that they did. \nThis bill received all of 13 votes when it was first brought to the \nfloor. Today, we ought to all be grateful for the leadership of those \n13 senators, because this year the Public Education Reinvestment, \nReinvention, and Responsibility Act represents the best hope and the \nbest blueprint for finally achieving meaningful, bipartisan reform of \nthe federal role in education.\n  For the last eight years, I had the great privilege of serving my \nlittle State as governor. During that time, I worked together with \nlegislators from both sides of the aisle, with educators and others, to \nset rigorous standards, to provide local schools with the resources and \nflexibility they needed, and in return to demand accountability for \nresults. We in Delaware have not been alone in this endeavor. We have \nbeen part of a nationwide movement for change--a movement of parents \nand teachers, of employers, legislators and governors, who believe that \nour public schools can be improved and that every child can learn.\n  As a former chairman of the National Governors' Association, I can \nattest that the Federal Government is frequently a lagging indicator \nwhen it comes to responsiveness to change. It is clearly states and \nlocal communities that are leading the movement for change in public \neducation today. The bill we introduce today does not seek to make the \nFederal Government the leader in education reform by micromanaging the \noperation of local schools. Nor does this legislation seek to \nperpetuate the status quo in which the Federal Government passively \nfunds and facilitates failure. Rather, this legislation seeks for the \nfirst time to make the Federal Government a partner and catalyst in the \nmovement for reform that we see all across this country at the State \nand local level. This legislation refocuses Federal policy on doing a \nfew things, but doing them well. It redirects Federal policy toward the \npurpose of achieving results rather than promulgating yet more rules \nand regulations.\n  I believe we have a tremendous opportunity this year to achieve \nbipartisan consensus to reform and reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, and in so doing to redeem the original intent \nof that landmark legislation. I want to express my appreciation to our \nnew President for his interest in renewing educational opportunity in \nAmerica and leaving no child behind. There is much in the legislation \nwe introduce today that squares with the plan that the President sent \nto Congress last week. We on this side of the aisle agree with the \nPresident that we need to invest more federal dollars in our schools, \nparticularly in schools that serve the neediest students. We also agree \nthat the dollars we provide, we should provide more flexibly. And we \nagree that if we are going to provide more money, and if we are going \nto provide that money more flexibly, we should demand results. That's \nthe formula: invest in reform; insist on results.\n  I believe we also agree with our new President that parents should be \nempowered to make choices to send their children to a variety of \ndifferent schools. We agree that parents are the\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nfirst enforcers of accountability in public education. Where we \ndisagree is in how we provide that choice. The President believes that \nthe best way to empower parents and to provide them with choices is to \ngive children and their parents vouchers of $1,500. With all due \nrespect, that is an empty promise. In my State, you just can't get your \nchild into most private or parochial schools for $1,500 per year. That \nis simply an empty promise.\n  I believe there is a better way. I believe we've found a better way \nin my little State of Delaware. Four years ago, we introduced statewide \npublic school choice. We also passed our first charter schools law. I \nknew that this was going to work when I heard the following \nconversation between a school administrator and some of his colleagues. \nHe said, ``If we don't provide parents and families what they want and \nneed, they'll send their kids somewhere else.'' I thought to myself, \n``Right! He's got it.''\n  We have 200 public schools in my small State, and students in all of \nthese schools take our test measuring what they know and can do in \nreading, writing, and math. We also measure our schools by the \nincidence of poverty, from highest to lowest. The school with the \nhighest incidence of poverty in my state is the East Side Charter \nSchool in Wilmington, Delaware. The incidence of poverty there is 83 \npercent. Its students are almost all minority. It is right in the \ncenter of the projects in Wilmington. In the first year after East Side \nCharter School opened its doors, very few of its students met our state \nstandards in math. Last spring, every third grader there who took our \nmath test met or exceeded our standards, which is something that \nhappened at no other school in the state. It's a remarkable story. And \nit's been possible because East Side Charter School is a remarkable \nschool. Kids can come early and stay late. They have a longer school \nyear. They wear school uniforms. Parents have to sign a contract of \nmutual responsibility. Teachers are given greater authority to innovate \nand initiate.\n  We need to ensure that parents and students are getting what they \nwant and need, and if they're not getting what they want and need that \nthey have the choice--and most importantly that they have they have the \nability--to go somewhere else. A $1,500 voucher doesn't give parents \nthat ability, at least not in my State. Public school choice and \ncharter schools do.\n  We agree on many things. Where we disagree, as on vouchers, I believe \nwe can find common ground. I believe that we can come together, for \nexample, to provide a ``safety valve'' to children in failing schools, \nin the way of broader public school choice and greater access to \ncharter schools. I am therefore hopeful about the prospects for \nbipartisan agreement and for meaningful reform. To that end, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Public Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, \nand Responsibility Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr.  Biden, Mr. DeWine, and \n        Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 304. A bill to reduce illegal drug use and trafficking and to help \nprovide appropriate drug education, prevention, and treatment programs; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we are taking an important step in \nour effort to rid our nation of drug abuse. There has lately developed \na bipartisan consensus that realizes that supply reduction needs to be \ncomplemented with demand reduction in our fight to combat drugs. Yes, \nwe must continue our vigilant defense of our borders and our streets \nagainst those who make their living by manufacturing and selling these \nharmful substances. And yes, we must sustain our vigorous law \nenforcement offensive against these merchants of misery. But the time \nhas come to increase the resources we devote to prevent people from \nusing drugs in the first place and to breaking the cycle of addiction \nfor those whose lives are devastated and consumed by these substances. \nOnly through such a balanced approach can we remove the scourge of \ndrugs from our society.\n  Last session, to stem the maddening increase in methamphetamine \nmanufacturing and trafficking in America, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a \nbill which I had authored. It was a balanced bill that provided law \nenforcement with several needed tools to help turn back the tide of \nmethamphetamine proliferation, and it also contained several \nsignificant prevention and treatment provisions. In particular, one of \nthe treatment provisions offered an innovative approach to how drug \naddicted patients can seek and obtain treatment. As science and \nmedicine continue to make significant strides in developing drugs that \npromise to make treatment more effective, we must pave the way to \nensure that these drugs can be administered in an effective manner, \nIndeed, this provision did exactly that, by creating a decentralized \nsystem of treating heroin addicts with a new generation of anti-\naddiction medications.\n  Mr. President, the Drug Education, Prevention and Treatment Act of \n2001, which we introduce today, also embodies this balanced approach. \nWhile the bill furthers our law enforcement efforts by increasing \npenalties for those who involve minors in drug crimes and those who use \nour public lands for drug manufacturing, the bulk of the legislation \nadvances our prevention and treatment efforts. Before detailing some of \nthese measures, I want to thank my partner on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy, as well as my colleagues Senators Biden, DeWine, and \nThurmond for cosponsoring this bill. The effort and expertise they have \ncontributed to this bill have helped make it worthy of the support of \nevery member of this body.\n\n  I am extremely pleased that this bipartisan bill has a friend in the \nnew White House. President Bush has indicated on several occasions, and \nin the plan he unveiled last fall, that he also believes in a \ncomprehensive drug control strategy. He, too, has stressed treatment as \nan important component in combating juvenile drug abuse. I look forward \nto working with the President, as well as with Attorney General \nAshcroft, as we combat drug abuse in this country in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  This legislation recognizes that we must do more to prevent and treat \nsubstance abuse. Such efforts, it is safe to say, will prove well worth \nit. According to a report recently released by the National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University in 1998, States \nspent $81.3 billion--fully 13.1 percent of total state spending--on \nsubstance abuse and addiction. Only $3 billion of this, however, was \nspent on prevention and treatment. The remaining $78 billion was spent, \nin the words of the study's authors, ``to shovel up the wreckage of \nsubstance abuse and addiction.'' Remarkably, these staggering numbers \ndo not even include the amount of federal matching funds that states \nspend, for example, on Medicaid and welfare, or the spending of local \ngovernments--which bear most of the law enforcement burden, or private \nsector costs such as employee health care, lost productivity, and \nfacility security. The report urges us, as policymakers, to reexamine \nour priorities and shift our attention to drug prevention and \ntreatment.\n  This bill does just that, and, I hasten to add, it does so without \nundermining in any way our commitment to supply reduction. Indeed, this \nbill, it can be said, ultimately will help to cut supply by reducing \nthe demand for drugs among those who are the most consistent and \naddicted users.\n  Whilte this legislation will prove enormously helpful, it is no \nsubstitute for what is our most effective tool for preventing drug \nabuse: good parenting. Demand reduction starts with educating all of \nAmerica's children about the harmful, destructive nature of drugs, and \nthat education must start at home. According to the 1999 PRIDE survey, \nstudents whose parents never or seldom talk to them about drugs are \n36.5 percent more likely to use drugs; in contrast, students whose \nparents talk to them often, or a lot, about drugs are 33.5 percent less \nlikely to use drugs.\n  Parents need to talk seriously to their children about the risks of \ndrug use before they fall prey to peer pressure or drug dealers who \nwant nothing more than to create new addicts. Parents need to stop \ndeluding themselves into believing that moving to the suburbs, away \nfrom the temptations and evils of the inner cities, will prevent\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\ndrug dealers from reaching their children. They need to stop thinking \nthat it is always the other family's kid who is using drugs.\n  Parents, grandparents, priests, pastors, rabbis, teachers, and \neveryone else involved in a child's life need to take an active role in \neducating our children about the dangers of drugs. Drug abuse knows no \nboundaries. It doesn't discriminate on the basis of gender, race, age, \nor class. It is truly an equal opportunity destroyer. Unless children \nare prepared with the knowledge and truth of how drugs will ruin their \nhealth and future, they are vulnerable to the lies of those who are \npeddling drugs.\n  Sadly, studies reveal that many children will never have \nconversations with their parents about drug use. Some children have \nparents that are addicted to drugs, some have parents who are \nimprisoned, and some have parents who just don't understand how vital \nit is for them to talk to their children about drug use. This fact \nalone represents one important reason why communities and organizations \nneed to be involved in educating both parent and children about the \ndangers of drug abuse.\n\n  We need effective education and prevention programs in our schools \nand communities. Even for children blessed with dedicated, concerned \nparents, these school- and community-based programs are vitally \nimportant. Indeed, according to the 1999 PRIDE survey, students who \nnever or seldom join in community activities are 52.6 percent more \nlikely to use drugs. Additionally, students who report never taking \npart in gangs are 90.8 percent less likely to use drugs. It is clear \nthat the more children hear the truth about what drug abuse and \naddiction can do to them, the more likely they will turn their backs on \ndrug use and lead productive lives.\n  To this end, this bill contains significant funding for drug abuse \neducation and prevention programs in our schools and communities. It \nauthorizes grants for school and community-based drug education and \nprevention programs that have been proven to be effective and research-\nbased. The bill also authorizes funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth to continue its research toward identifying even more effective \nprevention and treatment programs. Learning how to treat drug addiction \neffectively is an inextricable component in America's battle to conquer \ndrug abuse.\n  An additional provision authorizes grants to eligible community-based \norganizations, including youth-serving organizations, faith-based \norganizations, and other community groups, to provide after-school or \nout-of-school programs that include a strong character education \ncomponent. Another important provision authorizes funding for \ncommunity-based organizations that provide counseling and mentoring \nservices to children who have a parent or guardian that is \nincarcerated. We want all who can help to be in a position to help, and \nthese drug education and prevention programs seek to get everyone in \nall communities involved.\n  Mr. President, while I am confident these innovative drug education \nand prevention programs will help reduce the number of children who \ndecide to use drugs, we also need to ensure that those who are addicted \nreceive treatment. This bill authorizes, therefore, sizeable grants to \nStates to provide residential treatment facilities specifically \ndesigned to treat drug-addicted juveniles. It is crucial that drug-\naddicted children receive treatment while they are young before they \nruin their lives and grow up to become hard core addicts, which often \nleads to criminal behavior.\n  It does without saying that it is important to ensure that violent \nand repeat offenders are imprisoned and punished for their crimes. \nHowever, I believe that there is merit to giving nonviolent offenders, \nwhose crimes are tied directly to their addictions, a chance to enter \ndrug treatment in stead of prison. This bill contains several \nprovisions that will assist States in providing nonviolent, drug-\naddicted offenders with the opportunity to participate in drug \ntreatment programs in lieu of incarceration.\n  For example, one provision authorizes the Attorney General to make \ngrants to State and local prosecutors for the purpose of developing, \nimplementing, or expanding drug treatment alternatives to prison \nprograms for nonviolent offenders. These programs are administered by \nprosecutors who determine which offenders are eligible to participate. \nAll eligible offenders who participate are sentenced to, or placed \nwith, a long-term, drug-free residential substance abuse treatment \nprovider. If, however, the offender does not successfully complete \ntreatment, he or she is required to serve a sentence of imprisonment \nwith respect to the underlying crime.\n  This program has been administered effectively by certain district \nattorneys in New York over the last decade. Last session, I worked hard \nwith Senators Thurmond and Schumer, to get these very programs \nauthorized so that other State and local prosecutors could benefit from \nthis drug alternative to prison program. I look forward to the \ncontinuing support of Senators Thurmond and Schumer to ensure that this \nprovision is enacted into law this session.\n\n  This bill also reauthorizes the drug court program and authorizes \njuvenile substance abuse courts, both of which provide continuing \njudicial supervision over nonviolent offenders with substance abuse \nproblems while allowing them to enter treatment programs as an \nalternative to prison.\n  A high percentage of offenders who otherwise don't qualify for \nparticipation in alternatives to prison programs, but nonetheless have \nserious drug addictions, far too often are released from incarceration \nwithout ever receiving treatment. To address this issue, this bill \nauthorizes funding to provide drug treatment services to inmates. This \nfunding will go a long way in ensuring safer neighborhoods and a more \nproductive society once drug addicted offenders are released from \nincarceration.\n  To further ensure safer neighborhoods, the bill also promotes the \nsuccessful reintegration of inmates into society by authorizing \ndemonstration projects in the federal and state court systems that \nincorporate new strategies and programs for alleviating the public \nsafety risk posed by released prisoners. These projects, which \nestablish court-based programs for monitoring the return of offenders \ninto communities, include drug treatment, as well as vocation and basic \neducational training. Each program uses court sanctions and incentives \nto encourage positive behavior.\n  Finally, the bill contains a provision that requires the government \nto consider, on the same basis as other non-governmental organizations, \nfaith-based organizations to provide the assistance under all programs \nauthorized by this bill, as long as the program is implemented in a \nmanner consistent with the first amendment. I am aware of some concerns \nSenators Leahy and Biden may have with this provision relating to the \nparticipation of faith-based organizations, and I am committed to \nworking with them in an effort to address their concerns as the \nlegislation moves through the process.\n  Mr. President, this bill bespeaks a compassionate concern for those \nwho suffer from drug addiction. By passing this bill, we will be \ntelling these people that we have not given up hope for them, \nespecially for our children, that we will offer the means to help them \nhelp themselves, and that we will not leave them behind to be preyed \nupon by those who would make a profit on their misery. Above all, this \nlegislation demonstrates our unwavering commitment to rid our nation of \ndrug abuse. To those who traffic drugs, let there be no mistake about \nour resolve: we will put you in jail when we catch you, but we will \nalso fight you for the soul of every person you would prey upon. And, \nin time, we will change them from helpless targets for your poison to \nproductive, responsible members of our society. I invite my colleagues \nto join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001--Summary\n\n\n                 Title I: Offenses Involving Juveniles\n\n     Sec. 101.

These programs are \n     administered by prosecutors who determine which offenders are \n     eligible to participate. All eligible offenders who \n     participate are sentenced to or placed with a long term, drug \n     free residential substance abuse treatment provider. If the \n     offender does not successfully complete treatment, he is \n     required to serve a sentence of imprisonment with respect to \n     the underlying crime.

Such grants leverage \n     limited Federal, State, and community-based adolescent \n     services to help fill the large unmet need for adolescent \n     mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n     Sec. 308. Expansion of Research\n       This section authorizes funding for the National Institutes \n     of Health to enter into cooperative agreements to conduct \n     research on drug abuse treatment and prevention and to \n     establish up to 12 new National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical \n     Trials Network (CTN) centers to develop and test an array \n     of behavioral and pharmacological treatments and to \n     determine the conditions under which novel treatments are \n     successfully adopted by local treatment clinics. \n     Authorizes $76.4 million to be appropriated in 2002 and \n     such sums as are necessary for FY 2003-2005.\n     Sec. 309. Comprehensive Study By National Academy of Sciences\n       This section directs the Attorney General to enter into \n     contracts to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of federally \n     funded programs for preventing youth substance abuse; (2) \n     identify federal programs and programs that receive federal \n     funds that contribute to reductions in youth substance abuse; \n     and (3) identify programs that have not achieved their\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\n     intended results and to make recommendations on programs that \n     have proven successful and those that should have their \n     funding terminated or reduced because of lack of \n     effectiveness.\n     Sec. 310. Report on Drug-Testing Technologies\n       This section directs the National Institute on Standards \n     and Technology to conduct a study of drug-testing \n     technologies to identify and assess the efficacy, accuracy, \n     and usefulness of such technologies.\n     Sec. 311. Use of National Institutes of Health Substance \n         Abuse Research\n       This section ensures that the research on alcohol and drug \n     abuse conducted by NIDA is disseminated to treatment \n     practitioners to aid them in the treatment of addicts.\n\n\n            Title IV: School Safety and Character Education\n\n                       Subtitle A--School Safety\n\n     Sec. 401. Alternative Education Demonstration Project Grants\n       This section authorizes funding for the Attorney General, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to make \n     grants to State educational agencies or local educational \n     agencies to establish not less than 10 demonstration projects \n     that enable the agencies to develop models and carry out \n     alternative education for at-risk youths. This section \n     authorizes $15 million a year for FY 2002 through 2004.\n     Sec. 402. Transfer of School Disciplinary Records\n       This section requires a State that receives federal funds \n     to have a procedure to facilitate the transfer of \n     disciplinary records by local educational agencies to any \n     private or public elementary school or secondary school.\n\n                    Subtitle B--Character Education\n\n     Sec. 411. National Character Achievement Award\n       This section establishes a National Character Achievement \n     Award for students who distinguish themselves as models of \n     good character.\n     Sec. 421-424. Preventing Juvenile Delinquency through \n         Character Education\n       This section authorizes $100 million for the Secretary of \n     HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General, to award \n     grants to eligible community-based organizations, including \n     youth serving organizations, businesses, and other community \n     groups, to provide after school or out of school programs to \n     youth that include a strong character education component. \n     Eligible organizations must have a demonstrated capacity to \n     provide after school or out of school programs to youth. \n     Character education is defined as an organized educational \n     program that works to reinforce core elements of character, \n     including caring, civic virtue and citizenship, justice and \n     fairness, respect, responsibility, and trustworthiness.\n     Sec. 431-434. Counseling, Training, and Mentoring Children of \n         Prisoners\n       This section authorizes $25 million for the Attorney \n     General to award grants to community-based organizations \n     providing counseling, training, and mentoring services to \n     America's most at-risk children and youth in low-income and \n     high-crime communities who have a parent or legal guardian \n     that is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local \n     correctional facility. Such services will include counseling, \n     including drug prevention counseling; academic tutoring, \n     including online computer academic programs that focus on the \n     development and reinforcement of basic skills; technology \n     training; job skills and vocational training; and confidence \n     building mentoring services.\n\n\n                TITLE V: REESTABLISHMENT OF DRUG COURTS\n\n     Sec. 501.

Authorizes $50 million to be appropriated in 2002 and \n     such sums as necessary for 2003-2004.\n\n\n TITLE VI: PROGRAM FOR SUCCESSFUL REEENTRY OF CRIMINAL OFFENDERS INTO \n                           LOCAL COMMUNITIES\n\n     Sec. 601-618. Federal Reentry Demonstration Projects\n       This section authorizes demonstration projects in Federal \n     judicial districts, the District of Columbia, States, and in \n     the Federal Bureau of Prisons using new strategies and \n     emerging technologies that alleviate the public safety risk \n     posed by released prisoners by promoting their successful \n     reintegration into the community. This section also \n     establishes court-based programs to monitor the return of \n     offenders into communities, which include drug treatment and \n     aftercare, mental and medical health treatment, vocational \n     and basic educational training. Each program uses court \n     sanctions and incentives to promote positive behavior and \n     graduated levels of supervision within the community \n     corrections facility to promote community safety.\n\n\n            TITLE VII: ASSISTANCE BY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS\n\n     Sec. 701. Assistance by Religious Organizations\n       This section provides that the government shall consider, \n     on the same basis as other non-governmental organizations, \n     faith-based organizations to provide the assistance under all \n     programs authorized by this bill, as long as the program is \n     implemented in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Hatch and \nSenators Biden, DeWine, and Thurmond to introduce the Drug Abuse \nEducation, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001. This bill provides a \ncomprehensive approach to drug treatment, prevention, and enforcement. \nIt is my hope that the innovative programs established by this \nlegislation will assist all of our States in their efforts to address \nthe drug problems that most affect our communities.\n  No community is immune from the ravages of drug abuse. My own State \nof Vermont has one of the lowest crime rates in the nation, yet we are \nexperiencing serious troubles because of the abuse of heroin and other \ndrugs. Recent estimates indicate that heroin use in Vermont has doubled \nin just the past three years, and the number of people seeking drug \ntreatment has risen even more rapidly. The average age of a first-time \nheroin user dropped from 27 to 17 during the 1990s, signaling a sharp \nrise in teenage drug abuse. The consequences of this rise have made \nthemselves all too clear over the past months.\n  On January 3, Christal Jones, a 16-year-old girl from Burlington, was \nmurdered in New York City. According to news reports, she was recruited \nin Burlington to move to New York and become part of a prostitution \nring, and she was motivated by a desire to get money to buy heroin. \nWhen she died, drugs were found in her body, although they were not the \ncause of her death. And Christal Jones' tragedy apparently is not \nunique as many as a dozen Vermont girls may have been involved in this \nNew York ring. And since her death, others have come forward to say \nthat teenage girls in Burlington are prostituting themselves to get \nmoney to buy heroin.\n  These disturbing reports followed by only a few months a heinous \ndrug-related triple murder in Rutland, Vermont. In that case, 20-year-\nolds Robert Lee and Donald Fell reportedly spent the night drinking and \ntaking crack cocaine, and then allegedly killed Fell's mother and her \nfriend. Looking to get out of Vermont, they then allegedly carjacked a \nwoman arriving for work at a local supermarket and drove to New York, \nwhere they are accused of beating her to death. Such a case surely \ndeserves a strong law enforcement response, and last Thursday the \naccused were indicted by a federal grand jury for carjacking resulting \nin death and kidnapping, among other charges.\n  Such violence is rarely visited upon my State. When it is, a swift \nlaw enforcement response is necessary, and we must do what we can to \nsupport the efforts of law enforcement to safeguard our communities. \nBut we kid ourselves if we think that law enforcement alone, with ever-\nincreasing penalties, is the answer to the drug problem. Though \neffective enforcement of our drug laws, particularly to deter \ninvolvement of our young people, is a critical component, this is \nsimply insufficient to meet the severe social effects of drug abuse. We \nneed to provide a comprehensive approach to the drug problems of my \nState and our nation. In Vermont, as the Rutland Daily Herald recently \neditorialized, on January 26, 2001, ``agencies that treat addictions'' \nneed ``a boost in resources and manpower.'' Those who work to prevent \ndrug abuse from occurring in the first place need our strong support.\n  I have tried to boost Vermont's anti-drug efforts by working to \nprovide funding for drug prevention, law enforcement, and drug \ntreatment projects. For example, I secured funding for the Vermont \nCoalition of Teen Centers in last year's Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations bill. These teen centers give adolescent Vermonters \nrecreational alternatives to drug use. I was also able to help provide \nsignificant funding for the Vermont Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Task \nForce, facilitating the ability of law enforcement officials to work \ntogether to tackle Vermont's drug problems. In addition, at my request \nCongress approved substantial funding for Vermont to plan and establish \na long-term residential treatment facility for adolescents.\n  I believe that the bill I introduce today with Senator Hatch will \nbuild\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\nupon those important efforts by providing a substantial boost for \ntreatment, law enforcement, and prevention, both in Vermont and across \nthe nation. It contains numerous grant programs to aid States and local \ncommunities in their efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse. Of \nparticular interest to the residents of my State, it establishes drug \ntreatment grants for rural States and authorizes money for residential \ntreatment centers for mothers addicted to heroin, methamphetamines, or \nother drugs.\n  This legislation also will help States and communities reduce drug \nuse in prisons through testing and treatment, an effort I proposed in \nthe Drug Free Prisons Act I introduced in the last Congress. It will \nprovide funding for programs designed to reduce recidivism through \nfunding drug treatment and other services for former prisoners after \nrelease. In addition, this bill will reauthorize drug courts another \nstep I proposed in the Drug Free Prisons Act and create juvenile drug \ncourts.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to review and \namend penalties for a number of drug crimes involving children. For \nexample, in addressing circumstances such as those surrounding the \ndeath of Christal Jones, the bill instructs the Sentencing Commission \nto amend its guidelines to provide for any necessary sentencing \nenhancement for criminals who distribute drugs to minors in order to \nlure a minor into or keep a minor engaged in prostitution or other \ncriminal activity.\n  In short, there are programs in this legislation to benefit all \nAmericans whose lives are disrupted by drug abuse in their families and \ncommunities. I strongly recommend this bipartisan bill to my \ncolleagues, and hope that we can move quickly to make it law.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I have worked to provide necessary funding \nfor treatment, prevention, and enforcement efforts in Vermont. Last \nyear, I secured $150,000 for the Vermont Coalition of Teen Centers, \n$400,000 for the Vermont Drug Task Force, $100,000 for an adolescent \ntreatment facility, two grants worth $500,000 for a balanced and \nrestorative justice project, $1.7 million in Byrne law enforcement \ngrants, two grants worth $560,000 to reduce underage drinking, about \n$725,000 for Drug Free Communities Support Programs throughout Vermont, \nand $274,535 for Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, RSAT, programs \nin the Vermont Corrections Department. In 1999, I worked to procure \n$270,611 for RSAT programs for Vermont prisons and jails, $75,000 for \nthe Vermont Coalition of Teen Centers and an additional $74,976 for the \nEssex Teen Center, two grants worth $660,000 to combat underage \ndrinking, and about $172,000 for Drug Free Community Support programs \nthroughout Vermont. And in 1998, I helped secure $249,864 for balanced \nand restorative justice programs, $274,938 for RSAT programs, $1.9 \nmillion in Byrne law enforcement grants, $360,000 to combat drunk \ndriving, and $424,494 in a Safe Kids/Safe Streets grant.\n\n  This legislation will provide additional ways that Vermont and other \nStates can benefit from federal assistance to prevent drug abuse and \ndrug-related crime. I would like to describe in more detail some of its \nmost important aspects.\n  This bill authorizes a wide variety of treatment and prevention \nprograms. Treatment and prevention efforts are often overshadowed by \nlaw enforcement needs. Indeed, a recent study by the Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse, CASA, showed that of every dollar States \nspent on substance abuse and addiction, only four cents went to \nprevention and treatment. The States and the Federal government have \nundeniably important law enforcement obligations, but we must do more \nto balance those obligations with farsighted efforts to prevent drug \ncrimes from happening in the first place.\n  As I have said, heroin is an increasing problem in Vermont. In other \nStates, methamphetamines or other drugs present a growing challenge. \nThis legislation will help States address their most pressing drug \nproblems, and places a particular emphasis on States that may not have \nbeen able to address their treatment and prevention needs in the past. \nIndeed, among many other provisions, the bill offers funding for rural \nStates like Vermont to establish or enhance treatment centers. It \ninstructs the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to \nmake grants to public and nonprofit private entities that provide \ntreatment and are approved by State experts. This will allow the \nVermont agencies looking to provide heroin treatment or to prevent \nheroin abuse in the first place to acquire Federal funding to help in \ntheir efforts.\n  The Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act also authorizes funding \nfor residential treatment centers that treat mothers who are addicted \nto heroin, methamphetamines, or other drugs. This will help mothers and \nthe children who depend on them to rebuild their lives it will keep \nfamilies together. And I hope it will help avoid further stories like \none that appeared in last Sunday's edition of the Burlington Free \nPress, in which a young mother told a reporter how heroin ``made it \neasier for [her] to take care of [her] kids.''\n  The bill also calls for funding drug treatment programs for \njuveniles. As the tragic story of Christal Jones and the disturbing \nreports about other girls in her position have shown, juveniles can see \ntheir lives quickly deteriorate under the influence of drugs. This is \nwhy I have worked to provide Vermont with funding to establish a long-\nterm residential treatment facility for adolescents. I hope to continue \nthat effort through this bill, in the hope that we may be able to \nprevent future tragedies.\n  Our efforts here must include reducing the lure of drugs, and \neducating our kids and making sure they have recreational alternatives \nare two key components. In light of that, this bill authorizes grants \nto carry out school- and community-based prevention and education \nprograms, with priority given to rural and urban areas experiencing \ndrug problems. It provides additional funding for after-school \nprograms. Finally, it authorizes funding for States to establish \ndemonstration projects of alternative education for at-risk youths. \nThese steps should improve the quality and availability of drug \neducation and prevention efforts throughout the United States.\n  In addition to providing additional funds for treatment and \nprevention, the bill directs the United States Sentencing Commission to \nreview existing criminal penalties and provide any necessary increases \nfor drug crimes involving juveniles. In particular, the Sentencing \nCommission must review the current penalties for distributing drugs to \nminors, using minors to distribute drugs, trafficking near a school, \nand using Federal property to grow or manufacture controlled \nsubstances. I would like to highlight one provision in particular in my \ncomments today.\n  This bill calls for the Sentencing Commission to amend its guidelines \nto provide for a specific sentencing enhancement for anyone who \ndistributes drugs to minors in order to lure a minor into or keep a \nminor engaged in prostitution or other criminal activity. Let me \nexplain why this provision matters. If the law enforcement officials \ninvestigating the death of Christal Jones find that the person or \npeople who brought her to New York and prostituted her were giving or \nselling her heroin to entice her, the punishment should be more severe. \nThis provision will give prosecutors an additional tool to fight such \nodious conduct.\n  I would also like to commend the approach taken in the criminal \nprovisions in this legislation. Instead of imposing mandatory minimums, \nwe have invested discretion in the Sentencing Commission to determine \nappropriate penalties. A 1997 study by the RAND Corporation of \nmandatory minimum drug sentences found that ``mandatory minimums are \nnot justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine \nconsumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.'' Despite \nthis study and mounting evidence of prison overcrowding, legislators \ncontinue to propose additional mandatory minimums. In light of the \npersistence of that idea, this legislation calls for a new study of the \nissue, including whether mandatory minimums have a disproportionate \nimpact on any racial or ethnic groups and whether they are an \nappropriate vehicle to punish nonviolent offenders.\n  Last year I introduced the Drug Free Prisons Act, which authorized \ngrants to States to facilitate treatment and testing programs in \nprisons and jails.\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nThis bill provides resources to achieve the same goal. It is critical \nthat our prisons be drug-free, both because lawbreaking within our \ncorrectional system is a national embarrassment, and because prisoners \nwho are released while still addicted to drugs are far more likely to \ncommit future crimes than prisoners who are released sober. This bill \nwill provide needed help to address drug abuse in prisons throughout \nthe country. It authorizes $50 million for drug-free prisons and jails \nbonus grants, allows States to use Residential Substance Abuse \nTreatment, RSAT, grants to provide services for inmates or former \ninmates, and reauthorizes funding for substance abuse treatment in \nFederal prisons.\n\n  As Joseph Califano, Jr., the president of CASA and former secretary \nof Health, Education, and Welfare, told the National Press Club last \nmonth: ``The next great opportunity to reduce crime is to provide \ntreatment and training to drug and alcohol abusing prisoners who will \nreturn to a life of criminal activity unless they leave prison \nsubstance free and, upon release, enter treatment and continuing \naftercare.'' This legislation will accomplish both of those goals.\n  A prior CASA study found that drug and alcohol abuse was implicated \nin the crimes and incarceration of 80 percent of those currently \nserving time in America's prisons. This finding shows that we have a \nprison population that has a history of substance abuse, and will seek \nout opportunities to continue using drugs while imprisoned. Of course, \nif prisoners are using drugs in prison, this will create serious \nbehavioral and other problems that corrections officers will have to \naddress, at no small risk to them.\n  The problem does not end there. The same CASA study shows that \ninmates who are illegal drug and/or alcohol abusers are the most likely \nto be repeat offenders. In fact, the study concluded that 61 percent of \nstate prison inmates who have two prior convictions are regular drug \nusers. The strong link between drug use and recidivism cannot be \nignored. Prison should provide an opportunity for us to break this \ncycle and therefore reduce crime. We can do this through a concerted \neffort to test prisoners for drug use and penalize those who test \npositive and provide adequate drug treatment so that prisoners can lead \nproductive, non-criminal lives upon their release.\n  This approach to reducing drug use and addiction in prisons has the \nsupport of Jim Walton, Vermont's Commissioner of Public Safety, and \nJohn Perry, the Director of Planning for the Vermont Department of \nCorrections, who work with these issues every day. I have always valued \ntheir counsel, as they have first-hand knowledge of the real law \nenforcement needs in my state. They both feel strongly that the bill \nwill give law enforcement the tools it needs to test and treat offender \npopulations, both in jail and in the community. I hope and expect that \nthis bill will have the same effect across the country.\n  In addition to providing funding for drug treatment and testing in \nprisons, this legislation also adopts a proposal made by Senator Biden \nin both this Congress and the last that would provide funding for \nFederal and State programs designed to ease the transition of criminal \noffenders back into society after their release. It establishes court-\nbased programs to monitor the return of offenders into communities. \nThese programs include drug treatment and aftercare, mental and medical \nhealth treatment, vocational and educational training, life skills \ninstructions, and assistance in obtaining suitable affordable housing. \nEach program uses court sanctions and incentives to promote positive \nbehavior and graduated levels of supervision within the community \ncorrections facility to promote community safety. I commend Senator \nBiden for his leadership on this program.\n  The bill also re-establishes the drug courts program and re-\nauthorizes funding for it, as I proposed in last year's Drug Free \nPrisons Act. The majority repealed the authorization of the drug courts \nprogram in the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act \nof 1996, in an apparent attempt to discredit Democratic programs. In my \nview, effective programs dealing with drug abuse should not be used as \npolitical footballs. That is why the Congress has continued to fund \ndrug courts in every year's appropriations acts. This has been the \nright decision, and we should undo the repeal.\n  Drug courts provide the opportunity to deal systematically with \nnonviolent drug offenders at a substantial savings to taxpayers. \nInstead of jailing these nonviolent offenders, the courts can order \nalternative punishments that are mixed with mandatory testing and drug \ntreatment and human services such as education or vocational training. \nMeanwhile, imprisonment is held out as a stick to ensure good behavior. \nTo qualify for federal assistance, a drug court program must mandate \nperiodic drug testing during any supervised release or probation \nperiods, provide drug abuse treatment for each participant, and hold \nout the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration for \nnoncompliance or failure to show satisfactory process. Violent \noffenders are defined quite broadly, so we can be confident that we are \nnot funding programs that put dangerous people back on the streets.\n  In addition to reauthorizing drug courts for adults, this legislation \nauthorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to State and local \ngovernments to establish juvenile drug courts, extending the drug court \nmodel that has shown significant promise in dealing with adult \noffenders to juveniles. Juvenile drug courts should provide a way to \nreach out to younger offenders before they turn to a life of crime, \nhelping to save both lives and significant government resources.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on the inclusion of charitable \nchoice language in this legislation to allow religious groups to \ncompete for grants on the same basis as other groups. Although the \nlanguage in this bill mirrors language that was passed in the \nChildren's Health Act last year as well as in previous legislation, I \nhave serious reservations about it. I know that many of my colleagues \nshare those reservations.\n  Charitable choice is going to be a significant issue during this \nCongress. I would have preferred that we have hearings about charitable \nchoice before including it in this bill, and I made my feelings known \nto Senator Hatch. I asked him to introduce the bill without the \nlanguage and consider adding it later if specific language could be \ncrafted for which there was bipartisan support. But Senator Hatch was \ncommitted to including this language in the bill as introduced. Let me \nbe clear: its inclusion here does not represent my endorsement. As this \nlegislation is considered by the Committee and the Senate, we need to \ngive considerable thought to the approach taken here. I intend to work \nwith Senator Hatch and the other sponsors of the bill to ensure that \nthe important protections and prohibitions of the First Amendment are \nfully respected. At the very least, we need to ensure that those who \nreceive federal drug treatment and prevention funds are trained \nprofessionals, and that the government funds are not used in any way, \ndirectly or indirectly, to support or promote discrimination.\n  At the same time, I believe that this bill, taken as a whole, will do \na great deal of good. While charitable choice language is in this bill \ntoday, I have made no commitment to having this charitable choice \nlanguage in the bill when Congress passes it. My commitment is to help \nimprove drug treatment, prevention, and education throughout the United \nStates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two newspaper \narticles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Rutland Daily Herald (VT), Jan. 26, 2001]\n\n                            Now Is the Time\n\n       It is time for Vermont lawmakers to take the initiative in \n     pushing for a comprehensive anti-drug program that will \n     respond constructively to the increased use of dangerous \n     drugs in Vermont.\n       Major drug busts in the Rutland area, as well as a rise in \n     crimes related to drug addiction, have pointed to the heroin \n     problem in the region. City leaders have taken needed steps \n     to bolster efforts by city police to address the problem, and \n     Mayor John Cassarino has offered a tax proposal that would \n     provide necessary funding in the future.\n       Statewide, the use of heroin has probably doubled in the \n     past three years. The number of Vermonters seeking treatment \n     rose from 164 to 344 in that time. That number doesn't\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\n     take into account the users who don't seek treatment.\n       The Vermont State Police have made a compelling case for \n     boosting manpower, which has eroded substantially in the past \n     eight years. And Gov. Howard Dean has made the fight against \n     heroin one of his priorities.\n       But so far Dean has not come up with resources for a long-\n     term attack on the problem. The Legislature ought to use this \n     moment to take Dean's initiative further.\n       Dean is well known for his punitive attitude toward drugs \n     and for his lack of faith in the efficacy of treatment for \n     drug users. But aggressive treatment, combined with \n     aggressive law enforcement, has not been tried. And at this \n     late date in the war on drugs, we ought to realize that law \n     enforcement alone has not done the job.\n       Law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels can \n     use a boost in resources and manpower. But so can agencies \n     that treat addictions. Effective treatment is labor-intensive \n     and could be made available to people both inside and outside \n     of the state's corrections system.\n       Mental health workers know that drug addiction is not an \n     easy affliction to cure. Addicts sometimes want no part of \n     treatment. But the state could establish institutions that \n     would respond more effectively to people who need help. Drug \n     courts could establish a regimen of treatment that would \n     expose people in state custody to the kind of help they may \n     never have seen before.\n       Dean has promised to move quickly to set up clinics for \n     drug treatment, following passage last year of legislation \n     allowing for methadone treatment. But as Dean has often said, \n     methadone alone will not solve the problem. Methadone needs \n     to be part of a larger program of treatment.\n       As of last week, only two hospitals in Vermont had \n     expressed firm interest in establishing methadone clinics. \n     Rutland Regional Medical Center is waiting to determine what \n     resources will be available and what kind of program the \n     regulations will establish. Health care facilities such as \n     RRMC need to be given the support and the resources to do the \n     job.\n       Vermont is a small enough state that it could pioneer \n     methods for treating drug problems that go beyond the obvious \n     first step of locking people up. It would be in the state's \n     interest to do so both to prevent the kind of crime and \n     dereliction that is a drain on any community and to rescue \n     Vermonters who succumb to the deathly appeal of drugs.\n       A package that included both law enforcement and treatment \n     measures might draw bipartisan support. Vermonters are not \n     helpless before the scourge of drug addiction if they have \n     the will to act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Burlington Free Press (VT), Feb. 7, 2001]\n\n                    Vt. Teen's Death Ruled Homicide\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n       Christal Jean Jones, the 16-year-old Burlington girl found \n     dead in a Bronx apartment Jan. 3, was the victim of a \n     homicide, according to New York City's top medical officer.\n       ``The cause of death was asphyxiation, and the manner of \n     death is homicide,'' Ellen Borakove; spokeswoman for the New \n     York City Medical Examiner's Office, confirmed Tuesday.\n       The medical examiner relied on police investigation and \n     toxicology tests to reach his conclusion. Borakove said Jones \n     was smothered.\n       Drugs were found in Jones' body, but Borakove declined to \n     say what the drug was or how it had been administered.\n       ``Whatever substance was found was not a contributing \n     factor in her death,'' Borakove said.\n       Jones' mother, Kathleen Wright, received the news during an \n     emotional 11:30 a.m. phone call Tuesday from Borakove's \n     office.\n       ``It's just what I expected,'' a weeping Wright said after \n     hanging up the phone. ``She was injected with drugs and then \n     she was killed.''\n       Local and federal authorities say Jones was part of a \n     prostitution ring operating out of an apartment in the Hunts \n     Point section of the Bronx last fall and this winter. \n     Authorities also say drugs, particularly heroin, were \n     involved.\n       As many as a dozen Vermont girls, many in the custody of \n     the state Social & Rehabilitation Services department at the \n     time, have been involved, say some of the teens who have \n     traveled to New York, their parents and authorities.\n       Gov. Howard Dean has ordered an investigation into SRS's \n     handling of the girls' cases.\n       Jose Rodriguez, a part-time Vermont resident with a \n     criminal record here, is being held on $100,000 bail in a New \n     York City prison because New York officials suspect he might \n     be involved in Jones' death. However, Rodriguez has been in \n     jail since Dec. 11, when he was arrested on two charges of \n     promoting prostitution and one charge of statutory rape \n     involving another Vermont teen-ager.\n       At prosecutors' request his initial bail of $10,000 was \n     increased to $100,000.\n       ``Our sympathy goes out the (Jones) family,'' Eric Sachs, \n     Rodriguez's court-appointed attorney, said Tuesday. ``We \n     don't wish that on anybody, especially a young girl.''\n       He said Rodriguez has cooperated fully with authorities and \n     knows nothing about Christal Jones' death.\n       ``He's in jail. Obviously, we know he didn't do it,'' Sachs \n     said.\n       When he was told Tuesday that the medical examiner had \n     ruled Jones' death a homicide, Sachs called the District \n     Attorney's Office.\n       He was assured, he said, ``there is no Christal Jones case, \n     and there is no accusation that my client is involved.''\n       ``Nobody has ever seen him'' in the Zerega Avenue apartment \n     in which Jones was killed, Sachs said. ``It's not his \n     apartment. He has no connection to this apartment. Where \n     these girls live, or don't--he doesn't know.''\n       However, in the police affidavit outlining the prostitution \n     and rape charges against Rodriguez, New York Police Office \n     Sean Iannucci said the victim said the crimes were committed \n     at the apartment where Jones' body was found.\n       If convicted, Sachs said, Rodriguez faces a maximum jail \n     term of four years for the rape charge and 15 years for each \n     of two prostitution charges.\n       Investigators who have interviewed witnesses and some of \n     those involved say Rodriguez was intimately linked to the \n     girls and a prostitution ring.\n       ``I will kill you if you try to leave; I know people in \n     Vermont and New York,'' Rodriguez was said to have told two \n     of the Vermont girls before his arrest. Police also said he \n     beat one of the girls after learning she had tried to call a \n     family member for help.\n       Since Jones' death, many of those involved have gone into \n     hiding. Some parents of the girls known to frequent New York \n     won't talk. When approached, they crack the door only to say \n     they don't know where their daughters are. Their fear is \n     palpable.\n       In the Old North End and the King Street area of \n     Burlington, Jones' death--and life-- are well known. Local \n     residents are painfully aware of the extent of heroin use and \n     the hold the drug has over their neighbors. They say there is \n     no easy resolution to the problem they have watched reach \n     epidemic propositions in the past five years.\n       ``We've got the demand,'' said Mike Larow, who owns Larow's \n     Market on North Street. ``Everyone seems to be afraid to \n     admit that it's here.''\n       A federal grand jury in Burlington is reviewing evidence in \n     the case.\n       Vermont state officials and local police knew of the \n     prostitution ring in the fall, according to a variety of \n     sources. Dean said state officials went to New York and \n     brought back two girls who had been at the apartment where \n     Jones eventually died.\n       ``The only comment is how sad it is that this child has \n     died and how unnecessary,'' SRS Commissioner William Young \n     said Tuesday. ``I think everyone from our local office and \n     throughout the organization takes this kind of news hard.\n       ``We certainly hope whoever is responsible for her death is \n     brought to justice.''\n       Young said the case pointed out how vulnerable young women \n     are, especially when they abuse drugs. Young said this was \n     the first case that anyone in his agency was aware of in \n     which there was an organized effort to take girls from \n     Vermont to another location to work as prostitutes.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, substance abuse is one of our Nation's most \npervasive problems. Addiction is a disease that does not discriminate \nbased on age, gender, socio-economic status, race or creed. And while \nwe tend to stereotype drug abuse as an urban problem, the steadily \ngrowing number of heroin and methamphetamine addicts in rural villages \nand suburban towns shows that is simply not the case.\n  We have nearly 15 million drug users in this country, four million of \nwhom are hard-core addicts. We all know someone--a family member, \nneighbor, colleague or friend--who has become addicted to drugs or \nalcohol. And we are all affected by the undeniable correlation between \nsubstance abuse and crime--an overwhelming 80 percent of the two \nmillion men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and \nalcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime.\n  All of this comes at a hefty price. Drug abuse and addiction cost \nthis Nation $110 billion in law enforcement and other criminal justice \nexpenses, medical bills, lost earnings and other costs each year. \nIllegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year and for \nthe spread of a number of communicable diseases, including AIDS and \nHepatitis C. And a study by The National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA, shows that seven out of \nten cases of child abuse and neglect are caused or exacerbated by \nsubstance abuse and addiction.\n  Another CASA study released last week revealed that for each dollar \nthat States spend on substance-abuse related programs, 96 cents goes to \ndealing with the consequences of substance abuse and only four cents to \npreventing and treating it. Investing more in prevention and treatment \nis cost-effective because it will decrease much of the street crime, \nchild abuse, domestic violence, and other social ills that can result \nfrom substance abuse.\n\n[[Page S1321]]\n\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine \nand Thurmond authorizes more than $900 million a year for prevention \nand treatment programs to reduce the criminal justice, health care, and \nhuman costs associated with substance abuse.\n  We know that if someone gets through age 21 without smoking, abusing \nalcohol, or using drugs, they are unlikely ever to have a substance \nabuse problem. That is why prevention programs for kids are vital. This \nbill provides $200 million a year in grants to drug prevention programs \nlike those run by the Boys and Girls Clubs and by law enforcement \nthrough the DARE program to get the message out to kids that drugs can \nruin their lives.\n  While there is good news that overall drug use has stabilized among \nstudents, there is also bad news--use of Ecstasy by high school seniors \nhas increased more than 66 percent. Prevention programs funded by this \nAct will get the message out to kids that drugs like Ecstasy are \nincredibly dangerous--even if their friends or a cover story in the New \nYork Times Magazine might make it seem like it is ``no big deal.'' \nStudies show that Ecstasy can damage regions of the brain responsible \nfor thought and memory. If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is.\n  This bill also authorizes additional funding for drug treatment, \nwhich is desperately needed. Every year since 1989, I have published my \nown drug report, each of which has advocated a three-prong approach to \naddress the drug problem--prevention, treatment and enforcement. I have \nalways urged more money for treatment because it always gets the short \nend of the stick.\n  Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. And as with other \nchronic relapsing diseases--such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma--\nthere is no cure, although a number of treatments can effectively \ncontrol the disease. According to an article published in the Journal \nof the American Medical Association in October, the rate of adherence \nto the treatment program and the relapse rate are similar for drug \naddiction and other chronic diseases--meaning that treatment for \naddiction works just as well as treatment for other chronic relapsing \ndiseases.\n  Unfortunately, only two million of the estimated five million people \nwho need drug treatment are receiving it. The Drug Abuse Education, \nPrevention and Treatment Act takes steps to close this ``treatment \ngap'' by targeting drug treatment to rural and economically depressed \nareas, funding adolescent treatment and residential treatment centers \nfor women with children, and increasing funding for the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse--whose brilliant scientists conduct 85 percent \nof the world's research on drug abuse--to conduct clinical trials on \nnew treatments for addiction.\n\n  The bill also reauthorizes two key programs created in the 1994 Biden \nCrime Law that fund prison-based drug treatment in the state and \nfederal systems.\n  Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft''; it is \nsmart crime prevention policy as the Key and Crest programs in my home \nstate of Delaware have shown. If we do not treat addicted offenders \nbefore they are released, they will return to our streets with the same \naddiction problem that got them in trouble in the first place, and they \nare likely to re-offend. This is not my opinion; it is fact. More than \n80 percent of inmates with five or more prior convictions have been \nhabitual drug users, compared to approximately 40 percent of first-time \noffenders. Re-authorizing prison-based treatment programs is a good \ninvestment and an important crime prevention initiative.\n  This legislation would also re-authorize the drug court program, a \nprogram I have championed and introduced legislation to reauthorize. \nThe Federal Government has funded drug courts since 1994 as a cost-\neffective, innovative way to deal with non-violent offenders who need \ndrug treatment. Rather than just churning people through the revolving \ndoor of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks get \ntheir acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug \ncourt programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to \nparticipate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to \nfinish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with \nfinancial obligations, including drug-court fees and child-support \npayments.\n  Drug courts have been proven effective at keeping offenders with \nlittle previous treatment history in treatment, providing closer \nsupervision than other community programs to which the offenders could \nbe assigned, reducing crime and being cost-effective.\n  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least \n$5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing \nof the savings associated with future crime prevention and freeing \nscarce prison beds for violent criminals. But most important, more than \n500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, \na sizable victory for society and the budget alike.\n  This Act also includes my ``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act \nof 2001,'' which creates demonstration programs to oversee the \nreintegration of high-risk, high-need offenders into society upon \nrelease. These individuals have served their prison sentences, but they \npose the greatest risk of re-offending because they lack the education, \njob skills, stable family or living arrangements, and the substance \nabuse treatment and other mental and medical health services they need \nto successfully re-integrate into society.\n  According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are \nnow living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in \nlocal jails. A record number of those inmates--nearly 590,000--will \nreturn to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of returning \nprisoners have been re-arrested for new crimes within three years.\n  The safety threat posed by this number of prisoner returns has been \nexacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly \nproperly supervise all their returning offenders. In fact, parole \nsystems have been abolished in thirteen States, and policy shifts \ntoward more determinate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority \nto impose supervisory conditions on offenders returning to their \ncommunities.\n  The demonstration reentry programs created by this bill would help \nsupervise these people when they are released from jail and make sure \nthey get the mental health, substance abuse and other services they \nneed so that they won't go back to a life of crime and can be \nproductive members of our society.\n  I believe that the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act \nis a good piece of legislation. Strong treatment and prevention \nprograms are a vital part of a comprehensive drug strategy. \nForestalling drug abuse and treating it when it occurs is sensible \npolicy in terms of saving money, preventing crime and sparing lives. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 305. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to remove the \nreduction in the amount of Survivor Benefit Plan annuities at age 62; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am delighted today to \nrise to discuss President Bush's commitment to strengthening America's \nnational security. I know this is a matter that is very close to the \nheart of my colleague in the Chair, the Senator from Oklahoma. \nPresident Bush often said during the campaign to the military that \n``help is on the way.'' It is nice to know that help has arrived.\n  The President is spending this week traveling to military \ninstallations to see and hear, for the first time since assuming \noffice, the needs of the military.\n  I can tell you, having just come back a few weeks ago from visiting \nthe troops, marines and sailors aboard the U.S.S. Nassau in the \nMediterranean, that they appreciate it when anybody from the Government \ncomes to visit them where they are on location. Clearly, for the \nPresident of the United States to go directly to a military facility \nand look the troops in the eye and tell them that help is coming says a \nlot about the President. And believe me, it will do a lot for the \nmorale of the military in this country. He is going to be traveling to \nadditional military installations this week to see and hear just what \nthe needs are as\n\n[[Page S1322]]\n\nthose needs are addressed by the men and women who serve.\n  He is committed to address these urgent needs, and specifically pay \nraises, housing, benefits, and the like. I fully support him in that \neffort. I believe for the last 8 years our military has suffered.\n  I might just say it is nice to hear a President talking about \nstrengthening the military. The needs of our military in the last 8 \nyears have not been funded, and our military has been overextended for \ntoo many peacekeeping missions for which it was neither trained nor \nequipped.\n  In addition to that, oftentimes these missions were conducted without \nbeing budgeted, which forced the dollars to come out of the hides of \nthe men and women who serve in terms of readiness and other accounts.\n  As the Senator in the Chair understands full well, our military \nreadiness is at an all-time low. Planes are not flying for lack of \nspare parts and numerous accidents. Two Army helicopters crashed \nyesterday. Ships aren't sailing for lack of fuel. Soldiers aren't \ntraining for lack of ammunition.\n  I remember looking a young marine in the eye aboard the U.S.S. Nassau \na couple of weeks ago and asking him if he needed anything other than a \nlittle more money. He said: Yes, I would like to have that, but I also \nwould appreciate it, Senator, if you could give me some ammunition for \nthis weapon that I need to fire. We don't have even dummy rounds to \npractice for this particular weapon. He showed me the weapon. I was \nshocked by that, frankly.\n  But, again, let me reassure our military that help is on the way. In \nfact, I think it has arrived.\n  Like the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, my friend Senator \nWarner, I support this effort by the administration to complete a top-\nto-bottom assessment of the military. I think it is important when we \ndo that assessment to do it on the basis of what the needs are and \nunderstand that we are doing it for that reason--to assess the needs--\nand not to come to some foregone conclusion and then prove it with your \ntop-to-bottom assessment. We need to be sure we are buying the right \nweapons for the right threats.\n  The United States has a strong economy and a great open society. \nUnfortunately, it is the only remaining superpower in the world. That \nalso makes us a target for those who oppose our values of life and our \nliberties. The world is not a friendly place. We see violence and \nunrest every night on the news.\n  I do not know if people realize it, but when you go and talk to the \nmen and women out there, their lives are on the line every day. I stood \non the bridge of the U.S.S. Nassau in Malta and watched a small Maltese \nNavy gunboat circling around that ship 24 hours a day to keep guard so \nthat no terrorists could get to that ship. Oftentimes, as we found with \nthe U.S.S. Cole, we didn't have that kind of security from the host \ncountry.\n  So weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological--\ncontinue to proliferate around the world into the hands of dictators \nand demagogues who might, in desperation, choose to oppose us and, \nworst of all, fall into the hands of terrorists.\n  We face new threats, such as cyberattacks on our command and control \nnetworks and our vulnerable civil infrastructure. Our military needs to \nthink through these new defense challenges and architect the right \nforce for our Nation for the new century. I will give the \nadministration the time it needs to work through these issues as they \npresent a new budget.\n  As a member of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee and Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I fully appreciate \nthe challenges that President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld face as they \ntry to rebuild our military and simultaneously set us on the right \ncourse for this new century.\n  It is not going to be an easy job. There are a lot of needs. We have \na lot of ground to make up and a lot of new things to do. In the \nmeantime, like Chairman Warner, I expect a new administration will be \nrequesting a supplemental. But that is not my decision to make. I am \nhopeful that will be the case.\n  There is no better way to understand the needs of our military than \nto get out of Washington and visit them. As I said, I salute the \nPresident for doing that. I went on the U.S.S. Nassau, and one of the \nsailors walked up to me and said: Senator, is there any reason why a \nmember of the United States Navy like me who is an E2 cannot get sea \npay? I am serving aboard ship, and everybody from E4 and above gets sea \npay, and those of us at E1, E2, and E3 don't.\n  We are going to take care of that. That matter has already been \nbrought to the attention of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee in the Senate as well as the relevant committees in the House \nof Representatives.\n  But it felt good to be back at sea. It felt good to be on board ship. \nIt reminded me of my service aboard the U.S.S. Navasota during the \nVietnam war. It didn't feel good enough to reenlist, but it was a great \ntime. There were 13 members of the U.S. Navy and Marines on board from \nNew Hampshire. We listened, had lunch, and we talked. They deserve our \nsupport. They deserve compensation commensurate with the rest of \nAmerica.\n\n  From E1 to E3--the lowest pay grades in the Navy serving aboard that \nship swabbing the decks and doing all the hard work--don't get sea pay, \nand those E4s and above do. That is wrong. We are going to take care of \nthat.\n  All of our sailors face the same threat. They deal with the same \npersonal issues while they are away from home and family. They have \nchildren to raise. They have things to do that they miss--all kinds of \nfamily things they miss while they are away while we ask them to do it. \nThey shouldn't be on food stamps and should have a reasonable salary. \nThey ought to be compensated fairly. We are going to take care of the \nsea pay with legislation this year so that those E1 and E3 sailors will \nbe compensated.\n  I appreciate the military's current desire to hold out the prospect \nof sea pay as a reenlistment bonus. However, these sailors are paying \nthe same price at sea as the senior sailors. To say you can serve your \nfirst elected tour of duty and not get it, but if you re-up, we will \ngive to it to you, is simply wrong. We will find another incentive to \nget them to re-up. I think, frankly, for them to re-up, we should tell \nthem we are going to appreciate you and we are going to pay you sea pay \nbecause you are away from your home and family.\n  In addition to some of the readiness problems and personnel issues we \nare dealing with now in the military, I think one of the biggest \nchallenges Secretary Rumsfeld is going to face is space and how we \nutilize space. Of course, Secretary Rumsfeld understands that as well \nas anybody. He chaired the space commission, so-called, that was \ncreated in our Armed Services defense bill. I was proud to be the \nauthor of that language. One of the plain reasons is the U.S. economy \nis so strong that we should use our satellite capabilities to fuel our \nnew information-based science. Satellites support Americans every day. \nI don't think we realize how important they are. They support our \nweather, help hunters and boaters navigate; they provide pagers and \ntelephones to communicate with travelers anywhere on the surface of the \nEarth.\n  But we cannot stop there, however. We must also keep our promises to \nthose who have already given a lifetime of service to this country.\n  Just as our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were there for us, \nprotecting us--we must be there for our veterans and military retirees.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to eliminate the \nmilitary survivor's benefit penalty.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will repeal the existing reduction in \nthe Survivor Benefit Plan spouses currently suffer when they reach the \nage of 62.\n  Today, after years of paying heavy premiums for this optional \nbenefit, survivors of military retirees receive 55 percent of their \nspouses service pay prior to age 62. However, once these spouses reach \nage 62, their benefits are drastically reduced to only 35 percent. The \noverwhelming majority of these beneficiaries are women. This reduction \nin benefits will have a devastating effect on their quality of life.\n  In addition to eliminating this reduction in benefits which retired \nmilitary spouses incur when they turn 62,\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\nspouses whose loved one passed away after their 62nd birthday will also \nreceive full 55 percent.\n  Passage of this important legislation will bring the military \nSurvivor Benefits Plan more in line with other Federal and civil \nservants employee health plans.\n  After a lifetime of sacrifice, we owe it to our military retirees to \nprovide them with peace of mind that their spouse will be taken care of \nafter their death.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support our retirees and pass \nthis legislation immediately.\n\n  One of the many important defense challenges President Bush and \nSecretary Rumsfeld face is protecting America's lead in space \nactivities. One of the main reasons the U.S. economy is so strong is \nour use of satellite capabilities to fuel our new information-based \nsociety.\n  Satellites support Americans every day. For example, they support our \nweather forecasts, help hunters and boaters navigate, provide pagers \nand phones that can communicate with travelers anywhere on the surface \nof the earth, and allow farmers to check on the health of their fields.\n  Our soldiers, sailors, and airmen also rely on space assets. \nAccordingly, the utilization of space will also be at the forefront of \nour national security agenda during this century, and I will work to \nensure that America expands its leadership in this military arena.\n  To help the nation better posture for that future challenge, I \nauthored the provision in the FY2000 Defense Authorization Act that \ncreated a commission 2 years ago called the ``Commission to Assess \nNational Security Space Management and Organization,'' more commonly \nknown today as the Space Commission.\n  Coincidentally, the chairman chosen last year to lead that commission \nbecame our new Secretary of Defense--Donald Rumsfeld.\n  Last month, they finished their work, and I commend Secretary \nRumsfeld, the commissioners, and the staff for their outstanding work, \nand for thoroughly pulling together a great deal of research and data.\n  The Commission's findings confirm my long-held view of the growing \nimportance of space to the nation and my belief that space management \nand organization reforms are urgently needed as America's commercial, \ncivil, and military reliance on space assets expands.\n  The Commission's recommendations lay the foundations for what I have \noften maintained--military space activities should evolve to the \neventual creation of a separate Space Force.\n  The United States has shown the world the value of space in providing \ninformation superiority on the modern battlefield.\n\n  As we move into the new century, we need to: Defend our current \nspace-based information superiority; be able to deny our adversaries \nthat same capability (thorough programs I have long supported like KE-\nSAT and Clementine); and leverage the uniqueness of space to be able to \nrapidly project military force around the world (thorough programs I \nhave long supported like Space Plane).\n  We need a strong advocate for space to fight for and justify these \nnew space programs needed for the 21st century in competition with many \nother pressing military investment requirements.\n  Near-term management and organization reforms recommended by the \nCommission will begin to put in place the leadership and advocacy for \nspace programs that have long been lacking.\n  Another of the many defense challenges President Bush and Secretary \nRumsfeld face is protecting America from missile attack.\n  I salute the administration's commitment to deploying a robust \nmissile defense for this nation. Many Americans don't realize that the \nUnited States does not have a defense against a missile attack today.\n  Meanwhile, for years, Russia has deployed various missile defenses \naround Moscow and other sites which has been ignored by ABM Treaty \nproponents. These missiles could carry weapons of mass destruction--a \nnuclear, chemical, or biological warhead that could wreak havoc on a \nU.S. city. We have a constitutional responsibility to defend America. \nHomeland defense from missile attack is essential.\n  With such a threat hanging over our leader's head, it is impossible \nto contemplate engaging globally in the best interest of the United \nStates--no President would risk a U.S. city to come to the aid of an \nally.\n  Worst yet, countries like China and North Korea continue to \nproliferate missile technology to rogue nations.\n  I am pleased that the President and his Cabinet have been so pro-\nactive in explaining this important issue to our allies.\n  A U.S. missile defense system, both theater and national is not \nintended as a threat to any nation. It is intended to defend America, \nand we have a duty to deploy such a defense.\n  While I salute the military's efforts to develop a near-term missile-\ndefense capability, I want to work with the administration to ensure we \nhave a robust, multilayered architecture that includes the current \nland-based concept with sea-, air-, and space-based systems to \neliminate this threat to U.S. cities and our deployed forces.\n  Today, President Bush visited the only NATO facility on U.S. soil at \nthe Joint Forces Command at Norfolk, VA. President Bush watched an \nallied U.S.-NATO coordinated response to a simulated missile attack.\n  I understand the President commented ``Pretty exciting technology, \nand it's only going to get better.`` I agree that this technology is \nonly going to get better. America needs to make a commitment to protect \nit's citizens from threats that come on a missile, including biological \nand chemical weapons.\n  I look forward to working with the new administration, President Bush \nand Secretary Rumsfeld, to rebuild our military and set the nation on \nthe right course for the new century.\n  Let me assure the military, help has arrived.\n  Finally, continuing on the area of missile defense, this is a very \nimportant challenge faced by President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld in \nprotecting the United States. Over the last several years, I have been \ninvolved in so many debates on the floor, so many discussions. I know \nthe Senator from Oklahoma has as well. We are trying to save a national \nmissile defense program only to have it put off with some wordsmithing \nor delay. I salute President Bush's commitment to deploying a robust \nmissile defense for this Nation. It is immoral not to do it.\n  I also salute, because it was his birthday a few days ago, President \nReagan on his 90th birthday for being the visionary he was on this \nissue. It was Ronald Reagan who really convinced Gorbachev that we \ncould have built that thing 20 years ago when, in fact, we couldn't. \nBecause he convinced Gorbachev that we could and that it might be a \nthreat to him, the Soviet Union essentially folded as the threat that \nit was to the world in the cold war for so long. Ronald Reagan knew \nthis could be done. He was laughed at, still is to some extent on that \nissue. But 10, 15, 20 years from now, when we have this thing up and \ngoing and it is protecting our troops in the field, protecting our \nallies and protecting our own homeland, Ronald Reagan will get the \ncredit he deserves so richly for coming up with that visionary promise \nof a missile defense system.\n  Russia has deployed various missile defenses around Moscow and other \nsites which have been ignored by the ABM Treaty proponents. These \nmissiles could carry weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical, \nand biological, that could wreak havoc on a U.S. city, and we have \nbasically ignored it. We have a constitutional responsibility to defend \nAmerica.\n  I can remember seeing little tapes of so-called focus groups where \nthey would ask 15 or 20 people in a room what would happen if another \nnation, such as China or Iran or Iraq, fired a missile at the United \nStates of America. All of them answered: We would shoot it down. All of \nthem were wrong. We do not have the capability to shoot down such a \nmissile, but we need that capability. We need the capability to shoot \nit down over the aggressor's homeland, not over ourselves. So that is \nwhere this missile defense system is so important.\n  I hear the criticisms: It won't work; it is too expensive; we don't \nneed it.\n  The bottom line is, if we can defend America from any missile attack, \nwhether it be accidental or deliberate\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nor whatever, we need to do it. That is our obligation. We have a \nconstitutional responsibility to defend America. Homeland defense from \nmissile attack is the moral thing to do. With such a threat hanging \nover our leader's head, it is impossible to contemplate engaging \nglobally in the best interests of the United States. No President \nshould risk a U.S. city to come to the aid of an ally.\n  And worst yet, China, North Korea, and other nations continue to \nproliferate missile technology. There is some really shocking \ndocumentation, both public as well as classified, that will tell us \nthat this is a serious matter. I am pleased the President and Secretary \nof Defense and his Cabinet have been so proactive in explaining this \nimportant issue to our allies. I understand that Secretary Rumsfeld \nwent to Europe, was very forceful to our allies, saying: You are free \nnations. You have the right to your views, but our view is we need to \nprotect ourselves and to defend this system and build this system, and \nwe are going to do it.\n  In closing, I will just say I look forward to working with President \nBush, working with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to \nimprove our readiness, to improve pay for our military and benefits, to \ncut all of the excessive operations throughout the world that are not \nreally related to defense and get our military morale back. It is going \nto be exciting, and I look forward to being a part of it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the legislation in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nhis comments about the need for deployment of a national missile \ndefense. I spoke to that subject this morning, when I talked about \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's remarks in Munich that were very \nwell received by our allies. They had some concerns about the \ndeployment of a national missile defense by the United States. But \nafter his comments to them, they were very much reassured. While there \nstill isn't the degree of support that we need and that we would like \nto have among our allies, I believe the consultations now occurring, \nand those that will occur in the future, primarily led by the Secretary \nof Defense, will bring our allies to the same conclusions that we have \nreached; namely, that we need to get on with it and that they can \nparticipate in this kind of assistance to the extent they want to as \nwell. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Hampshire. I \nspoke to that issue this morning.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 307. A bill to provide grants to State educational agencies and \nlocal educational agencies for the provision of classroom-related \ntechnology training for elementary and secondary school teachers; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Representative Lois Capps and I \nare introducing legislation to help teachers use technology in their \nteaching, the Teacher Technology Training Act of 2001.\n  This bill has three major provisions:\n  It authorizes $100 million for state education departments to award \ngrants to local public school districts on the basis of need to train \nteachers in how to use technology in the classroom.\n  It specifies that grants may be used to strengthen instruction and \nlearning, provide professional development, and pay the costs of \nteacher training in using technology in the classroom.\n  It requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate the technology \ntraining programs for teachers developed by school districts within \nthree years.\n  This bill is needed because teachers say they need to learn how to \nuse computers and other technology in their teaching. A 1999 Education \nWeek poll found that 27 percent of teachers have had no training in \ncomputers, 31 percent have had one to five hours, and 17 percent have \nhad six to ten hours. This means that 75 percent of teachers have had \nless than ten hours of training in how to use computers. In a 1999 \nsurvey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, only 23 percent \nof teachers said they felt ``well prepared'' to integrate educational \ntechnology into instruction. ``Most teachers want to learn, but they \nsay it takes time and they need help,'' says Linda Roberts, Director of \nEducational Technology, U.S. Department of Education.\n  In many schools, the students know more about how to use computers \nthan the teachers do. In one Kentucky school profiled by Inside \nTechnology Training magazine, the students run the school's computer \nsystems. The article quoted the school district's technology \ncoordinator as saying that the students had ``long surpassed'' what the \nteachers could do and reported that one student had recently trained \ntwenty teachers on software for Web page construction (``Fast Times at \nKentucky High,'' Inside Technology training, June 1998).\n  In addition to helping teachers teach, technology proficiency is \nbecoming crucial to survival. Most good jobs require experience using \ncomputers. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has said, \n``Opportunities are now dependent upon a person's ability to use \ncomputers and engage in using the Internet,'' CQ Weekly, ``Digital \nHaves and Have Nots,'' April 17, 1999.\n  The economy of California is a case in point as it shifts away from \nmanufacturing and toward higher-skill service and technology \nindustries. Employers are placing a high premium on the computer skills \nnecessary for these positions. Students are better prepared when their \nteachers are well trained. We cannot educate students for the \nincreasingly technological workplace without trained teachers.\n  We have made great efforts to make technology available to students \nin their classrooms. Eighty percent of California's schools have \nInternet access.\n  But computers are of little value if people do not know how to use \nthem and in school, they can become diversions or entertainment, \ninstead of learning tools without trained teachers.\n  If we expect teachers to be effective, we must give them up-to-date \nskills, knowledge, and tools. This includes training.\n  By introducing this bill, I am not suggesting that technology is a \ncure-all for the problems in our schools. Technology is one of many \nteaching and learning tools. It can bring some efficiencies to \nlearning, for example, providing a new way to do math and spelling \ndrills, making learning to write easier, providing easier access to \ninformation that without a computer is time-consuming and cumbersome to \nobtain.\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\n  We expect a great deal from our teachers and students. We must give \nthem the resources they need. This bill is one step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 308. A bill to award grants for school construction; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Excellence \nin Education Act of 2001.\n  The purpose of this bill is to 1. reduce the size of schools; 2. \nreduce the size of classes; and 3. bring accountability to the use of \nthese funds. The bill would create a matching grant program to build \nnew schools to meet the following size requirements:\n  For kindergarten through 5th grade, not more than 500 students, for \ngrades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students and for grades 9 through \n12, not more than 1,500 students.\n  For kindergarten through grade 6, not more than 20 students per \nteacher and for grades 7 through 12, not more than 28 students per \nteacher.\n  The bill authorizes $1 billion each year for the next five years for \nthe\nU.S. Department of Education to award grants to local school districts. \nSchool districts would have to match federal funds with an equal \namount. In addition to making the above reductions, school districts \nwould be required to terminate social promotion, provide remedial \neducation, and require that students be subject to state achievement \nstandards in the core academic curriculum.\n  This bill will provide a new funding source for school districts or \nstates to match to build new schools and reduce both school size and \nclass size. There is no good estimate of how many schools would be \nneeded to reduce schools and classes to the levels specified in the \nbill, but we all know that there are too many large schools and large \nclasses in public education today.\n  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build \n6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This \nestimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school \nsizes. Consequently, the need for the funds my bill would authorize is \nhuge.\n  Why do we need this bill?\n  First, many of our schools are just too big, especially in urban \nareas. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. Some \nschools have as many as 4,000 students. In fact, half of American high \nschool students go to schools that have 1,500 students or more.\n  Equally serious is the fact that our classes are too big. Even though \nwe have begun to reduce class sizes in the lower grades in California, \nit still has some of the largest class sizes in the United States.\n  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class \nsizes are reduced. The Oakland, California, school district plans to \nopen 10 new small schools in the next few years. The Oakland tribune \nexplained it like this on October 18, 2000: ``Small schools are viewed \nas antidotes to huge, factory-like campuses commonplace in America's \ninner cities. Research has shown that small schools create intimate \nlearning atmospheres for students and teachers.''\n  The U.S. Department of Education cites studies that list these \nbenefits of small schools: students have a greater sense of belonging; \nfewer discipline problems occur; crime, violence and gang activity go \ndown; alcohol and tobacco abuse decline; dropout rates fall and \ngraduation rates rise; and student attendance increases.\n  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high \nschool size is between 600 and 900 students. Studies show that small \nschools have higher academic achievement, fewer discipline problems, \nlower dropout rates, higher levels of student participation, higher \ngraduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's \nschool administrators are calling for smaller, more personalized \nschools.\n  A Tennessee study called Project STAR placed 6,500 kindergartners in \n330 classes of different sizes. The students stayed in small classes \nfor four years and then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. \nThe test scores and behavior of students in the smaller classes were \nbetter than those of children in the larger classes. A similar 1997 \nstudy by Rand found that smaller classes benefit students from low-\nincome families the most.\n  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, \nask more questions, and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools \nand smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.\n  California has some of the largest schools in the country; Los \nAngeles has some of the largest classes and schools in the world! Here \nare some examples in the Los Angeles area: Hawaiian Elementary, 1,365 \nstudents; South Gate Middle School, 4,442 students; Belmont High \nSchool, 4,874 students.\n  California also has some large classes, even though we have made \ngreat progress in reducing teacher-to-pupil ratios in the lower grades. \nStill today, many middle and high school English and math classes are \nvery large, up to as many as 39 students.\n  The American public supports increased federal funding for school \nconstruction. The Rebuild American Coalition last year found that 82 \npercent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, up \nfrom 74 percent in a 1998 National Education Association poll.\n  Every parent knows the importance of a small class in which the \nteacher can give individualized attention to a student. Every parent \nknows the importance of the sense of a community that can come with \nattending a small school. And every parent knows that big schools and \nbig classes can be a stressful learning environment.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in passing this important \neducation reform.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to specify the purposes for which funds provided under subpart 1 \nof part A of title I may be used; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill designed \nto better direct and refocus ESEA Title I funds on academic \ninstruction. The goal of this bill, titled ``The Title I Integrity \nAct,'' is to target Title I funds on learning and to get ``more for our \nmoney'' from the largest Federal elementary-secondary education \nprogram.\n  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the \ncountry for services to children attending schools with high \nconcentrations of low-income students, from preschool through high \nschool. It has been the ``anchor'' of Federal assistance to schools, \nsince its origin in 1965. For Fiscal Year 2000, funding for Part A \nbasic grants to school districts is almost $8 billion.\n  This bill would specify in law how Title I funds can and cannot be \nused by schools. It seeks to direct Title I funds to uses that improve \nacademic achievement and help students meet state achievement \nstandards.\n  The bill says that ``a local educational agency shall use funds . . . \nonly to provide academic instruction and services directly related to \nthe instruction of students in preschool through grade 12 to assist \neligible children to improve their academic achievement and to meet \nachievement standards established by the State.''\n  Permitted uses include these: Interventions and corrective actions to \nimprove student achievement; extending academic instruction beyond the \nnormal school day and year, including summer school; the employment of \nteachers and other instructional personnel (including employee \nbenefits); instructional services to pre-kindergarten children for the \ntransition to kindergarten; the purchase of instructional resource such \nas books, materials, computers, and other instructional equipment and \nwiring to support instructional equipment; development and \nadministration of curriculum, educational materials and assessments; \nand transportation of students to assist them in improving academic \nachievement.\n  Uses explicitly not permitted are these: The purchase or lease of \nprivately-owned facilities; the purchase or provision of facilities \nmaintenance, janitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the \npayment of utility costs; the construction of facilities; acquisition \nof real property; food and refreshments; travel to and attendance at \nconferences or meetings; and the purchase or lease of vehicles.\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague. It says, ``A State or local \neducational agency shall use funds received under this part only to \nsupplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of such \nFederal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the \neducation of pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, \nand not to supplant such funds.''\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given states a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can currently be used. Permitted uses \nare for the following: instructional practices; counseling, mentoring; \ndeveloping curricula; salaries; employee benefits; renting privately-\nowned facilities; janitorial services; utilities; mobile vans; training \nand professional development; equipment; interest on lease purchase \nagreements; travel and conferences; food and refreshments; insurance \nfor vehicles; parent involvement activities.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: (1) construction or acquisition of real property; and (2) \npayment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to \nreimburse a parent for salary lost due to attendance at ``parental \ninvolvement'' meeting.\n  My reason for introducing this bill is this: Our students are not \nlearning; our schools are failing our children. We must use our limited \nfederal dollars for the fundamental purpose of education: to help \nstudents learn.\n  Just this week I learned that a January 2001 study by Education \nWeekly, titled ``Quality Counts 2001: A Better Balance,'' brought more \nbad news about California's students. Here's what the report found:\n  In fourth grade reading, 20 percent of students are proficient and 52 \npercent are below the basic standard.\n  In eighth grade reading, 22 percent of students are proficient and 36 \npercent are below the basic standard.\n  Comparing California to other states, in how well fourth grade \nstudents read, California ranks 36 out of 39 states. In eight grade \nreading, California ranks 32 out of 36 states.\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\n  Nationally, the news is similarly distressing:\n  U.S. eighth graders are out-performed by their counterparts in math \nand science from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, Australia and \nCanada (Third International Math and Science Study, December 5, 2000). \nThe 1999 study showed virtually no improvement for U.S. students over \n1995.\n  American twelfth graders performed in mathematics better than \nstudents in only two countries, Cyprus and South Africa.\n  In writing, 75 percent of U.S. school children cannot compose a well-\norganized, coherent essay, concluded the National Assessment for \nEducation Progress (NAEP) in September 1999.\n  While it is difficult to really ascertain exactly ow Title I funds \nare always being used, we do know of a few examples of uses that raise \nquestions in my mind:\n  In Alabama, schools ``dipped into Title I to pay the electric bill \nand for janitorial services.'' Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights.\n  While most of Title I's $8 billion appear to be spent on instruction, \nthe Los Angeles Times, in a March 12, 2000 editorial, said, ``About \nhalf that amount is wasted on unskilled though well-meaning teacher \naides, who are often more baby-sitter than instructor.''\n  Title I has been used ``to pay for everything from playground \nsupervisors and field trips to more time for nurses and counselors.'' \nSan Diego Tribune, March 16, 2000.\n  California school officials have told my staff that Title I has been \nused for pay for clerical assistants in school administrative offices, \npayroll staff, truant officers, schoolyard duty personnel, school bus \nloading assistants, ``curriculum coordinators,'' ``compliance,'' \nattending conferences, and home visits.\n  It is time to put an end to the notion that Title I can be everything \nto everyone, that it can fund all the services that schools need. \nFederal funding is only seven percent of total funding for elementary \nand secondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of \ntotal support for public schools. We must get the most that we can \neducationally for our limited dollars.\n  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of \neducation: to help students learn. This bill is one step toward that \ngoal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Title I Integrity Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON FUNDS.\n\n       Subpart 1 of part A of title I (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 1120B (20 U.S.C. 6323) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1120C. LIMITATIONS ON FUNDS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, a local educational agency shall use funds received \n     under this subpart only to provide academic instruction and \n     services directly related to the instruction of students in \n     preschool through grade 12 to assist eligible children to \n     improve their academic achievement and to meet achievement \n     standards established by the State.\n       ``(b) Permissible and Prohibited Activities.--In this \n     section, the term `academic instruction'--\n       ``(1) includes--\n       ``(A) the implementation of instructional interventions and \n     corrective actions to improve student achievement;\n       ``(B) the extension of academic instruction beyond the \n     normal school day and year, including during summer school;\n       ``(C) the employment of teachers and other instructional \n     personnel, including providing teachers and instructional \n     personnel with employee benefits;\n       ``(D) the provision of instructional services to pre-\n     kindergarten children to prepare such children for the \n     transition to kindergarten;\n       ``(E) the purchase of instructional resources, such as \n     books, materials, computers, other instructional equipment, \n     and wiring to support instructional equipment;\n       ``(F) the development and administration of curricula, \n     educational materials, and assessments; and\n       ``(G) the transportation of students to assist the students \n     in improving academic achievement; and\n       ``(2) does not include--\n       ``(A) the purchase or lease of privately owned facilities;\n       ``(B) the purchase or provision of facilities maintenance, \n     gardening, landscaping, or janitorial services, or the \n     payment of utility costs;\n       ``(C) the construction of facilities;\n       ``(D) the acquisition of real property;\n       ``(E) the payment of costs for food and refreshments;\n       ``(F) the payment of travel and attendance costs at \n     conferences or other meetings; or\n       ``(G) the purchase or lease of vehicles.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 310. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at 1 \nCourthouse Way in Boston, Massachusetts, as the ``John Joseph Moakley \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague, \nSenator Kerry, in introducing this legislation to name the U.S. \ncourthouse in the city of Boston after a wonderful friend and an \noutstanding leader, Congressman, Joseph Moakley, who announced \nyesterday that he will not be candidate for re-election next year \nbecause of a serious illness that has just been diagnosed.\n  Congressman Moakley has served Massachusetts and the nation with \ngreat honor throughout his long and brilliant career in public service. \nLike the rest of my colleagues, I'm deeply saddened by Joe's \nannouncement yesterday.\n  As dean of our delegation, Joe's leadership in Congress is invaluable \nand indispensable for the people of Massachusetts--and the whole nation \ntoo. He's a true giant in Congress, and I'm proud to serve with him.\n  Joe's has been at the forefront of many great battles of national and \ninternational importance. No one is more effective in Congress on the \nfront lines or behind the scenes. He has touched the hearts of all our \npeople, and he's made a remarkable difference in their lives and hopes. \nHe's a voice for the voiceless, and for all those who need our help the \nmost. He champions the cause of hard-working families and the middle \nclass--and all of us are proud to be there with him, on the front-lines \nin all these battles.\n  When I look back over the many years that Joe Moakley has served in \nCongress, I think of the important progress we've achieved--the battles \nwe've waged and won--for decent and affordable health care--for good \neducation, so that more children can have a better start in life and a \nchance to go to colelge--for better jobs, greater opportunities, fairer \nwages, and safer working conditions--for a cleaner environment--for \nequal rights for women and an end to discrimination in the workplace--\nfor civil rights at home and human rights in other lands. And above \nall, in countless nations around the world, Joe Moakley is renowned for \nhis extraordinary achievement in protecting and defending the \nfundamental human rights of all the people of El Salvador.\n  He has fought long and hard and well for funds to rebuild the Central \nArtery--to build the South Boston Piers Transitway--to clean up Boston \nHarbor--to modernize the Port of Boston--and to preserve Massachusetts' \nmany historic sites--the old State House, the Old South Meeting House, \nthe USS Constitution, Dorchester Heights, and Boston's historic \nmarketplace, Faneuil Hall. Joe Moakley's efforts to protect and \npreserve these many sites guarantee that they'll be an important part \nof our state's history and heritage for many years to come.\n  And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Few, if any, Members of \nCongress have done so much for so many for so long.\n  When the chips are down, Joe Moakley is always there when we need him \nmost. If President Kennedy were here today, we all know what he'd day--\nhe'd call Joe Moakley a true profile in courage.\n  Thoughout his career, Joe Moakley has worked brilliantly, effectively \nand tirelessly to promote the highest ideals of public service. He is \nan outstanding statesman, leader, and legislator. I commend him for his \nleadership, and I look forward to the early enactment of this \nlegislation as a tribute to a man who has served the city of Boston, \nCongress, and the country so well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr, Cochran, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mr. Frist, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 311. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide for partnerships in character education: to the \nCommittee on\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is an issue on which I have been \nworking for 7 years; that is, character education in our schools, both \npublic and private. The bill I sent to the desk has seven cosponsors \nfrom both parties. I ask other Senators who are interested in helping \nat the grassroots level in public schools and private schools, who want \nto bring Character Counts to their character education in their \nschools, that they might consider this bill. I would like to speak a \nlittle bit about character in our Nation and in our schools.\n  I rise today with my friend, Senator Dodd, who is my principal \ncosponsor, although we now have Senators Frist, Kennedy, Harkin, \nCleland, and Cochran. This bill is called the Strong Character for \nStrong Schools Act. It is not a very big program, and it does not \ninterfere very much at all with the schools, but it does provide for \nmoney to be granted to public school systems, partnerships between \nState agencies and others, bringing character, or character kind of \nprograms, into the schools.\n  Last month, I listened with great pleasure to President Bush's \ninaugural address. He basically ticked off the tenets of good character \nthat underscore American life. The President's speech was clearly a \nmessage about character and the importance of character in American \ndaily lives. In his speech, the President touched on many elements of \ngood character. I found it especially telling when the President \nemphasized the necessity of teaching every child these principles and \nthe duty of every citizen to uphold these very same principles.\n  I am going to quote a number of people. Let me quote Theodore \nRoosevelt, one of our great Presidents. He said:\n\n       Character, in the long run, is the decisive factor in the \n     life of an individual and of our Nation.\n\n  What I have been principally involved in, in our State of New Mexico, \nis called Character Counts. Six pillars of character are promoted in \nthe schools. Almost all of them use the same six pillars: \nTrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship.\n  I would submit that character truly does transcend time as well as \nreligious, cultural, political, and socio-economic barriers.\n  I believe President Bush's renewed focus on character sends a \nwonderful message to Americans, and will help those of us involved in \ncharacter education reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved.\n  I say that because it was not too long ago, during the last \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, re-authorization, that \nSenators Nunn, Dodd and I included a provision in the bill to fund \npilot projects to increase character education.\n  Since then, the Department of Education has made $25 million in \n``seed money'' grants available to 28 States to develop character \neducation programs. Currently, there are 36 States that have either \nreceived Federal funding, or have enacted their own laws mandating or \nencouraging character education.\n  In New Mexico, over 230,000 kids and nearly 90 percent of our schools \nparticipate in some form of character education.\n  Most of New Mexico utilizes a wonderful character curriculum called \n``Character Counts,'' which was established by Michael Josephson, a \nrenowned ethicist from the Josephson Institute in California.\n  Character Counts emphasizes six pillars of good character: \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship. The point is that teachers like this approach. These six \npillars are not based on any particular religion or philosophy. They \nmerely represent the kind of values that everybody can agree are \nimportant for our children.\n  I first learned of Character Counts after reading about it in a \nnationally syndicated newspaper column. I subsequently, found out that \none school in my State had decided to try the program, and that it \nseemed to be working.\n  Character Counts started in New Mexico in 1993 at the Bel Air \nElementary School in Albuquerque. Bel Air had disciplinary problems, \nand teachers and the principal were looking for ways to address those \nproblems. One of Bel Air's counselors, Mary Jane Aguilar, along with \nDon Whatley, a teacher, suggested that the school try a new approach, \ncalled Character Counts.\n  They took the six pillars, with training from the Josephson \nInstitute, and began integrating them into the daily lives of their \nstudents. Within 6 months of integrating Character Counts into the \ndaily curriculum at Bel Air, the teachers noticed that disciplinary \nepisodes were fewer and that the students began to treat each other \nbetter.\n  After hearing of the success at Bel Air, I invited the mayor of \nAlbuquerque in 1994 to join me in forming the Character Counts \nLeadership Council, to bring together community leaders, schools, \nteachers, parents, and students for the purpose of expanding Character \nCounts in Albuquerque and throughout the State. And after our initial \nefforts, I worked to establish Character Counts partnerships in other \nparts of the State, and the program spread quickly throughout New \nMexico.\n  Since then, I have helped bring Character Counts to over 70 schools \nand communities in New Mexico. Places like Farmington, Santa Fe, \nRoswell, Portales, Carlsbad, Silver City, Hobbs and Las Cruces. And in \neven smaller communities like Espanola, Mountainair, Dexter, Hagerman, \nLake Arthur, Artesia, Capitan, Carrizozo, Lovington, Eunice, Jal, \nTatum, Alamogordo, Socorro, Deming, and Gallup.\n  As I travel around New Mexico, in virtually every town I have noticed \nschool billboards with things like: ``The word for the month of May is \n`citizenship.' Character Counts!'' It is everywhere in the schools in \nNew Mexico and I am proud to be a part of the program.\n  Additionally, many of our communities now have adopted Character \nCounts in afterschool programs like the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and \n4-H. So when kids leave the classroom for after-school activities, they \nare still being taught how to make decisions based on the six pillars.\n  I think what we are starting to see in New Mexico is the beginning of \nthe Character Counts Generation--young people entering high school, who \nare bringing with them the lessons they have learned through Character \nCounts.\n  Mr. President, I could go on for quite some time talking about \nCharacter Counts in New Mexico. The bottom line is that I believe it is \nworking in New Mexico and other parts of the country.\n  Consequently, I think we need to encourage more character education \nby providing a little more seed money for these worthwhile programs.\n  So today, Senator Dodd and I are here to introduce a bill to \naccomplish just that.\n  The Strong Character for Strong Schools Act seeks to encourage the \ncreation of character education programs at the State and local level \nby providing grants to eligible entities.\n  Grant recipients would use the funding to design and implement \ncharacter education programs incorporating the following elements: \ncaring, civic virtue and citizenship, justice and fairness, respect, \nresponsibility, trustworthiness, and any other elements developed by \nthe program.\n  ``Eligible entities'' would include partnerships of, one, a State \nEducational Agency, SEA, and one or more school districts, two, an SEA, \none or more school districts, and one or more nonprofit organizations, \nthree, one or more school districts, or, four, a school district and a \nnonprofit organization. Nonprofit organizations could be institutions \nof higher education.\n  The program would be authorized at $50 million for fiscal year 2002 \nand such sums as may be necessary for each of the four succeeding \nfiscal years.\n  I also want to emphasize that our bill does not dictate to States \nwhich character education program to implement. Rather, the bill merely \nprovides states general guidelines and allows them to adopt whatever \nprinciples or pillars they choose after consultation with their \ncommunities.\n  Hopefully, our renewed effort will bring together even more \ncommunities to ensure that character education is a part of every \nchild's life. And with the successful passage of the legislation we\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nare introducing today, our new Secretary of Education, Rodney Paige, \nwill be in a position to help make these programs a reality.\n  Thank you and I hope that my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Mexico leaves \nthe floor, I ask permission to join as a cosponsor of this most \nimportant legislation. It appears to be bipartisan. We have the two \nleading Democrats on the Education Committee plus Republicans. It \nshould be a bill that we can pass.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am grateful that the distinguished minority whip \nwould join. We will be working together on this bill. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, in introducing the Strong Character for \nStrong Schools Act. Senator Domenici and I have worked together for \nmany years on this important issue. We established the Partnerships in \nCharacter Education Pilot Project in 1994 and have worked regularly \nsince then to commemorate National Character Counts Week. So, I am \npleased that today we are introducing the Strong Character for Strong \nSchools Act to help expand States' and schools' ability to make \ncharacter education a central part of every child's education.\n  Our schools may be built with the bricks of English, math and \nscience, but character education certainly is the mortar. This \ninitiative ensures that our children's character, as well as their \nminds, receives care and nurturing in our schools. Character education \nmeans teaching students about such qualities as caring, citizenship, \nfairness, respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, and other qualities \nthat their community values.\n  Character education provides students a context within which to \nlearn. If we view education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our \nchildren, then we will not only miss an opportunity, but will \njeopardize our future. Character education isn't a separate subject, \nbut part of a seamless garment of learning. For example, at Waterford \nHigh School, in Connecticut, as part of the character education \nprogram, math students designed a ramp for kids who use wheelchairs. \nThe students learned about math, but also about caring.\n  Theodore Roosevelt said that ``[t]o educate a person's mind and not \nhis character is to educate a menace.'' That may be, but I prefer Dr. \nMartin Luther King's exhortation that we judge each other not by the \ncolor of our skin, but by the content of our character.\n  A recent survey of high school students by the Character Counts \nCoalition found that during the preceding year, 71 percent cheated on \nan exam; 92 percent lied to their parents and 78 percent lied to a \nteacher; about 35 percent had stolen from a store; and 16 percent were \ndrunk in school. This doesn't mean that these are bad kids, but it does \nmean that we need more character education.\n  We know that these programs work. Schools across the country that \nhave adopted strong character education programs report better student \nperformance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student \ninvolvement with the community. Children want direction--they want to \nbe taught right from wrong. The American public wants character \neducation in our schools, too. Studies show that about 90 percent of \nAmericans support schools teaching character education.\n  Virtually all national education organizations are involved in \npromoting character education. Last June, the Connecticut Department of \nEducation, on behalf of many State organizations, issued a Call to \nAction letter, outlining a program to improve the school climate in all \nConnecticut schools. And, the Connecticut Education Association has \ndeveloped its own character education program that teaches kids about \nnot bullying and other behaviors that can disrupt schools and make it \ndifficult for children to learn.\n  As all education policy should be, character education is bi-\npartisan. When Senator Domenici and I introduced a resolution last \nCongress establishing National Character Counts Week, we had 57 co-\nsponsors, with broad support in both parties. And President Bush, in \nhis education plan, calls for increased funding for character \neducation.\n  Our children may be one-quarter of our population, but they \ndefinitely are 100 percent of our future. That's why this measure is so \nimportant--it provides a helping hand to our schools and communities to \nensure that children's futures are bright and filled with opportunities \nand success. So, I am confident that not only are we doing the right \nthing here, but that we will see this bill become law along with other \neducation reforms, this Congress.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, when I was a boy growing up in Lithonia, \nGA, I was privileged to have accomplished and dedicated teachers who \nprovided me with a strong foundation in the three R's. Thanks to their \ncapable and committed efforts, I received an excellent education in \nreading, writing, and arithmetic. And thanks to their good example and \ntheir ability to teach through inspiration, I was also well versed in \nthe fourth R, which I call ``respect.''\n  What my teachers demonstrated so effectively almost five decades ago \nis that character education is essential to any well-rounded system of \neducation. We can work together to help ensure that all children in \nAmerica will start school ready to learn. We can pool our efforts--\nparents, teachers, community leaders, and elected officials--to enable \nour students to be first in the world in scientific and academic \nachievement. But I believe the greatest gift and most effective tool we \ncan give to our children is to instill in them, from the beginning, the \nvalues and beliefs which help mold their character. Character is the \nessential building block in each youngster's journey to become a \nresponsible, moral adult. It is the gift my teachers gave me when they \noffered me a first-rate education which addressed not only matters of \nthe head, but of the heart as well.\n  Thanks, in part, to the efforts of my distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Domenici and Dodd, character education has spread into \nthousands of classrooms throughout this nation. In 1994, Senator \nDomenici with the support of Senators Dodd and Mikulski offered a \nsuccessful amendment to the Improving America's Schools Act which \nestablished, for the first time ever, a grant program in the Department \nof Education to enable State education agencies, in partnership with \nlocal education agencies, to develop character education programs. My \nState of Georgia was one of the first to receive funding under the \nPartnerships in Character Education Pilot Projects. Since its inception \nin 1995, this program has awarded more than $25 million to 37 States \nthroughout the country. I am proud to join my colleagues today in \nintroducing legislation to expand this worthy program which encourages \nschools and communities to develop and sustain character education \nprograms of excellence.\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n  It has been said that the character of a nation is only as strong as \nthe character of its individual citizens. In illustration of this \ntruth, I like to tell a true story which happened decades ago during \nthe war in Korea. At that time, one of our generals was captured by the \nCommunists. He was taken to an isolated prison camp and told that he \nhad but a few minutes to write a letter to his family. The implication \nwas that he was to be executed shortly. The general's letter was brief \nand to the point: ``Tell Bill,'' he wrote, ``the word is integrity.''\n  The word is indeed integrity. This following Monday, Presidents' Day, \nI will host a Summit on Character at the State Capitol in Georgia, \nwhich will be attended by State leaders from across the political and \nsocial spectrum. The purpose of the Summit is to rekindle the American \nspirit that motivated the Founders in constituting our nation and to \ninspire Georgians to develop the highest standards of character in \nthemselves and in the youth of our State. Benjamin Franklin once said \nthat ``The noblest question in the world is, What good may I do in \nit?'' The Character Summit in Georgia has this in common with the \nlegislation we are introducing today: They both seek to encourage moral \ncharacter and civic virtue in our children--America's most precious \nresource and the future of this great Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 312.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ndeclaratory judgement relief for section 521 cooperatives; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss legislation I'm \noffering today on behalf of myself and Senators Baucus, Brownback, \nBurns, Lugar, Roberts, Craig, Enzi, and Nelson from Nebraska this \nafternoon. It will assist millions of farmers across the nation. I've \nnamed the bill the Tax Empowerment and Relief for Farmers and Fishermen \nAct, or what I will refer to as TERFF.\n  I'm a farmer, like my father was before me. I understand farming and \nhow policy decisions from Washington impact hardworking farmers, like \nmy son Robin. Before I ran for elected office and after I leave, God \nwilling, I'll still be farming. There is little that I feel more \nstrongly about than providing the agriculture community potential to \nsurvive and thrive. As far as I'm concerned, agriculture is my ``terf'' \nand as long as I'm in this town, I'll do all I can to serve my friends \nand neighbors in the agriculture community.\n  This legislation has already been adopted by the Senate multiple \ntimes. In the midst of a serious downturn in the agriculture economy, \nit seems to me we ought to be doing everything we can to help farmers, \nand this would provide significant assistance.\n  For example, my agriculture tax package will include:\n  The Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts--these farmer \nsaving accounts would allow farmers to contribute up to 20 percent of \ntheir income in an account, and deduct it in the same year. Farm \naccounts would be a very important risk management tool that will help \nfarmers put away money when there's actual income, so that, in the bad \ntimes, there will be a safety net. This measure has strong bipartisan \nsupport and was actually sent to President Clinton, who vetoed it.\n  Farmers who participate in the Conservation Reserve Program CRP, are \nunnecessarily struggling during tax season because of a recent case \npushed by the IRS. The latest 6th Circuit court's ruling treats CRP \npayments as farm income subject to the additional self employment tax \nrate of 15 percent.\n  Senator Brownback has taken the lead on fixing this problem. This \nunfair tax not only ignores the intent of Congress in creating the CRP, \nit discourages farmers from using environmentally pro-active measures. \nAt a time when farmers are struggling to regain their footing \neconomically and do the right thing environmentally--it's important \nthat Congress support them by upholding it promise on CRP.\n  Senator Lugar has led the effort to expand the current program where \ncompanies can donate to food banks, so that farmers and restaurants can \nalso donate surplus food directly to needy food banks. This will be a \nwin for the farmers and a big win for people who depend on food bank \nassistance.\n  This was also part of the vetoed tax bill. When we passed income \naveraging for farmers a few years ago, we neglected to take into \naccount the problem of running into the alternative minimum tax, which \nmany farmers are facing now. My bill will fix this growing problem.\n  My bill expands opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need \nof low interest rate loans for capital purchases of farmland and \nequipment.\n  Current law permits state authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and \nto lend the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers \nand ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and \nequipment used in a farm or ranch operation.\n  Unfortunately, aggie bonds are subjected to a volume cap and must \ncompete with big industrial projects for bond allocation. Aggie bonds \nshare few similarities to industrial revenue bonds and should not be \nsubjected to the volume cap established for industrial revenue bonds.\n  Insufficient allocation of funding due to the volume cap limits the \neffectiveness of this program. We can't stand by and allow the next \ngeneration of farmers to lose an opportunity to participate in farming \nbecause of competition with industry for reduced interest loan rates.\n  Recently the IRS determined that some cooperatives should be exposed \nto a regular corporate tax due to the fact that they are using organic \nvalue-added practices rather than manufactured value-added practices. \nThis is unfair, and needs to be fixed.\n  And of course my package wouldn't be complete without a provision \nleveling the playing field for ethanol producers.\n  The Small Ethanol Producer Credit will allow small cooperative \nproducers of ethanol to be able to receive the same tax benefits as \nlarge companies. This provision provides cooperatives the ability to \nelect to pass through small ethanol producer credits to its patrons.\n  The ``TERFF'' package will do more to reform taxes for the American \nfarmer than any other measure in recent memory.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Grassley and \nothers to introduce the TERFF Act, Tax Empowerment and Relief for \nFarmers and Fisherman.\n  This bill includes several provisions providing tax relief that will \nhelp our nation's farmers.\n  First, this bill will create FFARRM, Farm, Fish and Ranch Risk \nManagement, Accounts that will provide farmers, ranchers and fishermen \nwith additional money management tools. Agricultural producers will be \nallowed to contribute up to 20 percent of their annual income into \nthese accounts. The tax on this income will be deferred for up to five \nyears or until the depositor withdraws the money.\n  The bill will amend the tax code to ensure that farm cash rents are \nnot subject to an additional 15 percent self-employment tax. \nAdditionally, the bill will ensure CRP, Conservation Reserve Program, \npayments are not subject to the same self-employment tax. I have also \nco-sponsored a similar CRP bill with Senator Brownback from Kansas.\n  The bill will also enable States to expand opportunities for \nbeginning farmers who are in need of low interest\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nloans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment.\n  The bill provides that interest, rent and royalty payment made by a \nsubsidiary to a non-profit are not subject to a unrelated business \nincome taxes. The bill provides a tax deduction to farmers and ranchers \nwho donate food to hunger relief organizations.\n  The bill will correct a problem experienced by farmers who use income \naveraging by ensuring that farmers are not disqualified from using \nincome averaging due to the alternative minimum tax, AMT, calculation.\n  The bill would reapply taxes on cooperatives using animal value-added \npractices in the same way as cooperatives using manufactured value-\nadded practices. Furthermore, it would allow cooperative producers of \nethanol to receive the same tax benefits as large corporations. The \nbill will also allow farmer cooperatives to use preferred stock to \nraise equity capital.\n  This bill will help our nation's farmers and ranchers. The \nagriculture sector of our nation's economy needs the relief.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to address a \nconcern of farmers in my State of Wyoming and throughout the United \nStates. This legislation, which I am introducing with the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, as well as the \nsenior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, is designed to clarify a \nprovision in the Internal Revenue Code and its accompanying regulations \nwhich has been broadly interpreted to impose self-employment (SE) taxes \non rental income from real estate even though such income was generally \ndesigned to be exempt from SE taxes.\n  Under Section 1402(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, rental income \nfrom real estate was only intended to be subject to the SE taxes when, \none, the income is from an arrangement between an owner and lessee \nthat, two, requires the lessee to produce agricultural or horticultural \ncommodities on the land; and, three, there shall be material \nparticipation by the owner or tenant with respect to any such \nagricultural or horticultural commodities. The problem all goes back to \nambiguity of the term ``arrangement'' in this section. This section has \nbeen interpreted to by the IRS to apply not only to the specific lease \nagreement itself, but also to other extraneous production or management \narrangements between the owner and his lessee. Accordingly, the IRS has \nhit many small self-employed farmers with a tax penalty that they never \nexpected and which was never envisioned when Congress wrote the section \nof the Internal Revenue Code in question.\n  The legislation I am introducing today clarifies this section by \nreplacing the term ``arrangement'' with ``agreement,'' indicating that \nthe lease agreement itself must specify the requisite responsibilities \nof the owner in order to be subject to the SE tax. As in so much of \nwhat we do here, a small change in words can have a dramatic impact on \npeople's lives. By clarifying what I believe was intended by Congress \nall along, we will save numerous farmers the heartache and expense of \nlitigating with the IRS over whether rental income from their real \nestate is subject to SE tax. This small change in the tax code will \nprovide considerable tax relief to farmers in my home State of Wyoming \nand throughout the United States. I thank Chairman Grassley for his \nsupport of this important legislation and I urge my colleagues to enact \nthis important relief for America's family farmers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Levin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burns, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Craig, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Bingaman,  and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 315. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \npayments under the Conservation Reserve program as rentals from real \nestate; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am speaking on a bill that I put in \ntoday, along with several cosponsors, regarding the Conservation \nReserve Program Tax Fairness Act.\n  To be a farmer today, you really need to be an optimist--about the \nweather, about farm prices, about our rapidly changing economy. But one \nthing farmers should not have to worry about is being additionally \ntaxed for participating in a conservation program.\n  I rise today to introduce the Conservation Reserve Program Tax \nFairness Act of 2001. This bill would simply correct the tax treatment \nof one of our nation's most valuable conservation programs so that \nthere is not a disincentive for farmers to be good stewards of the \nland.\n  I am joined in this effort by Senator Dorgan who has taken an active \nrole on this issue last year and serves as the lead cosponsor of the \nbill this year. This bill is also co-sponsored by Senators Daschle, \nLugar, Levin, Roberts, Burns, Jeffords, Baucus, DeWine, Harkin, Craig, \nJohnson, and Leahy.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this bill has the bipartisan support \nof many in the Senate because it is just common sense. In a time when \nthe farm economy continues to suffer and conservation efforts are more \nimportant than ever, we should be doing everything we can to make \nconservation efforts more appealing, not less. And if there is one \ntruth that is pretty evident here, it is that if you want less of \nsomething, than tax it. Well, Mr. President, I think we can all agree \nthat we want more conservation, not less, and therefore, we need to \ncorrect this tax interpretation.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, has been a great success \nfor this Nation. The program provides financial incentives for \nimproving and preserving environmentally sensitive land, taking it out \nof production and enhancing its environmental benefit. The CRP program \nincreases water quality, wildlife habitat and prevents soil erosion--\nall factors which have become even more important in light of recent \nconcerns about nonpoint source pollution in our nation's waterways.\n  Specifically, this measure clarifies once and for all that CRP \nconservation payments from the Government are not subject to self-\nemployment social security taxes--a rate of up to 15 percent of the \npayment amount. Currently, there is confusion over how CRP payments \nshould be taxed owing to a recent court case in the 6th Circuit Court \nof Appeals. This case overturned a 1998 Tax Court ruling that CRP \npayments are not subject to Social Security taxes because they are a \nrental payment the Government makes in exchange for farmers taking \nenvironmentally sensitive land out of production. Since other rental \npayments are exempt from this additional tax, CRP payments were \nconsidered exempt as well.\n  As a result of this confusion, there is now a discrepancy between \nactive farmers who take part in CRP, which are now subject to the tax \nbecause it is considered income, and landowners who do not farm but \ntake part in CRP and are exempt from the tax. Clearly, this is not what \nCongress intended when it set up this program.\n  Furthermore, the new court ruling has inspired the IRS to \naggressively seek back taxes on CRP payments, as far back as the 1996 \ntax year. That could amount to tens of thousands of dollars for farmers \nwho are already struggling through economic hard times.\n  In my State of Kansas alone, $102.7 million in CRP payments were \nissued in 1999. Are we really going to tell farmers that this money--\npromised them for conservation purposes--will now be additionally taxed \nall the way back to 1996? This would amount to a disincentive for \nfarmers to participate in environmental and conservation programs \nbecause they cannot trust that there won't be some hidden penalty down \nthe road. Is that the message this body really wants to send?\n  This tax makes no sense. Since CRP land is not used for agricultural \nproduction, it should not be considered farm income--but rather rental/\nreal estate income as the Tax Court originally ruled. CRP payments are \ndifferent from traditional setaside programs because the program \nrequires strict adherence to environmental standards. The farmer is \ncontracting with the Government for an environmental benefit. Why on \nEarth would we choose to tax him for it?\n  We must also consider the state of the farm economy today. \nAgriculture\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nis one of the few industries in this country which has not been blessed \nwith a prolonged booming economy. This is the worst possible time to \nburden farmers with additional taxes.\n  This bill received enthusiastic support in the last Congress. In \nfact, this measure was approved unanimously in the Senate last year as \npart of a larger tax bill, but, unfortunately, was not able to make its \nway into law. In addition to strong Senate support, this bill has the \nbacking of numerous farm groups including: the National Corn Growers, \nNational Wheat Growers, American Soybean and Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociations--along with the National Farmer's Union and the American \nFarm Bureau.\n  My colleagues, one of the privileges we have as Members of the Senate \nis to be able to correct legislative wrongs that hurt our constituents. \nThis may be a minor thing in the larger scheme of the tax debate, but \nit is of vital importance to our Nation's farmers. I urge you all to \njoin me in this effort.\n  If I may summarize, this Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness \nAct of 2001 is to remove taxation on CRP and put it back to where it \nwas when the program was first put forward. That program pays farmers \nto idle land to be able to build it up, conserve it, to be able to \nbuild wildlife up on these tracts of land. It has been very successful.\n  What has taken place or occurred is that the IRS has taken farmers to \ncourt and said they should be taxed for self-employment income for CRP \npayments, which was never the intent of Congress when it passed that. \nThat was not to take place. Yet the lower court in that one circuit \nruled that that is, indeed, correct and that they should be taxed a \nself-employment tax on that income.\n  Today Senators Dorgan, Roberts, and myself held a press conference \nintroducing this bill to clarify this issue and to remove the self-\nemployment tax on CRP payments. I think this is a key provision. I hope \nwe are able to move forward on it.\n  Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, is supporting us \nin this effort, and he put it in an overall farm tax relief package. At \nthis time, when we have so much difficulty in the farming economy, it \nis important to clarify that we are not going to tax people in a \nsituation that they should not be taxed in and where it was never \nintended for them to be taxed.\n  This bill previously passed the Senate last year. It has strong \nbipartisan support. The list of original cosponsors is as follows: \nSenators Daschle, Lugar, Levin, Roberts, Burns, Jeffords, Baucus, \nDeWine, Harkin, Craig, Johnson, Leahy, and Bingaman. I hope more will \njoin us as well. I hope this not only clears the Senate this year, but \ngets through to the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Conservation Reserve Program \n     Tax Fairness Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM PAYMENTS AS \n                   RENTALS FROM REAL ESTATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1402(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (defining net earnings from self-employment) is \n     amended by inserting ``and including payments under section \n     1233(2) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. \n     3833(2))'' after ``crop shares''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to payments made before, on, or after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Brownback and \na number of our colleagues today in introducing the Conservation \nReserve Program Tax Fairness Act of 2001. This much-needed legislation \nwould clarify that Conservation Reserve Program payments received by \nfarmers are treated for tax purposes as rental payments from real \nestate not subject to self-employment taxes.\n  For over a decade, many farmers have agreed to take out of farm \nproduction environmentally-sensitive lands and place them in the \nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) for an extended period. In return, \nthese farmers receive an annual rental payment from the Commodity \nCredit Corporation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Over the past several years, the IRS has waged an aggressive campaign \nto try to re-characterize CRP rental payments as net earnings from \nself-employment and subject to self-employment taxes. I believe that \nthe IRS's position here is dead-wrong.\n  North Dakota has about 3.3 million acres with $109 million in rental \npayments in the CRP program. The IRS's position means that farmers in \nNorth Dakota could be mailed a tax bill from the IRS for more than $16 \nmillion in added federal taxes this year alone. A typical North Dakota \nfarmer with 160 acres in CRP would have a CRP payment of $5,280 and \nwould owe nearly $800 in self-employment taxes because of the IRS's \nill-advised position. To make matters worse, if the IRS pursues back \ntaxes on returns filed by farmers in past years, the amount of taxes \nowed by individual farmers could amount to thousands of dollars.\n  I believe that it is absolutely ludicrous for the IRS to load up \nfarmers with an added tax burden at the very time that our nation's \nfamily farmers are struggling with high fuel costs and record high \nfertilizer prices while commodity prices are at record low levels. \nGiven these circumstances, where are the nation's family farmers \nsupposed to come up with the $231 million in additional taxes the IRS's \ninterpretation of CRP rental payments imposes on them?\n  In our judgment, the Congress never intended this tax result. In \nfact, the U.S. Tax Court understood this very point, when it ruled in \n1998 that the IRS's interpretation of CRP payments was improper and \nthat CRP payments are properly treated by farmers as rental payments \nand, thus, not subject to self-employment taxes. Regrettably, the U.S. \nTax Court's ruling was later reversed by a federal appellate court as \nthe IRS continues to litigate the matter.\n  We think that most of our colleagues understand that the current IRS \nposition is not what Congress intended, nor is it supportable in law in \nour judgment. That's probably why, for example, the Senate unanimously \nagreed to an amendment I offered to the marriage penalty reduction bill \nlast summer that included language to clarify the proper tax treatment \nof CRP payments as rentals not subject to self-employment taxes. \nHowever, my amendment with its CRP language and other amendments were \nstripped from the final version of that bill and this critical CRP \nchange was not included in any other tax bills signed into law by the \nPresident in the last Congress.\n  With the legislation we introduce today, Congress can tell the IRS \nthat its mistaken effort to treat CRP payments as net earnings from \nself-employment will not be allowed to stand. I, along with the other \ncosponsors, urge you to support this change by cosponsoring our bill \nand working with us to get it added to any major tax legislation passed \nby Congress this year.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Brownback and \nothers to introduce the CRP, Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness \nAct. This bill will clarify Congressional intent that the CRP was not \nintended to be subject to self employment social security taxes.\n  In a 1999 decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that \nCRP payments could no longer be treated as real estate rental income a \nstatus that would make those payments exempt from social security \ntaxes.\n  The CRP provides financial incentives for improving and preserving \nenvironmentally sensitive land--taking it out of production and \nenhancing its environmental benefit. The CRP program increases water \nquality, wildlife habitat and prevents soil erosion--all factors which \nhave become even more important in light of recent concerns about \nnonpoint source pollution in our nation's waterways.\n  This case overturned a 1998 Tax Court ruling that CRP payments are \nnot subject to social security taxes because they are a rental payment \nthe government makes in exchange for farmers taking environmentally \nsensitive land out of production. Since other rental payments are \nexempt from this additional tax, CRP payments were considered exempt as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\n  As a result of this confusion, there is now a discrepancy between \nactive farmers who take part in CRP--which are now subject to the tax \nbecause it is considered income--and landowners who do not farm but \ntake part in CRP and are exempt from the tax. Clearly, this is not what \nCongress intended when it set up this program.\n  This bill will allow farmers and ranchers the ability to rest assured \nonce and for all that conservation payments made by the government will \nnot be subject to the high tax rate imposed by social security self-\nemployment--a rate of 15 percent of the payment--in future years. As a \nresult, working farmers will enjoy the same status as non-farm \nlandowners in this program which encourages conservation of land, water \nand wildlife.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Frist, Mr. Miller, \n        Mr. Lott, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sessions, \n        and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 316. A bill to provide for teacher liability protection; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, with my \ncolleagues Senators Gregg, Frist, Miller, Lott, DeWine, Enzi, \nHutchinson, Sessions, and Carper, The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher \nLiability Protection Act. This important legislation extends \nprotections from frivolous lawsuits to teachers, principals, \nadministrators, and other education professionals who are acting within \nthe scope of their professional responsibilities.\n  The Teacher Liability Protection Act builds upon the good work \nCongress began in 1997 when it enacted the Volunteer Protection Act. As \nyou may recall, the Volunteer Protection Act provides liability \nprotections to individuals serving their communities as volunteers. \nAfter bringing several volunteer protection amendments to the floor \nthroughout the 1990's and introducing the Volunteer Protection Act \nduring the 104th Congress, I was honored to work with our colleague, \nSenator Paul Coverdell, to steer this measure through the 105th \nCongress and have it enacted in 1997.\n  Now, we need to extend similar liability protections to our nation's \nteachers, principals, and education professionals who are responsible \nfor the safety of our children when they are at school.\n  Everyone agrees that providing a safe, orderly environment is a \ncritical component of ensuring that every child is able to reach their \nfull academic potential. Teachers who are unable to maintain order in \nthe classroom cannot reasonably be expected to share their knowledge \nwith their pupils, whether it be in math, science, or literature. \nDisruptive, rowdy, and sometimes violent students not only threaten the \nimmediate safety of their classmates, they threaten the very future of \nour children by denying them the opportunity to learn.\n  Unfortunately, teachers, principals, and other education officials \nshare an impediment in their efforts to ensure that students can learn \nin a safe, orderly learning environment: the fear of lawsuits. All too \noften, these hard-working professionals find their reasonable actions \nto instill discipline and maintain order are questioned and second \nguessed by opportunistic trial lawyers.\n  Today's teachers will tell you that the threat of litigation is in \nthe back of their minds and forces them at times to act in a manner \nwhich might not be in the best interests of their students. A 1999 \nsurvey of secondary school principals found that 25 percent of the \nrespondents were involved in lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in \nthe previous two years--an amazing 270 percent increase from only ten \nyears earlier. The same survey found that 20 percent of principals \nspent 5-10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events in an effort \nto avoid litigation. This is time that our educators should spend \ncounseling students, developing curriculum, and maintaining order--not \nfending off frivolous lawsuits.\n  The legislation is structured similarly to the Volunteer Protection \nAct of 1997 and is nearly identical to teacher protection legislation \nintroduced by Paul Coverdell (S. 1721) in the 106th Congress. Simply \nput, the bill extends a national standard to protect from liability \nthose teachers, principals, and education professionals who act in a \nreasonable manner to maintain order in the classroom. It does not \npreempt those States that have already taken action to address this \nproblem and it allows any state legislature that disagrees with these \nstrong protections to opt out at any time. Since this bill builds on \nSen. Coverdell's fine work, my colleagues and I thought it would be \nhighly appropriate that it bear his name.\n  At the same time, it is important to note that this legislation is \nnot a ``carte blanche'' for that minuscule minority of school officials \nwho abuse their authority. The bill does not protect those teachers who \nengage in ``willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, \nor a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety'' of a \nstudent. Nor does the bill preclude schools or local law enforcement \nentities from taking criminal, civil, or administrative actions against \na teacher who acts improperly. Rather, the bill is simply designed to \nprotect those teachers, principals, and educational professionals who \nact responsibly from frivolous lawsuits.\n  From a historical context, this is not new ground for our colleagues \nin the Senate. During the 106th Congress, Senator Coverdell sucessfully \nincluded his legislation in the Senate's verison of the ESEA \nReauthorization bill. Unfortunately, as we all know, efforts to \nreauthorize the ESEA stalled on the Senate floor. It is now appropriate \nfor the Senate to revisit this issue, and I hope give its full \nendorsement.\n  I look forward to working with my fellow original co- sponsors and \nthe rest of the Senate to see that these important protections are \nenacted into law on behalf of America's hard working and dedicated \nteachers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 316\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION.\n\n       The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C 6301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n                ``TITLE XV--TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION\n\n     ``SEC. 15001.

Mr. President, today I add my support to the Teacher \nLiability Protection Act, a bill first introduced by my predecessor \nSenator Paul Coverdell. Like him, and like my colleagues with whom I \nintroduce this bill today, I firmly believe in the promise that the \neducation of our children provides. An important part of fulfilling \nthat promise is ensuring that our classrooms are a secure place in \nwhich to learn. And, as a result, teachers and principals are called \nupon every day to maintain order in our schools. In doing so, they \nshould not be subject to frivolous lawsuits. Nor should the fear of \nsuch litigation prevent educators from acting reasonably and quickly in \nthis regard.\n  The bill we introduce today seeks to eliminate that fear and to \nreassure educators that they can and should perform this necessary part \nof their job without hesitation. The bill provides limited immunity for \nteachers, principals, and other education professionals for any \nreasonable actions they take in an effort to discipline students or \nmaintain order in the classroom. In addition, it limits the \navailability of punitive damages and damages for non-economic loss in \nthose suits that do proceed.\n  I also think that it is important to discuss what this bill does not \ndo. It does not prevent proper accountability for teachers and \nprincipals who act intentionally, or even recklessly. Nor does it \nprotect them if they violate state or federal law. Finally, this bill \nrecognizes the authority of states on this issue by allowing states the \nability to opt out of its provisions and leaving untouched any state \nlaw that provides greater immunity from liability. In sum, this bill \nprovides an important and necessary baseline of protection for teachers \nand principals who are on the front line of our national struggle to \nimprove education, and to fulfill the promise of our children's future.\n  I believe this Congress has a unique opportunity to improve education \nin our country. I hope that my colleagues will give this bill careful \nconsideration, and support it as an important part of that effort.\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Mitch \nMcConnell, in introducing the Paul Coverdell Teacher Liability \nProtection Act of 2001.\n  Senator Coverdell, recognizing the value of those individuals who \nsacrifice their time, money and energy to serve others, was a true \nleader in protecting both volunteers and teachers. In 1997, he \nsuccessfully ushered the Volunteer Protection Act through Congress. \nToday, as a result of Senator Coverdell's efforts, volunteers can \ngenerously give their time and services without the threat of frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  Last year I joined Senator Coverdell in offering a teacher amendment \nduring floor consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, ESEA. That amendment contained several provisions impacting \nteachers, but the bulk of the amendment was the Teacher Liability \nProtection Act. I am pleased to say that this amendment was passed by \nthe Senate by a vote of 97 to 0, and a nearly identical measure was \npassed by the House by a vote of 358 to 67. The overwhelming support \nthat this amendment received during the 106th Congress clearly \nillustrates the bipartisan nature of this initiative. Although Congress \ndid not complete work on ESEA before the end of the session, I am very \noptimistic that the new President will sign into law an education \nreform bill this year and that bill will include the Paul Coverdell \nTeacher Liability Protection Act.\n  Our nation's public schools have become more violent, and teachers do \nnot feel safe in their own classrooms. Today, more than half our \nnation's school teachers have been verbally abused, 16 percent have \nbeen threatened with injury and 7 percent have been physically \nattacked. Parents and students alike report that the behavior of some \nstudents completely interferes with the learning of others. As our \nschools have increasingly felt the effects of violence, drug use and a \nbreakdown of discipline, it is necessary for teachers to use reasonable \nmeans to maintain order, discipline and a positive educational \nenvironment. However, teachers continuously find themselves the targets \nof frivolous lawsuits when they are forced to restore order in the \nclassroom. Our nation's educators need to feel free to appropriately \nand swiftly discipline disruptive, unruly and unmanageable students to \nensure the safety and education of all the children under their \nsupervision.\n  Currently, unless a teacher is fortunate enough to work in a state \nthat has liability laws that protect teachers, many teachers are \nhesitant to take action or intervene for fear of a lawsuit. This \nlegislation would help to correct this sad situation.\n  The Paul Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act was modeled after \nthe Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and several state liability laws. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to protect teachers from frivolous \nlaw suits when attempting to remove a disruptive or belligerent student \nfrom a classroom.\n  Specifically, it provides limited civil liability immunity for \nteachers and principals who engage in reasonable acts to maintain order \nand preserve a safe and educational environment in their classrooms and \nschools. The bill is narrowly crafted to focus on protecting reasonable \nacts that fall within the scope of a teacher's responsibilities in \nproviding education services. The bill does not protect teachers who \nengage in wanton and willful acts of misconduct, criminal acts or \nviolations of state and federal civil rights laws. The Teacher \nLiability Protection Act simply protects teachers and other education \nprofessionals from liability for harm caused to an individual by \nreasonable acts carried out in accordance with local, state and federal \nlaws, as well as rules and regulations for controlling, disciplining, \nexpelling or suspending a student from a classroom or school. \nAdditionally, this legislation stipulates that punitive damages may not \nbe awarded against a teacher unless the claimant establishes by clear \nand convincing evidence that harm was caused by an action that \nconstituted willful or criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n  Furthermore, it is important to note that this legislation does not, \nin any way, supercede any state law that provides teachers with greater \nimmunity from liability. Moreover, states can opt out of the provisions \nof this bill by passing state legislation exempting them from the \nTeacher Liability Protection Act.\n  I conclude by saying that we have a unique opportunity this year to \nimprove our nation's public schools, and we should start with \nprotecting its teachers. As you know, teachers are our most precious \nresource in the classroom, and to continue to place them at risk in \ntheir jobs, and not give them the protection they so desperately need \nis a shame. It is high time that we recognize teachers and principals \nfor who they are; professionals that go to great lengths to help our \nchildren learn. Creating a safe-zone in which they are not subject to \nbeing dragged through the courts for ensuring the safety and education \nof the students in their classrooms should be a priority as we \nundertake education reform in the 107th Congress. That is why I stand \nhere today to join Senator McConnel in empowering our nation's teachers \nto take back control of our classrooms and create an environment where \nthey can teach and their students can learn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 318. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday we read the first news accounts \nof the first analysis ever of the human genetic code--what some have \ncalled ``the blueprint of human life'' itself. Today, Senators Kennedy, \nHarkin, Dodd, and I are introducing a bill to make sure this stunning \nnew knowledge is used to help Americans, not hurt them. Our bill is \ncalled the ``Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and \nEmployment Act.'' It says simply that genetic information may not be \nused to discriminate against Americans in health insurance or \nemployment. An identical measure will be introduced tomorrow in the \nHouse by more than 150 Republican and Democratic co-sponsors.\n  The genetic revolution has the potential to dramatically improve \nhealth care. Genetic technology can greatly improve our ability to \ntreat and even cure now-incurable illnesses. Genetic tests can tell \nwhether a person is at risk of developing certain diseases years before \nsymptoms appear, giving her either peace of mind--or critical time to \nreduce her risks. But the scientific and commercial value of the human \ngenome project will be seriously undermined if people refuse to take \ngenetic tests because they fear the results may be used against them.\n  That is not just our opinion. That warning has been sounded \nrepeatedly by the two men who understand genetic testing better than \nanyone in the world--the scientists in charge of the two teams that \nmapped the human genome. Dr. Craig Venter and Dr. Francis Collins. At a \nWhite House ceremony last June where Doctors Venter and Collins \nunveiled the sequencing of the human genome, they warned that our laws \nwere not keeping pace with science and urged Congress to pass strong \nfederal protections against genetic discrimination. As Dr. Collins put \nit: ``If we needed a wake-up call, isn't today the wake-up call?''\n  The question now is: Are we going to heed that warning? Or, are we \ngoing to turn a deaf ear? This bill is the test. It has four major \ncomponents. First, it forbids employers from using genetic information \nto decide who to hire or fire, and other terms and conditions of \nemployment. Second, it forbids insurers from using genetic information \nto deny or restrict coverage, or raise premiums. Third, it prevents \ndisclosure of identifiable genetic information to health insurers, \nhealth insurance data banks, employers--and anyone else who has no \nlegitimate need for the information. Finally, if these basic rights are \nviolated, our bill gives victims of genetic discrimination the right to \nhold the violator accountable in court.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n  It's been nearly three years since we first introduced this bill. \nBack then, some people said there was no need for these protections \nbecause there was no proof that genetic discrimination ever actually \noccurs. We got another wake-up call last Friday, when the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission went to court to challenge genetic \ntesting by an employer. The EEOC has asked the court to order the \nBurlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad to end its alleged policy of \nrequiring employees who claim work-related injuries related to carpel \ntunnel syndrome to undergo genetic testing--or lose their jobs.\n\n  The Burlington Northern case marks the first time the EEOC has ever \nbrought a genetic discrimination in court. But it is not the first case \nof genetic discrimination we've heard about in this Senate. Last July, \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a \nhearing specifically on genetic discrimination in employment and what, \nif anything, the Senate should do about it. I testified at that hearing \nabout a social worker who made the mistake of telling her co-workers \nthat she had been the primary care-giver for her mother, who had died \nof Huntington's disease. Despite her own good health and her long \nhistory of outstanding performance reviews, she was fired. Why? Because \nthere is a chance she might one day develop the same disease that \nkilled her mother.\n  I also testified about a 40-year-old mother of two young children who \nagreed to participate in a genetic research study. She tested positive \nfor BRAC1, the gene implicated in breast and ovarian cancer. After \nundergoing preventive surgery to remove her breast and ovaries to \nminimize the risk of cancer, she lost the insurance she received from \nher job. Then she lost her job. She, too, had a history of good work \nevaluations. Now she says she will never again participate in any \nhealth studies, and she will not allow her children to be tested.\n  While genetic discrimination may be relatively rare now, experts say \nthat's only because genetic tests are still relatively rare. As testing \nbecomes more affordable, and more common, experts tell us, the \nincidence of discrimination is likely to increase dramatically.\n  How many more times do we need to hear about lives that have been \nshattered by someone's misuse of genetic information before we say \nclearly: ``In America, you cannot discriminate against people because \nof their genetic makeup. Period.''\n  This is a matter that effects every one of us. We all have flaws in \nour genes.\n  With rare exceptions, genetic tests can't confirm if we will ever \ndevelop a particular disease. All they can tell us is that we might \nsome day develop the disease. Or we might not. Is it fair for employers \nto use genetic information in deciding who to hire and who to fire?\n  More than 10 years ago, we passed the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. We agreed then that, in this country, you can't discriminate \nagainst someone because of a disability. Can we really believe now that \nemployers and insurers ought to be allowed to discriminate against \nsomeone because he or she might someday develop a disability illness?\n  Last week, three insurance companies in England admitted for the \nfirst time that they test for Huntington's disease, a progressive and \nincurable neurological disorder. One insurer also admitted it uses \nexperimental tests for breast and ovarian cancer and Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  Do we have to wait until insurers in this country start using genetic \nscreening routinely before we set some reasonable legal guidelines for \ngenetic tests? How many more wake-up calls do we need?\n  Last summer, shortly after he and Francis and Collins unveiled the \nsequencing of the human genome, Craig Venter wrote me a letter. In it, \nhe warned that genetic discrimination ``is not a theoretical concern. \nToday, people who know they may be at risk for a genetic disease are \nforegoing diagnostic tests for fear they will lose their job or their \nhealth insurance.'' As a result, he said, ``the incentives for new \ndiscoveries and treatments based on our newly acquired genomic \ninformation are diminished, and the promising new era in medicine is \ndelayed.''\n  There are some who say strong federal protections are not needed \nbecause a number of states have already passed bills to prevent genetic \ndiscrimination. They're right about one thing: many states have passed \nlaws. I'm proud to report that South Dakota became the latest last \nFriday when it adopted legislation to curb the collection of a person's \ngenetic information without informed consent. In all, 37 states have \npassed bills regarding genetic discrimination in health insurance, and \n22 states have laws regarding genetic discrimination in the workplace.\n  Those laws represent progress. And they offer some protection. The \nproblem with the current patchwork of state laws is that it contains \nmajor loopholes. For example: some states protect only DNA and RNA. \nOther states extend protection to family history data and other medical \ninformation that could offer some genetic clues. In addition, because \nof federal exemptions, state laws offer no protections to the one-in-\nthree Americans who get their health insurance through their employer.\n  Others say this bill is not needed because the Americans with \nDisabilities Act already prohibits discrimination based on disability. \nThe problem with that theory is: it's never been tested. The Burlington \nNorthern case represents that first time a genetic discrimination suit \nhas been brought specifically on the grounds that it violates the ADA. \nMaybe the court will decide that the ADA does cover genetic \ndiscrimination. Maybe it will decide that it doesn't. Either way, a \ndefinitive answer could take years. What is the harm of us acting now \nto say clearly that genetic discrimination will not be tolerated in \nAmerica? What is the worst thing that could happen? That we end up with \ntwo laws, each protecting the same fundamental principle?\n  Last year, then-President Clinton signed an executive order banning \ngenetic discrimination in federal employment. Our bill seeks merely to \nextend the same protections to private workplaces and insurers. The \nprinciples in our bill are supported by both Dr. Craig Venter and Dr. \nFrancis Collins. They are also supported by the federal Advisory \nCommittee on Genetic Testing, the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and the departments of Labor, Justice, and Health and Human \nServices. More important, they are supported by a strong majority of \nthe America people.\n  At the beginning of our nation's history, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \n``laws and discoveries must go hand in hand with the progress of the \nhuman mind. As . . . new discoveries are made . . . institutions must \nadvance also to keep pace with the times.''\n  Our new knowledge about the genetic blueprint has the potential to \ndramatically improve our health and the quality of our lives. However, \nif we don't respond to the wake-up call now, this new knowledge also \nhas the potential to destroy lives. We simply cannot afford to take one \nstep forward in science, while taking two steps backwards in civil \nrights!\n  The legislation we offer today will enable us to move forward in a \nway that will benefit--and protect--all Americans. I thank my \ncolleagues--Senators Kennedy, Dodd, and Harkin--for all their help in \nthis endeavor. I also thank our colleagues in the House--particularly \nCongresswoman Louise Slaughter, for her tireless effort to move our \ncompanion bill to the floor in that chamber. And I urge my colleagues \nto join us in answering the wake-up call now so that we can make sure \nthe genetic revolution--which has been largely financed with American \ntax dollars--helps people--instead of hurting them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Genetic \nNon-discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act'' with \nSenator Daschle, Senator Dodd, Senator Kennedy, and other colleagues. \nThis bill would bring our nondiscrimination policies into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Genetic discrimination is a terribly important issue and one that I \nhave been following for quite some time now. My interest started in the \nlate 1980s when I was first involved in the effort to fund the Human \nGenome Project at NIH. Looking back over the past ten years, this was \none of the best investments our country has ever made. The advances in \nthe study of the human gene are mind-boggling. Last\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\nyear, the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics announced that \nscientists had mapped the entire human genome. Just yesterday, these \nsame scientists reported the probable number of human genes at 30,000 \nto 40,000 (only twice as many genes as your run-of-the-mill roundworm).\n  The impact of these discoveries will go far beyond the laboratory. \nThe mapping of the human genome will mean enormous gains in science and \nthe provision of health care. The identification of a number of \ndisease-related genes has already provided scientists with important \nnew tools for understanding the underlying mechanisms for many \nillnesses. And genomic technologies have the potential to lead to \nbetter diagnosis and treatment, and, ultimately, the prevention and \ncure of many diseases and disabilities.\n  However, without genetic discrimination protections, people will be \ndeterred from using genetic technologies that detect and prevent the \nonset of life-threatening diseases.\n  Discrimination in health insurance and employment, and the fear of \npotential discrimination, threaten our ability to conduct the very \nresearch we need to understand, treat, and prevent genetic disease. \nMoreover, discrimination--and the fear of discrimination--threaten our \nability to use new genetic technologies to improve human health. As a \nresult, our rapid, scientific progress could be rendered meaningless \nfor the every day American.\n  Let me give you just a few examples:\n  In the early 1970's some insurance companies denied coverage and some \nemployers denied jobs to African-Americans who were identified as \ncarriers for sickle-cell anemia, even though they were healthy and \nwould never develop the disease.\n  More recently, in a survey of people in families with genetic \ndisorders, 22 percent indicated that they, or a member of their family, \nhad been refused health insurance on the basis of their genetic \ninformation.\n  And a number of researchers have been unable to get individuals to \nparticipate in cancer genetics research. Fear of discrimination is \ncited as the reason why.\n  But this is more than just about numbers and anonymous individuals, \nit's about real people--including my own family. As many of you know, \nboth my sisters died from breast cancer. And other members of my family \nmight be at risk. Should I counsel them to get tested for the BRCA1 and \nBRCA2 mutations? Should I counsel them to disclose our family history \nto their health care providers?\n  Right now, I'm torn. I know that if my family is to have access to \nthe best available interventions and preventive care, they should get \ntested, and they should disclose our family's medical history to their \nphysicians. But, conversely, if they are to get any health care at all, \nthey must have access to health insurance. Without strong protections \nagainst discrimination, access to health insurance is currently in \nquestion.\n  In 1995, I introduced an amendment during the mark-up of the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act. My amendment clarified \nthat group health plans could not establish eligibility, continuation, \nenrollment, or contribution requirements based on genetic information. \nThe amendment became part of the manager's package that went to the \nfloor, and it ultimately became law.\n  HIPAA is a good first step. We should be proud of that legislation. \nYet if our goal is to ensure that individuals have access to health \ninsurance coverage and to employment opportunities--regardless of their \ngenetic makeup--we must ensure that they are protected against \ndiscrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup.\n  Our proposed legislation offers such protections. Let me describe \nthem in brief:\n  First, this legislation prohibits insurers and employers from \ndiscriminating on the basis of protected genetic information. It is \nessential to prohibit discrimination both at work and in health \ninsurance coverage. If we only prohibit discrimination in the insurance \ncontext, employers who are worried about future increased medical costs \nor increased sick time will simply not hire individuals who have a \ngenetic predisposition to a particular disease.\n  Second, under our proposal, health insurance companies are prohibited \nfrom disclosing genetic information to other insurance companies, \nindustry-wide data banks, and employers. If we really want to prevent \ndiscrimination, we should not let genetic information get into the \nwrong hands in the first place.\n  Finally, if protections against genetic discrimination are to have \nteeth, we must include strong penalties and remedies to deter employers \nand insurers from discriminating in the first place.\n  This bill will ensure that every American will enjoy the latest \nadvances in scientific research and health care delivery, without fear \nof retribution on the basis of their sensitive genetic information. All \nof us should be concerned about this issue, because all of us have \ngenetic information that could be used against us. As we move into the \nnew millennium, everyone should enjoy the benefits of 21st century \ntechnologies--and not be harmed by 21st century discrimination.\n  I applaud the commitment of my fellow co-sponsors on this important \nissue and look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to pass federal legislation that will prohibit genetic \ndiscrimination in the workplace and in health insurance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, over the past decade the science of \nidentifying genetic markers for diseases has evolved at an astonishing \npace. For an increasing number of Americans, science fiction has become \nreality--their doctors can now scan their unique genetic blueprints and \npredict the likelihood of their developing diseases like cancer, \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n  Armed with this knowledge, individuals and families can make informed \ndecisions about their health care including, in some cases, even taking \nsteps to prevent the disease or to detect and treat it early. \nUnfortunately, however, phenomenal advances in our knowledge about \ngenetics have outpaced the protections currently provided in law. Thus, \nthe potential also exists for this information to be used by health \ninsurers or employers to deny health coverage or job opportunities.\n  And, in fact, recent events have catapulted the issue of genetic \ndiscrimination from a potential concern to a devastating reality. Just \nthis week, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a \nlawsuit against an employer for requiring genetic testing of employees \nwho file injury claims. Additionally, a recent survey of over 2,000 \ncompanies conducted by the American Management Association showed that \n18.1 percent of companies require genetic or medical family history \ndata from employees or job applicants. According to the same survey, \n26.1 percent of the companies that require genetic or family medical \nhistory tests use the results of those tests in hiring decisions.\n  We know that Federal and State laws currently offer only a patchwork \nof protections against the misuse of genetic information. While the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 took \nimportant first steps toward prohibiting genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance, it left large gaps. For example, it does not prohibit \ninsurers from requiring genetic testing or from disclosing genetic \ninformation and offers no protection at all for people who must buy \ntheir insurance in the individual market. And, while several States, \nincluding Connecticut, have enacted legislation prohibiting health \ninsurance discrimination, these laws can not protect the 51 million \nindividuals in employer-sponsored ``self-funded'' health plans. \nAdditionally, few States have chosen to address the issues of \nemployment discrimination or the separate issue of the privacy of \ngenetic records.\n  I know from personal experience that this issue is not a partisan \none. Four years ago, I joined Senator Domenici in introducing one of \nthe first bills on this critical topic, addressing both insurance and \nemployment discrimination. And two years ago, along with many of my \nDemocrat colleagues, I joined Senator Snowe in supporting strong \nlegislation protecting patients from genetic discrimination in \ninsurance.\n  Today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator \nHarkin and Senator Kennedy in introducing comprehensive legislation to\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nsafeguard the privacy of genetic information and prohibit health \ninsurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information. \nSpecifically, this legislation would prohibit health insurers from \ndiscriminating based on genetic predisposition to an illness or \ncondition and would prevent insurers from requiring applicants for \nhealth insurance to submit to genetic testing. This bill would also \naddress concerns about employment discrimination by preventing \nemployers from firing or refusing to hire individuals who may be \nsusceptible to a genetic condition. Finally, this legislation holds \nemployers and insurers accountable by imposing strong penalties those \nwho violate these provisions.\n  Three years ago, in a visit to Yale University's Genetic Testing \nCenter I had the opportunity to glimpse cutting edge uses of that \ntechnology. I also had the opportunity, however, to hear the fears \nexpressed by the patients at the center. On that visit I met with Keith \nHall, who has been a patient at Yale for several years--since he was \nfirst diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis, a genetic disease that causes \ntumors of the brain, kidney and other organs, and sometimes mental \nretardation. Keith worries about what would happen to his insurance if \nhe ever had to switch jobs.\n  I also met with Ashley Przybylski, an 11-year-old girl from Oxford, \nCT. Ashley suffers from a genetic nutritional disorder that can cause \nseizures and brain damage. While currently the family's insurance \ncovers the exorbitant cost of the medication that keeps her healthy--\n$33,000 a year--Ashley faces the prospect of being denied coverage when \nshe gets older.\n  While we as a Nation welcome these scientific achievements, it is \ncritical we ensure that they be applied for the purposes of preventing \nor treating disease, rather than for denying health insurance or \nemployment to individuals. This issue is too important to ignore for \nyet another year. Each day that passes more individuals suffer \ndiscrimination. Each day that we fail to act, more families will be \nforced to make decisions about genetic testing based, not on their \nhealth care needs, but on fear.\n  I pledge my commitment to ensuring that continued progress in science \nis matched by progress in creating protections against discrimination \nand establishing fundamental rights to privacy. I'd like to again thank \nmy colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin for \njoining me in introducing this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week, scientists announced the \ncompletion of a task that once seemed unimaginable--deciphering the \nentire DNA sequence of the human genetic code. This amazing \naccomplishment is likely to affect the 21st century as profoundly as \nthe invention of the computer or the splitting of the atom affected the \n20th century.\n  These new discoveries bring remarkable new opportunities for \nimproving health care. But they also carry the danger that genetic \ninformation will be used--not to improve the lives of Americans--but as \na basis for discrimination. Discrimination on the basis of a person's \ngenetic traits--such as those associated with cancer, Huntington's \ndisease, or sickle cell anemia--is as unacceptable as discrimination on \nthe basis of gender, race, or religion. No American should be denied \nhealth insurance or fired from a job based on the results of a genetic \ntest.\n  People need access to genetic testing, in order to seek treatments to \nextend and improve their lives. Yet, the vast potential of genetic \nknowledge to improve health care will go unfulfilled, if patients fear \nthat information about their genetic characteristics will be used as \nthe basis for discrimination. Congress has a responsibility to \nguarantee that private medical information remains private, and that \ngenetic information cannot be used for improper purposes.\n  The Genetic Non-Discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act \nguarantees these protections. It gives the American people the \nprotections they need and deserve against genetic discrimination. It \nprohibits employers from using genetic information to discriminate in \nthe workplace in hiring, promotion, pay or other workplace rights and \nprivileges. And it gives victims of genetic discrimination the right to \nseek remedies through legal action.\n  In too many cases today the promise of genetic research is being \nsquandered, because patients rightly fear that information about their \ngenes will be used against them in the workplace or in health \ninsurance. Study after study reports that the vast majority of \nAmericans are concerned about taking a genetic test, for fear that \nemployers will have access to the information. The Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association reported that 57 percent of women at risk \nfor breast or ovarian cancer had refused to take a genetic test that \ncould have identified their risk for cancer and assisted them in \nreceiving medical treatment to prevent the onset of these diseases \nbecause they feared reprisals for doing so. Tragically, the vast \npotential of genetic knowledge to improve health care will go \nunfulfilled if patients fear that information about their genetic \ncharacteristics will be used as the basis for job discrimination or \nother prejudices.\n  And that fear is clearly well-founded. Genetic discrimination is a \nreal and frightening problem, and it is happening right now. Last \nSaturday reports of mandatory genetic testing of employees made \nheadline news--and the testing was being conducted by one of the \nlargest railroads in this country. One employee was informed by the \nrailroad that he would be fired for refusing to submit to the genetic \ntesting.\n  This is just the tip of the iceberg of what is becoming a routine and \npervasive employer practice as genetic testing becomes more accessible \nand economical. Today, employers and insurers often require and use \nthis information to deny health coverage, refuse a promotion, or reject \na job applicant--all in the absence of any symptoms of disease. \nAccording to a 1995 study by Georgetown University, people have been \nrequired to provide information about genetic diseases, disabilities, \nor family medical history on job applications and have been denied jobs \nor have lost jobs because of a family genetic condition.\n  Moreover, a recent survey by the American Management Association of \nover 2,000 companies showed that more than 18 percent of companies \nrequire genetic tests or data on family medical history from employees \nor job applicants. According to the same survey, more than 26 percent \nof the companies that require this information use it in hiring \ndecisions.\n\n  Experts in genetics are virtually unanimous in calling for strong \nprotections to prevent this misuse and abuse of science. The Department \nof Health and Human Services' advisory panel on genetic testing--\nconsisting of experts in law, science, medicine and business--\nrecommended unambiguously that ``Federal legislation should be enacted \nto prohibit discrimination in employment and health insurance based on \ngenetic information.'' Dr. Craig Venter, the president of Celera \nGenomics, who led the privately-financed aspect of the gene sequencing \nresearch, has spoken of the ``immediate threat . . . [of] genetic \ndiscrimination. . . . [H]uman rights and civil rights law will have to \nbe updated to include this new class of diagnosed person. At this \nstage, one can only imagine the future potential of abuse,'' he said.\n  With time, the potential for genetic discrimination will only grow \nstronger and federal legislation to establish minimum protections is \nneeded to ensure that advances in research and technology are not used \nto discriminate against workers. Without strong protections \nguaranteeing that private medical information remains private and that \ngenetic information can not be used for improper purposes, we will \nsquander the unprecedented opportunities presented by these new \ndiscoveries, and the health and welfare of large numbers of our fellow \ncitizens will be put at risk.\n  I commend our leader, Senator Daschle, for introducing this important \nlegislation that will give the American people the protections against \ngenetic discrimination they need and deserve. The Genetic Non- \nDiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act will prohibit \ninsurers from denying or abridging health care coverage on the basis of \ngenetic test results. It will protect employees from discrimination on \nthe basis of their unalterable genetic inheritance. The Act safeguards \nAmericans' private genetic information from\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nunauthorized disclosures to employers, banks, and others who should not \nhave access to this most sensitive of personal information. And, \nbecause a right without a remedy is no right at all, this important \nmeasure would provide persons who have suffered genetic discrimination \nin either arena with the right to seek redress through legal action. I \nurge my colleagues to join Senator Daschle and me in supporting the \nGenetic Non-Discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 319. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure that \nair carriers meet their obligations under the Airline Customer Service \nAgreement, and provide improved passenger service in order to meet \npublic convenience and necessity; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this morning the Commerce Committee heard \ntestimony from the Department of Transportation Inspector General on \nthe airlines' efforts to meet their voluntary Airline Customer Service \nCommitment. The IG reported that the airlines had made progress in \ntheir customer service areas. He also noted that the airlines were \ndeficient in many areas of their commitment. The IG recommended that \nCongress take some measures to ensure that the airlines continue to \nmake progress on the passenger service front.\n  To that end, I am introducing the Airline Customer Service \nImprovement Act, along with Senators Hollings, Hutchison, and Wyden.\n  This bill implements the recommendations set forth by the Inspector \nGeneral in his final report. Specifically, the bill requires each air \ncarrier to incorporate the voluntary Airline Customer Service \nCommitment into its contract of carriage. In addition, the bill \nrequires each air carrier to specifically disclose information \nrecommended by Mr. Mead, such as the on-time performance rates of \nspecific flights and the airlines' policy with respect to overnight \naccommodations.\n  The bill also directs the Department of Transportation to raise the \ncompensation required for passengers involuntarily bumped from a \nflight. This regulation has not been updated in more than 20 years.\n  The bill also directs the Department of Transportation to change the \nway it calculates lost and mishandled baggage statistics, so that these \nstatistics will more accurately represent the problems that passengers \nface.\n  Finally, consistent with the IG's recommendations, the bill requires \nthe airlines to report on their efforts to establish targets for \nreducing the number of chronically-delayed and canceled flights, and \nestablishing a system passengers may use to determine if their flight \nhas been delayed or canceled.\n  In short, this legislation does not seek to legislate good customer \nservice. This legislation seeks to provide the airlines and the \nDepartment of Transportation with the incentives to ensure that good \ncustomer service remains high on everyone's priority list.\n  Let me make clear that this bill is just one small step towards \nfixing the system. This bill does not begin to address the many \nproblems facing the airline industry. Capacity, congestion, antiquated \nair traffic control systems, and labor all have had detrimental effects \non our system and, consequently, customer service. The Commerce \nCommittee will continue to explore ways to improve the efficiency of \nour aviation system. We will all need to work together to fix the \nmultitude of problems that airline customers face everyday.\n  I look forward to working together with my fellow Senators on this \nand other ways to address the needs of our aviation system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Customer Service \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Inspector General of the Department of \n     Transportation has found that the airlines' voluntary \n     commitment to better service, set forth in the Airline \n     Customer Service Commitment, has resulted in positive changes \n     in how air travelers are treated.\n       (2) While the Inspector General's Final report noted that \n     the voluntary effort has produced benefits faster than a \n     legislative or regulatory mandate, which could have taken \n     years to implement, the Inspector General has recommended \n     additional changes that require legislation and regulations.\n       (3) The Airline Customer Service Commitment has prompted \n     the airlines to address consumer concerns in many areas, \n     ranging from providing information more accurately on delays \n     to explaining that lower fares may be available through the \n     Internet.\n       (4) The airlines were cooperative with, and responsive to, \n     many of the suggestions the Inspector General made in the \n     interim report last year.\n       (5) The Inspector General has determined that, while there \n     has been significant progress in improving airline customer \n     service, certain areas covered by the Airline Customer \n     Service Commitment are in need of significant clarification \n     and improvement and, where appropriate, enforcement action.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I join with Senator McCain in co-\nsponsoring the Airline Customer Service Improvement Act. The Commerce \nCommittee has spent a great deal of time seeking ways to hold the air \ncarriers accountable for their service and to force them to do a better \njob. Deregulation was supposed to make the carriers compete for our \nbusiness, but it has failed. We now have hundreds of markets with no \ncompetition, and without competition, you get no service. Carriers have \ntreated consumers like cattle in a stockyard, and that must end.\n  It is time to stand up for all travelers and demand basic \ninformation, and to expect service if we are paying the high fares.\n  The Commerce Committee has held three hearings, enlisted the \nDepartment of Transportation's Inspector General, and experienced the \nlack of service, first hand. It is not complicated, but it does take a \ncommitment from the industry to hire more people and give them the \ntools to tell consumers what is going on or why a flight is canceled or \ndelayed. Flights delayed 30, 40 percent of the time, according to DOT \nstatistics, or canceled that often, should be eliminated or schedules \nchanged.\n  Telling people truthfully what is happening, providing basic \nnecessities when flights are delayed for hours on end like they were in \nDetroit in January 1999, is not hard.\n  The chairman and I have waited patiently to proceed with legislation \nin anticipation of a final report by the Department of Transportation's \nInspector General, Ken Mead. The report, released Monday, is a \nblueprint for change. Mr. Mead and his staff, David Dobbs, Lexi \nStefani, Brian Dettleback, and Scott Morris, worked long and hard to \nfind the best way to make improvements in service.\n  The report notes that reducing delays is a tough problem, requiring \nfunding and industry action. We have an air transportation system in \ncrisis, from every angle, nonetheless that is no excuse for poor \nservice. There are more people flying, more planes landing, an increase \nin delays (up 33% since 1995), a critical shortage of runways, and \nairlines able to dictate the price and quality of service offered in \nmany markets without regard to competition. Delays will continue to \nplague the system, but the carriers know this, and their Customer \nService Commitments were done in light of known problems. We will work \nwith the industry on many facets of expanding capacity, but it is their \njob to improve service.\n  The carriers all to often want to cite the government as the reason \nfor their problems. I do not buy that. These carriers have more data \nthan virtually any industry, and make educated guesses on pricing and \nscheduling every day. They know the likelihood of delays. Even weather, \nwhich is unpredictable on a daily basis, is something they can \nanticipate. I know right now we will have thunderstorms this summer, \nand snow storms next winter. How will the carriers treat people during \nthose times? I know my flight is likely to be delayed--the reasons may \nvary, but the process by which you tell people basic information should \nnot be hard. Some of the carriers have attempted improvements. At a \nhearing last June, one carrier demonstrated a\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nnew automatic system that more quickly tells people what to expect. \nAnother carrier has ``chariots'' that set up temporary service counters \nduring emergency periods. An ad this past weekend touted ways to \nelectronically tell passengers that a flight is late. These are a \nstart, but there is a long road to go.\n  The Air Transport Association last month announced a number of \ninitiatives on ways to reduce delays. The ATA called on the President \nto hire a 1000 more controllers, use satellites to track planes and to \nredesign our airspace--all actions that could increase capacity. I \nsupport those initiatives, but we had better tell the Administration \nnot to reduce the FAA's budget by hundreds of millions of dollars, \nwhich they apparently are considering.\n  The Senate is going to spend the time to increase competition, to \nimprove service, and to put back the notion of the public's needs as a \npriority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Baucus, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Frist, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Landrieu, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 321. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide families of disabled children with the opportunity to purchase \ncoverage under the medicaid program for such children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nannounce the introduction of the Family Opportunity Act of 2001. I \npledge my commitment to working with Senator Kennedy and others in a \nbi-partisan, bi-cameral way for the passage of the Family Opportunity \nAct this year.\n  We have a common-sense bill. Our bill is pro-family because it keeps \nfamilies together. It's pro-work because it lets parents work without \nlosing their children's health care. It's pro-taxpayer because it lets \npeople earn money and help pay their own way for Medicaid coverage.\n  Why is this legislation so necessary? As a parent, your main \nobjective in life is to provide for your child to the best of your \nability. Our federal government takes this goal and turns it upside \ndown for the parents of children with special health care needs. The \ngovernment forces these parents to choose between family income and \ntheir children's health care. That's a terrible choice.\n  Families have to remain in poverty just to keep Medicaid. Obviously \nthis affects entire families, not just the child with the health care \nneeds. The story of an Iowan family illustrates this point. Daniel, the \n18-year-old son of Melissa Arnold, can't work part-time for fear of \njeopardizing his brother's Medicaid coverage.\n  I know of another family whose son was paralyzed after a diving \naccident. The family exhausted $1 million of private insurance. Then \nthey had to pay $1,500 a day on their own just to keep their son alive. \nYet another family has a 4-year-old son who functions at an infant's \nlevel. This little boy takes anti- seizure medication that costs about \n$150 every two weeks. His nutritional supplement is $10 a day. He'll \nalways wear diapers. All of those costs come out of his parents' \npocket.\n  Most families just can't afford those costs.\n  Why is Medicaid so desirable? It's critical to the well-being of \nchildren with multiple medical needs. Medicaid covers services that are \ndifficult to find in private health plans. A child with a severe \ndisability may need special medical equipment or physical therapy on a \nregular basis just in order to be able to eat.\n  Our bill creates a state option to allow working parents who have a \nchild with a disability to keep working and to still have access to \nMedicaid for their child. Parents would pay for Medicaid coverage on a \nsliding scale. No one would have to become impoverished or stay \nimpoverished to secure Medicaid for a child.\n  The legislation recognizes a universal truth. Everybody wants to use \ntheir talents to the fullest potential, and every parent wants to \nprovide as much as possible for his or her children. The government \nshouldn't get in the way. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nfor passage of the Family Opportunity Act this year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to once again join my \ncolleague Senator Chuck Grassley in introducing the Family Opportunity \nAct of 2001--the hallmark of which is to remove the health care \nbarriers for children with disabilities that so often prevent families \nfrom staying together and staying employed.\n  Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is \nenjoying today, families of disabled and special needs children \ncontinue to struggle to keep their families together, live \nindependently and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities.\n  More than 8 percent of children in this country have significant \ndisabilities, many of whom do not have access to critical health \nservices they need to maintain and prevent deterioration of their \nhealth status. To get needed health services for their children, \nfamilies are being forced to become poor, stay poor, put their children \nin out of home placements, or simply give up custody of their \nchildren--all so that their children can qualify for the comprehensive \nhealth coverage available under Medicaid.\n  In a recent survey of 20 states, families of special needs children \nreport they are turning down jobs, turning down raises, turning down \novertime, and are unable to save money for the future of their children \nand family --so that their child can stay eligible for Medicaid through \nthe Social Security Income (SSI) Program.\n  Today we are reintroducing legislation intended to close the health \ncare gap for the Nation's most vulnerable population, and enable \nfamilies of disabled children in this country to be equal partners in \nthe American dream.\n  In the words of President George W. Bush in his ``New Freedom \nInitiative'', ``Too many Americans with disabilities remain trapped in \nbureaucracies of dependence, and are denied the access necessary for \nsuccess--and we need to tear down these barriers''.\n  The Family Opportunity Act of 2001 will tear down the unfair barriers \nto needed health care that so many disabled and special needs children \nare being denied.\n  It will make health insurance coverage more widely available for \nchildren with significant disabilities, through opportunities to buy-in \nto Medicaid at an affordable rate.\n  It will allow states to develop a demonstration program to provide a \nmedicaid buy-in for children with potentially significant disabilities \nwho without needed health services will become severely disabled.\n  States will have more flexibility to offer disabled children needed \nhealth services at home and in their communities.\n  It will establish Family to Family Information Centers in each state \nto help families with special needs children.\n  The passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 showed the \ncommitment of this Nation to ensure that people with disabilities have \nthe right to lead independent and productive lives without giving up \ntheir health care. It is now time for Congress to show that same \ncommitment to our country's children with disabilities and their \nfamilies.\n  I look forward to working with all members of Congress to move this \nlegislation forward and give disabled children and their families \nacross the country a better opportunity to fulfill their dreams and \nfully participate in the social and economic mainstream of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S.J.

Con. Res. 9\n\n       Whereas the people of East Timor experienced an unprovoked \n     and violent attack in the aftermath of a peaceful referendum \n     in which they cast an overwhelming vote for national \n     independence;\n       Whereas at least 1,000 people were killed, thousands more \n     people were injured, 500,000 people were displaced, much of \n     the infrastructure was destroyed, and scores of communities \n     and villages were completely destroyed in East Timor by \n     roving bands of militias and paramilitary organizations;\n       Whereas some Indonesian military officers and personnel \n     along with some Indonesian civilian police helped to train \n     and arm the militias and paramilitary organizations before \n     setting them loose to terrorize the people of East Timor and \n     destroy their homes, businesses, and personal property;\n       Whereas the Indonesian ranking military officers and \n     civilian police officers not only failed to keep the peace in \n     East Timor once the referendum on national independence was \n     conducted but also, in some cases, actually incited violence \n     and participated in widespread killing, rape, forced \n     displacement, mayhem, and wholesale property destruction;\n       Whereas numerous militia leaders who have been implicated \n     in various crimes against humanity in East Timor continue to \n     operate with impunity in West Timor and throughout Indonesia \n     and none have been formally charged and brought to trial in \n     Indonesia for the wave of violence, murder, rape, and terror \n     inflicted on the people of East Timor, in particular, in \n     preparation for, the conduct of, or the aftermath of the 1999 \n     referendum;\n       Whereas Indonesia is a party to the Universal Declaration \n     on Human Rights and other international human rights \n     agreements and is legally obligated to comply with those \n     agreements;\n       Whereas the continuing failure to investigate, indict, \n     prosecute, and secure convictions and appropriate punishment \n     for those responsible for so much death, violence, and \n     destruction among the people of East Timor continues to fuel \n     an environment of terror, fear, and crime in East and West \n     Timor and along their common border, thus trapping tens of \n     thousands in squalid refugee camps and preventing their safe \n     return to their homes;\n       Whereas the Indonesian government has failed to follow \n     through on its agreement to provide evidence and accused \n     criminals to the justice system of the United Nations \n     Transitional Administration in East Timor, creating \n     circumstances whereby lower-level East Timorese militia \n     members are brought to justice in East Timor, while East \n     Timorese militia leaders and Indonesian military officers \n     with command responsibility reside in Indonesia without fear \n     of prosecution;\n       Whereas the Indonesian government has yet to take all \n     necessary steps to create a court with authority to prosecute \n     past crimes under internationally-recognized human rights and \n     humanitarian law, and the National Human Rights Commission of \n     Indonesia has limited authority to only investigate such \n     violations;\n       Whereas, in August, 2000, Indonesia's upper house of \n     parliament passed a constitutional amendment prohibiting \n     retroactivity in prosecutions;\n       Whereas repeated assurances to the international community \n     and to Congress by the Indonesian government of impending \n     action against the perpetrators of crimes against humanity in \n     East Timor have produced few noticeable or substantive \n     results; and\n       Whereas Congress is deeply disturbed that gross violations \n     of the human rights of the people of East Timor and United \n     Nations personnel rendering basic humanitarian services in \n     East and West Timor have gone unpunished since January 1, \n     1999, and the perpetrators have not been brought to justice: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) Congress--\n       (1) deplores the widespread and systematic violence that--\n       (A) has occurred in East Timor and in the refugee camps of \n     West Timor since January 1, 1999; and\n       (B) has resulted in many murders, rapes, and the near-total \n     destruction of East Timor's infrastructure and numerous \n     villages on that troubled island;\n       (2) decries the continued existence of an environment of \n     intimidation, misinformation, instability, terror, and fear \n     among the people living in the refugee camps housing tens of \n     thousands of displaced people, many of whom wish to return to \n     East Timor, but are too scared to freely repatriate and \n     return safely to their home communities;\n       (3) denounces the leaders of the militias and paramilitary \n     groups who are responsible for the violent attacks, \n     pillaging, and mayhem that has caused so much suffering and \n     property destruction in East Timor as well as their \n     accomplices in Indonesia inside and outside of that sovereign \n     country's armed forces; and\n       (4) continues to support the courageous efforts of those in \n     Indonesia working toward domestic prosecutions of the \n     individuals most responsible for the post-referendum \n     violence, but recognizes that these efforts currently face \n     overwhelming obstacles.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President and the \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) endorse and support the establishment of an \n     international criminal tribunal for the purpose of \n     prosecuting culpable Indonesian military and police officers \n     and personnel, leaders of local militias and paramilitary \n     organizations, and other individuals who are responsible for \n     crimes against humanity in East Timor, including systematic \n     murder, rape, and terrorism, the unlawful use of force, and \n     crimes against United Nations personnel deployed in East \n     Timor and in the refugee camps of West Timor;\n       (2) direct the pertinent agencies of the executive branch--\n       (A) to begin collecting and organizing such information \n     (including from intelligence sources), and to provide such \n     appropriate resources, as will be necessary to assist in \n     preparation of indictments and prosecution of cases before an \n     international criminal tribunal; and\n       (B) to undertake any additional inquiries and \n     investigations that would further such efforts; and\n       (3) work actively and urgently within the international \n     community for the adoption of a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution establishing an international criminal \n     court for East Timor.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Feingold, \nReed, Leahy, Kennedy, and Wellstone in introducing legislation calling \nfor the establishment of an International War Crimes Tribunal for East \nTimor. We recently passed the first anniversary of the date when a \nSpecial United Nations of Commission of Inquiry into the Violence and \nDestruction in East Timor first recommended this course of action.\n  As many of us know, back in 1999, after many years of military \noccupation, the people of East Timor were suddenly and brutally \nattacked immediately after they peacefully cast their overwhelming vote \nfor national independence.\n  At least 1,000 people were murdered and thousands more were injured. \n500,000 people were displaced. And scores of communities and villages \nin East Timor were destroyed by roving bands of militias and \nparamilitary organizations. These militias and paramilitary \norganizations were trained and armed by Indonesian military officers \nand personnel along with the Indonesian civilian police.\n  Around this time last year, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged us \nto give the Government of Indonesia time to find and punish these \nguilty individuals in Indonesia and to demonstrate their cooperation on \nrelated criminal investigations and prosecutions with authorities in \nEast Timor and the United Nations Transition Authority in East Timor \n(UNTAET).\n  But as I stand here today, not a single individual has been charged \nor brought to trial in Indonesia for the wave of violence, murder, \nrape, and terror inflicted on the people of East Timor in preparation \nfor and the conduct of the 1999 referendum and its aftermath. A number \nof militia leaders were implicated in these heinous\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\ncrimes--but they have never been formally charged and brought to trial \nin Indonesia or East Timor. They continue to operate with impunity in \nWest Timor and throughout Indonesia.\n  This is unconscionable. We have shown nothing but patience, and they \nhave simply done nothing. The time for sitting back and waiting is \nover, and we must now take decisive and concrete steps to ensure that \njustice is done.\n  This legislation I am introducing today is carefully modeled after \nsimilar legislation that established the International War Crimes \nTribunals for Iraq, the Balkans, and Rwanda. It consists of three \nparts:\n  First, it calls upon the Bush Administration to endorse and support \nthe establishment of an international criminal tribunal to prosecute \nall individuals who are responsible for egregious human rights abuses \nin East Timor. These abuses include crimes against humanity in East \nTimor, including systematic murder, rape, and terrorism, the unlawful \nuse of force, and crimes against United Nations personnel deployed in \nEast Timor and in the refugee camps of West Timor.\n  Second, it calls upon the Bush Administration to direct pertinent \nU.S. Government agencies to begin collecting and organizing the \nnecessary evidence and information needed to indict and prosecute these \nwar criminals before an international tribunal.\n  Finally, the legislation calls upon the Bush Administration to work \nactively and urgently within the international community to adopt a UN \nSecurity Council resolution establishing an international tribunal on \nEast Timor.\n  In the course of human events, Mr. President, wherever and whenever \nconflict has resulted in great bloodshed, human suffering, and \ndestruction, there has been no real peace established without real \njustice. The people of East Timor deserve peace--and to establish \npeace, we must first seek justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1350-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1350-S1351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 10--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE \n     REGARDING THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA'S UNLAWFUL BAILOUT OF HYUNDAI \n                              ELECTRONICS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Bennett) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 10\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea over many \n     years has supplied aid to the Korean semiconductor industry \n     enabling that industry to be the Republic of Korea's leading \n     exporter;\n       Whereas this assistance has occurred through a coordinated \n     series of government programs and policies, consisting of \n     preferential access to credit, low-interest loans, government \n     grants, preferential tax programs, government inducement of \n     private sector loans, tariff reductions, and other measures;\n       Whereas government assistance to the semiconductor industry \n     is part of the preferences, privileges, and support given by \n     the Korean government to corporate conglomerates, known as \n     chaebols, over several decades;\n       Whereas the policy of providing assistance to chaebols has \n     resulted in trade-distorting spending and capacity expansion \n     and resulted in massive corporate debt;\n       Whereas in December 1997, the United States, the \n     International Monetary Fund (IMF), other foreign government \n     entities, and a group of international financial institutions \n     assembled an unprecedented $58,000,000,000 financial package \n     to prevent the Korean economy from declaring bankruptcy;\n       Whereas as part of that rescue package, the Republic of \n     Korea agreed to put an end to corporate cronyism, and to \n     overhaul the banking and financial sectors;\n       Whereas Korea also pledged to permit and require banks to \n     run on market principles, to allow and enable bankruptcies \n     and workouts to occur rather than bailouts, and to end \n     subsidies;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea agreed to all of these \n     provisions in the Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF dated \n     December 3, 1997;\n       Whereas section 602 of the Foreign Operations, Export \n     Financing, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, as \n     enacted by section 101(d) of Division A of the Omnibus \n     Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \n     (Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-220) specified that the \n     United States would not authorize further IMF payments to \n     Korea unless the Secretary of the Treasury certified that the \n     provisions of the IMF Standby Arrangement were adhered to;\n       Whereas the Secretary of the Treasury certified to Congress \n     on December 11, 1998, April 5, 1999, and July 2, 1999 that \n     the Stand-by Arrangement was being adhered to, and assured \n     Congress that consultations had been held with the Government \n     of the Republic of Korea in connection with the \n     certifications;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea has acceded to the World \n     Trade Organization, and to the Agreement on Subsidies and \n     Countervailing Measures (as defined in section 101(d)(12) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act);\n       Whereas the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing \n     Measures specifically prohibits export subsidies, and makes \n     actionable other subsidies bestowed upon a specific \n     enterprise that causes adverse effects;\n       Whereas Hyundai Electronics is a major exporter of \n     semiconductor products from the Republic of Korea to the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea has now engaged in a massive \n     $2,100,000,000 bailout of Hyundai Electronics which \n     contravenes the commitments the Government of the Republic of \n     Korea made to the IMF, the World Trade Organization and other \n     agreements, and the understandings and certifications made to \n     Congress under the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) believes strongly that the relationship between the \n     United States and Republic of Korea has been and will \n     continue to be harmed significantly by the bailout of a major \n     exporter of products from Korea to the United States;\n       (2) calls on the Republic of Korea to immediately end the \n     bailout of Hyundai Electronics;\n       (3) calls on the Republic of Korea to comply immediately \n     with its commitments to the IMF, with its trade agreements, \n     and with the assurances it made to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury;\n       (4) calls on the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary \n     of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative to \n     take immediately such action as is necessary to assure that \n     the unlawful bailout by the Republic of Korea is stopped, and \n     its effects fully offset or reversed; and\n       (5) calls on the United States Trade Representative and the \n     Secretary of Commerce to monitor and report to Congress on \n     steps that have been taken to end this bailout and reverse \n     its effects.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a concurrent resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate regarding the Republic of Korea's \nunlawful bailout of Hyundai Electronics, an issue of great concern to \nme and, I believe, should be of concern to the Senate. I rise to \nintroduce this resolution with my colleagues Mr. Lott, Mr. Crapo, and \nMr. Bennett.\n  In 1997, the International Monetary Fund, in cooperation with the \nUnited States and a group of financial institutions, put together an \nunprecedented $58 billion financial package to prevent the Korean \neconomy from bankruptcy. As a part of that rescue package, the Korean \ngovernment agreed to implement specific reforms aimed at addressing the \nproblems that had led to the economic crisis in the first place.\n  In recent weeks, the Korean government has decided to break \ncompletely with the policies that it has adopted over the past three \nyears and is promising to provide a $2.1 billion bailout of Hyundai \nElectronics. This action not only runs contrary to the stated policy of \nthe Korean government but also flies in the face of the government's \nclear assurances that this sort of wholesale bailout would not happen.\n  This resolution is necessary because the present actions of the \nKorean government are a flagrant violation of Korean's international \ncommitments. The Hyundai bailout violates Korea's International \nMonetary Fund Agreement; the World Trade Organization Agreement on \nSubsidies and Countervailing Measures; U.S. legislation to stop \nsubsidies to the semiconductor industry in Korea; Section 301 of the \nU.S. trade laws, and U.S. countervailing duty laws. This unlawful and \nunwise bailout must be stopped.\n  The conditions of the IMF Agreement are clear. The corporate \ngovernance provision of the IMF Agreement required Korea to end \ngovernment-directed lending companies; to stop government subsidized \nsupport or tax privileges to bail out individual companies; to reduce \nthe high debt-to-equity ratios of corporations; to reduce mutual \nguarantees within conglomerates; and to permit Korean bankruptcy laws \nto operate without interference from the government.\n  The government's special waiver of the debt ceiling for Hyundai \nElectronic is a violation of Korea's commitment not to interfere in the \nlending practices of private banks and not to provide subsidies. The \naudacious Korean\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\ngovernment announcement on January 3, 2001 dropped every pretense of \nlegitimacy by notifying the intend to provide for the outright bailout \nof Hyundai. In a press statement, the government announced that the \nKorean Development Bank, a Korean government agency, would purchase \n$2.1 billion of Hyundai Electronic corporate bonds over the next twelve \nmonths. The move was clearly aimed at keeping Hyundai from defaulting \non its massive debt. This action is outrageous and demands the \nimmediate attention of the Korean government as well as Congress and \nthe Administration.\n  The bailout violates Korea commitments under the World Trade \nOrganization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. \nKorea's assistance to Hyundai Electronics, including the purchase of \nHyundai's corporate bonds, the waiver of the bank lending limitations, \nand the increase in the limits on export loans, are all violative of \nKorea's SCM commitments, and are subject to WTO dispute settlement \nchallenge. The assistance to Hyundai is a prohibited Export Subsidy, \nand meets the Adverse Effects or ``injury'' test.\n  This bailout violates the conditions of the Omnibus Consolidated and \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, Public Law 105-277. Section \n602 required that the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury certify that Korea \nwas in compliance with its IMF Stand-By Arrangement provisions, \nincluding those I mentioned earlier, and that no IMF funds were being \nused to provide assistance to the semiconductor industry, among others. \nIn enacting this provision, the Congress acknowledged the risk that, in \nthe midst of the financial crisis, the Korean government would continue \nto attempt to keep non-viable companies afloat through directed lending \nand subsidies. The purpose of the provision was to create an \nenforcement mechanism for the IMF reform provisions, by providing for \nthe withholding of U.S. support for further financial assistance to \nKorea, if the government violated the provisions of Section 602.\n  The Treasury Secretary made several certifications pursuant to \nSection 602, making them prior to each remaining disbursement of IMF \nloans to Korea. In these certifications, Secretary Rubin certified to \nCongress that Korea was implementing the reforms that it had agreed to \nin its IMF loan agreement and also that IMF funds were not being used \nto provide subsidies to the semiconductor industry. In recent weeks, \nthe Korean government has violated both the letter and the spirit of \nSection 602, directly frustrating Congressional intent. The Korea \ngovernment has said that it will not make any further draws on the \nstand-by credits from the IMF, so the U.S. government does not have the \nleverage of threatening to stop future loan disbursements under the \ncurrent IMF program. In sum, they have taken American tax dollars and \nrun, without fulfilling the commitments they made. It's an outrage.\n  The assistance to Hyundai Electronics is a subsidy under the U.S. \ncountervailing duty law. The benefits received by Hyundai under the \nKorea government's bailout program constitute a countervailable subsidy \nunder the U.S. countervailing duty law. Section 771(5) provides that a \nsubsidy is one that ``provides a financial contribution . . . to a \nperson and a benefit is thereby conferred.'' This financial \ncontribution can include ``the direct transfer of funds, such as \ngrants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer \nof funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees.'' The statute also \nspecifies that the determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be \nmade ``without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or \nindirectly on the manufacture, production, or export or merchandise.'' \nThus, a subsidy can exist even if the government does not directly \nprovide the subsidy, but directs a bank to provide the subsidy.\n  The statute also specifies that a benefit ``shall normally be treated \nas conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient.'' In the case \nof a loan, there is a benefit to a recipient ``if there is a difference \nbetween the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the \namount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the \nrecipient could actually obtain on the market,'' 19 U.S.C. \n1677(5)(E)(ii). Thus, the Commerce Department, when determining whether \na program is a countervailable subsidy, looks to the benefit to the \nrecipient rather than the cost to the provider of the subsidy.\n  In the case of Hyundai Electronics, the company would not be able to \nobtain any loans ``in the market'' absent government intervention. \nPrivate concerns are reluctantly willing to roll over Hyundai's debt \nonly because the government is involved.\n  In short, because of the preferential financing Hyundai receives \nunder these government actions, and because of the very substantial \nsize of the loans in question, Commerce's investigation of these \nprograms in the course of a countervailing duty proceeding would be \nalmost certain to find substantial subsidy margins.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed in Korea's \nactions in regards to this matter. It is clear that Korea is \npurposefully circumventing the will and intent as well as the spirit \nand letter of the IMF agreement the World Trade Organization Agreement \non Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, U.S. legislation to stop \nsubsidies to the semiconductor industry in Korea, and U.S. \ncountervailing duty laws.\n  Korea must not be permitted to backtrack on the reforms it made that \nwere requirements for IMF and U.S. assistance, just because it is no \nlonger drawing on those loans. The very purpose of the reform measure \nwas to put Korea on stable financial footing. Now Korea is unraveling \nits reform measures, in order to prevent a failing company from going \nbankrupt. Such actions cannot be overlooked, but should be dealt within \nthe strongest possible manner.\n  I am very disappointed that the Korean government has acted in bad \nfaith with respect to its commitments. The U.S. Administration and the \nU.S. Congress must work together to find an effective and just response \nto Korea's action. This bailout undermines Korea's credibility in \ninternational financial circles and threatens the bilateral economic \nrelationship between the United States and Korea. It must be stopped.\n  Mr. President, I would not come to the floor and speak in these \nterms, nor would I have gained the sponsorship by key leaders here in \nthe Senate that I have, if we did not think this was important. \nAmerican taxpayers willing to help stabilize the world economy and \nwilling to help stabilize its friends in the world by contributing $58 \nbillion for those purposes, in working with the International Monetary \nFund and the World Trade Organization, should not now be ignored, nor \nshould what we have said be ignored in this process.\n  With that, I introduce this Senate concurrent resolution speaking to \nthat very issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1351-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1351-S1352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 19--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH SHOULD BE INCREASED BY \n                   $3,400,000,000 IN FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Frist, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Collins, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Santorum, and Mrs. Murray) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n\n                               S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the `Biomedical \n     Revitalization Resolution of 2001'.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health should be increased by $3,400,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2002 and that the budget resolution appropriately \n     reflect sufficient funds to achieve this objective.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce, with my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, an \nimportant resolution calling for increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, to keep us on track to double NIH funding by \nfiscal year 2003. Specifically, the resolution calls for the fiscal \nyear 2002 budget resolution to include an additional $3.4 billion in \nthe health function, to be allocated for biomedical research at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I have said many times \nthat the National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the \nFederal Government--perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government. \nWhen I came to the Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. \nToday, funding is $20.3 billion. This money has been very well spent, \ngiven that the advances realized by the National Institutes of Health \nhas spawned tremendous breakthroughs in our knowledge and treatment for \ndiseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, \nsevere mental illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and \nmany others. It is clear that a substantial investment in the NIH is \npaying off and that it is crucial that increased funding be continued \nin order to convert these advances into treatment and cures.\n  The effort to double NIH began on May 21, 1997, when the Senate \npassed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health be doubled over five years. Regrettably, \neven though the resolution was passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to \nnothing, the Budget Resolution contained a $100 million reduction for \nhealth programs. That led to the introduction of an amendment to the \nresolution by myself and Senator Harkin to add $1.1 billion to carry \nout the expressed sense of the Senate to increase NIH funding. Our \namendment, however, was defeated 63-37. We were extremely disappointed \nthat, while the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, they \nwere simply unwilling to put up the actual dollars to accomplish this \nvital goal.\n  The following year, during debate on the fiscal year 1999 budget \nresolution, Senator Harkin and I again introduced an amendment to the \nbudget resolution which called for a $2 billion increase for the \nNational Institutes of Health. While we gained more support on this \nvote than in the previous year, our amendment was again defeated by a \nvote of 57-41. Not to be deterred, Senator Harkin and I again went to \nwork with our Subcommittee and we were able to add an additional $2 \nbillion to the NIH account for fiscal year 1999.\n  In fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I again offered an amendment \nto the budget resolution to add $1.4 billion to the health accounts, \nover and above the $600 million increase which had already been \nprovided by the Budget Committee. Despite this amendment's defeat by a \nvote of 47-52, we were able to provide in the appropriations bill a \n$2.3 billion increase for fiscal year 2000.\n  Last year, Senator Harkin and I yet again offered an amendment to the \nbudget resolution to increase funding for health programs by $1.6 \nbillion. This amendment passed by a vote of 55-45. This victory brought \nthe NIH increase to $2.7 billion for FY'01. However, after late night \nnegotiations with the House, the funding for NIH was cut by $200 \nmillion below that amount.\n  This brief history of defeats and victories brings us to where we are \ntoday. The amount necessary to keep us on our track to double NIH \nfunding will require $3.4 billion for fiscal year 2002. I believe that \nthis goal can be achieved if we make the proper allocation of our \nresources.\n  Our investment has resulted in tremendous advances in medical \nresearch. A new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of \nthe AIDS virus in HIV infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. \nDeath rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. With the \nsequencing of the human genome, we will begin, over the next few years, \nto reap the benefits in many fields of research as analysis continues. \nAnd if scientists are correct, stem cell research could result in a \nveritable fountain of youth in replacing diseased cells. I anxiously \nawait the results of all of these avenues of remarkable research.\n  I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously from the \ninvestment we have made in the National Institutes of Health. That is \nwhy we offer this resolution today--to call upon the Budget Committee \nto include the additional $3.4 billion to the health accounts so we can \ncarry forward the important work of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/13/senate-section/article/S1352-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1352-S1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.
