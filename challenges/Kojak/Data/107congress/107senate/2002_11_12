Mr. President, Senator Lott and I would like to begin by \nwelcoming Senator Barkley. He is the 39th Senator to represent the \ngreat State of Minnesota. He was born in Annandale, MN. He received his \nundergraduate and law degrees from the University of Minnesota, so he \nis truly a son of the State.\n  He ran for the House of Representatives in 1991 and for the Senate in \n1994 and then in 1996 as a reform party candidate. He advised the \nGovernor, Governor Ventura, in his successful campaign for the \nMinnesota governorship in 1998. He was appointed as director of \nMinnesota's Planning and State Strategic Long-term Planning Agency.\n  In addition, as a businessman, he brings a great deal of experience \nand real-life perspective to this Chamber. I congratulate Senator \nBarkley, his wife Susan, and their three children and welcome him to \nthe Senate family.\n  Before I make my remarks in regard to our dear departed colleague, I \nyield the floor to accommodate Senator Lott's interest in welcoming \nSenator Barkley as well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend our welcome to our new Senator, \nDean Barkley from Minnesota. I congratulate him on his selection and \nwish him well on behalf of the Members of the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle. I pledge to him my commitment and our commitment to work \nwith him as he fills this interim appointment on behalf of the people \nof the great State of Minnesota.\n  I reviewed his background. I have had a chance to visit with him. I \nknow he is going to be very serious about this opportunity he has to do \nthe right thing for his own State but also for our country.\n  His experience as director of the Minnesota Planning and State \nStrategic and Long-term Planning Agency should serve him well in his \ntime in the Senate. His involvement in the effort toward good \ngovernment in his State, his participation in the reform party and the \nindependence party, and as a matter of fact his friendship and work \nover the years with members of both parties, Democrat and Republican, \nwill serve him well in this period that he will be in the Senate.\n  We are looking forward to the opportunity to encourage him, to answer \nhis questions, and to work with him on behalf of the people he will now \nrepresent. So I extend our congratulations and our welcome to Senator \nBarkley of Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10810-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10810-S10831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate our welcome to Senator \nBarkley, but no one needs to be reminded how it is he is here. I begin \nour remembrance of Paul Wellstone with the recognition that at times \nsuch as this it is more important to celebrate a life than to mourn a \ndeath. I will do my utmost in the next couple of minutes to remember my \nown advice, the importance of celebrating a life.\n  We mourn the loss of Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, their daughter \nMarcia, the staff, and the pilots who lost their lives. It has been a \nshock from which we have not yet fully recovered. Sometimes in these \ndifficult moments, I turn to the Bible, sometimes I turn to expressions \noffered to me by others, and sometimes to poetry.\n  An old Irish text was found in a Carmelite monastery in Tallow \nCounty, Wicklow, Ireland. The text was entitled ``Togetherness.'' I \nfind solace in the words of Togetherness.\n\n     Death is nothing at all--\n     I have only slipped away into the next room.\n     Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.\n     Call me by my old familiar name, speak to me in the easy way \n           which we always used.\n     Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes we enjoyed \n           together.\n     Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.\n     Let my name be the household word it always was.\n     Let it be spoken without effort.\n     Life means all that it ever meant.\n     It is the same as it always was:\n     There is an absolute unbroken continuity.\n     Why would I be out of your mind because I am out of your \n           sight?\n     I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very \n           near, just around the corner.\n     All is well. Nothing is passed, nothing is lost.\n     One brief moment, and all will be as it was before--\n     Only better, infinitely happier, and forever--\n     We will all be one together . . .\n\n  Paul was all of 5 foot 5. But I remember what someone once told me: \nsomeone certainly more than 5 foot 5. He said it is not the size of the \nman in the fight, it is the size of the fight in the man. Paul \nWellstone by that measurement was a giant. He fought. He spoke. He \nchallenged us all. But he did so in a way that made him a friend, not \nan enemy, a friend with people on this side of the aisle and a friend, \nof course, with those on this side, too; he had friends.\n  While he walked in this Chamber small in stature, everyone recognized \nthat if you measure a man and, in so doing, measure the true weight of \nhis being, you don't measure his size, you measure his heart.\n  Paul Wellstone inspired me. With his physical challenges--his back, \nhis knees, his legs from wrestling injuries, and then later with MS--I \nnever once heard him complain. Never once did he come to me saying, \nTom, you have to give me an opportunity to recover, to rest. He had an \nenergy, a dynamism, that overcame all of those ailments. He seemed more \nwell than those who are well. He inspired all with his joy, with his \npassion, with his energy.\n  For those of us who believe in public service, there was no greater \nevidence of his deep sense of commitment to public service than his \nadvocacy for mental health parity. Again, working across the aisle with \nSenator Domenici, that passion, that energy, that commitment, that \ndetermination, that persistence, all that was Paul Wellstone, flowed \nright up there from that desk. We knew he cared about mental health \nparity. I can think of no better monument, no better memorial, no \nbetter way to honor him than by passing mental health parity soon.\n  We were all the beneficiaries. Perhaps those who will benefit most by \nhis memory, his example, by his commitment, are our youth. I spoke to \nhis staff on the Sunday following his passing. I reminded them that in \nthe course of 5 years in my early life, I, too, lost heroes. Their \nnames were John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. \nWhile I recognize their physical being is no longer here, as our poem \nsaid, I recognize, too, that they only slipped into the next room, and \ntheir spirit was very much alive. And that burns within me with my \nunderstanding and my belief in our democracy in this commitment you \nmust make to public service.\n  In remembering the Wellstones, we must also pay tribute to that \nremarkable woman, Sheila Wellstone, for her advocacy, her leadership, \nher commitment to abolishing domestic abuse. The commitment she made, \nthe lives she saved, her willingness to be engaged, the extraordinary \neffort she made and the example she set, too, is something we will \nalways remember and for which we will always be indebted.\n  On this new day, let us not think of sadness but of celebration. Let \nus celebrate the life of Paul Wellstone as we acknowledge the loss of \nhis physical being. Let us extend our heartfelt condolences to David, \nto Mark, and to Todd, to Cari, Keith, to Joshua and Acacia, Sydney and \nMatt, his family. The hole in their hearts is large. The hole in their \nlives may never be fully filled.\n  To them I ask they, too, find solace in the words of \n``Togetherness.''\n\n       Death is nothing at all--I have only slipped away into the \n     next room. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will begin by thanking Senator Daschle for \nhis remarks so well delivered just now and also for conversations that \nhe and I experienced in the aftermath of this tragic loss.\n  I rise today also to pay tribute to the life and the service of \nSenator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. He had a real impact on this \ninstitution. He was a committed warrior to things he believed in. He \ndid it not only with compassion but with sincerity and also \ngenerousness and geniality. He never failed to take the time to tell a \nstory, to explain why he felt so strongly\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nabout these issues. He was unfailingly willing to be considerate of \nothers, to seek an agreement as to how the process would work, even \nwhen it led to a battle of words and of votes. He also had such an \nupbeat, optimistic view of that process, that battle, and the next one.\n  He would come over and say: ``Good job, I'll get you next time,'' if \nhe hadn't won. Even when he might be the single vote, or one of a \ncouple of votes--just a few--he was undaunted. You cannot help but \nadmire that approach to life and to the Senate. I not only understand \nwhen Senators take a different view, I appreciate it when they take \nthat view--the way Paul Wellstone did.\n  I have learned over the years that the saying that seems trite is so \ntrue in life and in this institution: You can disagree without being \ndisagreeable. He was the master at that.\n  I appreciated the friendship we developed. I loved to pick at him. I \nloved to go over and kid him about the little extra face hair that he \nhad for a while, and I would tell him he was my man for the nomination \nfor Presidency. When other potential candidates would come up, I would \nsay: Oh, no, I am already committed to Paul. He loved it, actually.\n  He was very kind to me. When I faced difficult tragedies--as with \nPaul Coverdell, when I stood here with tears rolling down my face, \nannouncing the loss of that great Senator--he would always be one of \nthe first to come over and engage and say how he felt. Sometimes in \ndifficult straits that the Senate has had to go through, when Senator \nDaschle and I had to make difficult decisions, he would be the only one \nwho would come over and say: It was tough, I know, but you did the \nright thing. I remember that.\n  So I think the people of Minnesota have an awful lot to be proud of \nin their Senator. When I went there to pay my respects to the people of \nMinnesota and to the family and to his friends and supporters, Senator \nKennedy was on the bus as we were leaving the airport. He said: We \nappreciate the fact that you are here. I know you are here not just \nbecause you are the leader of the party, but because you wanted to pay \nproper respects.\n  I said: I am here because it is the right thing to do, but also \nbecause, if the tables had been reversed and this was for me, Paul \nwould have been there. I really believe that.\n  So I take my hat off, I salute the Senator. He will be missed. The \nSenate will be different. But to the people and his family who are so \nheartbroken, to his friends and supporters and the people all over his \nState, our memory of him and his service will not be forgotten. He will \ngo down in history as a truly unique Member of the Senate. I guess we \nall are in some respects but Paul more so than others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, for more than 20 years Paul and Sheila \nWellstone were my friends and my political allies, so it is with a \nheavy heart that I stand here today. For the last 2 years Paul was my \nmentor and partner in the Senate, and I will miss him especially, as \nwill Minnesota, as will America.\n  I thank my many colleagues in the Senate who came to Minnesota just a \nshort time ago for the memorial service commemorating Paul and Sheila, \ntheir daughter Marcia, their staff and friends, Mary McEvoy, the \nDemocratic Party Associate Chair, Tom Lapic, and Will McLaughlin. Over \nhalf of the Senate attended that evening. Another dozen former \nSenators, a dozen or so Members of the House, President Clinton, Vice \nPresident Gore, Secretary Thompson, Reverend Jackson. Paul and Sheila \nwould have been honored.\n  I especially want to thank my Republican colleagues, Senator Lott, \nSenator Nickles, and the others who attended that evening. I was not \naware until the next day that Senator Lott was treated discourteously \nby some in the Minnesota crowd. To him and anyone else who suffered \nthat misfortune, I deeply apologize. Paul and Sheila would have been \nhorrified, as was I when I learned about it, as would the people of \nMinnesota have been. That is not the way we treat distinguished guests \nin Minnesota.\n  As for the rest of the evening, if the eulogists spoke sometimes a \nlittle long, they at times became impassioned, political, or even \npartisan--well, it was a service for Paul Wellstone. The speakers were \nselected, but they weren't scripted. They were all family and close \nfriends who were still in shock and in great emotional distress and in \ndeep pain.\n  What was most extraordinary about that service that evening, what \nhopefully will be remembered now the campaigns have concluded, is that \nover 20,000 people came to honor the lives and mourn the tragic deaths \nof Paul and Sheila and Marcia Wellstone, Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapic, and \nWill McLaughlin--over 20,000 people. That was unprecedented in \nMinnesota.\n  Nothing in my lifetime or in my knowledge of the State was even in \nthe same realm of that magnitude of love and gratitude and grief and \nsorrow. The service was held at the University of Minnesota Basketball \nArena which seats over 15,000 people. It was filled an hour before the \nservice was scheduled to begin. The fire marshals closed the doors. \nAnother 6,000 or so arrivals filled an adjacent arena to watch the \nservice on closed-circuit television. It, too, was overfilled by the \ntime the service began. Police and university officials urged late \narrivals to go home and watch the service on television, but hundreds, \nseveral hundred, remained clustered outside, standing around, wanting \nto be part of this unprecedented Minnesota congregation. That enormous \noutpouring of people and their emotions attested to the breadth and \ndepth of Paul Wellstone's political reach. He had touched so many \npeople so deeply. He had helped them, comforted them, and reassured \nthem. He had inspired so many people. He was their voice, their \nchampion, their hero, their United States Senator. And then suddenly, \ntragically, cruelly, he was snatched away and gone forever.\n  It was a service to remember and in part regret. It was a service of \nremembrance and regret for eight exceptional people who lost their \nlives flying to a funeral service in northeastern Minnesota.\n  I knew Paul, but the first time I saw him in action was in June of \n1982 at the DFL State Convention. I was endorsed at that convention to \nrun for the first time for the U.S. Senate, and the first day that 3-\nday convention opened, Paul announced--much to everyone's surprise--he \nwas going to run for the endorsement for State auditor 2 days hence.\n  For the previous 8 months, a very earnest young man had been in every \ncounty and every district and political event in Minnesota in \nDemocratic circles, explaining in numbing detail the functions of the \noffice of State auditor and how he was the best qualified to fulfill \nthem. Sunday came around, and the auditor's endorsement was the last \nendorsement at the end of the third day. There were 1,300 Democratic \ndelegates who were tired and worn out and ready to go home. Paul \nappeared on the stage after his opponent's one last excruciating \nexplanation of the auditor's position, and presented himself--most of \nthe audience seeing him for the first time--and he gave a typical Paul \nWellstone speech: Nuclear freeze, save the environment, for economic \njustice--nothing of much particular relevance to the office of State \nauditor. He was endorsed by acclamation of the delegates.\n  Paul and I both lost our elections that November, but we spent the \nnext 3 years campaigning together, working for the Governor of \nMinnesota, Rudy Perpich, in the Office of Energy and Economic \nDevelopment. We spent many hours talking and traveling the State \ntogether. In 1990 we swapped our political aspirations, Paul ran for \nthe Senate and I for State auditor, and this time we won. Paul's \nvictory in 1990 was one of the most memorable David-defeats-Goliath \nstories in America's political history.\n  In the first published poll several months before the election, the \nincumbent was ahead by over 50 percent. Paul was in single digits. He \nwas given no chance to win, and almost no help by the political \nestablishment. He was outspent in the campaign by over 5 to 1. Yet Paul \nwas the only Democratic challenger that year who ousted an incumbent. \nHis campaign symbol, his signature and his icon, became the rattling, \ngas-guzzling, usually in-the-repair-shop green bus. But despite a \nbrilliant campaign which captured the\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\npublic attention, this distinctively different candidate walked fast \nand talked fast and actually rode a bus. His innovative ads won \nnational awards that year, produced a campaign that couldn't even \nafford to air them.\n  Despite 8 months of Paul Wellstone and his best hyperdrive, that \namazing energy and excitement, and organizing all over the State, he \nstill entered that final weekend before the election, with most polls \nshowing him being 6 to 8 points behind.\n  That Saturday, as our Statewide DFL ticket boarded the bus--not \nPaul's bus, which was once again in the repair shop, but another bus--\nfor its final 2-day swing around the State, Paul's opponent had just \nlaunched a vicious personal attack against him. The campaign had no \nmoney to produce or air a response. Those 2 days were agonizing for \nPaul and Sheila and Marcia, who accompanied him, and for those of us \nwho were sharing that experience with him. Then, like a miracle, the \nhero of the moment came forth, the former Senator and Vice President, \nWalter Mondale, whom fate was to bind to the conclusion of another \nWellstone campaign 12 years later.\n  The Vice President publicly denounced the attack as a violation of \nMinnesota's standard of decency. The editorial board of the State's \nlargest newspaper agreed the day before the election. And the majority \nof Minnesota voters agreed the following day.\n  It was the most stunning upset and astounding victory in Minnesota \npolitical history.\n  Paul Wellstone was on the green bus headed to Washington, which, of \ncourse, was the bus that broke down on the way.\n  Despite Paul's 20 years of political experience, he wasn't prepared \nfor the Senate. The Senate may not have been prepared for Paul. I know \nhe later regretted some of his earlier decisions. He told me so after \nhe sat down with me when I won my election two years ago, and he was \ncounseling me to take a different approach.\n  But while he would have changed perhaps his early style, he would not \nhave changed his substance. He would not have changed because he could \nnot have changed his values or his ideals or his convictions. He could \nnot alter his passion for social justice, his caring for people, or his \noutrage at their oppression or suffering. His values were the essence \nof who he was. They were the core of his beliefs, the cornerstone of \nhis conscience. They were the hallowed ground of his political soul.\n  Paul Wellstone was a hard-working political activist, a hard-nosed \npolitical organizer, and a smart, savvy politician. He wanted to win. \nHe knew how to win. But he would not win if it meant losing his soul or \nforgetting his conscience or sacrificing his principles.\n  He was no Don Quixote out tilting at windmills. He was rather, a \nRichard the Lionheart on a crusade, mindful of the risks, the pitfalls, \nand the odds, but undeterred by them.\n  Time after time during his 12 years in the Senate, he took his stand \nbelieving that he was right--well, maybe not right but correct. He \nvoted his conscience. He voted his convictions, hoping that 50 or more \nof his colleagues would vote with him, but willing to stand alone if \nthey did not.\n\n  Some people said that Paul's dissenting votes reflected badly on him. \nOthers said they reflected badly on the Senate. Some people believe the \nSenate would be a better place without Paul Wellstone. Others of us \nbelieve the Senate would be a better place with 50 more like him.\n  Those who questioned his accomplishments overlook the obvious. Paul \ncould work tirelessly, speak persuasively, and do everything \neffectively. But he could only vote once--1 out of 100, 1 out of 535.\n  Paul had only 2 years out of his 12 years with a Democratic \nPresident, Senate, and House, as the Republicans will have again in \nJanuary. For his other 10 years, Paul served in divided government. He \ndid not accomplish all he wanted to. He did not accomplish much he \nwanted to. But he accomplished all he could. And he would have \naccomplished so much more if death had not intervened so suddenly and \nso cruelly.\n  There was so much life and so much politics left in Paul Wellstone, \nand so much courage. His death echoes the words of Ernest Hemingway:\n\n       Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their \n     fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their \n     society. Moral courage is a rarer quality than bravery in \n     battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, \n     vital quality of those who would seek to change a world which \n     yields most painfully to change. If people bring so much \n     courage to this world, the world has to kill them to break \n     them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks everyone \n     and afterwards many are strong at the broken places. But \n     those that will not break, it kills. It kills the very good \n     and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you \n     are none of those, you can be sure that it will kill you too \n     but there will be no special hurry.\n\n  Those are the words of Ernest Hemingway.\n  Paul Wellstone wasn't that fatalistic. At least, he didn't live or \npractice the politics of fatalism. Paul was a social reformer and a \ncrusader for social and economic reform. He believed in it. He \ndedicated his life to it. He gave his life for it. He knew the odds \nwere stacked heavily against him, especially here in Washington. He \nknew how hard it was; how unusual the circumstances had to be for a \nPaul Wellstone to make it to the Senate. He knew how hard it was for a \nPaul Wellstone to stay here, to combat the powerful forces aligned \nagainst him and their enormous financial and political resources that \nwould try to defeat him.\n  He detested political fundraising. He disliked the amounts of money \nhe had to ask for, and he distrusted most of the people who could \nprovide it. His loathing of fundraising was matched only by his hatred \nof flying in small airplanes--the principal reason he vowed his 1996 \ncampaign would be his last. But when the time came, he could not turn \nhis back on the crusade. He could not abandon the causes, and he could \nnot leave the people--because it was the people Paul loved. He loved \nbeing with people.\n  As long as he wasn't raising money from them, or flying with them, \nPaul loved being with people--real people, farmers, iron rangers, \neducators, senior citizens, children, all classes, all races, all \nreligions, all points of view. Paul practiced the politics of \ndiversity, and inclusion, and empowerment. He truly cared about people \nas individuals. He cared about their lives, their families, their well-\nbeing. He loved visiting veterans homes, nursing homes, and schools. He \nloved spending hours with people who couldn't vote or benefit him \npolitically.\n  He cared about people because they needed him--not because he needed \nthem. The poor, the unfortunate, the mentally ill, the disadvantaged \nand the distressed--he loved working for them, working to make their \nlives better, and working to give them a chance, a job, a farm, a home, \na life.\n  I agree with the majority leader. If this Senate, if this Congress \nand this administration want to show their respect for Paul Wellstone, \nif they want to honor his memory, we will pass and the President will \nsign into law the Wellstone-Domenici Mental Health Parity bill before \nwe adjourn this year. Nothing less would do him justice. Nothing else \nwould make him happier.\n  Paul came to love this institution of the Senate. For an organizer, \nit was the ultimate challenge. He genuinely liked most of his \ncolleagues--even those he disagreed with most of the time. Yes. He got \nfrustrated, discouraged, and impatient. But he respected the Senate. He \nloved being a Senator, and he was learning how to be a great one.\n  He was a great man. He was a great husband--with an even greater \nwife, Sheila. He was a great father and a great politician. He was an \nexcellent U.S. Senator, and he was becoming a great one. But death \ndenied him that opportunity. And it denied us him, and it denied the \npeople of Minnesota the leader they elected to represent them.\n  He died on his way to a funeral, that of the father of a friend. He \nflew because he had to, despite what in hindsight seems more like a \npremonition than a fear. He willed himself to fly because he had to be \nthe best U.S. Senator he could be.\n  And he never backed away from adversity. He got on a reliable plane \nwith a reputable charter firm flown by two licensed pilots. They flew \ninto what was reportedly occluded but not threatening weather, with low \nclouds and light, freezing precipitation--not ideal but not unusual for \nnorthern Minnesota in late fall.\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\n  And then, somehow, inexplicably, the plane landed in a desolate \nforest rather than a nearby airport. It burst into a huge conflagration \nand destroyed the lives of eight people, and damaged many more lives \nwho lost their loved ones, and left many thousands--thousands--of \npeople without their leaders, their allies, their heroes, and their \nfriends.\n  But life goes on, as it must. Minnesota held an election, as it \nshould. Senator-elect Norm Coleman conducted himself honorably in the \naftermath of that great tragedy and won honorably and honestly in that \nelection and has earned the right, through the expressed will of the \npeople of Minnesota, to serve as a U.S. Senator for 6 years, beginning \nin January. And I pray that he will be our Senator for the next 6 \nyears.\n  But former Vice President Mondale performed a great service to our \nDFL Party in Minnesota, to our State, and I believe to our democracy by \nstepping forward at the last moment when, in hindsight, the situation \nwas impossible but seemed possible only because it was former Vice \nPresident Mondale.\n  Senator Dean Barkley is an excellent appointment made by Governor \nVentura. He has earned this honor. He is knowledgeable. He is \nexperienced. And he is committed to good government. He has proven that \nas commissioner of State planning. Through his own political pioneering \nhe has forged an independent strength and spirit which has captured the \npolitical imagination of the people throughout our State and offers \ngreat promise in the years ahead, and he will have himself great \npromise in the years ahead. I am honored to be working with him during \nthese next months, as I look forward to working with Senator-elect \nColeman when he begins his term in January.\n  We have a special spirit in Minnesota. Our political spirit is \ntestified to here today by Congressman Jim Ramstad and Congressman Mark \nKennedy, who are witnessing these words of tribute to their colleague. \nBoth worked closely with Senator Wellstone, especially Congressman \nRamstad during his long years in the House with Paul on many issues of \nwhich they shared concern and commitment. And Paul's staff, who loved \nhim and gave their lives of service with him, and who are suffering a \nloss that is also immeasurable, are here as well. And I pray that they, \ntoo, will find opportunities in the future. I know they will, but it \njust will not be with Paul.\n  Years ago, then-President John Kennedy paraphrased a statement made \nby Theodore Roosevelt which seems like a fitting bipartisan note on \nwhich to end these remarks. He said in New York City, in a speech \nparaphrasing President Roosevelt:\n\n       The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, \n     whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who knows \n     the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends \n     himself in a worthy cause; who at best, if he wins, knows the \n     thrills of high achievement, and, if he fails, at least fails \n     daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those \n     cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\n\n  Paul, you have won many battles, but now you can wipe the dust and \nsweat and blood off of your face, and may you rest in eternal peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Mr. President, I stand to say a few words in honor of \nthe late Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Over a decade ago, Minnesota sent one of its best to this Chamber. He \nfollowed in the special tradition of public service that our State \nknows well. From Ramsey to Stassen, from Olson to Humphrey, from \nMondale to, yes, Ventura, our State has broken the mold more than once.\n  The man we sent here was Paul Wellstone, and no one would dispute \nthat Minnesota broke the mold again. Paul was short in stature but, as \nit proved, enormous in energy and passion. He had a passion for \nprinciple, he had a passion for politics, and, most of all, he had a \npassion for people.\n  Paul was a fighter, and, much like Hubert Humphrey, a Happy Warrior. \nPaul was the most effective kind of fighter there is: one that never \ngives up--never. And if there is one attribute that his colleagues and \nhis constituents admired, it was this: his unrelenting energy to fight \nthe fight.\n  I knew Paul. I respected Paul. We both have been like salmon in our \nown political rivers, swimming into the currents. Therefore, \nunderstanding his tireless energies in the cause of change, I am highly \nhonored to speak to his memory today.\n  True, there is an empty desk here today, a shrouded reminder of a \nlife cut short. But for the Paul Wellstone I knew, the empty chair is \nmore telling. Whether he was in this Chamber or at home in Minnesota, \nPaul was on his feet, out of his chair, speaking his mind. Always \nmoving--in thought, in language, in body--Paul was, indeed, a man of \nmotion and, more than that, a man of emotion. For if there is something \nthat we all knew about Paul, he not only believed in things, he felt \nthem. This was why Paul Wellstone was so formidable. For thought can be \npersuaded, changed, and abated. But a feeling? Never.\n  Paul, his wife Sheila, and their daughter Marcia tragically perished \nin the northlands of our State. Their untimely fate was sadly shared by \nthree loyal staff members--Tom Lapic, Will McLaughlin, and Mary \nMcEvoy--as well as the two pilots--Captains Richard Conry and Michael \nGuess.\n  As an unexpected and new Member of this Chamber--but more, as a \nsingular citizen of the State of Minnesota--allow me to take this \nmoment to express my personal and heartfelt condolences to all of those \nfamilies who lost their loved ones. I know I speak for all Minnesotans \nwhen I say to those families and friends: Your loss was our loss, and \nwe are all crushingly sorry for it.\n  Paul was unique, one of a kind. And yet, the essence of the man was \nno different from anyone in this Chamber. He wanted to make his State, \nand his Nation--our world--a better place. We all may differ about how \nto do so, and some may have disagreed with how Paul saw it, but no one \never doubted his motives. A selfless champion for those who have no \nvoice--the frail, the weak, the disenfranchised--Paul's voice was their \nvoice. And what a voice it was.\n  Typical of Paul's self-deprecating sense of humor, he loved to relate \nhis meeting with a distinguished senior Member of this body, Senator \nFritz Hollings of South Carolina, who remarked to Paul, ``You know, \nSenator Wellstone, you remind me of another Minnesota Senator, Hubert \nH. Humphrey.'' And as Paul began to swell with pride at being in the \ncompany of this great champion of civil rights, the senior Senator \nburst his bubble, ``Yes, sir, just like him, you talk too much.'' Paul \nloved this story, and he loved telling it on himself--so typical of the \nman.\n  Most of all, Paul loved and adored his wife and his family, \nespecially his grandchildren. He loved his friends. He loved Carleton \nCollege in Northfield, MN. He loved his students; and they knew it. \nIndeed, Paul simply loved people. And he loved them simply, \nunabashedly.\n  Paul loved Minnesota and all the people in it. From the known and \nrecognized, to the unknown and uncared for, he loved them all--truly \nand deeply.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Paul loved this distinguished institution. He \nloved and cherished the U.S. Senate, where today I, too, am honored to \nstand. Paul loved his entire staff.\n  Let me take this opportunity to thank Senator Wellstone's staff for \nyour generous and gracious welcome and offer of support in the truly \nhectic days since Thursday when I arrived. That you could be so \nunselfish in your time of unspeakable loss and heartbreak is something \nI will never, ever forget. I sincerely thank you for the help you have \ngiven me.\n  I plan to continue the fight during my short time here on one of \nPaul's signature issues: mental health parity. And with Senator Dayton \nand Minnesota's Congressional delegation, we plan to introduce a bill \nto honor Sheila and Paul Wellstone through a living legacy project. I \nhope that everyone in this Chamber will join us in this tribute.\n  There is a brief passage out of ``Sonnets from the Portuguese,'' by \nElizabeth Barrett Browning, that I would like to share. Her words more \nperfectly express the thoughts that I am so inadequately attempting to \nconvey about our dear, departed friend, Paul Wellstone:\n\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\n\n     ``Guess now who holds thee?''\n     ``--Death,'' I said.\n     But there the silver answer rang:\n     ``Not Death--but Love.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on October 25 the Senate and the people of \nMinnesota, the people of this country, and I personally suffered a \nterrible loss--the death of our colleague, Paul Wellstone, who, as we \nknow, died in a plane crash with his wife Sheila and daughter Marcia, \nthree members of his staff, and the pilots.\n  I am sure we will all reflect back on how we were notified, how we \nlearned of this tragedy. I was speaking to Senator Daschle's chief of \nstaff, Pete Rouse, asking him how things were going. We talked quite a \nbit during the last month of the campaign.\n  He said: I have some bad news.\n  What?\n  He said: Senator Wellstone's plane went down in Minnesota, and there \nis no hope that anyone survived that crash.\n  I will never forget that phone call. The passing of Paul Wellstone is \na loss for all of us, those who knew him and those who did not. This \nweek, most of us are returning to Washington for the first time since \nthe tragedy, so this is our opportunity, this is my opportunity, to \nspeak about Paul Wellstone with whom I lived here for 12 years, a long \ntime, a lot of days. I certainly am not qualified to talk about all of \nhis accomplishments. There are professors who will write about his \naccomplishments in years to come. But I can talk about him as a person, \nhow I saw him.\n  He represented Minnesota well; there is no question about that. \nAlthough he did not grow up in Minnesota, moving there as an adult, he \nembraced the state and its people. And the people of Minnesota loved \nhim dearly and deeply. He talked often of how much he enjoyed living in \nMinnesota and how proud he was to represent Minnesotans and be a part \nof the great political legacy of the state.\n  My father-in-law was born in Russia. But as a boy, he immigrated to \nMinnesota, and he grew up in Duluth, a tough town, where he and his \nfriends all had nicknames. My mother-in-law grew up in Minneapolis. So \nwhen I got to meet a Senator from Minnesota, of course, I was eager to \nshare a lot of my personal reflections on my wife's family, and Paul \nand I enjoyed talking about Minnesota.\n  The impact that Paul Wellstone made and the admiration he received \nextended well beyond Minnesota. He and I were allies in many \nlegislative battles, and I know many people in the State of Nevada--\nworking families, veterans, retirees, teachers, students, health care \nprofessionals and their patients--also appreciated him. He was an \narticulate and compassionate public servant who fought fiercely for \nthem. Many more Nevadans, like all Americans, are now better off \nbecause of Paul Wellstone's work in the Senate, and they would be even \nbetter off had he been able to be elected to his third term, as he \nwould have been.\n  Of course, here among his colleagues in the Senate he was not only \nwell liked but respected, as has been said here today on several \noccasions. People might not have always or even often agreed with Paul, \nbut they all had great respect for him. That is why I was so impressed \nto see a number of his Republican colleagues from Minnesota come and \nstand in silence at his desk today.\n  I was fortunate to serve with Paul, to benefit from his advice and \nhis judgment, and to enjoy his friendship. I smile because I am going \nto be lonelier here in the Senate without Paul.\n  I don't know on how many occasions I went to Paul Wellstone: Paul, do \nyou have to do this? And he always explained why he had to do it.\n  I am a better Senator and I know I am a better person for having \nknown Paul. \n  He used his voice to speak passionately and courageously on behalf of \nthe voiceless. He gave hope to the hopeless and helpless. He was a kind \nand gentle person.\n  I used to see him often in the House gym. He would run from his home \nto the gym every morning. When because of illness, he couldn't run \nanymore, without a lot of fanfare and a lot of talk, he walked. Then he \ndecided to work out other places. He went to the gymnasium where the \npolice officers, the Capitol Police, work out. Those of us who knew and \nloved Paul saw his physical deterioration, but it was something about \nwhich he never complained.\n  I remember one occasion when Sheila had gone home and he was here \nalone. He couldn't get dressed; he was in such pain. He came here. We \nhelped him down to the physician's office. He never complained. He was \nin such pain, sweat coming off his head.\n  He was a tough person physically, a tough person. I can vouch for \nthat. He was a champion wrestler, high school and college. I think \nprobably the dedication that it takes to be a wrestler, losing weight, \nhaving to exert total energy for an extended period of time, the work \nethic he developed, the things he did physically and mentally and \nemotionally, and his determination that made him so successful on the \nmat also prepared him well for the successes he had as an organizer and \nactivist, campaigner, Senator, and a person.\n  Paul Wellstone was a fighter who always remained true to his beliefs, \nstood up for his principles, served the interests of the people of \nMinnesota and the United States.\n  There are many things about Paul Wellstone that I remember and hold \ndear. I can say without any hesitation that he was my friend. I think \nhe thought I was his friend.\n  I remember the first time I ever heard Paul Wellstone speak. That was \nin 1990 when there was a public reception in Statuary Hall for the \nnewly elected Senators. We were all there. He stood and gave a great \nspeech. I asked: Who is this guy? He said it so well. He said things I \nthought about, the importance of politics and government and being \ninvolved. He spoke of his grassroots campaign.\n  I remember the last speech I heard him give, right there. In the \nyears I have been in the Senate, that seat has been the place of great \nspeeches. Paul Wellstone took over Dale Bumpers' seat. They both had a \nsimilar style in many respects. They both wandered around back there \nwith that long cord.\n  The last speech I heard Paul give, he said, among other things--and \nthis is a quote--\n\n       You could call me a softie. I am a softie.\n\n  And he was. He believed he could help people who are less fortunate \nthan he, someone that didn't have a Ph.D., who had been a college \nprofessor, hadn't been a U.S. Senator, who didn't have the fine loving \nfamily that he had. He could reach out to them. He felt he could do \nthat. He was a softie.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't always go to the prayer breakfasts held every \nWednesday, but I do go on occasion. I don't go every Wednesday. But I \nwanted to hear Paul Wellstone at a Senate prayer breakfast, so I went \nto that prayer breakfast. It was a memorable experience for me to hear \nPaul talk about his spirituality, which is something he didn't speak \nout about in public--except on this occasion. I will never forget that \nprayer breakfast, where Paul Wellstone spoke of his spirituality, his \nfaith, his deeply held principles. He was a man committed to ideas and \nideals.\n  I also remember Paul for the love he had for his wife Sheila. They \nwere inseparable. In this campaign, there were a lot of comparisons \nmade between his campaign and mine in 1986, where the opposing \ncandidate switched parties; there were a lot of similarities. He said \ntalk to Sheila about that, show her the ads that you ran. They were \nalways together, never apart. Even now it is so. They had the love of \ntheir children, the surviving boys, Mark and David. One is involved in \npublic housing and the other is a wrestling coach and teacher. Right \nhere, a few feet in front of me, on one of those Fridays where we were \ntrying to get everything done and get out of here, Paul was so anxious \nto go. Why? Because he thought this was the time his son's wrestling \nteam was going to be the State champions of Minnesota. Paul Wellstone, \nBarbara Boxer, and I were talking. I was trying to stall for time, and \nI asked, ``How many wrestling matches have you had, Paul?''\n  I also remember Paul because of my dad. As I have said here on \noccasion, my father committed suicide. One reason I have been able to \npublicly talk about that is because of Paul\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nWellstone. Paul helped us to understand mental illness is not something \nto be ashamed of. Any time Paul Wellstone publicly had a chance to talk \nabout suicide, he talked about suicide prevention and talked about my \nefforts on this. He never tried to take credit for anything alone. He \nworked so hard on the issue mental health parity. Part of that is \nsuicide. We have 31,000 people a year killing themselves. Because of \nPaul, we are doing something about that. We passed a resolution in the \nSenate recognizing it as a national health problem. We have given money \nto research the problems of suicide, depression and mental illness. \nThere are medical schools now studying why people kill themselves. So I \nwill never forget Paul Wellstone for a lot of reasons, not the least of \nwhich is my father.\n  I will also remember Paul Wellstone for the things he did for the so-\ncalled little people--those who are often not noticed or are neglected. \nHow many of us around here know the people who clean our offices? Not \nmany of us. They come by late at night when we are gone, and when we \ncome into the offices in the morning the trash cans are empty, the \ndesks are cleaned off. It's easy to overlook the people who do that, \nwho work hard to help us. Paul and Sheila Wellstone wanted to know who \nthey were, so they waited and waited until somebody came to their \noffice so they could thank them for cleaning the office. That also \nincludes the elevator operators, doorkeepers, police officers, \njanitors, as I have already mentioned. He knew them by name, stopped to \ntalk with them and listened to them.\n  To show the kind of guy he was with the Capitol Police, Mr. \nPresident, this man holds the record--he was suffering from multiple \nsclerosis and he holds the record--with all these big, physical, well-\ntrained, young policemen--he holds the record for pushups and pullups. \nYou can go and see who holds the record at the Capitol Police \ngymnasium. It is Senator Paul Wellstone. He was a hell of a man, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  He stared disease in the face; he had multiple sclerosis. Did anybody \never hear Paul whine, complain, or feel sorry for himself? No. He took \nit right on the jaw, like he did a lot of punches, and he went about \ndoing his business. Those of us who worked with him for 12 years saw \nhow his physical condition deteriorated. How long would it have been \nbefore he had to walk with a cane? I don't know. But he persevered. \nThat is one reason I remember Paul Wellstone.\n  Of course, Mr. President, we all remember Paul Wellstone because he \nstood for something. No one could ever question Paul Wellstone's sense \nof value. I still smile when I remember saying to Paul, ``Do you have \nto do this?'' Well, I knew the answer before I asked the question. We \nwho hold public office are judged on the difficult votes we are called \non to make. To his credit, Paul Wellstone relied on his conscience--not \non consultants--in such moments. I admire him so much for that.\n  Before entering politics, Paul was a gifted and popular college \nprofessor. To a great extent, he remained a teacher even after entering \nthe Senate, educating his constituents about government, and \nencouraging colleagues to learn more about issues and consider other \nperspectives, engaging us and challenging us. There are lots of times I \ncan reflect back on when Paul Wellstone, in his Socrates-like \npresentations, was trying to educate the Senate. He would say to me, \n``I am wasting my time; what good am I doing here?'' I would proceed to \ntell him all the good he had done. He was educating me, getting me to \nreflect upon what he had done, just like I am sure he did at Carleton \nCollege with his students.\n  Paul was a person with great compassion, who reminded us of our moral \nobligation to care for all human beings--I repeat, especially the most \nvulnerable, the hungry, the poor, the homeless, the ill, victims of \nabuse, and others who suffered.\n  Paul Wellstone is irreplaceable. His life was cut short, and because \nof that, it is incumbent upon us in the Senate and throughout America \nto remember his message of hope and compassion and carry forward his \nefforts to secure economic and social justice for all in the best way \nwe can. In that way, we honor the legacy of a great man, Paul \nWellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nvery articulate statement on Paul's life. We all shared experiences in \nworking with Paul.\n  Every Sunday, the Washington Post Style Section prints a column \ncalled ``Life Is Short.'' The column selects one individual and gives a \nsnapshot of that individual's life. If that column focused on Senator \nPaul Wellstone's life, the single snapshot would be a large photo \nalbum.\n  Senator Daschle has said Paul Wellstone was the ``soul of the \nSenate.'' I believe Paul tried to find the soul in all of us. He \nchallenged us, on a daily basis, to remember that every man, woman, and \nchild in this Nation should have access to quality education, a first-\nrate health care system that includes mental health and prescription \ndrug coverage, and jobs that provide decent minimum wage.\n  Three weeks ago, Paul made his final appearance in the Chamber. Paul \ngave a very passionate speech about the need to extend unemployment \nbenefits and provide more help for our veterans. His closing comments \nwere vintage Paul. He said:\n\n       What are people who cannot find jobs, who are out of work, \n     who are struggling to put food on the table, supposed to do?\n       What in the world is going on? What has happened to our \n     humanity?\n\n  Later that day, Paul came back to the Senate floor to give his \nthoughts about the 2003 Defense spending bill. He thanked Senators \nInouye and Stevens for their inclusion of an amendment that addressed \ndomestic violence and sexual assault which he had championed. As we all \nknow, the issue is not only important to Paul, it was especially \nimportant to his wife Sheila.\n  At the end of those remarks, Paul said, in reference to his own \nprovision that was not included in the final conference agreement:\n\n       I know my colleagues did their best. We will be back.\n\n  That was Paul--always gracious in both victory and defeat. Even more \nimportantly, he never focused on defeat because he was constantly \nplotting his next move to better educate his colleagues and their staff \non the issues--always the college professor.\n  I had the honor and the pleasure of working with Paul on an array of \nissues--education, veterans, dairy, health care, and job training. \nThese are not easy issues, but the difficulty of the issue never \ndeterred Paul. He always saw the glass half full rather than a half-\nempty glass.\n  In 1997 and 1998, Senators Kennedy, DeWine, Wellstone, and I worked \ntogether to pass the Workforce Investment Act, legislation that \nrestructured our job training system. Throughout those 2 years, we had \nmany long meetings. In every single meeting, Paul told us about the \nimpact various provisions would have on Minnesota. There was never a \nmeeting, public or private, where Paul did not mention the concerns and \nideas that were on the minds of his constituents.\n  Paul would also tell stories of his children. During many HELP \nCommittee hearings on education, we would often hear about his two \nchildren who were teaching in the Minnesota public school system. He \nwas so proud of all his children, his grandchildren, and, of course, \nSheila.\n  Paul was also very proud of his staff. He had great respect for their \nviews and always remarked to his colleagues that he was very fortunate \nto have a very talented and devoted staff.\n  Three years ago at the funeral of Walter Payton, the outstanding \nChicago Bears running back, who was also an extraordinary human being, \nthe Rev. Jesse Jackson remarked that on a tombstone, there is a \nbirthday, a small dash, and a date of passing. He said:\n\n       The dash between those two dates is the part you control. . \n     . . The dash determines the height and depth of how you live \n     your life.\n\n  Paul Wellstone maximized the height and depth of his dash. I was so \nlucky to have known Paul, to have had an opportunity to not only work \nwith him but to learn from him and, most importantly, to have been able \nto call him a good friend.\n  I was en route to Minnesota to campaign for Paul when I learned of \nhis tragic death. I instead spent time with\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nhis wonderful sons, David and Mark. I brought them the pictures of \ntheir dad celebrating the dairy program victory with Senator Leahy and \nanother recent victory for Minnesota as well as New England. It brought \nproud smiles to their faces. As I had expected, they were so much like \ntheir dad. I know they will continue on the path that Paul and Sheila \ncreated for them.\n  Paul, I will miss you, the Senate will miss you, and the country will \nmiss you. May your commitment, energy, integrity, and passion always \nguide us to do our best at all times. Goodbye, Paul.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, life gives no joy like that it takes away. \nAs always, the poet said it best. All of us in the Senate were suddenly \nand tragically reminded of that on a Friday morning 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago--a \ncold, gray, dreary October day. I was in a van driving between Fargo \nand Grand Forks, ND, when I received a call saying that an airplane had \ncrashed in northern Minnesota and that Senator Paul Wellstone, his wife \nSheila, staff, and others were on the plane. To say that I and others \nhave been deeply saddened, in fact devastated, by the loss of one of \nour colleagues is perhaps to even understate it.\n  Paul Wellstone and Sheila Wellstone died as they campaigned \nthroughout Minnesota for another term in the Senate. It was a tough \ncampaign, a close campaign, a hard-fought campaign. And yet Paul \nWellstone never complained about that. He seemed to relish it.\n  One of the last things he told me on the floor of the Senate several \nweeks ago about this campaign was, with a sparkle in his eye: We are \ngoing to win this campaign. He said: Byron, I have 4,000 volunteers--\n4,000 volunteers--who are going to be working election day in Minnesota \nfor me, getting people to the polls, driving people, calling people.\n  That was so typical of Paul Wellstone. It was always about citizen \naction, about people rising to the passion of an idea. That was typical \nPaul Wellstone.\n  Paul and Sheila Wellstone were wonderful friends to many of us in the \nSenate, and our thoughts and prayers go to the family, the families of \nthe pilots who lost their lives, the families of Paul's daughter and \nthe three staff people who were on the plane as well.\n  As my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, said in what I \nthought was a wonderful tribute to his friend and colleague, all of us \nwould be remiss if we did not say to Paul's staff: Paul would want \nfirst and foremost for us to recognize you today. Paul attracted to his \nservice in the Senate men and women with the burning in their soul to \ndo good things, who cared about fairness and justice and who cared \nabout public service.\n  All of us who work here know Paul Wellstone had a wonderful staff, \nand they have been through some very difficult times, about as \ndifficult as it can get for a Senate staff. Our thoughts and prayers go \nout to them and for strength as well.\n  Today let me for a moment remember Paul and Sheila for their service \nto our country. This is a rather small community in the Senate--men and \nwomen who love this country, fellow travelers who want to make \ndemocracy work. What the American people see are some pitched battles \nduring the day and the early evening hours in the middle of a debate in \nwhich there are different philosophies and ideas that clash on the \nSenate floor. What they do not see is we are colleagues and friends, \nfirst and foremost.\n  I think the entire Senate membership would say: We have, indeed, lost \na couple of good friends, Paul and Sheila Wellstone. Our country has \nlost two tireless fighters for justice. The Senate has lost its \nstrongest voice for those who do not have it so good in this country. \nAnd American politics has lost the true champion for the little guy.\n  If ever a man and wife were a team, it was Paul and Sheila Wellstone. \nThey did everything together. Sheila's public service, as Paul would be \nthe first to tell you, was every bit as important as his. That public \nservice was marked by a green bus, and that green bus meant in \nMinnesota and our part of the country citizen action, people \nempowerment, and something that was on the move, a mission, a campaign \non the move.\n  It is true, as my colleague said, Paul was different. He would not \nhave been caught dead in Ferragamo shoes, even if he wanted them, and \nhe did not. He was not a man to wear Brooks Brothers suits. He was \nshort of stature and tall of ambition with a power and passion of \nideas, as my colleague from Nevada just described, that would at the \nend stage of any debate leave him sitting at that chair with two more \namendments to offer--the hour was late and patience was short. \nImploring him made no difference. You could say: Paul, Paul, we are \njust out of time; can you just not offer one of these amendments? The \nanswer was always the same: Absolutely not. I am here to offer this \namendment. This amendment is important. I came here to do that work and \nthere are people who depend on me to offer this amendment--people whose \nlives were changed because of this amendment.\n\n  It was always with Paul: No. And we always turned away understanding \nthe passion that burned in his soul to do the right thing, to do the \nthing he felt was important for our country.\n  Paul was different in a much more significant way as well. In today's \nmodern politics, it is so often the case that politicians with a \nsophisticated network of pollsters and advisers are able to evaluate \nexactly which way the wind is blowing, to be able to set their sail to \nget maximum capability from that wind. It is a constant job of tacking \nfor some into or with that wind to find out exactly where the maximum \nwind will be. Paul was not interested in sailing or winds. Paul was \nonly interested in the rudder. He set the rudder and he did not care \nwhere the wind was: This is the direction I am going and it does not \nmatter whether it is a favorable wind or an unfavorable wind. This is \nwhere we are headed and this is why--very unusual in modern politics \nbut also very refreshing.\n  I found it interesting that those newspapers that were not very good \nto his ideas in life, in death gave Paul great credit for raising \nideas, for standing by his principles, for never wavering and never \ncausing for a moment any constituent anyplace to wonder where he stood. \nYou knew where Paul Wellstone stood.\n  There are two things, of a great many, that stand out in my mind. One \nday I sent around a memorandum to Senators saying we were going to \nvisit a youth detention center in Maryland and I wanted to know if \nanyone wanted to come along. Paul Wellstone called me and said: I would \nlike to come.\n  The two of us, with some staff, went out to a youth detention center \nand spent the entire morning sitting in that youth detention center \ntalking to kids, kids who had committed murder, kids who were drug \naddicted, kids who had been in the worst kind of trouble one could \npossibly imagine. Driving back to Capitol Hill after this visit, I once \nagain got another glimpse of Paul Wellstone's soul. He said: If someone \nhad cared about those kids early in their lives they would not be there \ntoday. Someone needed to help those kids at the right moment, and we \ncan do that in the Senate.\n  To Paul, that visit was, how can we reach out to help people who need \nhelp at a time when they desperately need that help?\n  In the last couple of months, Paul came up to me while we were in the \nwell of the Senate, and he said: I was campaigning in Minnesota and I \nwent to an independent auto repair shop, and the major automobile \nmanufacturers would not give the computer codes to these independent \nauto repair shops. These small independents are telling me they cannot \nwork on the new cars. They do not have the computer cards for the \ncarburetors and all those things they have to have to work on those \ncars.\n  He said: That is unfair, and it is going to drive those folks out of \nbusiness. This is going to kill the little guy.\n  He asked if I would hold a hearing on this in my Consumer \nSubcommittee. I said of course I will. We put together some information \non it. The day of the hearing came and Senator Wellstone was to be the \nlead-off witness. That was not enough for Senator Wellstone. As was his \nwant, in the way he did politics, the hearing room was packed. It was \nfull of mechanics\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nand independent repair shop owners from all across this country. I \nguess that hearing room holds probably 100 people, and there were 150 \npeople there. Paul had brought his people, the independent repair shop \nfolks, to that hearing room as a demonstration of this problem, to say \nthis problem ought to be fixed.\n\n  Paul was the lead-off witness and as was typical with him, with great \npassion he made the case about the unfairness to the little guy, about \nthe independent repair shops trying to make a living, and how what is \nhappening is unfair to them.\n  About 3 weeks ago, right before we completed our work and left for \nthe election, Paul came up to me on the floor of the Senate during a \nvote. He was holding a sheet of paper. He was flashing this paper and \nsaying: We won. His point was that the automobile manufacturers had \nreached an agreement with the independent repair shops, and that \nproblem had gotten solved. For Paul, it was about the little guy versus \nthe big guy, about those who did not have the power and those who did.\n  It was always that he wanted to stand on the side of those who did \nnot have the power, those who needed help. That was so much of Paul \nWellstone's life.\n  There is much to say, and my colleagues, I am sure, will say it when \nwe talk about his service to our country. It is sufficient now to say \nthat one of our Senate desks is empty. The Senate has lost a wonderful \nfriend.\n  I conclude by quoting Thomas Moore, if I might, and relate it to \nPaul's service:\n\n     Let fate do her worst; there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy;\n     Which come in the nighttime of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long; long be my heart with such memories fill'd!\n     Like the vase, in which roses have once been distill'd\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang 'round it still.\n\n  Paul Wellstone is no longer in the Senate, his desk is empty, but the \npassion of his ideas most surely will remain for years and years to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I reflect on the life of a friend \nand reflect on a political life. Politics is a fateful calling. The \nvoters can end a political life in a few hours on any Tuesday. \nPromising public careers can be terminated abruptly. But like life \nitself, political life should be measured by its quality rather than \nits quantity. By that measure, Paul Wellstone, a man small in stature, \nbecame a giant in this Senate.\n  This is not my desk in the Senate. My desk is the one directly in \nfront of the desk where we honor the memory of Paul Wellstone. So many \ntimes I had to leave my desk because when Senator Paul Wellstone got \nwound up on an issue of great importance to him, you had better clear \nout. He had this famous desk with the long microphone cord, and he \nwould roam all over this area, speaking with passion and commitment. I \nwanted to stand back a few steps to witness it because it was truly \nhistoric when he took to the Senate floor.\n  I do not think there were any routine Wellstone speeches. With all \ncredit to his staff, I am sure he embellished them in the certain \nqualities that even the best staff person could not add. There was no \nroutine nature about Paul Wellstone in politics.\n  I remember when he first ran. People kind of laughed about the idea. \nThis professor from a small college in Minnesota is going to run \nagainst an incumbent Senator?\n  We all know what that was about. This had to be a class project. He \nwas going to go out and make his stand, make his speeches, and probably \nlose by an embarrassing margin. But then they started getting reports \nback from that early campaigning. This now famous green schoolbus, \nwhich I had a chance to see when I was in Minneapolis for the tribute \nto Paul Wellstone, had a platform on the back where he would stand like \nHarry Truman and make his speeches.\n\n  I remember his television commercial which they replayed during \ntributes after he died in the plane crash. He said: You will have to \nlisten very closely because I don't have much time. I don't have much \nmoney and I have to tell you everything. This is my home; this is where \nI work.\n  It was a classic presentation of what he was all about in just a few \nseconds.\n  At the end of the campaign after he won and surprised everyone, there \nis a photo of Paul, Sheila, and Marcia when Paul agreed to finally \nretire the pair of shoes he wore throughout the campaign. What a sorry \npair of shoes. He was no slave to fashion, to say the least.\n  In his campaign in the Senate, I can recall he was admonished by a \ncolleague to go home and change his shirt because it did not look like \na Senator's shirt. He did not think of those things. Those things were \nso inconsequential to his view.\n  He thought about the important things, the really important things. \nHe reminded us time and again of how those things are overlooked. You \ndraw together 100 Senators across the United States, you put the \nnational political agenda in front of us, and Paul Wellstone found it \nhard to believe that we could miss so many important things.\n  Sheila was the same way. His wife Sheila, the unpaid Senator to \nMinnesota at his side, worked on issues such as domestic abuse, \ninviting all of us to come to an art center she had regularly to \nhighlight what victims were expressing through their art in terms of \ndomestic abuse.\n  We used to talk about Paul Wellstone's amendments on the floor. They \nwere great amendments. Some of them did not get a great number of \nvotes. We used to speak in the caucus about the so-called Wellstone \namendments. We used to have competition to make sure that he got enough \nvotes so it was not called a Wellstone amendment. And he said, I win \nsome of these amendments. And he did. Without fail, every one of the \namendments challenged every one of us to look at the national agenda \nand look at America from a different perspective.\n  We get caught up in the life of public service and forget the people \nthat Paul Wellstone never forgot. I think back to some of them. Paul \nWellstone did not make any bones about the fact that he opposed the \nVietnam war. During the 1960s, when many of us were in college and that \nwas a dominant issue of the time, he was opposed to that war. But you \nwould find, as I did in his tribute in Minneapolis, the veterans groups \ncoming out in large numbers to pay tribute to Paul Wellstone. There was \nno separation between them. Paul Wellstone opposed the war, but he did \nnot oppose the warriors who came home. He became their champion in the \nSenate.\n  When people would bring up his own military record, or lack of it, or \nhis own position on Vietnam, he would always be able to rally the \nveterans of Minnesota who would say, we are for Paul Wellstone because \nhe fought for us to make sure we were not forgotten when we came home. \nThat is the kind of person he was.\n  I think of the debate on education in the Senate, the no child left \nbehind bandwagon. I was on it. What a big bandwagon it was. It was the \nPresident, the leaders, the Democrats and the Republicans in the House \nand Senate, liberal and conservative alike. We would all be for no \nchild left behind. But not Paul Wellstone. Paul Wellstone was the one \nvoice saying, wait a minute, we may be going too far here. High-stakes \ntesting for kids can destroy their lives in the future. Are we moving \ntoo fast without thinking about the children and what it could be doing \nto their lives? Again and again, Paul Wellstone forced us all to slow \ndown even as we were involved in some political movement that seemed to \nhave great force behind us, to stop and think about the actual people \naffected, the children, the teachers, the families.\n\n  He was first and foremost a teacher himself, at Carlton College and \nin the Senate. Time and again, he taught us. He never taught us better \nthan the lesson on mental health parity. Paul Wellstone realized that \nour treatment of mental health in the United States of America in the \n21st century is shameful. It is disgraceful. He told us over and over \nthat we treat people with mental illness as if they are suffering\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nfrom some curse rather than some illness. He begged us time and again \nto treat fairly people who suffer from mental illness.\n  I join with everyone here today, all the Members of the Senate who \nhave given speeches and nice comments about Paul Wellstone, all the \nmembers of our government, from the President on down, who said what a \ngreat man he was and great values he brought to public life. Members \ncan prove it by passing this Wellstone-Domenici bill for mental health \nparity and do it on an expedited schedule. Paul Wellstone, if he were \nhere today, would say: Forget the speeches, forget the flowers; pass \nthe bill, help some people. That is what government is supposed to be \nabout. That is a challenge to us.\n  We ought to mark our calendar today. Here we are, November 12, \nthinking about the challenges this country is going to face. Instead, \nstep back and say: Where will we be 2 or 3 months from now dealing with \nmental health parity? Will we have done enough? Paul Wellstone led that \nfight in a way that was classic Wellstone.\n  In the debate he would know, many times, that the forces were against \nhim, that he did not stand a chance. He would stand here with such \npassion and commitment and make these speeches, hour after hour, if \nnecessary, always respectful of his opposition, always on the Senate \nfloor, even for those who saw the world in completely different terms, \nbut always committed to what he was fighting for.\n  They tell us the politics of Paul Wellstone are now out of fashion. I \ndon't believe that for a second. You ought to know that since Paul \nWellstone passed away, many in the Senate have been trading phone calls \nlate at night in their homes talking about not only Paul and the great \nloss of Sheila and Marcia and the three campaign workers and the two \npilots, but reflecting on ourselves and why we are here. Paul would \nlike that. Paul would like that his passing would cause us all to think \na little bit harder about who will carry on his fight.\n  I have heard a lot of us in these conversations, my colleagues and \nmyself, talking about what we need to do to make sure that voice is not \nsilenced in the Senate, to make certain that Paul Wellstone's passion \nand commitment live on. That is the greatest tribute of all.\n  For 6 years, I served in the Senate with Paul Wellstone. For 2 years, \nhe was over my shoulder at this Senate desk.\n  For every Member of the Senate, Paul Wellstone will always be over \nour shoulder keeping an eye on what we do, listening to our speeches, \nasking us in real human terms whether we are forgetting someone in the \nprocess.\n  The victims who cannot afford lobbyists in Washington, DC, the poor \nand dispossessed who may not even have the will to vote, let alone to \nparticipate in this process, the people without the resources to be \nheard, who is going to speak for them? Paul Wellstone did. Those who \nstand in tribute to his memory should make certain that voice is never \nsilenced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will also say a few words about Paul \nand Sheila Wellstone. Paul and Sheila were good friends of my wife \nAnne, my son John, and myself. We met shortly after they arrived in \nWashington for Paul to take up his duties in the Senate. Our friendship \ngrew over time. Friendship came easily to Paul and to Sheila because \nthey had a genuine interest in and a compassion for other people. So on \na personal level, Paul and Sheila will be greatly missed.\n  On a policy level, they will also be greatly missed in this Senate. \nPaul believed strongly that government should and could help improve \nthe lives of average people. He championed better education for our \nchildren, better access to health care, particularly mental health \ncare, as my colleague from Illinois has described. He championed a \ndecent wage for workers. Any issue that presented a choice between the \npublic interest and a special interest, there was no question where \nPaul stood.\n  Sheila was also a fierce advocate for policies in which she believed. \nHer focus for many years was on the problems of domestic violence, and \nshe and Paul helped spotlight that problem. They did much to put it on \nour national agenda. Paul said what he believed. He voted his \nconvictions, even when those convictions placed him in a small minority \nin the Senate. He was proud to proclaim himself a Liberal in an age \nwhere most Americans have been persuaded that liberal is a pejorative \nterm.\n\n  The truth is that his views, when not distorted by his opponents, \nwere very much endorsed by the majority of the Americans. His core \nbelief was that those who are less fortunate should be helped to obtain \nthe tools with which to succeed. That belief is shared by most in this \ngreat country. His service in the Senate was an effort to implement \nthat belief.\n  When serving here in the Senate, one is always aware that the \nimperative to do what is right sometimes conflicts with the desire to \nbe reelected. Paul always chose to do what he considered right and damn \nthe consequences. He came to the Senate with a clear intent to make a \ndifference in the history of his nation, and he succeeded. The death of \nPaul and Sheila and their daughter, their staff and pilots, was a great \ntragedy for our country. It was also a great tragedy for this Senate. \nThe Senate will be a lesser place without Paul Wellstone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nto pay tribute to the memory of our tragically departed friend and \ncolleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, and to remember his life partner \nSheila, their daughter, and the others who lost their lives in the \nplane crash.\n  We send our condolences and our prayers to the families of all of \nthose who were involved.\n  Whenever Senator Wellstone came to the floor of the Senate to fight \non behalf of our Nation's most vulnerable, to fight for economic \nfairness, for working men and women, to fight for quality public \neducation and health care for all our children, can't you just hear his \nvoice now--standing up over and over again to fight and to speak out in \nbehalf of the people he represented--to protect our environment.\n  In thinking about Senator Wellstone, I thought of the words of \nFrederick Douglass in 1857 when he said:\n\n       If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who \n     profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation want \n     crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without \n     thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful \n     roar of its many waters.\n\n  Paul Wellstone was ready to fight for progress. And he was unafraid \nof the war that followed. In fact, he embraced it.\n  Paul Wellstone believed the status quo can never be a cause but, \nrather, must be the constant casualty of time in any nation dedicated \nto equality and justice and freedom.\n  Did he win every battle? No. But the very fight of Senator Paul \nWellstone ennobled the Senate and enlightened this Nation by giving \nvoice to the challenges that confront us.\n  I would like to read from a speech that Senator Wellstone gave to \ngraduating students at Swarthmore College. The passion of Paul's words \nreminds us of the shame of passivity, the passivity of standing back \nand watching millions of families slide into poverty, and our Nation's \nfuture slip away from them.\n  Senator Wellstone asked:\n\n       How can it be that in the United States of America--today--\n     at the peak of our economic performance--we are still being \n     told that we cannot provide a good education for every child?\n       We are still being told that we cannot provide good health \n     care for every citizen.\n       We are still being told that people can't look forward to \n     jobs that they can support themselves and their children on.\n       We're still being told that we cannot achieve the goal of \n     having every five-year-old come to kindergarten ready to \n     learn.\n       How can it be that we are being told that we cannot do this \n     at the peak of our economic performance?\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\n       I say to you today that it is not right. It is not \n     acceptable. We can do much better, and if not now, when? If \n     we don't do this now, when will we do it as a nation?\n       That is a betrayal of our heritage. The impoverishment of \n     so many children is our national disgrace.\n\n  Senator Wellstone did not pull any punches. Yet he was not a cynic \neither. He believed that by giving wings to the nobler angels of our \nNation, we could place progress in the wind.\n  In the same speech I was quoting from, Senator Wellstone closed, \nurging people to get involved with politics and public service and \nbecome those nobler angels whose wings would give flight to change and \nto justice. He said:\n\n       I do not believe the future will belong to those who are \n     content with the present.\n       I do not believe the future will belong to the cynics, or \n     to those who stand on the sideline.\n       The future will belong to those who have passion, and to \n     those who are willing to make the personal commitment to make \n     our country better.\n       The future will belong to those who believe in the beauty \n     of their dreams.\n\n  We will miss Paul Wellstone's leadership, his voice on this Senate \nfloor. We will miss the beauty of his dreams of an America where the \nmost vulnerable among us are valued, where all of our children are \ncherished, and where no one who gets up and goes to work in the morning \ngoes to sleep at night in poverty.\n  But, Paul, while we will miss you coming to the floor of the Senate \nto share those dreams, I promise you those dreams will not die.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the Presiding Officer a good afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I, too, would like to lend a few comments to one we \nfondly regarded as the ``Little Giant,'' Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  I, obviously, had an opportunity over the years to converse, discuss, \ndebate, agree--occasionally disagree--with our friend who truly \nbelieved in his cause, a cause that was perhaps more liberal than my \nown, but a cause that was reflected on what makes the Senate so unique; \nthat is, the cause of the balance that we have, more or less a \nmainstream of thought that prevails in the Senate. But in many cases it \nis brought about by those who have very active views, whether they be \nliberals or conservatives.\n  But Paul Wellstone did represent, if you will, the pendulum in the \nSenate. His contribution was one of activism, of standing for the \nunderdog, of reflecting on the needs of some we can never properly \nrepay; specifically, the veterans of this Nation who have given so much \nso that we can live in the freedom of our democracy.\n  As I have reflected, along with Senator Stevens and Representative \nYoung, because of the vast distances between our State of Alaska and \nWashington, DC, and the tribulations of long flights back and forth, \nand the ever-increasing pressures to make dates, particularly during \ncampaigns, having just run a campaign myself, why, I can recall the \nunpleasant evening flights in bad weather, with a recognition that \npeople expect you to be present at a given time. And it is the demands \nthat are constant pressures to try to fulfill obligations that cause \neach Member of both the House and the Senate to live, perhaps, on the \nedge. Unfortunately, that edge results in additional exposure that is \nassociated with accidents. And we have seen that in the passing of our \ngood friend Paul Wellstone, who, again, to me, is referred to as the \n``Little Giant'': small in stature but significant in what he believed. \nAnd his contribution, again, I think is measurable in one sense by \nthose who knew him but in another sense by the legacy he leaves in this \nbody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleague, \nPaul Wellstone.\n  As with the loss of anyone so vital, so full of energy, and so dear \nto us, it is hard to believe that Paul is really gone. But as with a \nbrother, or a father, or a great teacher, even if they have died, they \nleave a part of themselves with those who carry on. They are never \nreally gone.\n  I first met Paul before either of us had been elected to the Senate. \nI was meeting with different people as I considered a run for the \nSenate, and I heard about this professor in Minnesota who was planning \nto run in 1990. I had a chance to visit him at his home. When we met, \nwe laughed at the idea that the two of us or either of us, would ever \nhave been elected to the Senate.\n  But then Paul went on to run a terrific campaign, without a lot of \nmoney, but with a whole lot of energy. When he won, he helped me and \nothers to believe that we could do the same. I will always be grateful \nto him for that example, as I am sure are many others across the \ncountry who were inspired by Paul and the exceptional life that he led.\n  So now we know that whenever a candidate runs a scrappy populist \ncampaign, Paul Wellstone will be there.\n  Paul Wellstone believed in clean elections. Paul was a strong, \nstalwart ally over the years that we served together in the Senate, \nworking for campaign finance reform. He was an original cosponsor of \nthe first McCain-Feingold bill--one of a handful of us, along with \nSenators Claiborne Pell and Fred Thompson and he was there all the way. \nSome have said that the law that we enacted this year went too far. \nCharacteristically, Paul thought that it did not go far enough.\n  Paul Wellstone wrote: ``The way in which money has come to dominate \npolitics is the foremost ethical issue of politics of our time. We need \nto invite ordinary citizens back into American politics to work for \nwhat is right for our nation.''\n  Whenever Americans reform our election campaigns, Paul Wellstone will \nbe there.\n  Paul Wellstone said: ``I don't represent the big oil companies. I \ndon't represent the big pharmaceutical companies. I don't represent the \nEnrons of this world. But you know what, they already have great \nrepresentation in Washington. It's the rest of the people that need \nit.'' That's what Paul Wellstone said.\n  So, whenever there are voices standing up for the little guy, Paul \nWellstone's voice will be there.\n  There is a role that some Senators play of leading where not many \nfollow because they know that it is right. Paul Wellstone had the \ncourage of his convictions. He was not afraid to stand alone. Now that \nhe is gone, there may come more times when some of us will be counted \nas the only vote against something.\n  But whenever a Senator stands alone in the well of the Senate and \ncasts a solitary vote because that's what he or she believes, that \nSenator won't really be alone because Paul Wellstone will be there.\n  There is a role that some Senators play of reminding the rest of us \nof what is right, even when we don't necessarily like to hear it. It \nhas been said many times, and it is nonetheless true, that like Paul \nDouglas, Phil Hart, and Paul Simon before him, Paul Wellstone was the \nconscience of the Senate.\n  Whenever political expediency pulls us to vote one way, but our \nconsciences pull us back the other, Paul Wellstone will be there.\n  Paul Wellstone was a dear, sweet man, and a good friend to those of \nus who knew him. Yes, he had a puckish grin and a ready sense of humor. \nHis passing brings a tear to our eyes.\n  But whenever we think of that smile of his, Paul Wellstone will be \nthere.\n  The Bible says: ``Justice, justice shall you pursue.'' Paul didn't \nneed to be told. That was who he was. Paul Wellstone believed in \njustice with every fiber of his being.\n  Paul fought for justice for children who didn't have enough to eat. \nHe fought for environmental justice, even for the poor side of town. He \nfought for social justice when it came to access to health care. He \nfought for economic justice when it came to a fair minimum wage and the \nability of working families to protect themselves under the bankruptcy \nlaw. And he fought for justice among nations, and for peace. Paul \nWellstone was the very embodiment of justice.\n  And so, Paul Wellstone, here on the Senate floor, there is a hole in \nour hearts. We will miss you, dear friend.\n  But we will still look for you. For wherever it is on this Senate \nfloor, at a political rally, or at a town hall meeting somewhere on a \ncold, windy\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nday in the heartland of America whenever someone speaks for justice, \nPaul Wellstone will be there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Paul Wellstone was an extraordinary \nleader with a common touch. His dedication to the well-being of average \nAmericans was unparalleled in Congress.\n  He believed all of our citizens, no matter how humble their \nbeginnings, or difficult their plight, had an equal right to happy, \nhealthy, and full lives. He always made the time to hear the real needs \nof the people, and he always took the time to speak up for them in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  For Paul, core beliefs were not something to be compromised. He \nunderstood as well as anyone in this body the give-and-take of \nlegislation. But we always knew his values were at the forefront of \nevery battle, and the people of Minnesota could count on him to fight \nfor them with every ounce of his considerable energy and ability.\n  Paul and I were seatmates. His desk is right beside mine on the \nSenate floor. But we were more than neighbors. Paul was our conscience, \nour guiding light. He turned overlooked needs and forgotten causes into \nreal hopes for millions of Americans. For them, Paul Wellstone was \ntheir champion, their Senator.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Wellstone chaired a hearing in the Labor \nCommittee on an issue of great concern to American workers. A group of \nlow-wage men and women were so excited by the prospect of the hearing \nthat they took a day off from work, boarded buses, and headed for the \nhearing. When they arrived, they found the room full and the door \nbarred. But Senator Wellstone heard about the workers who were waiting \nin the hallway, unable to get in. He invited them in and seated them on \nthe dais among the Senators attending the hearing. For Paul, this was \nthe way it was intended to be. For him, there was no distance, no \nbarrier between the people and their elected representatives.\n  Senator Wellstone did his homework. He knew the facts and he also \nknew the reality of everyday life for the people he cared for so deeply \nand served so well. When the Senate debated education policy, we knew \nPaul understood the issues thoroughly. We also knew Paul had spent more \ntime visiting the public schools than any other Senator. He knew the \nchallenges firsthand because he had taken the time to listen to \nparents, teachers, and schoolchildren so he could be a true voice for \nthem in Washington.\n  He taught us all by his example that Americans face challenges \ntogether. He was the embodiment of e pluribus unum, that out of many \npeoples in America, we are one Nation. He lived every moment of every \nday fighting to make our Nation even stronger, ever the beacon of \nopportunity for all of our citizens.\n  Paul, we will miss you. You and Sheila and Marcia leave an \nextraordinary legacy for millions of Americans to honor, to cherish, \nand to carry on. Your outstanding contributions to the Senate, to \nMinnesota, and to the Nation will always be remembered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is with a very heavy heart \nthat all of us gather in the Chamber that will miss one of our own. It \nwas with a very heavy heart we received the news on that snowy, icy day \nthat we had lost, while flying in northern Minnesota, a wonderful \ncompanion and colleague and, along with him, his life's companion, and \npart of that family--his daughter.\n\n  This freshman Senator had observed this Senator from Minnesota who \nhad such energy and, along with it, such happiness. I can still see \nPaul Wellstone thrusting in the air those short, little jabs, while at \nthe same time having that wry smile on his face, as he would teach us \nthe way we should be as Senators--advocating for those who could not \nadvocate for themselves, for those who could not hire with unlimited \nresources. He was there to stand and represent those folks.\n  I went to Minnesota in August to do what I could for Paul Wellstone \nin a race that, interestingly, as November 5 approached--and Paul was \nso concerned about what was going to be the effect of his vote on the \nIraq resolution, the fact he voted his conscience, the fact he stood up \nas the little giant against what was otherwise considered the tide. The \nfact he did that resonated among his constituents in Minnesota. We saw \nthe result of that in the polls, for Paul had jumped up from an even \nrace. He was up five, six, seven points before that fateful day his \nlife was taken from us.\n  I think back to that time in August I had gone out there to campaign \nfor Paul. It was a time of mourning in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area \nbecause a lady police officer had just had her life snuffed out in an \nunusual kind of murder, where it was unsuspected. I went with Paul and \nSheila that night to several events, including back to the source of \nthat crime, at a project where so many of the community leaders had \nturned out. I watched Paul as he interacted with those grieving \nconstituents, as they all came together in a resolve to heal the wounds \nin that community and bring the races together, instead of dividing \nthem, as so often might have been the case in a very unfortunate \ncircumstance where a police officer had lost her life.\n  I went to what was called the ``national night out''--a remembrance \nof what communities can do in coming together.\n  I went to two or three such events on that evening I visited with \nPaul and Sheila. I watched the interaction of him with Minnesotans. I \nsaw that it was the same Paul Wellstone that I saw interacting with \nSenators in this Chamber, in our caucuses, in our luncheon meetings, in \nthe cloakroom, and in the committee meetings. It was the same friendly, \nhighly intelligent man, always offering that smile, getting from place \nto place with that limp in his gait as a result of an old wrestling \ninjury. And he was so attractive. He was attractive to us as a friend \nand a colleague. He was attractive to the folks of Minnesota as their \nSenator.\n  I went to their home, a modest, very comfortable, very appropriately \nappointed duplex townhouse, close in so he could be where his \nconstituents were. It was easy access for him, even though with that \nlimp; it had a set of stairs, at least two, if not three stories. It \nwas so comfortable as a retreat for him, made so by his lifelong \ncompanion Sheila, who was at his side throughout that campaign and who \nwas at his side throughout his professional career, including his \ncareer in the Senate.\n  Then when I was in Minnesota, I talked to his kids. This is not his \nimmediate family kids. This was the extension of Paul Wellstone, the \nprofessor, the extension of Paul Wellstone, the Senator, who had \nlegions of young people, some in their middle years, who went door to \ndoor telling why those Minnesotans should vote and continue him in the \nSenate.\n  I saw their conviction as I talked to them basically to share a \nnumber of stories I had as a Congressman going door to door. A lot of \nthose experiences we shared were quite humorous, some of the unexpected \nexperiences when one goes knocking on doors. I explained to them, with \na bit of overstatement, that western civilization depended on what they \nwere doing, going door to door. We all had a good laugh about that.\n  They were committed. They were committed to Paul Wellstone. They were \ncommitted for the kind of person he represented, and they were doing \nthe job and they were very effective. Their number had multiplied many \ntimes over so that as it came to that fateful day, there were legions \nof some 4,000 of those young people who were canvassing Minnesota.\n  That says a lot about the kind of person Paul Wellstone was and how \nhis memory will live; that young people believed enough in him that \nthey would spend all day in a thankless job of going door to door.\n  I remember so well the Paul Wellstone we loved around here. He\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nwas not afraid to take on any foe. He was not afraid to take on any \nsubject where he felt he could offer something of substance to the \ndiscussion, and as far as this Senator is concerned, it often made the \ndifference because it was done with dignity, it was done with passion, \nit was done with energy, and his orations were done with great \nconviction.\n  That is a great example. That is a great role model for all of us. We \nwill miss him deeply.\n  I remember when I came to the Minnesota airport for that memorial \nservice. Someone met me at the gate and escorted me to the place where \nwe were all to huddle up and then board the buses. As I walked in to \nthat waiting room, what stared me in the face was a simple poster that \nsaid: Wellstone for Senate. I remember almost having my breath taken \naway as I realized that he was not going to be with us in body anymore. \nBut he certainly will continue with us in spirit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate is greatly diminished with the \npassing of Senator Paul Wellstone. As we see the bouquet of flowers on \nhis desk, we can see Paul in action, speaking out, speaking up \nindefatigable on the issues of concern to him.\n  He undertook a very difficult campaign back in 1990 against the odds, \nagainst a popular incumbent Senator. He was able to mobilize students, \nactivists, people who believed in what he believed in because he was \nalways a man with a cause. All the time he had a point. He did not mind \nbeing a dissenter.\n  People who may be listening to this session of the Senate do not \nknow, but there is a little card at the desk on each side, Republicans \nand Democrats. When the Senators come in and vote, there is a check. It \nis not easy, when, say, there are 50 members of the party and 49 checks \nare on one side, to vote against the 49, to have your name stand out in \nmarked contrast as a dissenter, but Paul Wellstone did not mind that a \nbit.\n  I believe in the history of our country the dissenters are vitally \nimportant, sometimes more important than the majority. Oliver Wendell \nHolmes, a Supreme Court Justice, was a prime example. He did not mind \nspeaking out in dissent. And then he got another Supreme Court Justice, \nLouis Brandeis, to join him. So then instead of 1 to 8, it was 2 to 7. \nThe brainpower of the 2 was characteristically better than the 7. For \nthat matter, the brainpower of that one, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, \nwas greater than the 8 of many occasions.\n  Plessy v. Ferguson was a decision establishing the principle of \nseparate but equal, having segregation in America, in a decision \nshortly before the turn of the 20th century, I believe in 1896. John \nMarshall Harlan was the one dissenter. That dissent became a clarion \ncall for Brown v. Board of Education. Similarly, I think the dissents \nthat Senator Wellstone registered have the potential to become a \nmajority point of view.\n  It was said earlier today, and I think with real meaning, that the \nlegislation to establish parity for mental illness with physical \nillness would be an appropriate tribute for Senator Paul Wellstone. \nThat legislation came within a hair's breadth of being passed in the \nspring of 2001 on an appropriations bill.\n  Technically, we are not supposed to legislate on an appropriations \nbill, but that rule is honored and then breached very often, maybe not \nmore often than it is observed but it is breached very frequently.\n  We had passed it through the Labor, Health, Human Services and \nEducation Subcommittee which I had chaired. It was a health bill. \nSenator Domenici was the principal champion on the Republican side, and \nSenator Wellstone was the principal champion on the Democratic side. I \nwas long a cosponsor of the matter. In chairing the conference, we \npushed very hard. It came within one vote on the House side--we had the \nSenate--of getting that legislation passed.\n  It ought to be passed as a tribute to Senator Wellstone. It also \nought to be passed for the benefit of the people who suffer from mental \nillness, which is every bit as debilitating as a physical illness.\n  On October 25, I was campaigning, as I think most people were. I had \njust come from a political rally in Reading, PA, where Vice President \nCheney had spoken for Congressman Gekas who was running in a hotly \ncontested election against Congressman Tim Holden, two incumbents \npitted against one another. I turned on the radio at about 1:30 eastern \ntime and was shocked to hear the news that Senator Wellstone's plane \nhad gone down. It brought memories of the plane that went down on April \n3, 1991, with Senator John Heinz, a vibrant, young Senator who had \ngreat potential, as did Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Flying small planes is an occupational hazard and everybody in this \nChamber, all 100 of us, as well as the 435 Members in the other \nChamber, and many other legislators and governmental officials, climb \ninto small airplanes every other day. We all hold our breath as to \nwhether we will be successful on the flight. Regrettably, we fly in bad \nweather, which sometimes we should not do but there is always a big \ncrowd waiting and always some reason to finish.\n  It was a great tragedy. Paul's wife Sheila was with him in the plane. \nOne seldom saw Paul in the Halls of Congress without Sheila. She was \nnot on the floor of the Senate, but she was with him constantly, \nholding hands, a very devoted couple. Their daughter Marcia was with \nthem, also devoted in the campaign, a brilliant young woman at the age \nof 33.\n  Senator Wellstone will be sorely missed in the Senate. There are many \nPaul Wellstone stories. I will mention one. I was managing the \nappropriations bill for Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. \nSenator Wellstone was in the Chamber bright and early. We started at \n9:30. He had an amendment. Sometimes it is hard to get amendments up \nonto the floor. His amendment provided that no Member of Congress \nshould have a health insurance policy at Government expense that was \nsuperior to what every other American had available to him or her.\n  When that amendment was brought up, it was through the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, who was smiling broadly. It was a very \nextraordinary amendment to make. It is pretty hard to make an amendment \nlike that stick because it would have made President Clinton's national \nhealth insurance policy look entrepreneurial to the nth degree. It did \nnot pass, even though the Democrats controlled the House and the \nSenate. Senator Mitchell, the majority leader in 1993, was a major \nproponent of health care, but the Clinton plan with its bureaucracy \nwent down to defeat. To have a requirement that no Member of Congress \ncould have a health plan that was superior in any way to what the \nGovernment provided for every citizen was really an extraordinary idea, \nto characterize it very mildly.\n  I did not have to debate Senator Wellstone for very long before there \nwas an avalanche of Senators who came to the Chamber. He really struck \na nerve, and he struck a nerve because many people think that Senators \nand Members of the House have health insurance which is paid for by the \nGovernment, which is not true. We pay for the health service which we \nhave, but we also have additional health service policies, Blue Cross \nand Blue Shield. To have legislation limiting what a Member could have \nto that which every other citizen would have at Government expense \nwould be a great inducement to pass a widespread health insurance \nbenefit, and perhaps we ought to do that. That was Senator Wellstone's \nidea. He debated it with fervor and intensity. It was an extraordinary \ndebate. I do not think he got too many votes for his plan, but that did \nnot diminish it in any way. That is the great quality of a dissenter. \nThis Chamber will not be the same without Senator Wellstone.\n  In the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my comments on homeland security be given as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking all of our \ncolleagues who have already spoken here on the Senate floor this \nafternoon in tribute to our dear friend, Paul Wellstone. I join in the \nsentiments and would like to extend my sympathy and my prayers to the \nentire Wellstone family and the families and friends of the crew and \nstaff members who also lost their loved ones just a few short weeks \nago.\n  Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, and their daughter Marcia, left \nquite a legacy. These are family who were working so closely together \nto help Paul in his reelection bid. So as we pay tribute to Paul today \nwe must also, I believe, remember the dedication and the love of his \nwife and his daughter--his entire family. Each one of us understands \nour elections are many times a family effort. We see our spouses, we \nsee our daughters and sons go out and campaign and spend time with us \nand spend time in other parts of our States. So I think we all can \nrelate to this. In a sense, it makes this tragedy even harder for all \nof us to bear, to think this was not just a loss of Paul, but also of \nhis wife and his daughter.\n  The great English poet Alfred Tennyson wrote of a dear friend who \ndied suddenly:\n\n       God's finger touched him, and he slept.\n\n  Recently God's hand touched our friend Paul Wellstone. Now he sleeps \nand now we mourn. The Senate will really never be the same without Paul \nWellstone. Not only did we lose a colleague, but we also lost a friend, \na good man, an ethical man, a leader, a true champion--a champion of \nthe causes and the issues he believed in so passionately.\n  As many of my colleagues have expressed already, Paul had a kind of \ndrive and passion and spirit that was really unequaled in this body. \nBut we will also miss his kindness, his resolve, and his unbelievable \nenergy--energy he brought to every single task he undertook. Whatever \nit was, Paul did it with sincerity and he did it with great passion. \nPaul got things done. He was effective. That effectiveness came because \nof his energy, because of his drive, because of his determination, and \nit came because he understood what he believed in. He understood what \nhe cared about. He understood what was important.\n  It also came about because he could get along with people from both \nsides of the aisle. He really transcended politics in that respect. He \nknew people. He understood them. It was evident he cared about them. \nYou never had any doubt when Paul Wellstone asked you how you were \ndoing, how you were feeling, how your wife was, that he actually meant \nit. He actually cared.\n  Arthur Ashe, the famous athlete, who also died too young, once said: \n``True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge \nto surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at \nwhatever cost.''\n  That was Paul Wellstone. That was his mission. No cost was too great \nin his eyes when it came to protecting the lives of those in this \nsociety who could not protect themselves--as he said, ``the little \npeople'', the poor people, the people who needed someone to help them. \nHe worked so hard and so tirelessly and with such commitment to protect \nchildren, the elderly, the mentally ill. I had the privilege of working \nclosely with Paul on a number of the legislative initiatives he cared \nso much about--the kind of initiatives that were intended to protect \nand improve peoples' lives, like job training--the bill he and I spent \nan awful lot of time working on--and mental health courts bills.\n  Paul also cared deeply about the future of America's children. He \nwanted to ensure that every single child in this country received a \nquality education.\n  He was instrumental in making sure that our transition to teaching \ninitiative was included in last year's education reform law. And, in \nfact, at the time of Paul's death, he and I were getting ready to \nintroduce a bill to expand the childcare loan forgiveness program to \ninclude preschool teachers. I intend to go forward and introduce that \nbill tomorrow. I know that is what Paul would have wanted. And, in his \nmemory, I would like to rename that bill ``The Paul Wellstone Early \nEducator Loan Forgiveness Program.'' This legislation is just one of so \nmany examples of what Paul stood for and cared so passionately about.\n  It wasn't too long ago that this Senate lost another friend and \ncolleague. That man was a dear friend of mine. That man was Senator \nPaul Coverdell. I was recently looking back at the Congressional Record \nat some of those firery and empassioned speeches that Paul Wellstone \nused to give on this Senate floor, and I came across a speech he gave \nin tribute to Senator Coverdell following his death.\n  I was really struck by his remarks, because what he said in those few \nwords about Senator Coverdell really capture today what we in this \nSenate think about Paul Wellstone.\n  I would like to take just a moment to read to my colleagues what Paul \nWellstone said on this floor on July 19, 2000:\n\n       Mr. President, I want to speak about my colleague, Senator \n     Coverdell. I know other Senators have. I absolutely have \n     nothing rehearsed. There are many Senators who will speak \n     about Senator Coverdell probably in a more profound and \n     moving way than I can.\n       There is one moment I want to remember about Senator \n     Coverdell because this small story tells a large story. We \n     had had a major debate about the Colombia aid package. \n     Senator Coverdell and I were in a debate. We did not agree. \n     It was a pretty good debate back and forth. I know from time \n     to time during the debate I would reach over and touch his \n     hand and say something to the effect: I just cannot believe \n     you said this; this is wrong--something like that.\n       At the end of the debate, I said, because I believed it and \n     believe it: Senator Coverdell is a really good Senator.\n       He smiled and touched my hand and said: Senator Wellstone \n     is a really good Senator.\n       I do not know if the latter part is true, but the point is \n     that is the way he was. That is the kind of Senator he was.\n\n  That is also the kind of Senator Paul Wellstone was.\n  Paul Wellstone in that tribute went on to say this about our friend, \nSenator Coverdell:\n\n       We talk about civility. He was just a beautiful person. I \n     really enjoyed him. We need a lot of Senators like Senator \n     Coverdell: Paul, you are wrong on the issues, but you are a \n     really good person.\n       The Senate has lost a wonderful person and a wonderful \n     Senator, and the United States of America has lost a \n     wonderful person and a wonderful Senator.\n\n  To Paul Wellstone today, I say that you, too, were a wonderful \nperson. You were a wonderful Senator.\n  Today on this floor, we honor what Paul Wellstone stood for, what he \nbelieved in, and what he accomplished here in this Senate. As a public \nservant, Paul touched the lives of his family, his friends and \ncolleagues in the Senate, his constituents in his home State of \nMinnesota, and the lives of millions of people throughout the United \nStates.\n  I will not forget Paul Wellstone--none of us will. He is deeply \nmissed and will always be remembered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as we have reconvened today, there is a \nvoid in this Chamber. The untimely passing of our friend and colleague, \nPaul Wellstone, brings a sadness to the entire Senate family.\n  We are also touched by the loss of Paul's wife Sheila, his daughter \nMarcia, members of his campaign staff: Will McLaughlin, Tom Lapic, and \nMary McEvoy, and the two pilots: Captains Richard Conry and Michael \nGuess.\n  When I heard Senator Wellstone's plane had gone down in Minnesota, it \nwas difficult for me to convey my thoughts. I thought of the countless \nhours I have spent, as a Senator now for 34 years, in small planes, \nflying around my State on campaigns and on official business.\n  I recalled the day in December of 1978 when the plane carrying my \nwife Ann and myself and five friends, coming from Juneau to Anchorage, \ncrashed at\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\nthe Anchorage Airport. The time that followed was a difficult one for \nmy family. The death of a spouse, a colleague, a loved one, or a friend \nis never easy, but to lose that person in an accident, particularly one \nyou survive, is worse because you will always know you never said \ngoodbye.\n  It was an ironic twist when I discovered Paul Wellstone's plane \ncrashed in the same city, Eveleth, MN, where Alaska Congressman Nick \nBegich was born. As the Senate knows, Representative Begich and the \nHouse majority leader, Hale Boggs, were killed when the airplane in \nwhich they were flying was lost over Alaska in 1972.\n  It is safe to say--and I think this is no surprise to anyone--that \nPaul Wellstone and I did not see eye to eye on much, but I respected \nPaul for fighting for what he believed and for his personal toughness \nthat never let physical problems slow him down.\n  We spent much time together on the subway going back and forth and \nbecame great friends. As a matter of fact, Paul and his wife came over \nto our home. Catherine and I were pleased to have dinner with him and \nSheila on a personal basis.\n  I admired Paul's commitment to his causes, particularly to his \ndedication to mental and physical health parity. As a young boy, I \nhelped raise a cousin who was challenged by mental retardation, and I \nknow the difficulties faced by those in that community. Senator \nWellstone's compassion and determination has made a difference in many \nfamilies across our Nation, many lives of people such as my cousin.\n  Likewise, Senator Wellstone's wife Sheila was a great advocate. Her \nwork on behalf of domestic abuse victims helped many women and children \nbegin life anew, with the hope and encouragement that came from \nSheila's work.\n  Catherine and I cannot put into words the sympathy and sorrow we feel \nfor Paul's family for the loss of their parents, their siblings, and \ntheir grandparents.\n  Mr. President, grief is a process that helps heal the heart. We will \nalways miss Paul, but we honor his memory by keeping after our \nbusiness, as he did--testing our ideas on the campaign trail and here \non the Senate floor. My friend, Paul Wellstone, would want it that way.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President,\n\n     Sunset and evening star,\n     And one clear call for me!\n     And may there be no moaning of the bar,\n     When I put out to sea,\n     But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\n     Too full for sound and foam,\n     When that which drew from out the boundless deep\n     Turns again home.\n\n     Twilight and evening bell,\n     And after that the dark!\n     And may there be no sadness of farewell,\n     When I embark;\n     For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place\n     The flood may bear me far,\n     I hope to see my Pilot face to face\n     When I have crost the bar.\n\n  Mr. President, one of our number has gone from our midst.\n  I know that by now he has seen his Pilot face to face because Paul \nWellstone has crossed the bar. He was not tall; yet mere feet and \ninches are no measure of a human heart. He could not be cool or aloof, \nfor he knew that it is passion and commitment that drive human \nprogress. He was not without infirmity, but the limitations of the \nflesh never hold down a robust and tenacious spirit.\n  Paul Wellstone fairly burned with exuberance for life and for the \ncauses that he cared about. We all heard Paul Wellstone as he spoke \nabout those causes that he cared so much about. He always spoke with \npassion. A visit to his office is illustrative. Over the entrance to \nhis private office is a huge enlargement of a snapshot of his former, \nnow deceased, chief of staff, Mike Epstein. Most of us remember Mike \nEpstein, who used to be seen back here on the bench to my left as he \nsat listening to Paul and waiting with Paul. Paul Wellstone did not \nforget. He did not forget Mike Epstein.\n  Once inside Paul's office, over the doorway three large photos can be \nseen of the faces of battered women. Paul Wellstone often spoke of \nthose battered women in our population. He did not forget.\n  On the walls of his private chamber are photos of Hubert Humphrey, \nJohn Kennedy, and on his desk is a bust of Martin Luther King. Paul \nWellstone did not forget.\n  Paul was a man of causes. He was a teacher. He was a man who stayed \ntrue to the things in which he believed. I can almost see him back \nthere now beside the flowers that have so thoughtfully been placed on \nhis desk as a token of our remembrance of him. I often heard him use a \nmetaphor. He called it an old Jewish proverb. He would use it again and \nagain, in speech after speech. He would say, ``You can't dance at two \nweddings at the same time.'' Senator Don Nickles is on the floor, and \nhe remembers this and has indicated so by a smile. I never quite knew \nwhat Paul Wellstone meant when he said that you can't dance at two \nweddings at the same time. I never tried it, but I never was at two \nweddings at the same time.\n  When he said, ``You can't dance at two weddings at the same time,'' \nhe meant that one must not be false. That is the key. One must not be \nfalse. He meant that one cannot be all things to all people. He was \nthinking of the words of Shakespeare, who said: To thine own self be \ntrue. Thy can't now then be false to any man.\n  He meant that one cannot say one thing and then do another. And he \nmeant that one cannot say the same thing to two different people and \nmean two different things. It is a fundamental lesson and has special \napplication to those of us who toil in the ruined fields of what passes \nfor politics today. You cannot dance at two weddings at the same time.\n  Paul Wellstone died tragically, but he lived heroically. He ran \nuphill against the odds and enjoyed and gloried in the experience. He \nwas unique, he was priceless, and he was quite irreplaceable.\n  I shall miss him, and we all shall miss his courage.\n  I was most endeared to Paul Wellstone in the last days of his life. \nOne day as we stood in the room together--we Democrats--and discussed \nthe resolution concerning the Iraq war--which may come and which in my \npresent thinking is likely to come--we stood over in the corner room \nthere and the majority leader was there. My Democratic colleagues--most \nof them--were there; Paul Wellstone was there. We discussed the Iraq \nresolution. I remember Paul Wellstone as he stood and said to us, his \nDemocratic colleagues:\n\n       You all do what you must, but I am going to vote against \n     the resolution. But don't worry about me. I will explain it \n     to my people. I think I am doing the right thing, and I \n     believe my people will feel also that it is right. But if \n     they don't, they will vote. However that vote comes, whatever \n     that decision is, I will live with it.\n\n  I thought that took a great deal of courage. Here was a Senator who \nwas running for reelection and he had already reached a decision in his \nmind that he was going to take a stand, and that was going to be a \nprincipled stand. His future in politics could go one way or another; \nbut regardless Paul Wellstone was going to take that position. He was \ngoing to go to the people with it. He was willing to debate it with the \npeople, and he felt that in the final analysis the people would uphold \nhim in the position he had taken.\n  There were not any ifs, ands, or buts. That was a position he took \nright over in that room, in the corner, near the elevator on this \nfloor. That, more than anything I saw in Paul Wellstone's life when he \nwas here in our midst for 12 years, that, more than anything else, \nimpressed me. I thought: Oh, if all Senators were like that. If all \npublic officials were like that, who would take a principled stand, \nstate the reasons for that stand to the electorate, and let them make \ntheir choice. Of course, he wanted to come back to the Senate, but he \nknew very well that particular stand, in the climate in which we find \nourselves, might mean he would not be reelected. And in the minds of a \nlot of people, the likelihood would be perhaps he would not be \nreelected. He took that stand. That told\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\nme something about that man I had never seen before in him.\n  That is the kind of courage that is found in men and women who are \nnot only willing but are proud to stand up for their convictions and \nwin or lose. They are determined to do it that way because they feel \nthat is for the best interest of their country. That is the way Paul \nWellstone felt. But that, more than anything else, watching him and \nlistening to him on that occasion and knowing he was heading out of \nhere in a very close election, which at that point he probably was a \nlittle behind--and I think he was. But he went. He made that decision. \nHe voted that way. He went to the people and, from what I can \nunderstand, he was winning. His points were going up. He was going up. \nSo the people, even though some of them--many of them--may not have \nagreed with Paul, admired a man of conviction. That is the kind of man \nthey wanted in this body.\n  I will always remember Paul Wellstone for that demonstration of \nconviction, that demonstration of integrity, that demonstration of \ncourage, that demonstration of character. So his spirit, as long as I \nam here, will always permeate this Chamber.\n  I never was close to Paul Wellstone. I cannot say I am close to a \ngreat many Senators here. That is not their fault. We are all busy \npeople. But that drew me close to Paul Wellstone.\n  We owe a great debt to the people of his beloved Minnesota and his \nwonderful family for sending him to serve with us for a time. I fully \nbelieve if Paul Wellstone had lived, he would have won that race. That \nSenator we would have had back.\n  I went to that memorial service. I went to Minnesota. I went there \nwhen Hubert Humphrey died, and I went to the memorial service for Paul \nWellstone. I was at that dreg gathering. I was struck by the size of \nthat tremendous gathering of people singing songs, speaking. I wondered \nabout this man, what kind of hold he must have had on the hearts of the \npeople of Minnesota to draw a huge audience like that in a memorial \nservice.\n  I also believe in my heart that the memorial service veered off on a \npath that probably was not intended, and I felt badly about some of the \nthings that happened there--about the treatment, not only impolitic, \nbut the discourteous treatment that was accorded to the minority \nleader, Mr. Lott. I did not know about the treatment by which he had \nbeen embarrassed. I did not know about that until after it was over. \nBut I felt as time went on that I was in a strange meeting, and I \nbelieve that but for the veering off course by that meeting Walter \nMondale would have been elected. In any event, that is in the past and \ncannot be revisited.\n  We will all miss Paul Wellstone. I do not think that he would have \nwanted things to happen as they did in that particular meeting, but \nthat being said, I think Paul Wellstone's spirit will live on.\n  I regret the strange twist of fate that took his wife and his \ndaughter and the members of his staff to their untimely ends. But as to \nPaul, we owe him a great debt. I think I can best say his spirit will \nlive on by repeating the words of Thomas Moore:\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy,\n     That come in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n\n     Long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is a sad occasion that we see flowers \non the desk of Paul Wellstone memorializing his service to this country \nand to the Senate.\n  Paul Wellstone served very ably in the Senate for 12 years. I had the \npleasure of working with him, and I had the pleasure of opposing him on \nmany occasions. Many times, I would always say in the heat of the \nbattle that Paul Wellstone had intensity, he had passion, and he had \nconviction. As Senator Byrd mentioned, those are qualities and traits \nthat are very much needed in the Senate.\n  October 25, when Paul Wellstone was killed along with his wife Sheila \nand his daughter Marcia, in addition to three staff members and a \ncouple of pilots, was a real tragedy to the Senate family. \nUnfortunately, we have lost a lot of Senators through airplane crashes. \nMany of us have been in planes under questionable circumstances. It is \na tragedy we hate to see. I remember receiving the phone call and the \nwords were ``oh, no,'' when it was confirmed.\n  As many of our colleagues, I went to Minnesota for the memorial \nservice on October 29 to express our condolences and sympathy on the \nloss of a colleague. We wanted to show support to his family, friends \nand constituents and say that, yes, he was a valuable Member of the \nSenate and we hated to lose him. To lose him in such a tragic and \nunexpected way is really a loss for the entire country.\n  I remember very well when Senator Wellstone made one of his last \nspeeches. It was a tribute to Senator Helms. Philosophically, they were \nprobably as opposed as they could be, but they were always gentlemen \nand they always conducted themselves as Senators. Like Senator Helms, \nevery time we had a debate with Senator Wellstone that we disagreed on \nwe always would shake hands, win or lose, and we did both. We won some \nbattles, we lost some battles, but we were always friends and we were \nall colleagues.\n  I remember Paul Wellstone being inducted to the National Wrestling \nHall of Fame in Stillwater, OK--an outstanding American and a great \ntribute. This happened in the year 2000, but he was in the class of \n2001, a class that is very unique.\n  Our colleague, Senator John Chafee, also deceased, was inducted into \nthe National Wrestling Hall of Fame, as well as the current Speaker of \nthe House, Dennis Hastert. They were a very special class of \ncompetitors who competed not only on the wrestling mat but also on the \nfloor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  Paul Wellstone earned our respect and our gratitude. We miss him, and \nwe wish to communicate to his family, his friends, his associates, and \nhis staff members, that we respected Paul Wellstone. We appreciate his \nservice to this country, to his State, and to the Senate. Paul \nWellstone will be missed by all of us who had the pleasure of calling \nhim our colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in taking \nthese few moments to pay tribute to an extraordinary man and a great \nSenator. It is hard to come back to the Senate floor this afternoon and \nnot be overcome by a sense of loss because this desk behind me, with \nthe flowers, will never again serve as the launching pad for one of \nPaul Wellstone's memorable and impassioned speeches.\n  Every American who shared Paul's determination to make our country \nall that it should be, all that it can be, all that Paul thought it \nmust be, felt that same sense of loss. The Americans who only knew Paul \nWellstone through tuning into C-SPAN or seeing the evening news, \nwatching that energy flow, those arms flail about, that pacing up and \ndown, may not have known the man but they too saw, as we his colleagues \nsaw, that deep abiding love of our country. That is what motivated Paul \nWellstone. He would come on to this floor, sometimes bursting through \nthose doors, having to speak out, making it clear that there was some \ninjustice that had to be righted, some problem that had to be solved, \nin order for us all to be the best we could be.\n  That wrestling spirit that never let go really was with him in every \nencounter. He was a bear hugger. He was a caring, loving man, as well \nas a great advocate.\n  His determination to improve our Nation, our education system, our \nhealth care system, our employment system, to strengthen civil and \nhuman rights and provide opportunities to those who live on the \noutskirts of American life, was unparalleled. Every one of us who knew \nhim, and the millions who did not, were heartbroken by his untimely \ndeath.\n  I had someone say to me that the voice for the voiceless has been \nsilenced. That is not only a tribute to\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nPaul but it can also be heard as a rebuke to us. Was there only one \namong us who spoke for the voiceless, who hurt for those who were \nhurting, who carried the pain of injustice and exclusion under which so \nmany suffered? One hopes that is not the case, but the only way to \nprove it is not is to ensure that our voices are heard loudly and \nclearly.\n  This floor will seem empty without his words of conviction unless we \nfill it with our own. The ideals he represented and his steadfast \nbelief that we, the people, through our government, acting together, \ncan be a positive force, literally to change the future for those who \nmight otherwise be left in despair, that commitment motivated every \naspect of his daily life.\n  Our Senate family and the people of Minnesota not only lost Senator \nPaul Wellstone, but we lost a great advocate in Sheila Wellstone and we \nlost a great teacher in Marcia Wellstone. His family shared his passion \nand his drive for justice. His staff were with him every step of the \nway and some tragically even gave their lives in service. Our thoughts \nand prayers are certainly with all those, along with the Wellstone \nfamily, who lost family members, friends, and colleagues.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I had the great pleasure of working with \nboth Paul and Sheila Wellstone. I admired Sheila greatly. Just as her \nhusband, she was made of steel. That little package of energy that \npropelled her down these corridors and throughout the State of \nMinnesota looking for ways to help and to shed the spotlight she could \nbring into the darkest corners of human misery set her apart. She \nespecially became a champion of those women and children who were \nvictims of domestic violence. The stories she heard from women all over \nMinnesota and America did not stay her property; she told them to \nanyone. She would come to the White House and button hole me or the \nPresident. She would go anywhere to see anyone to make sure that \nsomeone whose small cry for help that she heard in St. Paul or Margie \nwould be heard in Washington as well. She believed that the idea of \nviolence-free families should be a reality in every home in our Nation.\n\n  She and Paul, together, believed the diseases, the illnesses of the \nmind, should no longer be relegated to some back room where they would \nbe brushed aside, ignored because of the stigma, the embarrassment \nattached to them historically. She encouraged Paul to join forces with \nSenator Domenici to transform each of their families' experiences into \na national campaign to improve the lives of the mentally ill.\n  Sheila and Paul were also instrumental in bringing to international \nawareness the horrific problem of trafficking in human beings, the \nmodern form of slavery by which young women, young girls, are literally \nsold into bondage, into the sex trade, into domestic servitude. Sheila \nand Paul Wellstone were absolutely committed that this practice of \ndegradation would end.\n  When each of us heard the news that the plane carrying Paul and \nSheila and Marcia went down, time seemed to stop. Many did not want to \nbelieve it. We kept asking our staff and others how it could be true. \nHow could this have happened? Horrible events, tragedies of this \nmagnitude, have a way of stopping time. But then we have to return. The \nclocks have to start moving again. We have to continue our journey into \nthe future. But if we remember what that moment in time felt like when \nwe realized our friend, our colleague, a great Senator, would no longer \njoin us for our debates, then perhaps that tragedy can change the tone \nand landscape of our politics and our debates. Perhaps Paul's example \nin life, his legacy in death, will compel all to look inward, to ask \nourselves what are we doing today with the same energy, the same good \nhumor, the same fighting spirit that Paul Wellstone embodied to make \nlife a little better for the people we represent, to give voice to the \nvoiceless.\n  Over the past weeks I have thought a lot about Paul Wellstone. I \nremember so many incidents and so many of his triumphs. He was there \nday in and day out. No issue was too small that it did not have his \ncommitment behind it if he thought it would make a difference in \nsomeone's life. The Senate passed expanding insurance coverage for the \nmentally ill. I hope Senator Domenici's heartfelt plea and his long-\ntime commitment will help finally to pass his and Paul's dream into \nlaw.\n  We increased access to child care for the working poor because Paul \nWellstone knew what it meant to worry about your children while at work \nbecause you did not know the conditions they would be in, whether they \nwould receive the quality of care they should.\n  One of my favorite Paul Wellstone moments was that Paul and I were at \na hearing he was chairing of the Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining. We had been receiving reports about a sharp increase in the \nnumbers of unreported deaths and injuries among immigrant workers--many \nof them illegal, who found their way to our country and were put to \nwork, despite the laws against it, for the cheap labor they provided--\nwho were not given the protection or the support or the respect they \nshould have for the dangerous jobs they were performing.\n  One of my State's newspapers, NewsDay, ran a powerful investigative \nreport about the conditions in which immigrant workers labored in New \nYork. Paul read it and contacted me right away. He wanted us to work \ntogether to find out what we could do to stop people from dying, \nliterally dying, in New York and around America.\n  Many who go to hearings around here know that not many people, except \nthe paid lobbyists for the various industries affected, show up for the \ncommittee hearings. The lobbyists fill the chairs. They take the notes. \nThey rush out to make the cell phone calls to report to their superiors \nand employers what is going on. But unfortunately, except on rare \noccasions, other people do not come.\n  On that day, to our surprise, hundreds of workers flooded the halls \nof the Dirksen Building trying to get into our hearing, trying to tell \ntheir stories. Unfortunately, we had no idea this would draw such a \ncrowd. The room the hearing was being held in was not big enough to \naccommodate everyone waiting.\n  Paul and I conferred, and Paul said: I can't believe it. There are \nall these people outside. Some of them came from miles away. You can \nsee his arms, as you hear those words, going back and forth. What are \nwe going to do?\n  Before I could answer, he got up, and in that bow-legged wrestler's \nstance and walk he had, he walked down from the platform, through the \ncrowd, threw open the doors, told the Capitol Police that everyone was \ncoming in and that there would be room. They could sit on the floor, \nthey could sit in the Senators' chairs because he and I were the only \nSenators there. He would not keep the very people we were having the \nhearing about out of the hearing room.\n  That was Paul. He was a people's Senator. Everyone was welcome. Every \ndoor was open. It was an unusual hearing, but it was a memorable one. \nAfterwards, he greeted each and every person who was there.\n  It was this passion that got him up and fighting every day, even when \nhe was in such pain, as some of us can remember, seeing him in pain on \nthis floor, remembering how last year the pain was so intense he \nliterally dropped to the floor of the Senate. He later learned that he \nwas not just contending with the aches and pains of a Hall of Fame \nwrestling career but that he had multiple sclerosis. That did not stop \nhim either.\n  For any of us who inquired how he was doing, he brushed it off. He \nwas not interested in any way or concerned about his own health. He \nwanted to talk to you about what we were going to do about unemployment \ninsurance, what we were going to do about education, how we could turn \nour backs on all these children who would not get the resources they \nneeded.\n  During the debate on the education bill, Paul was the only member of \nour Education Committee to vote against it. We knew why. He warned that \nfocusing our education system solely on improvements in standardized \ntests without a major increase in Federal funding was wrong. I agreed \nwith that. I said so at the time in our committee. I will vote for this \nbill, but only if we have the funding.\n  Here we are, a year later. We got the funding for 1 year and then the \nadministration came in and no more funding.\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nPaul was right, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nknows. Trust, but verify, when it comes to such promises.\n\n  Senator Wellstone always stood by his beliefs. His last big fight, as \nSenator Byrd has so eloquently reminded us, was over two big issues: \nCertainly Iraq, what should be done, what will be done, what our \nobligations as Senators are to hold this administration accountable; \nand, here at home, the fight for unemployment benefits to be extended. \nFor the life of me and for Paul Wellstone, with whom I spoke about this \nat length time and time again, it made no sense. How could we turn our \nbacks on people who were out of work through no fault of their own, who \nneeded a little bit of a helping hand? He would come to the floor, he \nwould make that case, and we wouldn't go anywhere with it. We couldn't \nget our colleagues to support extending unemployment insurance one more \ntime.\n  Along with what I hope will be a lasting legacy of mental health \nparity, I truly request our colleagues and the administration to extend \nunemployment insurance, Paul Wellstone's last domestic battle, for \npeople who will otherwise have nowhere to turn when those benefits are \ngone.\n  I want to say also a word about Senator Wellstone's staff, because he \ncertainly loved and respected his staff. As Senator Byrd has mentioned, \nhis staff was a loyal, hard-working group who often accompanied Senator \nWellstone to the floor and sat there watching him, getting energy from \nhis excitement and passion. I want to name some of the names of those \nmen and women who helped him do the work we honor today. Colin \nMcGinnis, his chief of staff, and Brian Ahlberg, his legislative \ndirector, are two extraordinary public servants. My staff has enjoyed \nthe privilege of working with them.\n  My staff and I have also had the opportunity to work with Marge \nBaker, who led Senator Wellstone's efforts on the Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Training, with Jill Morningstar, who was his legislative \nassistant on education and women's issues, with Rachel Gregg, who led \nhis efforts to assist the working poor, as well as Patti Unruh, Ellen \nGerrity, and Richard McKeon, who made up his team of health care \nadvisers.\n  I offer my condolences to each of his extraordinary staff members and \nI want them to know how much we appreciate the work they did for Paul.\n  On October 15, at the close of his last debate, here is what Senator \nWellstone said:\n\n       I don't represent the pharmaceutical companies, I don't \n     represent the big oil companies, I don't represent the big \n     health insurance industry, I don't represent the big \n     financial institutions. But you know what, I represent the \n     people of Minnesota.\n\n  That may be his most fitting tribute--the honor, the ability, the \nresults he brought to the way he represented the people of Minnesota. \nHe did it with passion and principle. We join in saluting his life and \nhis service and we challenge ourselves to remember the reasons why so \nmany are mourning him today. Each of us, try to live up to the standard \nPaul Wellstone set.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New York \nfor her gracious and most appropriate words with regard to the service \nof the Senator from Minnesota, who was such a special person.\n  I rise to add my words of respect and praise and thanksgiving for the \nlife and leadership of my friend and colleague and, in fact, political \nhero. Paul Wellstone was a good man who did his very best to do good \nthings--very simply, good things for others. With his wife Sheila, \ntheir lives were about service, service and advocacy for others. In \nfact--I think the Presiding Officer probably knows this--they may well \nhave been the most unselfish people I ever observed. The drive was not \nto power. It was not to popularity. It certainly was not to wealth. It \nwas to service--service to those without a voice. Paul Wellstone really \ndid believe all men and women are created equal and therefore should be \ntreated accordingly.\n  As a friend, Paul was always supportive and full of counsel for a \nfellow progressive--or should I say liberal. While our paths to the \nSenate could not have been more different, our paths in the Senate were \nmuch alike. He was a pathfinder for me and for many others because of \nhis personal passion and principle with which he was so secure--it was \ndeep in his soul. It gave him vision. His words and deeds were an \nexample for all who seek to lead. As he so often implored, our actions \ncannot be separate from our words. All men and women are created equal, \nand he believed our Nation must act, also, accordingly. He fought for \nthat every day on this floor.\n  We have heard about his principled fight for mental health parity. We \nhave heard about his fight to make sure education was something other \nthan high stakes testing, and to make sure welfare reform was about \nsomething other than reducing the numbers on rolls, but was really \nabout reducing poverty levels; on labor rights and defending the right \nto organize, defending the right of working men and women to have \naccess to the American promise on an equal basis with those who are \ngranted more; and on women's rights, which we have heard so much about, \nand domestic abuse, in which he carried the words and deeds of his wife \nso ably; on veterans' care and the homelessness problems of our Vietnam \nvets. On these and many other issues he really was a man who spoke for \nthose without a voice.\n  Paul's passion and vision will be deeply missed. For those honored to \nhave shared his life, it is now our responsibility to pursue his \nvision. His commitment to equality and justice must not be lost and, \nwith God's will, it will not.\n  To this challenge, earlier today I heard Senator Stabenow cite great \nwords from Frederick Douglass that bear repeating. When you think about \nPaul Wellstone you think about how he handled himself in this world. \nThose words are:\n\n       If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who \n     profess to prefer freedom and yet deprecate agitation want \n     crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without \n     thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful \n     roar of its many waters.\n\n  Paul Wellstone led his struggle for freedom with thunder and \nlightning--his struggle for progress. We will miss him. We will miss \nhis struggle. We must take it up.\n  All of us pray for his family and the families of the others lost on \nthat tragic day of the crash. Our hearts are saddened. And we, as \nSenator Clinton has so ably articulated, commend his loyal and \ndedicated staff, and those thousands of volunteers who made his voice \nmultiples of what it otherwise would be, through their activism and \norganization. We say thank you for all of them. Our love goes out. We \nrespect them for what they have done, and their service. We hope they \nwill not turn away from the effort and the fight. We thank them \nall. They mourn. We mourn. But we must not quit. We will not quit. Our \ndeeds must match his deeds in the days and years ahead.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to two dear \nfriends, Paul and Sheila Wellstone. The October 25 plane crash in \nnorthern Minnesota which took their lives was an incalculable tragedy. \nIt deprived Minnesota of a brilliant Senator. It deprived my wife \nBarbara and me of two very dear friends. It deprived the poor and \ndisadvantaged everywhere in this country of a most committed, eloquent, \nand passionate champion.\n  If there is one word that I heard perhaps more than any other in the \ntributes that have been paid to Paul Wellstone, it would be the word \n``passionate.''\n  Compounding the tragedy, the crash claimed the lives of Paul and \nSheila's daughter, Marcia; three members of his staff: Will McLaughlin, \nTom Lapic, and Mary McEvoy; and the plane's two pilots, Captains \nRichard Conroy and Michael Guess.\n  Our hearts go out to Paul's sons and grandchildren, and to all of the \nfamilies of those whose lives were lost. We think about what might have \nbeen. We\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nare reminded of just how ephemeral and precious life is.\n  It is said that an obituary tells you what a person did and a eulogy \ntells you who a person was. I would like to talk about who Paul was.\n  Paul Wellstone was the patron Senator of lost causes. By ``lost,'' I \ndon't mean wrong. In fact, most of his causes were right. But many of \nthem were at the moment unpopular.\n  Paul Wellstone devoted his energies to fighting for the \ndisenfranchised and demoralized, the lonely, and the isolated. He saw \nhis mission in the Senate and in life as comforting the afflicted and, \nwhen necessary, afflicting the comfortable. In social justice circles, \nit is called ``speaking truth to power.''\n  Paul knew what it is like to be the underdog. He literally wrestled \nhis way into the University of North Carolina on an athletic \nscholarship. He overcame learning disabilities to earn a Ph.D. from \nthat distinguished university. The civil rights movement inspired him \nto become active in politics. In 1990, he ran a seemingly quixotic \ncampaign against an incumbent Senator who outspent him by more than \nseven to one. And Paul won. And he won again in 1996.\n  I think Paul beat the odds because he gave hope to so many people who \nhave been left behind. Paul was a friendly and warm person who learned \nand remembered everybody's name because he genuinely cared about them.\n  More recently, Paul battled hip and back injuries and publicly \nannounced that he had multiple sclerosis. When he made that \nannouncement, he said--with characteristic wit and pluck--``I have a \nstrong mind--although there are some who might disagree with that--I \nhave a strong body, I have a strong heart, I have a strong soul.'' And \nthat he did.\n  Paul knew what it was like to be an underdog. So he devoted his life \nto fighting for the underdog. At Minnesota's Carleton College, where he \nwas a professor, he protested the college's investments in companies \ndoing business with pro-apartheid South Africa. He intervened on behalf \nof many farmers facing foreclosure. He joined the picket lines at a \nmeat-packing plant. And when Carleton College's custodians went on \nstrike, he taught his classes off-campus because he wasn't going to \ncross that picket line.\n  Paul brought his unabashed idealism to the Senate. He voted against \nthe gulf war in 1991. He voted against the welfare bill in 1996. He led \na lonely fight against the bankruptcy bill, saying that it would enrich \nbig credit card companies at the expense of ordinary people suffering \n``brutal economic circumstances.'' And the list goes on.\n\n  One of his last votes that he cast was for the more multilateral \napproach relative to our situation in Iraq. During that debate, he \nargued as follows: ``Acting now on our own might be a sign of our \npower. Acting sensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our \nallies with bipartisan congressional support, would be a sign of our \nstrength.''\n  Paul often found himself in small minorities. He was, however, able \nto move the Senate on occasion through sheer conviction. For instance, \nhe teamed with Senator Domenici to require health insurance companies \nto provide more equitable coverage and benefits to people suffering \nfrom mental illness. It was the right thing to do. It was the fair \nthing to do. And he prevailed.\n  Life deals everyone setbacks and defeats. And Paul had more than his \nshare, especially in the Senate. But he never became the least bit \ncynical as many people do when they suffer life's disappointments. He \nkept coming back cheerful and committed as ever. He was absolutely \nguileless. And I think that was the source of his popularity, which \nextended to people who vehemently disagreed with the policies that he \nadvocated. Everyone admired the fact that he spoke from the heart, and \nhe voted based on his sincere beliefs--not from political expediency. \nHe believed in the power of ideas and causes, and in the power of \ngovernment to help people. He was a formidable adversary. And he had \nthat unique gift of being able to disagree without being disagreeable.\n  T.S. Eliot wrote to a friend: ``We fight for lost causes because we \nknow that our defeat and dismay may be the preface to our successors' \nvictory, though that victory itself will be temporary; we fight rather \nto keep something alive than in the expectation that anything will \ntriumph.''\n  That wistful statement, to me, captures some of Paul Wellstone's \napproach to his duty. With indefatigable goodwill and cheer and \nsincerity, Paul always bounced back, always carried on, and always \nstood on principle--never on expediency. He wasn't afraid to be in the \nminority, even a minority of one.\n  A friend of Paul's, Bill Holm, wrote a touching tribute that appeared \nin the New York Times the day after Paul died. I am going to put that \ncolumn in the Record following my remarks, but I wish to quote from it \nbriefly to underscore some of what the column says.\n  Bill Holm wrote, ``Whatever Paul's height, he was one of the largest \nmen I ever met. He filled rooms when he entered them. Size in a public \nman is an interior, not an exterior, quality. . . . He thought himself \nan athlete . . . and I suspect he saw his whole political life in that \nmetaphor. He wrestled with the power of big money, military adventurism \nand penny-pinching against the poor. He meant to fight fair, but he \nmeant to win.''\n  The great suffragette Anna Howard Shaw remarked, ``it does not make \nso much difference perhaps as to the number of days we live as it does \nto the manner in which we live the days we do live.'' She could have \nbeen saying that about Paul Wellstone.\n  Paul fought the good fight--usually against long odds. I think, \nbecause he was a wrestler, he knew it was always possible to snatch \nvictory from the jaws of defeat. Sometimes you can be behind on points \nbut suddenly pin your opponent seconds before the match is over. So he \nnever gave up. He had an infectious optimism. That is why he was such \nan inspiration.\n\n  He certainly lived his life with gusto. He showed that gusto in the \nway he consumed my wife's stuffed cabbage. We still have some in the \nfreezer which we had preserved for the next dinner we were going to \nhave with the Wellstones.\n  Paul Wellstone may have stood 5 feet 5 inches tall, but he had the \nheart of a giant. As we mourn his passing, we celebrate his life. What \na gift he gave to us all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Bill Holm's column, appearing in the \nOctober 26, 2002, edition of the New York Times, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 26, 2002]\n\n                   A Liberal With a Wrestler's Stance\n\n                             (By Bill Holm)\n\n       Minneota, Minn.--Paul Wellstone was an unlikely politician \n     in a place like Minnesota--land of walleyes, cornfields and \n     phlegmatic Scandinavians. He was an urban Jew, son of \n     immigrants, a college professor at the fanciest of \n     Minnesota's private colleges. And, probably worst of all for \n     his non-talkative constituents, he was a passionate orator, a \n     skilled rouser of rabble over issues he loved and an \n     unapologetic populist liberal.\n       How did this man, who was killed yesterday in a plane crash \n     in northern Minnesota, ever manage a triumphantly successful \n     political career in which even many Republicans and \n     conservative Christians quietly scribbled the Wellstone X on \n     their ballots, hoping their neighbors wouldn't catch them \n     behaving like lefties?\n       When I gave readings of poetry and essays, I often shared a \n     podium with Senator Wellstone at various rural conventions \n     and political gatherings. It was a remarkable experience, and \n     I learned very well to proceed rather than follow him. He \n     worked a house as well as Hubert Humphrey ever did.\n       I remember a Farmers Union convention in St. Paul: Paul \n     Wellstone, a pugnacious 5-foot-5, stood at the dais between \n     the Farmers Union chairman and me, both 6-foot-5 \n     Scandinavians.\n       ``It's nice to join my Norwegian cousins here in St. \n     Paul,'' he said. He then proceeded in 20 minutes to bring the \n     audience cheering to its feet. If this had been a monarchy, \n     the farmers would have crowned him.\n       I was next, with a few small and sensitive rural poems. I \n     had a sinking feeling that a master had bested me.\n       Whatever Paul's height, he was one of the largest men I \n     ever met. He filled rooms when he entered them. Size in a \n     public man is an interior, not an exterior quality. Paul \n     charmed--and sometimes persuaded--even those hostile to his \n     unashamed liberal ideas by listening with great courtesy and \n     attention to unfriendly questions. He answered without \n     dissembling, without backing down from his own principles, \n     but with a civil regard for the dignity of the questioner.\n       And he had the politician's great gift: an amazing memory \n     for names. I saw him once\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\n     pluck a vote with this gift. He answered questions for 45 \n     minutes in a room full of ordinary citizens whom he'd never \n     seen before. He began hs last answer this way: ``Your \n     question reminds me of Mary's concern.'' Mary, in the back \n     row, was 45 minutes ago. Mary, likely a rock-ribbed \n     Republican, blushed a little and smiled. One more vote.\n       Even those who continued to disagree with Paul did not \n     question the sincerity of his idealism. He was sometimes \n     attacked for naivete (as in his brave vote against \n     authorizing the president to go to war with Iraq), but never \n     for dishonesty. He voted, as he spoke, from the heart.\n       It's often forgotten that Paul, nearing 60 with a bad back \n     and a respectable batch of grandchildren whom he treasured, \n     began his rise in the world with a college wrestling \n     scholarship. His working-class parents had no money for \n     school, so wrestling earned him a doctorate.\n       He preserved a wrestler's sensibility in both his academic \n     and political life. In 1998 I met Paul at a reception at the \n     Governor's Mansion just before Jesse Ventura, a professional \n     wrestler by trade, first occupied that house. How curious, I \n     told Paul, that the two most interesting politicians in \n     Minnesota at the moment should both be wrestlers. He replied \n     with a wry smile: ``But I'm a real one.''\n       He thought himself an athlete, not an entertainer, and I \n     suspect he saw his whole political life in that metaphor. He \n     wrestled with the power of big money, military adventurism \n     and penny-pinching against the poor. He meant to fight fair, \n     but he meant to win.\n       Not only Minnesota, but the whole country will feel the \n     absence of his voice and his bravely combative spirit. We say \n     with Walt Whitman: Salud, Camerado. We look for you again \n     under our boot-soles.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, liberal? Worse, The London Economist \ncalled Senator Wellstone the most ``left wing'' Senator in the U.S. \nSenate. Yet, as the most conservative Senator, I found myself time and \nagain fighting at his side.\n  The year started with the Bush seduction of Senator Ted Kennedy on \neducation. Senator Kennedy looked at the amount--$7 billion. President \nBush looked at the thrust--prove that public education was a failure so \nthat private education could be financed by the Government. Testing. \nSomehow the billions being spent by the States on testing was not \nenough. A Federal test was necessary.\n  Failing schools would be closed. Failing students would be tutored. \nBut most likely, the student failing for the lack of a competent \nteacher could find no competent tutor. For all this testing, the \neducation bill provided no help for the student to pass the test. And \nfor this, Senator Wellstone ranted and raved. But nobody listened. \nSenator Wellstone was liberal, but as a conservative I knew he was \nright. We both voted no.\n  Next was the Bush tax cut. No doubt Senator Wellstone, the liberal, \nwas the target for this initiative. For the purpose of Voodoo II, or \nBush's Reaganomics, was to eliminate the resources of Government so \nthat without the money there would be no programs. But in reality, \nprograms persevered, with a horrific debt, and the devastating waste of \ninterest costs. Senator Wellstone, the liberal, was for programs. I, \nthe conservative, was for putting Government on a pay-as-you-go path. \nWe both voted no.\n  Then there was jobs. Fast Track--this was a device that Presidents \nuse to control trade agreements. With it, the agreement submitted by \nthe President could not be amended. Congress was required to vote it up \nor down, and, of course, no agreement was ever submitted until the \nWhite House had the vote fixed.\n  To get NAFTA approved, President Clinton bought the vote with \nnumerous favors not related to the agreement, such as defense \ncontracts, cultural centers, and golf rounds in California and \nArkansas. One could readily see that the intent was to create jobs \nsouth of the border. Sure enough, we lost 700,000 textile jobs alone. \nSo, when fast track expired, we refused to renew it for President \nClinton. Again, Senator Wellstone and I both opposed giving fast track \nauthority to President Bush.\n  ``Liberal.'' ``Conservative.'' Wrong references. Adlai Stevenson used \nto say it's not whether one is liberal or one is conservative, but \nwhether one is headed in the right direction.\n  Adam Nagourney of the New York Times writes of the ``homogenization'' \nof American politics. Politics has changed. Triangulation has taken \nover so that every party compromises, or triangulates, the other \nparty's issues. Both are for tax cuts. Both are for saving Social \nSecurity. Both are for defense. Both are for the war with Iraq. Both \nare for homeland security. Both are against corporate corruption. \nWorse, money locks in this triangulation so that we are back to George \nWallace's, ``There's not a dime's bit of difference between the \nparties.''\n  But there is a fundamental difference. The Republicans know to \ncampaign. The Democrats know to govern. Paul Wellstone came to \nWashington to govern. He could see the crying needs of the country: \nschools, health care, jobs, infrastructure, et cetera. And he was \ndetermined to do something to provide for these needs. But with the \nDemocrats in control by only one vote, we abandoned governing. The \nneeds of the country were abandoned and both parties went into high \ngear to campaign, with money controlling the issues. Y2K, free trade, \ncorporate reform--money controlled with a refusal to even cancel the \nprincipal corruption: stock options. The Congress danced around the \nfire of intelligence failures, terrorism insurance, seaport security, \nrail security, energy policy, pension reform, prescription drugs--but \nno governing.\n  Paul Wellstone was a fighter. The shortest fellow in the Congress, \nmost of us couldn't touch his shoes. Today, there are no fighters in \nWashington, just campaigners.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the tragic death of our colleague, Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota, was such a sudden shock to all of us. It was \nhard to believe he had died. Paul was so full of life, and full of \nenergy and enthusiasm. It was so incongruous, so unbelievable, that his \nlife could be needed so abruptly.\n  But, it was, and we continue to grieve and to miss him.\n  Paul and I were friends. We also collaborated on legislation to help \nfarmers and to find a cure for Parkinson's Disease and Duchenne \nMuscular Dystrophy.\n  We often talked about our strategy for accelerating the research that \nis so important to the effort to conquer these threats to human life.\n  He traveled to my State to see for himself the plight of the poor in \nthe Mississippi Delta. He was sincerely interested in helping alleviate \nthe burdens and problems faced by the poor people who lived in the \nDelta. I told him about the initiatives we had started and let him know \nI shared his concerns and that we were trying some new approaches such \nas the Delta Regional Initiative.\n  Senator Wellstone will always be appreciated for the efforts he made \nto help those who needed help the most.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, the Senate has been a unique institution \nsince its inception. We take great pride in our deliberative nature. \nDebate may take time, but it is time well spent. It is always better to \npursue the right--rather than the rushed--course of action. This style \nof governance has served the American people well for more than two \ncenturies.\n  This does not mean the Senate is not a dynamic body. It is full of \nthe same vibrancy that marks this great experiment called American \ndemocracy. For within this Chamber have echoed some of the most lively \nand spirited debates in our Nation's history. And outside this Chamber \nas well--in committee rooms and caucus meetings and other public \nforums.\n  On Friday the Senate lost one of its most animated Members in Paul \nWellstone. He was a proverbial ``true believer.'' Conviction was not \nsomething about which he simply spoke at opportune moments; he showed \nit time and again with his unabated enthusiasm for being a United \nStates Senator. Paul Wellstone's beliefs rose from a deep and \nimpenetrable well of principle.\n  Indeed, Paul was a proud and unabashed voice for liberalism. His \nvotes often landed him not only on the other side of Republicans, but \non the other side of his fellow Democrats, as well. He was a man who \nsimply did not blink in the face of political pressure. He stared it \ndown without regard to price. Even if you did not agree with him, you \nadmired him and the courage he so frequently displayed.\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\n  I saw this first hand on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. There Paul and I served together on the Subcommittee on \nPublic Health and the Subcommittee on Children and Families. We shared \na common concern for the health of women and children and the mentally \nill. He spoke out often on their behalf. He fought hard for them. And \nhis passion for their well-being will be missed.\n  Paul Wellstone was one of a kind. We were blessed to have him, his \nwife, Sheila, and his daughter, Marcia, as members of the Senate \nfamily. And the people of Minnesota and the United States were blessed \nto have him in their service. May we keep Paul and Sheila's sons and \ngrandchildren and the families of all those who lost loved ones in our \nthoughts and prayers in the coming weeks.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, several days after this terrible \ntragedy, the loss of our beloved colleague, Paul Wellstone, his wife \nSheila, his daughter Marcia, three loyal members of his staff and two \npilots, we still remain in a state of shocked disbelief.\n  We have lost a unique and gifted man, who embodied not only the \nindependent spirit of his home state, but one that resides at the very \nheart of the American soul.\n  A few years ago, when speaking on this floor about the loss of his \nlegislative director, Paul claimed that ``sometimes the only realists \nare the dreamers. . . .''\n  In many ways he could have been referring to himself, the cerebral \npolitical science professor willing to stand alone, when necessary, for \nwhat he believed.\n  He had the common touch, and was an impassioned speaker, noted as \nmuch for his big heart as for his sharp mind.\n  Elected as the only new Senator in 1990, Paul's crusading voice would \nnot have had the same impact in the House of Representatives as it did \nin this Chamber.\n  Only in the Senate could he have helped to lead the successful \nopposition, in 1991, to an energy bill that would have opened the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, or five years later \nforce a vote on a minimum wage increase.\n  For two terms he fought tirelessly for increased funding for \neducation at every level, healthcare that was accessible and affordable \nfor all Americans, sweeping campaign finance reform, and farm \nlegislation that sought to protect the small farmers.\n  While he was, on the one hand, an ideological liberal, willing to \nspeak with his conscience, Paul was also able to work with Republican \ncolleagues on many occasions, and he was responsible for passing \nimportant bipartisan legislation, most notably the expanded insurance \ncoverage for mental illnesses, with Senator Domenici.\n  But Paul Wellstone's commitment to social justice did not stop at our \nborders. He was an outspoken champion of the poor and the powerless \naround the world, in Latin America, Asia and Africa.\n  I remember when, back in 1996, I voiced concern over the plight of \nwomen and girls under the reactionary rule of the Taliban, Paul was one \nof the few who was receptive to the need for the United States to \nrespond to such violations.\n  In 1999, Paul and I introduced the ``International Trafficking of \nWomen and Children Victim Protection Act,'' which established an \ninteragency task force to monitor and combat trafficking, provided \nassistance to other countries that met minimum international standards, \nand withheld U.S. non-humanitarian assistance to countries that failed \nto meet these standards.\n  To his eternal credit, it is worth noting that Paul had originally \nintroduced his own bill, which contained much tougher criminal \nprovisions and stronger protections for victims.\n  He was a leading advocate for Tibetan autonomy, able to work closely \nwith his ideological nemesis, Jesse Helms. In fact, the last time I \nworked with Paul was in cosponsoring an act to safeguard the cultural, \nreligious, and ethnic identity of the Tibetan people and to encourage \nfurther dialog between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.\n  We must not forget that the world has also lost Sheila, Paul's \nwonderful wife of almost 40 years, and a passionate campaigner against \ndomestic violence, and for the need to create violence-free families. \nHers was a noble cause, a critical fight, that must be continued.\n  Minnesota has produced some of America's most eloquent, committed, \nand honorable leaders. Hubert Humphrey, Harold Stassen, Eugene \nMcCarthy, and Walter Mondale come quickly to mind.\n  Even if he had not met such a tragic and untimely end, Paul Wellstone \nwould have surely earned his place among this distinguished group. The \nfact that he has left us so abruptly, and left all of us so sad, will \nnot diminish his achievements, nor weaken his message.\n  To quote Paul:\n\n       I still believe that government can be a force of good in \n     people's lives.\n\n  We in the Senate should take these words to heart, just as we were \ntruly honored to have had him among us. We are all the better to have \nknown him and worked with him. He will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, it has been a very moving afternoon in \nthe Chamber listening to my colleagues speak so eloquently about my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Minnesota. The words of my \ncolleagues were very moving. It was touching to hear of their respect \nand their affection and their admiration for Paul Wellstone.\n  I spoke earlier this afternoon about the Senator, my dear friend, and \nbecause others were waiting to speak I abbreviated my remarks. I wanted \nto close by noting, as others have so well, that Paul's remarkable \nachievements were not his alone.\n  He was one of those people who, in his greatness, was able to attract \ngreat people to his side. He had extraordinarily dedicated men and \nwomen who worked for him, worked with him, gave of their time and their \nenergy, their hearts and their souls to his work: Colin McGinnis and \nhis staff here in Washington; Connie Lewis, Minnesota State director, \nand her staff in Minnesota were always with Paul and Sheila and \nextraordinarily dedicated.\n  Of course, if you wanted to make a difference in Washington, if you \nwanted to try to move mountains and you were young and idealistic, who \nbetter to work for than Paul Wellstone?\n  Many of his former students at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, \nwent on to be his key staff aides. I used to tease Paul and say that is \nwhat he was doing during his time there; he was recruiting the best and \nthe brightest to work on his campaigns and organize the State and to \nwork in Washington and in Minnesota on behalf of the many causes he \nchampioned--Jeff Blodgett, who was managing his campaign for the third \ntime and doing so with great skill, and according to the last published \npolls, with very successful results, and others in Minnesota who gave \nup their careers, family life, and set it aside to one more time bring \nthe man they loved and in whom they believed to victory.\n  Kari Moe, who was involved with Senator Wellstone's Washington \noffice, was his chief of staff for years before. They are incredibly \ndedicated people each in their own right.\n  Tom Lapic tragically was on the plane with Paul and lost his life in \nservice to his friend and his country. Tom was the deputy Minnesota \ndirector. Several hundred friends and family came to his memorial \nservice a week after his death. He was a man who touched people deeply, \nas did Paul. His wife Trudy and others shared their recollections, the \nwonderful qualities Tom had that complemented Paul, his calmness, \nvirtually unflappable under any circumstances. Like Paul, he was astute \nand eloquent, and he and Paul collaborated on many of the words that \nPaul used in speeches. Tom was always by Paul's side offering his \nguidance and perspective.\n  Will McLaughlin was on Paul's campaign staff. He was just starting \nhis political career at the age of 23 in Minnesota. But everybody could \nsee he was destined to be a star, a Governor or\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\na Senator, something special someday. He already had been elected \nPresident of his fraternity at the University of Minnesota. Politics \nwas in Will's blood or maybe even in his genetic code. His father Mike \nMcLaughlin was a long time Fourth District chair of the Minnesota \nDemocratic Party, and he collaborated with the greats of the previous \ngeneration--Hubert Humphrey, Fritz Mondale, Eugene McCarthy, Joe Karth, \nBruce Vento. Will's mother Judy McLaughlin was a close associate of the \nformer speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He will be \nmissed by his mother Judy and his siblings and his friends and those in \nMinnesota who never had a chance to get to know him.\n  Thousands of Minnesotans knew Mary McEvoy who was on the plane as \nstaff in name but really as a friend of Paul's and Sheila's. She was \none of Sheila Wellstone's very closest friends. Sheila flew with Paul \nbecause he loathed it, and Mary flew with Sheila because she loathed \nit. It was beyond tragedy, beyond words that Mary had taken a leave of \nabsence from the University of Minnesota where she was a full \nprofessor, where she chaired the department, where she had her own very \ndistinguished career in her field, so she could help her friend Sheila \nand her friend Paul during their time of need. She had a service where \nover 1,500 Minnesotans, friends, and family came to pay their respects. \nShe was associate chair of the DFL Party. She was a leader. She was a \ncolleague. She was a mother of three beautiful children, and she had \nher husband Jamie. She will be terribly missed by all of us in the life \nof Minnesota.\n\n  Of course, the linchpin of Paul's staff, his unpaid and most \nimportant staff person was his wife Sheila who, unlike some campaign \nand political spouses, was beloved by Paul's staff and gratefully \nwelcomed to the office for her ability to run interference when \nnecessary with her husband and his life and his schemes.\n  I remember once it was said it took a lot of money to keep Mahatma \nGandhi in poverty because of the people around him necessary to help \nhim carry out his mission. It took a lot of really remarkable and \ntalented people to keep Paul Wellstone on the brink of disorganization. \nHe had so much energy and was doing so many things, often \nsimultaneously. Sheila was the linchpin and a formidable political \nactivist in her own right. She was born and raised in the coal country \nof West Virginia, a hard-scrabble upbringing. She and Paul were married \nwhen they were 19 years old. For 39 years they were each other's best \nfriend, colleagues, mates, spouses.\n  Many talk about and preach family values. That was a wonderful \nmarriage and a wonderful family. They had three children of whom they \nwere enormously proud. Marcia Wellstone, tragically on the plane, was a \nfuture political star in her own right. She loved campaigning, loved \nbeing out with the people of Minnesota. She was a wonderful teacher in \nthe White Bear School District, beloved by her students, liked by her \ncolleagues. She also leaves a gap with her family and friends that can \nnever be filled.\n  They had two sons who fortunately were not on the plane that day, \nDavid and Mark, of whom Paul and Sheila were also enormously proud. I \nhope and I trust they will, in this time of terrible loss and grief, be \nconsoled a little by the words that were expressed today, by the words \nthat have been expressed by people all over the country. They had \nextraordinary parents, very hard parents to lose, but ones who will be \nwith them in spirit always and gave them the best upbringing that any \ntwo fine men could wish for.\n  Paul was a family man from the beginning. That was always foremost in \nhis priorities. I remember not more than 6 weeks ago I happened to come \nto the Senate Chamber one afternoon, just around the lunch hour. Much \nto my surprise, the Senate was in recess. There was Paul with his 7-\nyear-old grandson named Joshua, Marcia's child, who was evidently on an \nouting that afternoon with his grandfather.\n  Paul was showing him around the empty Chamber and pointing out where \nhis desk was, as well as others. I think Paul was convinced that he had \nJosh quite impressed with this great Chamber and all it represents to \nall of us until Josh looked up at him kind of wistfully and said: \nGrandpa, are we going to go someplace soon? You promised that we were \ngoing to go someplace this afternoon.\n  For once, Paul seemed almost at a loss for words. He looked up at the \nceiling and then looked forlornly at me, looked over to Josh and said: \nThis is someplace.\n  I close by saying, yes, Paul, this is some place that you reached, \nwithout any of the advantages some of us have enjoyed, and Sheila \nWellstone with none at all. They met at age 19. He came to Northfield, \nMN, built a career as a college professor, she as a housewife raising \ntheir children. To come to some place like this is a phenomenal \nAmerican success story.\n  I recounted earlier today about how Paul was elected in 1990. He ran \nan extraordinary campaign, a David versus Goliath, come from nowhere, \nmiraculous victory that is a tribute to the kind of indefatigable \ncourage and willingness to follow his dream and bring people along with \nhim. He stood for what he believed in and won by doing so. That should \nbe in every political textbook in this country for decades to come.\n  He served in the Senate for 12 years and made those stands again and \nagain. Whether they were popular, whether he had the votes or not, he \nknew usually with great insight whether he was going to be successful. \nHe knew when he lost he had no alternative but to stand behind what he \nbelieved in, to stand with his conscience and his convictions. He \ntrusted in the people of Minnesota to give him the opportunity to \nserve, which they did twice, and he was going back to seek their \nsupport for a third term.\n  As others have pointed out, he was facing one of the most difficult \nvotes of his career, as some would say, at an inopportune time, which \nwas the resolution to authorize the use of force in Iraq by the \nPresident, at his discretion. Paul began his Senate career with that \nkind of vote with the Persian Gulf resolution and some believe because \nof his stands over the years that if he were to oppose a popular \nPresident, if he were to express a different perspective and, as \nSenator Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \npointed out, vote for an alternative resolution, one that committed the \nUnited States to multilateral action with other countries of the world, \nthat he would pay a political price for that in Minnesota.\n  Paul never really agonized about his decision in this matter because \ncompromising his convictions was not something Paul ever considered \ndoing. In fact, in my 2 years in the Senate, the one time I saw Paul \nangry was when a staff person--not his own staff, he did not know who \nmade the comment--was reported in the Washington Post as saying the \nSenate Democratic Caucus was trying to find some alternative resolution \nto provide cover for Paul Wellstone who was facing a difficult \nreelection. Paul was furious that anyone would accuse him of looking \nfor cover from a tough vote. He said in one of our meetings that is \nwhat he had to take back to the people of Minnesota, that they knew he \nwould never seek cover to avoid a tough decision or a tough vote; he \nwould do what he believed was right and he was willing to go back to \nthe Minnesota electorate and take their judgment.\n  I believe if he had been able to bring that to the Tuesday election \nthat judgment would again have been in the affirmative. That is Paul \nWellstone's legacy to all of us. That is his legacy to the country. \nWhether one would agree with everything Paul believed is not the point. \nThere are those who can have sincere convictions on the other side of \nthe issue. That is the greatness of our country and our democracy, that \nwe can have those disagreements, honest, different points of view, and \nwe are a better institution and we are a better country for our \nability, through our political process, to embrace and incorporate \nthose differences.\n\n  He stood for what he believed in, would risk everything, his \npolitical career, his opportunity to serve, everything he believed and \neverything he wanted, on a matter of principle. He would do so \nwillingly, courageously, and emphatically. That is something I will \ntake with me throughout the rest of my life, and I would commend it to \neveryone else in this body and across this country.\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am not sure of what the remainder \nof the Senate schedule might be for this week, but my own tenure in \nthis body is somewhat limited as a consequence of my election to the \nGovernorship in the State of Alaska. So with the permission of the \nPresiding Officer--and I have checked with the Parliamentarian--we have \nthe opportunity to address matters in our short remaining time.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues an earthquake that occurred \nin my State of Alaska just a little over a week ago. It registered 7.9 \non the Richter Scale, which is a very high earthquake.\n  My wife and I happened to be at mass during the earthquake, and not \nonly did the chandeliers move from side to side, but the crucifix, \nhanging by a brass chain, began to move very dramatically, and it was \nalmost as if the sign of the cross was moving across the agenda.\n  It happened to be a Korean service in a Catholic Church in Anchorage, \nand I must say, the magnitude of the earthquake was matched by the \nmagnitude of the Korean priest who did not break stride in his sermon. \nOn the other hand, it was in Korean, and my Korean is a little rusty. \nBut no one moved from the church. Heads went down. And I admired the \npriest.\n  My purpose in bringing this matter up is to share with you a \nrecognition of concern that has been expressed in this body for some \ntime; and that is the safety of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline which \ncovers some 800 miles from the North Slope of Prudhoe Bay to the city \nof Valdez where the oil is shipped in U.S. tankers and moved down the \nwest coast.\n  The significance of this earthquake along this 800-mile pipeline was \nthat no damage was done in spite of the 7.9 magnitude. Dealing with the \npotential for earthquakes in the design was a consideration some 30 \nyears ago, that the line itself should be designed to withstand an 8.0 \nmagnitude earthquake. I want my colleagues to know that the line held a \n7.9 tremor quite nicely. As a matter of fact, immediately after the \nquake rocked interior Alaska, the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez \nwas shut down as a precaution and inspected.\n  The massive quake did do some damage. There were a few supports which \nwere quickly repaired. The line slowly was refilled and put back into \nservice. But the significance was that there were no breaks. In fact, \nthe damage was minimal for the size of the quake which did destroy some \nroads, damage some bridges, other structures. But the best news is not \none cup of oil was spilled, despite the magnitude of the quake--not one \nsingle cupful.\n  There are those who claim the line has been poorly maintained; those \nwho say it is dangerously old, beyond its prime. I hope they will \nreconsider, recognizing what happened under a real test.\n  What can they say? The line performed as it was designed and \nengineered to perform. It is quite timely as this comes at a time when \nwe have in the House and Senate conference the issue of opening up ANWR \nto oil exploration. It has been a significant issue among the \nenvironmentalists. It has pitted Republican against Democrat and \nRepublican against Republican, Democrat against Democrat. As we \ncontemplate action in Iraq, we should reflect on the realization that \nwe have done a pretty good job of producing energy here at home and, \ngiven the opportunity, we can do much better if we are fortunate enough \nto get an energy bill and get ANWR included in that.\n  This comes at a time when Alaskans' dreams of opening the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration are being rekindled by huge \nRepublican gains nationally in Tuesday's elections.\n  The GOP is in control of the House and the Senate, and Democrats who \nare beholden to environmentalists and have blocked ANWR will have a \nmore difficult time turning their backs on U.S. energy independence and \nnational security.\n  I hope as I leave this body in the next few days that my State of \nAlaska will get a fair hearing on the ANWR issue because people in my \nState for years have been saying oil exploration and development can be \ndone and in an environmentally safe and responsible manner. Prudhoe Bay \nand other North Slope oilfields' records provide the best proof that \nthe assertion is true that we can develop these resources safely here \nat home. I think Sunday's earthquake was further evidence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10831-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10831-S10832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The issue of homeland security, I believe, is one of \ngreat urgency. I believe that September 11, 2001, could have been \nprevented had we had all of the so-called dots on the board about \nwarnings which had been received. I do not agree with CIA Director \nGeorge Tenet that another September 11 is imminent. CIA Director Tenet \nmade that statement about a month ago.\n  We had a lot of warning signals about 9/11. There was an FBI report \nin July of 2001 about a suspicious man taking flight training in \nPhoenix, that he had a big picture of Osama bin Laden in his apartment, \nwhich never got to headquarters. That warning was mired in FBI \nbureaucracy.\n  There was information that two al-Qaida members from Kuala Lumpur \nwere planning to come to the United States; that it was known to the \nCIA but never told to the FBI or the INS, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. They came in unimpeded and were two of the \npilots on the suicide missions on September 11.\n  Then there was the effort by the Minneapolis office of the FBI to \nsecure a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for \nZacarias Moussaoui which had the wrong standard. Had the FBI gotten \ninto Moussaoui's computer, there was a treasure trove of information \nabout potential attack.\n  Then there was the warning to the National Security Agency on \nSeptember 10 about something to happen the next day. It was not \ntranslated until September 12, but it was too late. Then an al-Qaida \nman named Murak confessed in 1996 of plans by al-Qaida to fly a plane \nloaded with explosives into the CIA headquarters. We already had the \nattack on the Trade Center in 1993. Osama bin Laden was under \nindictment for killing Americans in Mogadishu in 1993, and under \nindictment for the Embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. Osama bin Laden \nwas on record as declaring a worldwide jihad against the United States.\n  We had a lot of warnings, and had all of those dots been put on the \nboard, I think there was a veritable blueprint and I said as much when \nFBI Director Mueller came to testify before the Judiciary Committee \nlast June.\n  We had the homeland security bill on the floor for a full month. We \nstarted debating it on September 3. We did not finish until October 1, \nand it was never ever passed. When President Bush came to Pennsylvania \nback in late October, I urged the President to call a special session \nof Congress to pass homeland security. It seems to me that is our job.\n  The President is emphatic that the first thing he does every day is \nto review the intelligence briefings. There is grave concern that there \ncould be another attack. I am glad that the President is insistent that \nCongress pass homeland security before we go\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\nout of this lame duck session. While it is important to pass homeland \nsecurity, it is important that it be enacted with the appropriate \nprovisions. One provision that I have discussed at some length is to \nhave the Secretary be able to direct the intelligence agencies which \nwill all be under one umbrella. The idea to have the intelligence \nagencies under one umbrella, I think, has been generally agreed \nupon. This is not a new idea; it has been proposed for a long time.\n\n  I was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1995 and 1996. \nI saw the turf wars between the CIA and the FBI, the NSA and Defense \nIntelligence, et cetera. Legislation was introduced by this Senator to \nbring everything under one umbrella of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nand that legislation has languished. Mine was not the only idea; it has \nbeen proposed by others over the years. The turf battles have precluded \nit. Now, with an Office of Homeland Security, we have a chance to get \nit under one umbrella.\n  It is vital the Secretary be able to direct these analytical \ndepartments to work together. Otherwise, the turf battles will go on. I \nam not saying the CIA Director should lose control over his agents \naround the world or the FBI Director should lose control over FBI \nagents in the United States or abroad, or any other Department should \nlose control over their agents. But when you pull the analysis and \nbring all the analysts under one umbrella, there is the point that \nthere has to be direction so all the dots are placed on one screen.\n  The language is very simple. It is:\n\n       On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by the \n     President, to direct the agencies described under subsection \n     (f)(2) to provide intelligence information, analysis of \n     intelligence information, and such other intelligence-\n     regulated information, as the Assistant Secretary for \n     Information Analysis determines necessary.\n\n  That is the operative language. The other parts of the bill contain \nan enumeration of all of the agencies which will be under one umbrella \nfor analysis.\n  There has been considerable argument and disagreement over labor-\nmanagement provisions. This has been discussed at some length by this \nSenator and others in colloquies. Part of the controversy arose because \nof initial confusion as to whether the two paragraphs added by the \namendment by Senator Nelson of Nebraska--that is the other Senator \nNelson, Mr. President; may the Record show that Senator Bill Nelson is \npresiding at the moment--whether they were in addition to or in place \nof. And if they were in place of, that would have eliminated the \nPresident's national security waiver which is indispensable and should \nnot be eliminated.\n  In colloquy with Senator Lieberman, it was agreed to that these \nprovisions would be in addition to. So that asked that collective \nbargaining in current law would stand, which provides in subsection A:\n\n       (A) the agency or subdivision has a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national \n     security work, and\n       (B) the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to \n     that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with \n     national security requirements and considerations.\n\n  Then the Nelson amendment would have added the language:\n       (1) the mission and responsibilities of the agency or \n     subdivision materially change; and\n       (2) a majority of such employees within such agency or \n     subdivision have--as their primary duty--intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, or investigative work directly related \n     to terrorism investigation.\n\n  I believe that language would be satisfactory to all parties.\n  Then with respect to the flexibility which the President has sought \nas to the other five chapters, that format would be followed so that, \nin essence, where we have intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative work, there would be the flexibility for a national \nsecurity waiver as determined by the President.\n  Now I have just come from a meeting with Republican leadership with \nthe President, and there has been work over the past weekend on this \nissue. As yet, we do not know precisely what provisions have been \nagreed to. It is my hope that the language which I had suggested in \nSeptember and which has been before all of the Senators who were \nworking on the final analysis, plus this language, will be incorporated \nin the final bill. I will be in touch with the officials in the \nadministration yet this afternoon to try to see to it that these \nprovisions which are agreeable to all sides--both labor and management, \nto solve the labor-management controversy--can be made part of the \nbill, and that the language which would give the Secretary the \nauthority to direct the analysis sections will also be included in the \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the language giving the \nSecretary of Homeland Defense authority to direct the analytical \nagencies be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks along \nwith the language both as to collective bargaining and the flexibility \nin the other five divisions of labor-management.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 24, strike line 4 and insert the following:\n       (19) On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by \n     the President, to direct the agencies described under \n     subsection (f)(2) to provide intelligence information, \n     analyses of intelligence information, and such other \n     intelligence-related information as the Assistant Secretary \n     for Information Analysis determines necessary.\n       (20) To perform such other duties relating to\n       (A) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work, and\n       (B) the provision of this chapter [5 USCS Sec. Sec. 7101 \n     et. seq.] cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in \n     a matter of consistent with national security requirements \n     and considerations.\n       In addition to the requirements of sub-sections (A) and (B) \n     the President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter [5 USCS \n     Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq.] if the President determines that--\n       (1) the mission and responsibilities of the agency or \n     subdivision materially change; and\n       (2) a majority of such employees within such agency or \n     subdivision have--as their primary duty--intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, or investigative work directly related \n     to terrorism investigation.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision, the authority of the \n     President under Section 9701 on establishment of a human \n     resources management system shall require that the President \n     determines that:\n       (A) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work, and\n       (B) the provisions of chapter 43, 51, 53, 71, 75 or 77 \n     cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a matter \n     consistent with national security requirements and \n     considerations.\n       In addition to the requirements of sub-sections (A) and (B) \n     the President may issue an order providing for waiver of the \n     provisions of chapters 43, 51, 53, 71, 75 or 77 if the \n     President determines that--\n       (1) the mission and responsibilities of the agency or \n     subdivision materially change; and\n       (2) a majority of such employees within such agency or \n     subdivisions have--as their primary duty--intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, or investigative work directly related \n     to terrorism investigation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10832-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10832-S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN REMEMBRANCE OF BRIGADIER GENERAL VORLEY (MIKE) REXROAD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to Brigadier \nGeneral Vorley (Mike) Rexroad, USAF (Retired), who died on October 12, \n2002, after a life of distinguished service to the Military Health \nSystem, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences \n(USUHS), and our Nation.\n  Vorley (Mike) Rexroad, a native West Virginian born on April 6, 1915, \nearned his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Glenville State College, \nGlenville, West Virginia in 1938 and his Masters in American Government \nat the University of New Mexico in 1948. Mike Rexroad joined the Army \nAir Corps on December 9, 1941, and began 61 years of service to his \nNation and dedication to military medicine. In 1944, following both air \nflight and commando training, Lieutenant Rexroad was assigned to the \nBritish 14th Army Headquarters in Burma. At the conclusion of World War \nII in 1945, Captain Rexroad led the first American task force into the \nprisoner of war camp in Thailand. His task force included physicians \nand medical corpsmen; it was during this emotion-packed time when Mike \nRexroad developed his sincere appreciation for military medicine.\n  After his release from active duty, Mike Rexroad accepted a faculty \nappointment at New York University, NY, however, in June of 1950, with \nthe onset of the Korean War, Rexroad was called to active duty by the \nAir Force\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\nand assigned to the Office of Special Investigations/\nCounterintelligence. When the war ended, Major Rexroad was selected to \nhead one of the debriefing and interview teams for some 500 Air Force \nprisoners of war following their release from the North Korean prison \ncamps. This experience reinforced Mike Rexroad's appreciation of \nmilitary medicine's critical requirements for continuity and \nleadership. From 1955 through 1976, Mike Rexroad served as a \nprofessional staff member on Capitol Hill; he first served on the staff \nof Senator Dennis Chavez of New Mexico who was the chairman of the \nSubcommittee for the Department of Defense. Next he was selected by \nSenator John C. Stennis of Mississippi to serve as the senior staff \nmember for the Subcommittee on Military Construction; and, continued to \nserve in that capacity for Senator Alan Bible of Nevada. From 1965 to \n1976, he was appointed by Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, Majority \nLeader of the Senate and chairman of the Subcommittee on Military \nConstruction, to serve as the senior staff member for the subcommittee.\n  Following his service in both World War II and the Korean War, his \nreview of the medical capabilities during the Vietnam War for the U.S. \nSenate, and 20 years as a senior member of Senate Committee Staffs, \nMike Rexroad became dedicated to preserving the lessons learned in \nmilitary medicine; he concurred with Congressman F. Edward Hebert's \nphilosophy that America needed an academic home for military medicine. \nIn the early 1970s, Rexroad prepared documentation and memoranda for \npresentation to the Senate Appropriations Committee to justify the \nestablishment of USUHS and the need for continuity and leadership in \nmilitary medicine. Following the passage of Public Law 92-426, the \nUniformed Services Health Professions Revitalization Act of 1972, the \nsenior administration of USUHS worked directly with Mike Rexroad to \ncoordinate the construction requirements for USUHS.\n  In 1977, when closure threatened USUHS, the now-retired Mike Rexroad \nagain volunteered to raise Congressional support for the University. At \nthat time, no funding had been appropriated for USUHS. On March 21, \n1977 due to Rexroad's intervention, the Chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Aging, Congressman Claude Pepper, testified on behalf of \nUSUHS and strongly endorsed the continuation of the University; the \nMembers of the House of Representatives voted to retain USUHS with of \nvote of 264 to 142. The Honorable David Packard, first chairman of the \nUSUHS Board of Regents, succinctly described Mike Rexroad's vital role \nin two letters to Rexroad dated July 12, 1976 and May 10, 1977: ``It is \nno exaggeration to say that without your assistance USUHS could and \nwould not have been established (1976). Without your help, it is \nquestionable whether the school would have continued to enjoy the \nsupport of the Congress (1977).'' From 1993 through 1997, Rexroad was \nonce more called upon to raise congressional support for the \nUniversity. In May of 1996, the Members of the House of Representatives \nonce more voted on the retention of USUHS. This time, with the \ntremendous support and coordination of the military retired \nassociations, the vote to retain USUHS was 343 to 82. By November of \n1997, the Secretary of Defense determined that USUHS should remain \nopen; on December 11, 2000, the Honorable William S. Cohen, the \nSecretary of Defense, awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award to the \nUniversity; and, on March 22, 2001, the Honorable Donald Rumsfeld, \nSecretary of Defense, wrote the following to the Chair of the USUHS \nBoard of Regents:\n\n       The Department takes great pride in the fact that the USUHS \n     graduates have become the backbone for our Military Health \n     System. The training they receive in combat and peacetime \n     medicine is essential to providing superior force health \n     protection and improving the quality of life for our service \n     members, retirees, and families. All of us in the Office of \n     the Secretary of Defense place great emphasis on the \n     retention of quality physicians in the military. The USUHS \n     ensures those goals are met.'' In addition, the Association \n     of American Medical Colleges Reporter pointed out in the \n     December issues of both 1998 and 2001, that USUHS is the one \n     medical school where students have been, and continue to be, \n     trained in the medical response to weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD). ``Today, while the other medical schools \n     are in the process of initiating programs and training in \n     WMD, USUHS has been providing such education since its first \n     School of Medicine (SOM) Class of 1980; 3,265 SOM graduates \n     and 157 advanced practice nurses have now had this training. \n     The USUHS SOM graduates currently represent 22 percent of the \n     physicians on active duty in the Military Health System; thus \n     ensuring continuity and leadership for military medicine.\n\n  During his many years of support for USUHS, Mike Rexroad constantly \nacted upon his personal knowledge of what can go wrong when continuity \nand leadership are not ensured for military medicine. USUHS became a \npart of his overall commitment to the preservation of the hard-won \nknowledge of the battlefield, the absolute priorities of preventive \nmedicine, the tremendous achievements of uniformed research, and the \nneed for an academic home for military medicine. At the USUHS \nCommencement Exercises on May 15, 1998, Mike Rexroad received the \nDoctor of Medical Humanities, Honoris Causa; the honorary degree \nrecognized his unfailing, consistent, and dynamic advocacy for USUHS \nand military medicine. Through his 87th year, there was no request from \nhis military medical family for which he did not volunteer his time and \neffort; he played an essential role in making continuity and leadership \na reality for military medicine.\n  Brigadier General Vorley (Mike) Rexroad USAF, (Retired), was an \nextremely gifted, resourceful, and dedicated American. The citizens of \nour Nation have immeasurably benefitted by his splendid record of \naccomplishments and commitment to military medicine. I extend my \ndeepest sympathy to his wife, Ruth Cutlip Rexroad, formerly of New \nMexico; his son, Michael David Rexroad, a state prosecuting attorney in \nHoward County, Maryland; his daughter-in-law, Linda; and, his two \ngrandchildren, Michael and Laurie, on their great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10833-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10833-S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE GREAT LAKES LEGACY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I also want to thank the Lake Michigan Federation, Sierra \nClub, the Northeast-Midwest Institute, the Great Lakes Commission, and \nthe Council of Great Lakes Industry for their contributions to the \nsuccesses of this bill.\n  I am particularly pleased that H.R. 1070 includes several of the \nlegislative improvements contained in my companion legislation, S. \n2544. As a result of the Senate amendments, H.R. 1070 now authorizes \nthe Great Lakes National Program Office to carry out a public \ninformation program to provide information about the contaminated \nsediments and activities to cleanup the site. The Great Lakes National \nProgram Office is reauthorized and may receive up to $25 million per \nyear which is $14 million higher than the expired authorization. H.R. \n1070 also responds to the GAO report released in May by requiring the \nEPA to submit a report to Congress on the actions, time periods, and \nresources which are necessary to fulfill the duties of the EPA relating \nto oversight of Remedial Action Plans at Areas of Concern. Lastly, the \nlegislation has the flexibility to allow both cash and in-kind \ncontributions to be used to meet the non-Federal cost-share \nrequirement.\n  The Great Lakes Legacy Act is needed to address a problem that has \nbeen plaguing the Great Lakes for many decades. The region's industrial \npast unfortunately created a legacy of contaminated sediments, PCBs, \nheavy metals and other toxic substances in the lakes and tributaries \nthat feed into the Great Lakes.\n  These pollutants, which are degrading the health of both humans and \nwildlife, settled at the bottom of the tributaries and harbors where \nthey were dumped and contaminated the sediment or material on the \nbottom. Contaminated sediment is a major environmental problem in our \nregion, and it is critical that some of these concentrated deposits of \ncontaminated sediment be addressed now, because the longer we wait to \ncleanup the contamination, the longer we will see fish advisories in \nthe Great Lakes. Cleanup delays also mean a greater likelihood that the \nsediment will be transported into the open waters of the Great\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\nLakes where cleanup is virtually impossible.\n  We have taken steps under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to \nlimit the amount of toxic pollutants entering the Great Lakes \necosystem, and some progress has been made in removing contaminated \nsediments from our regional waters. Based on information that was \ngathered in 1999 by the EPA, over 1.7 million cubic yards of \ncontaminated sediment have been removed or treated at a cost of over \n$300 million at the 32 Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes.\n  However, the General Accounting Office and others have reported that \ncleanup progress has been slow. With this legislation, EPA can \naggressively deal with contaminants that were deposited into the \nsediments decades ago.\n  This bill authorizes up to $50 million per year to EPA's Great Lakes \nNational Program Office in order to cleanup contaminated Areas of \nConcern. This includes monitoring and evaluating sites, cleaning up \ncontaminated sediment or preventing further contamination. Projects \nidentified in a Remedial Action Plan would be given priority for this \nfunding. The EPA is required to submit to Congress a report on the \nactions, time and resources necessary to fulfill the duties of the EPA \nrelating to oversight of Remedial Action Plans at Areas of Concern. \nUnder this legislation, funding will be made available for innovative \nresearch to improve our cleanup technology. Additionally, this \nlegislation allows EPA to give money to local groups, States, or tribal \ngroups for outreach and education efforts.\n  Again, I am very pleased that the Congress has taken this critical \nstep for the Great Lakes, and I look forward to the President signing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMichigan and fellow Great Lakes Task Force Co-Chair, Senator Levin, in \nannouncing that the Great Lakes Legacy has passed Congress. This \nlegislation is vital in our efforts to address the slow progress in \nrestoring the Areas of Concern, AOC, throughout the Great Lakes.\n  In 1987, the United States and Canada made a commitment under the \nGreat Lakes Water Quality Agreement to cleanup AOCs, but as the General \nAccounting Office and others have reported, cleanup has been slow. The \nEPA reported in 1999 that over 1.7 million cubic yards of contaminated \nsediment have been removed or treated at 32 Areas of Concern in the \nGreat Lakes, all at a cost of over $300 million. However, none of the \n26 AOCs that are entirely in the United States have been restored to \ntheir beneficial use, approximately half of the sites have abandoned \nthe remedial action planning process agreed to under the Great Lakes \nWater Quality Agreement, and the EPA does not know how long cleanup \nwill take nor how expensive cleanup will be.\n  The cleanup of these Areas of Concern is important both to human \nhealth, as well as the health of the ecosystem. With the legislation \nCongress recently passed, the EPA can aggressively deal with \ncontaminants that were deposited into the sediments decades ago. Our \nbill authorizes up to $50 million per year to the EPA's Great Lakes \nNational Program Office to cleanup contaminated AOCs. This includes \nmonitoring and evaluating sites, cleaning up contaminated sediment, or \npreventing further contamination.\n  Under our bill, the EPA will be required to submit to Congress a \nreport on the actions, time, and resources necessary to fulfill the \nduties of the EPA relating to oversight of Remedial Action Plans at \nAreas of Concern. Furthermore, funding will be made available for \ninnovative research to improve our cleanup technology. Additionally, \nthis legislation allows EPA to give money to local organizations, \nStates, or tribal groups for outreach and education efforts.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senators Levin, Voinovich, Stabenow, \nClinton, Durbin, Dayton, and Wellstone, as well as Representative Vern \nEhlers and the other co-sponsors in the House for their leadership. I \nalso wish to thank the Lake Michigan Federation, the Sierra Club, the \nNortheast-Midwest Institute, the Great Lakes Commission, and the \nCouncil of Great Lakes Industry for their contributions to drafting and \npassing this bill. It will have a lasting, positive impact on the \nfuture of our Great Lakes.\n\n\n                         Remedial Alternatives\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I want to thank my friend and chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee for his leadership on \nrestoring some of the Nation's great waters. H.R. 1070, the Great Lakes \nLegacy Act, will allow the TPA to fund cleanup of contaminated \nsediments at Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes. Because this \ncontamination poses a significant human health risk, it is important \nthat before cleanup may begin at an Area of Concern using funds under \nthis act, there must be consideration of remedial alternatives and \ntheir short and long-term effects on human health and the environment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I agree with my colleague from Michigan, and the bill \nrequires the EPA to review the short-term and long-term effects of the \nproposed cleanup strategy before the project may be carried out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is my colleague aware that the current Remedial Action \nPlan process and the PA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy \nboth consider an evaluation of the heath risks posed by contaminated \nsites and the cleanup alternatives and that many Remedial Action Plans \nalready include such an evaluation of the health risks?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am aware that the current Remedial Action Plan and \nother processes consider an evaluation of the effects of cleanup \nalternatives and that many Remedial Action Plans already include such \nan evaluation. Additional evaluation is not required when the Remedial \nAction Plan has already evaluated the short and long term effects of \nremedial alternatives on human health and the environment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would my colleague agree that the evaluation that must be \nconducted under this bill is not meant to be a redundant task upon the \nEPA?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10834-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BAKERS CREEK TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition today to \nhonor the forty U.S. soldiers who tragically perished in Bakers Creek, \nQueensland, Australia on June 14, 1943. Their deaths came as a result \nof the crash of a B-17C Flying Fortress, which proved to be the worst \naviation disaster of the Southwest Pacific theater during World War II. \nMore soldiers died on that plane from my home State of Pennsylvania--\nsix--than from any other State. These six were as follows: Pvt. James \nE. Finney; T/Sgt. Alfred H. Frezza; Sgt. Donald B. Kyper; Pfc. Frank S. \nPenksa; Sgt. Anthony Rudnick; and Cpl. Raymond H. Smith.\n  I understand that members of the Bakers Creek Memorial Association, \nUSA, based in Orrtanna, PA, have located the families of Pvt. Finney, \nT/Sgt. Frezza, and Sgt. Kyper. However, the Association continues to \nsearch for the relatives of Pfc. Penska, Sgt. Rudnick, and Cpl. Smith \nto notify them of the specifics surrounding their loved ones' deaths. \nOnly recently has the Air Force officially recognized this tragedy.\n  The aircraft that crashed had been operated by the United States Army \nAir Force 46th Transport Carrier Squadron, 317th Troop Carrier Group, \n5th Air Force Division. The plane was one of the many B-17 bomber \naircraft that had been removed from combat status and converted into \ntransport aircraft. Shortly after takeoff from the Mackay airport in \nBakers Creek, the B-17 lost altitude, fell to the earth in a slow and \nsteady bank, and crashed in a ball of flames. The forty lost onboard \nincluded six crew members and thirty-five soldiers returning to their \nposts after being on leave in Australia.\n  Next June will mark the 60th anniversary of the Bakers Creek crash. I \nunderstand that Major General, Retired, Robert H. Appleby, former \nCommander of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, plans to lead a \ncontingent of victims' families to Australia in observance of the \nanniversary. I applaud the members of the Bakers Creek Memorial \nAssociation, USA, including General Appleby and Mr. Robert S. Cutler, \nfor undertaking this and other initiatives which keep the memory of the \nfallen heroes of Bakers Creek alive and well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10835-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10835]]\n                 THANKING AREA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise today to commend the Maryland, \nVirginia, and Federal law enforcement agencies on the capture and \narrest of the snipers who terrorized our region. For the citizens of \nMaryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, life slowly returned \nto normal after the 23 days of sniper shootings in October, but life \nwill never return to normal for the families of the victims who were \nkilled, and those who are still recovering from their injuries. I would \nlike to extend my sympathies to those families and to say that our \nhearts go out to them in this difficult time.\n  Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the police forces in our \nregion, the sniper attacks were stopped before they could do more harm. \nAn unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination among the \ndifferent jurisdictions involved, as well as among the Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement agencies, led to the capture of the two \nindividuals now charged in the sniper attacks. The task force created \nduring the sniper attacks did an excellent and effective job of sharing \ninformation, working together, and putting the safety of our citizens \nfirst. I thank all of the men and women who worked so tirelessly to \napprehend the suspects and commend them for a job well done.\n  The Federal Government also played an important role in the \ninvestigation. The FBI provided support to State and local police \nforces in conducting the manhunt, the ATF helped track and research the \nguns and bullets used by the snipers, and the Department of Defense \nprovided planes to monitor the region from the air. On October 8, I \nwrote a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft stating my support for \nMontgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose's request for Federal aid \nin the investigation, and I am extremely grateful that Federal aid was \ngranted.\n  While it is impossible to thank all of those involved, I would like \nto acknowledge by name the resolve, extraordinary dedication and \nperformance of Montgomery County, Maryland Police Chief Charles Moose \nand County Executive Doug Duncan, FBI Special Agent Gary Bald, and ATF \nagent Mike Bouchard, who became the public face of the crisis and the \ninvestigation for people all across the country. Their leadership, calm \ndetermination, and obvious skill in the most trying and tragic of \ncircumstances, without precedent in our area, helped inform and assure \nthe public that everything possible was being done.\n  Now that this multistate manhunt is over, the States involved must \ndeal with the financial costs of the investigation. In order to assist \narea States in paying for these costs, I joined with Senators Mikulski, \nWarner and Allen in a letter to the Department of Justice requesting \nFederal reimbursement for the enormous costs of the investigation. I am \nconfident that these suspects will be brought to justice and that this \nmay provide some small measure of comfort for those who lost loved ones \nin these attacks.\n  The 23 days in October were a trying time for our area and the \nuncertainty of the sniper attacks unnerved residents of the region. The \nweight of this concern has been lifted, thanks to the hard work of our \narea law enforcement agencies. But for the families of those killed in \nthe attacks, their loss will never be remedied and for them the weight \nwill never be lifted.\n  We must move forward and reflect on the lessons learned from these \ntragic attacks. All jurisdictions involved, as well as the expanding \nnumber of jurisdictions in which these two suspects allegedly committed \ncrimes, must now focus on preparedness. We have learned how effective \nthe coordination of law enforcement agencies can be, and we must plan \nfor such coordination in the future. And we in Congress can take steps \nto help States improve preparedness, coordinate law enforcement \nagencies, and use tools such as ballistic fingerprinting to prevent \nthis from ever happening again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10835-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 5, 2001 \nin El Monte, CA. Three Latino men were accused of a hate crime after \nbeating an African-American teen at a party and using racial epithets. \nThe victim, who was dancing with a Latina woman at the time of the \nattack, suffered cuts to the mouth; a friend who came to his aid \nreceived abrasions to the face. One of the assailants fired a gun into \nthe air before fleeing the party.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10835-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10835-S10836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE 227TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, on November 10th, we honored the 227th \nbirthday of the U.S. Marine Corps. For more than two centuries, the \nU.S. Marine Corps has exemplified the highest virtues of commitment, \nservice, and sacrifice. From the Barbary Coast to the far reaches of \nthe Pacific, in the jungles of Vietnam and across the vast expanse of \nthe Arabian desert, America's Marines have lived up to their motto: \n``Semper Fidelis.''\n  Through the long march of our history, the U.S. Marine Corps has \nbuilt a proud tradition. The smallest of the four service branches, \nthey have typically been the ``tip of the spear'' of American military \nmight. U.S. Marines have been among the first troops dispatched to \ninternational crises over the past century. Always apace with world \ndynamics, they have expanded their expertise to encompass the entire \nspectrum of conflict from humanitarian assistance to major theater war. \nAmphibious Forces have demonstrated--in times of crisis and frequently \non very short notice--that they possess a capable and formidable \n``package'' of ships and Marines to meet the threat across the full \nspectrum of modern conflict.\n  Our Marines have protected America's interests, struggled against \nfoes that meant harm to our national security and that of our allies, \nand remained at the forefront of our Nation's efforts to maintain \nglobal peace and stability. From Lebanon to Bangladesh to Somalia, \nMarines restored and maintained order, aided people in distress, \nprovided protection for the weak, and upheld the values that have come \nto define our country on the world stage. Many also made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the service of their country, and we honor their memory.\n  America's Amphibious Forces remain the force of choice in responding \nto crises in this uncertain world. When, in the early part of this \nyear, this nation resolved to liberate Afghanistan from an oppressive \nregime and take action upon terrorist aggressors, it was again the \nUnited States Marine Corps who got the call--and responded valiantly. \nDespite Afghanistan's isolation, the first sustained U.S. military \noperation ashore was conducted by the 15th and 26th Marine \nExpeditionary Units, an expeditionary force that was deployed, \norganized and launched from the USS Peleliu and USS Bataan Amphibious \nReady Groups. These two MEU's seized and established the first in-\ncountry staging base (Rhino, nearly 400 nautical miles inland), secured \nthe Kandahar airport (another 200 miles) and established a base from \nwhich quick-reaction operations could be conducted to further track \ndown Taliban and al-Qaida forces.\n  Amphibious ships with embarked Marine forces are one of the most \nformidable power projection capabilities in the world and represent our \nNation's only sustainable forcible-entry capability. In peace and in \nwar, their value has been ever-present.\n  Always faithful, our Marines are men and women of greatness. Tough \nand dedicated, they are truly the best America has to offer. For 227 \nyears, they have stood for all that is great about this Nation. Their \nvalues, sense\n\n[[Page S10836]]\n\nof courage and steadfast character remain timeless and valuable \ncommodities for an age in which our Nation faces considerable new \nthreats.\n  Today, not unlike 227 years ago, the importance of our Marine Corps \nis immutable. The razor-sharp readiness of the U.S. Marine Corps \nreassures our friends and warns our enemies, promising swift action, \ndecisive victories and a firm adherence to tradition.\n  As our U.S. Marine Corps celebrates another anniversary of its proud \nbirth on November 10th, 1775 in Philadelphia's Tun Tavern, I stand with \nmy colleagues in the Senate in saluting all who have worn the eagle, \nglobe and anchor, and to their families who also serve by supporting \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10836-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, we convene again today after a \nnational holiday set aside to honor one of America's greatest \ntreasures, its veterans.\n  This important holiday, originally called Armistice Day, began as a \ncommemoration of the historic ending of World War I at the eleventh \nhour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918. Armistice Day \nbecame primarily a day of remembrance for those who served during World \nWar I; indeed, Americans hoped World War I would be ``the war to end \nall wars.''\n  Then, during World War II, 16 million Americans again answered the \ncall to service on behalf of our Nation. After the war ended, Americans \nsaw the need to honor all those who served in the United States Armed \nForces, during times of war and peace, and through all periods of our \nhistory. On June 1, 1954, Armistice Day became Veterans Day.\n  I know that many of my colleagues joined me yesterday in taking the \nVeterans Day holiday to celebrate the soldiers, sailors, marines and \nairmen who wore this Nation's uniform and served honorably. That is a \nstart, but we must do more.\n  As the crisis with Iraq heightens, it is especially appropriate to \nmake certain that we keep the promise of care and support made to young \nmen and women who made great sacrifices on behalf of this Nation. We \nmust remember the pledge of Abraham Lincoln, ``to care for him who \nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.'' As \nChairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have fought hard for \nimprovements in benefits and services for our Nation's veterans. We \nhave made progress in fulfilling Abraham Lincoln's pledge this year, \nbut we must never waiver in our commitment to provide our veterans with \nbenefits and services that reflect their changing needs.\n  For example, our Nation's rapidly aging veterans have a critical need \nfor long-term care. There can be no doubt that such care requires great \nresources, but it is our responsibility to answer the call to provide a \ncontinuum of quality health care for veterans, as they once answered \nthe call to preserve our freedoms.\n  I am honored to represent the State of West Virginia, which has one \nof the highest veteran populations per capita of any State. The service \nof the over 202,000 living West Virginia veterans inspires me each day \nin my role as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where I \nhave the privilege to serve not only the veterans of West Virginia, but \nthose living throughout this Nation.\n  America's 25 million living veterans deserve to be honored and \nrespected every day, and not merely on the national holiday set aside \nfor the commemoration of their service. It would be shameful if \nveterans were made to feel forgotten every day except for this one day \neach year. There should be no ambivalence toward those who have served \nour Nation in the armed forces.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, not only to remember the sacrifices \nof our veterans, but to renew our commitment to them and to keep the \npromises that we made to them in the spirit of Abraham Lincoln. The men \nand women who served this Nation deserve no less.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \nNation's devoted Veterans. It is these men and women, past and present, \nwho embody the ideals of freedom, liberty and justice, which are the \nfoundation of our great Nation.\n  Veterans Day is a time to recognize those Americans who gave what \nPresident Abraham Lincoln once called ``the last full measure of \ndevotion.'' While we reflect on the deeds of these heroes and stand \ngrateful for their service and sacrifice, we must also ponder the \nongoing actions of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  Ours is a great Nation of free people who call our finest men and \nwomen to stand guard and protect the liberty that all Americans enjoy. \nTo this end, all of those who have donned the uniform of our Armed \nForces have consciously given a piece of themselves. Whether during \npeacetime or a time of conflict; at home or abroad; in the active \ncomponent, the reserves or the national guard; their service has been \ncharacterized by selflessness and a sense of a greater purpose.\n  Throughout our history, they have answered the call. Whether that \ncall to service sent them to a distant land full of turmoil, or to the \nflight line at a base in the Midwest, they have served with dignity and \nhonor.\n  I am proud that my home State of Texas has a rich tradition of \nmilitary leadership. Our young men and women have signed up to serve \ntheir Nation and are stationed throughout the United States and in all \ncorners of the globe. More Marines join the Corps from Texas per capita \nthan any other State. And we are home to more Army and Air Force bases \nthan any State.\n  As these men and women have sacrificed, so too has a far less \nrecognized segment of our Veteran population--their spouses. For each \ndisplaced serviceman, there is often a husband or wife left behind. \nThese silent patriots have kissed their loved ones goodbye and sent \nthem off to serve this country. They diligently run their households \nwhile their mate provides security at an airport in another part of the \ncountry or serves on a foreign base halfway around the globe. They have \noften put their career on hold and patiently moved the family to the \nnext in a long series of new bases and new communities. Whatever \naccolades we bestow upon our Veterans, we must also remember the \nparallel sacrifice of their heroic spouses.\n  Today our troops are answering the call to duty in locations around \nthe world. The war on terrorism is being waged by America's finest, \nfrom Afghanistan to the Philippines. Soldiers in South Korea continue \nto keep watch on the communist regime to their North. Air Force pilots \ncontinue to patrol the skies over Iraq as the world contemplates the \nfuture of the region. Reservists and National Guardsmen continue to \nserve, at the expense of their civilian vocations, on extended active \nduty for a year or more. Some of our military patriots continue to \nserve well beyond the date they were to leave active service because \nthe Nation continues to need their expertise.\n  On this Veterans Day, we express our heartfelt gratitude to our \nNation's veterans and to their spouses. We have incurred a debt to them \nthat can never be fully repaid. Today we remember those who have gone \nbefore and honor tomorrow's veterans who serve our country today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10836-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10836-S10837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPPORTING LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE MORE BANKRUPTCY JUDGES FOR MARYLAND\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of \nlegislation to provide more bankruptcy judges for several States, \nincluding three additional bankruptcy judgeships for my own State of \nMaryland. This legislation was introduced by Senator Biden and is being \ncosponsored by Senators Carper, Edwards, Feinstein, and Schumer.\n  This bill represents a significant step forward in our efforts to \nstrengthen Maryland's Federal bankruptcy court. I have long been \ninvolved in this effort, and I commend Senator Biden for his efforts in \nthis area. We have been working for several years to get these \nadditional judgeships approved, yet no legislation has been passed that \nwould authorize them. With such inaction, the problem facing Maryland's \nsitting bankruptcy judges has grown, and Maryland has remained without \nthe additional judgeships it so desperately needs to make our \nbankruptcy system work.\n  Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges continue to show remarkable\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\ndedication given the extraordinary burdens placed upon them. However, \nadditional judgeships remain essential to the fair and timely \nadministration of the bankruptcy code for all of the businesses and \nindividuals that come before the Maryland District.\n  Since 1992, we have been requesting additional judgeships for the \nDistrict of Maryland; thus far none has been approved. In 1992, there \nwere approximately 15,000 bankruptcy filings in the District of \nMaryland. From 1998 to 2001, there were over 30,000 bankruptcy filings \nper year in Maryland. The caseload has doubled for the sitting \nbankruptcy judges in the past 10 years, and they still do their work \nwith only 4 sitting bankruptcy judges. This dire need for additional \njudgeships in Maryland has yet to be remedied by the Congress.\n  This legislation provides three additional judgeships for Maryland. \nThese three additional judgeships would help reduce the overwhelming \nworkload of the four sitting bankruptcy judges. However, a September \n2002 recommendation from the U.S. Judicial Conference calls for the \ncreation of four additional judgeships in our State. And while the \nDistrict of Maryland will be pleased to get three additional judges, \nthe recommendation of the Judicial Conference for four additional \nbankruptcy judgeships demonstrates just how critical the situation is. \nAs of June 30, 2002, the national weighted filing average for \nbankruptcy judges was 1,641. The weighted filing per judge for \nMaryland's 4 bankruptcy judges was 3,030 almost twice the national \naverage.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3074, which would \nprovide much needed help on the bankruptcy courts in Maryland and \nacross the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10837-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10837-S10839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTENT OF TAA HEALTH INSURANCE TAX CREDIT PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, as I have said on numerous occasions, I \nam extremely pleased with the health care provisions in the Trade Act \nof 2002. The advanceable, refundable 65 percent tax credit toward the \npurchase of health insurance premiums for TAA workers and PBGC retirees \nrepresents a monumental precedent. It is an important precedent for \nDemocrats because, for the first time, the federal government will \nextend assistance for health coverage to laid-off workers. And the \nprovisions are also important for Republicans and others who believe \nthat the best way to help the uninsured is through tax credits for the \npurchase of health insurance. This program is an important test case, \nif you will, to determine whether this approach is viable and workable.\n  It is the viability and workability of the tax credit that I wish to \naddress today.\n  Our negotiations on the Trade Act health credits were really a \ncontinuation of discussions that started around this time last year--\nduring the debate over economic stimulus. Democrats had proposed \nincluding a 75 percent subsidy for COBRA premiums coupled with Medicaid \nexpansions as part of our economic stimulus package. Republicans \ninitially proposed a limited block grant for health care assistance and \nlater altered their package to include individual tax credits for \nhealth insurance.\n  It goes without saying that Republicans preferred a tax credit \napproach rather than a subsidy approach, and the Democrats expressed a \nstrong preference for group-based insurance over individual insurance.\n  The resulting compromise that was reached as part of the trade deal \ntruly was a delicately-crafted bipartisan effort. Democrats moved from \na premium subsidy to a tax credit, dropped the Medicaid expansion, and \nyielded on the issue of requiring those eligible for COBRA to purchase \nonly COBRA coverage. Republicans got their tax credit, but it does not \nallow new individual market policies to be purchased with the tax \ncredit except for those who had such coverage while they were working.\n  The health insurance options available to TAA workers and PBGC \nretirees include COBRA and state-based COBRA, as well as:\n  state high risk pools;\n  state employee benefit plans--or comparable programs established by a \nstate;\n  direct purchasing arrangements between states and insurers;\n  a state-operated health plan;\n  coverage purchased through a private purchasing pool; and\n  coverage under a spouse's employer group plan.\n  In other words, eligible workers and retirees will be given a wide \nrange of health insurance choices--depending on which options their \nstate has adopted. Having a number of choices is important to \nRepublicans and will be appreciated by TAA workers and PBGC retirees as \nwell.\n  I understand that some might try to read the legislative language \nregarding these options in a way that would allow broader access to \ninsurance purchased in the individual market. That was not our \nintention. As I mentioned above, the Senate bill and conference report \nexplicitly agreed to include individual health insurance as qualified \nhealth insurance, but only for individuals who had such coverage for \none month prior to separation from employment. We did not intend to \nallow states to enter into arrangements with individual insurers \nthrough the state-based coverage options.\n  The second point I would like to make addresses the insurance \nprotection provisions--guaranteed issue, a bar against pre-existing \ncondition limitations, and premium and benefit protections. This \nlanguage was part of the Senate bill, only we applied the protections \nto all of the state pooling options.\n  The conference report required workers to have had three months of \nprevious health care coverage in order for these important protections \nto apply. The language is vague, however, and does not specify when the \nthree months of aggregate coverage had to occur. I'd like to clarify \nhere that this coverage should occur for three months prior to \nemployment separation necessary to attain eligibility for assistance \nunder this law.\n  A more narrow reading of the three-month coverage requirement would \ndisqualify those who have had lapses of coverage between the loss of \njob-based or retiree coverage and application or eligibility \ndetermination for assistance under this program. After all, the goal of \nthe health provisions was to ensure access to coverage and to prevent \nthe loss of health coverage.\n  On that same point, the language on premium protections could be read \nto allow insurers to charge different rates to individuals \nparticipating in the TAA program. That was not our intention. The \nSenate language was intended to mean that TAA workers, as a group, \nshould be charged the same premiums when states choose to enroll these \nindividuals in existing insurance arrangements--for example in state \nemployee health plans. Individual workers should not be charged higher \npremiums based on their health status in these plans.\n  And, if a State elects to create a new insurance pooling \narrangement--in which case it is not possible to compare premiums for \nTAA workers to anyone else--we had intended that States would not allow \npremium rating on an individual basis but rather as a group.\n  To make my views known to the agencies that will administer the new \ntax credit, last week I sent letters to the Treasury Department, the \nDepartment of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human services \nregarding congressional intent in the TAA health insurance tax credit.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can bring the same willingness to work \ntogether and compromise to other important health care issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters I previously referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 17, 2002.\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary O'Neill: In a few short weeks, the health \n     insurance assistance provisions of the Trade Act of 2002 will \n     take effect. The passage and enactment of the historical Act \n     was the result of a delicately-crafted bipartisan effort. I \n     was proud to play a role in this significant achievement, and \n     I will continue to work with you to ensure its successful \n     implementation and operation. To that end, I am writing to \n     ensure that the Act's critically-important health insurance \n     protections are implemented consistent with the intent and \n     the letter of the law.\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\n       As you know, for many of the supporters of the Trade Act, \n     the health assistance was the single most important factor in \n     overcoming concerns about the effects of enhanced trade \n     negotiating authority on American jobs. These provisions were \n     designed to assure American workers that the potential loss \n     of work does not equal the loss of health coverage. \n     Protecting health coverage is especially important now. We \n     recently learned that an additional 1.4 million Americans \n     became uninsured in 2001. Successful implementation of this \n     new law can make a difference in preventing additional \n     workers and their families from losing health coverage.\n       As you implement this law, there are three issues that I \n     particularly want to emphasize. First, members of the \n     Conference Committee explicitly agreed to include individual \n     health insurance as qualified health insurance, but only for \n     those qualifying individuals who had such coverage for one \n     month prior to separation from employment (see section \n     (35)(e)(1)(J)). We did not intend to allow states to enter \n     into arrangements with individual insurers through the state-\n     based coverage options, and I believe that this objective is \n     clear in the conference report. Any other interpretation of \n     the law would be a violation of the intent of its authors.\n       Second, for those without access to employer-based \n     coverage, we included strong consumer protections. To prevent \n     discriminatory premiums and substandard benefits, we linked \n     the premiums and benefits offered to qualifying individuals \n     to those of ``similarly situated individuals'' (see sections \n     (35)(e)(2)(A)(iii and iv)). In plain English, this means that \n     individuals eligible for this tax credit should neither be \n     charged premiums or offered benefits that apply only to this \n     group nor pay higher premiums based on their own health \n     status or history.\n       In addition, the law provides guaranteed issue to \n     qualifying individuals (see section (35)(e)(2)(A)(i)). \n     ``Guaranteed issue'' has the same meaning in this law that it \n     has in state regulation of insurance. Specifically, to be \n     qualified health insurance, each plan must ensure access to \n     each qualified individual who meets the other criteria for \n     this coverage. It does not mean that an issuer of health \n     insurance can accept some but not all qualifying individuals \n     so long as there is an alternative that accepts the denied \n     individuals (e.g., a high-risk pool).\n       Third, since the goal of this provision is preventing loss \n     of health coverage, the Conference Committee agreed that \n     eligible individuals must also have been previously insured \n     for three months (see section (35)(e)(3)(B)). The law does \n     not specify when this aggregate of three months of creditable \n     coverage had to occur. To clarify, we intended that this \n     coverage should occur for three months prior to employment \n     separation necessary to attain eligibility for assistance \n     under this law (e.g., termination due to trade in the case of \n     displaced workers eligible for trade adjustment assistance \n     and retirement in the case of Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation (PBGC) eligible individuals). The three-month \n     coverage requirement should not disqualify those who had or \n     have lapses of coverage between the loss of job-based or \n     retiree coverage and application or eligibility determination \n     for assistance to this program. Indeed, these individuals \n     have a special need for access to affordable health insurance \n     and should not be penalized due to delays in passing, \n     implementing, and operating this law.\n       I make these clarifications to underscore their importance \n     in successfully implementing the health provisions of the \n     Trade Act. I know that the President shares our mutual \n     commitment to make this an effective program that preserves \n     health insurance for this set of American workers and \n     retirees. I look forward toward a continued collaboration in \n     implementing, monitoring, and, if successful, expanding these \n     important health policies.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 17, 2002.\n     Elaine L.

Section 16 of H.R. 3394 would ensure that the authorized \nfunding in the bill for research purposes does not support individuals \nin violation of U.S. immigration laws.

Our intent with this \nprovision is not to create new immigration laws or grant new authority. \nRather, this provision merely makes compliance with existing \nimmigration laws a requirement for grant eligibility.

Madam President, last month our extended Senate \nfamily suffered a great loss with the passing of Frances Humphrey \nHoward. I know her brother, our former colleague from Minnesota, Hubert \nHumphrey, would appreciate this body recognizing the important role she \nplayed.\n  Frances Howard was always a trend setter. When few women went to \ncollege, she graduated with a master's degree. She worked for Eleanor \nRoosevelt. She was a foreign service officer for the State Department \nat a time when mostly men were in the foreign service. She worked for \nthe National Institutes of Health as a liaison officer, developing \nprograms for medical libraries. She sat on the board of several \ncompanies involved with the arts and social activism. And when her \ncolleagues retired at 65, Frances worked until she was 85.\n  Senator Humphrey adored his younger sister, and for good reason. He \nwould not have been the warrior he was without his chief supporter, \nchief confidant, and chief campaigner. All of the important bills \nSenator Humphrey sponsored on civil rights, on Medicare, on the Peace \nCorps, and on the Food Stamp program were influenced by her concern for \nminorities, the elderly, the sick, and the hungry. She was a great \nadvocate for laws that make a real difference in the lives of the \nneediest in this country.\n  Frances' role was behind the scenes, but today, instead of always \nquitting her good job to help Senator Humphrey in his campaigns, she'd \nhave run herself--and won. If Hubert were here we\n\n[[Page S10840]]\n\nmight be listening to all the stories, but they can be summed up in one \nsentence: During her sixty years as an activist in Washington, Frances \nHumphrey Howard truly made a difference.\n  I know all of my colleagues, and especially our spouses, will miss \nFrances. My wife, Peatsy, joins me in extending our gratitude for her \nuntiring efforts and our deepest sympathy to her children, Anne and \nWilliam, and to the entire Humphrey family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10840-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BARBARA SNELLING\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, today I congratulate and thank \nthe Honorable Barbara W. Snelling from Shelburne, VT on her lifetime of \nservice to Vermont citizens, young and old.\n  Back in Vermont, Barbara is being honored by the Vermont Chamber of \nCommerce as the 2002 Citizen of the Year. In my home state, the \nSnelling name is synonymous with public service, commitment to \ncommunity, personal integrity and leadership.\n  Barbara ran for public office in 1991, shortly after the untimely \ndeath of her husband, Gov. Richard A. Snelling. Her list of \nachievements is long: two-term Lieutenant Governor; two-term State \nSenator; president of a consulting firm for 14 years; trustee for her \nalma mater, Radcliffe College; and current member of the United States \nPeace Institute, an appointment made by former President Clinton. She \nhas also held seemingly endless titles in her community, from Girl \nScout Troop leader to United Way Board member.\n  Her life work is a testament to the meaning of public service that \nfew individuals are capable of achieving. Barbara's endless devotion \nand commitment to the people of Vermont uniquely qualifies her as a key \nadvisor to her daughter, Diane Snelling, who now serves as a Vermont \nState Senator.\n  Barbara has become a symbol of the strength in spirit and courage to \novercome adversity. In 1996, during her bid for Governor, she suffered \na cerebral hemorrhage and lapsed into a coma. Her determination and \ndrive led to a miraculous recovery.\n  In her work at the Vermont State House, Barbara used the legislative \nprocess for the benefit of all and detriment to none. Each day, Barbara \nworks tirelessly for Vermont, and for this we must all thank her. We \nowe a great deal to this courageous and determined stateswoman.\n  Congratulations, Barbara. Your leadership and grace are legendary to \nthe people of Vermont. We are all extremely proud of you and your \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10840-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, today I congratulate \nGeorge and Gertrude Lewis on the occasion of their 60th wedding \nanniversary. They have been residents of Oregon for most of their \nlives, first in Medford and now in Lake Oswego.\n  George Lewis was born May 8, 1920 in Takilma, OR. Gertrude Lewis was \nborn July 22, 1920 in Lambert, MT.\n  George and Gertrude met in the fall of 1939 when they were both \npursuing undergraduate studies at the University of Washington in \nSeattle, WA. They began dating in the spring of 1941 and were married \nNovember 11, 1942. November 11, 2002 marks their 60th wedding \nanniversary.\n  George joined the Army Air Force, and he left to join allied forces \nin Europe in February of 1943. On April 5, 1943, his plane was shot \ndown and he became a Prisoner of War until he was liberated on May 8, \n1945. He has received a Purple Heart for his service to his country.\n  George and Gertrude's first child, Diane, was born on October 13, \n1943 while George was still a POW. He didn't meet his daughter until he \nreturned from the war in 1945. They then moved to Medford, OR, where \nGeorge worked for United Airlines as a passenger agent. On April 22, \n1946, their second child Stephen was born.\n  In 1950, George and Gertrude opened their own business, Rogue Valley \nTravel, a travel agency in Medford, OR. They ran the company together \nuntil they sold it and retired in 1980. Gertrude remembers that one of \nthe best times of their lives was in 1952 when they were able to afford \ntheir first trip to New York City and Europe, where they visited London \nand Paris. Since that time, they have traveled all over the world, to \nEurope, Asia, Africa and more. George's and Gertrude's grandchildren \nwill always remember a map kept in the garage in their home in Medford \nwith pins of all the cities they had been to.\n  In 1999, George and Gertrude moved to Lake Oswego, OR, where they \nlive today.\n  Their two children, six grandchildren and two great grandchildren, \nare proud to help them celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary and \nwork to live by the great example they have set.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10840-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. STANLEY F. TODD SR.\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy friend and hero, the late Dr. Stanley E. Todd Sr. I would also like \nto extend my most heartfelt condolences to his daughter Becky Todd \nYork, his son Stanley E. Todd Jr., his twin sister Hazel Bush, and his \ngrandchildren.\n  As a World War II veteran, Dr. Todd possessed a great deal of courage \nand patriotism that deserves to be recognized and commended. He served \nas a nose gunner on a B-24 bomber, an endeavor that nearly cost him his \nlife. At one point during his time in the service, Dr. Todd's plane was \nshot down over Austria and he became a German prisoner of war.\n  Though the trials Dr. Todd endured contributed to the person he \nbecame, he did not let his harrowing experiences have an adverse affect \non his life. Instead, he learned never to take a single moment for \ngranted, a paradigm that rings true and serves as an example to all of \nus he leaves behind.\n  After completing his service in the military and marrying Esta \nNewman, Dr. Todd enrolled in the University of Louisville School of \nDentistry. He practiced dentistry in Richmond, Ky., for 33 years. Also \nin Richmond, Dr. Todd helped found the Richmond Health and \nRehabilitation Center, a facility that has provided care to residents \nsince 1968.\n  Even after retiring in 1982, Dr. Todd continued to maintain an active \nlifestyle. He served Richmond as a city commissioner and also as \nchairman of the Richmond Housing Authority. Additionally, he was a \nformer chairman of the board of the Kentucky Heart Association, and \nserved on the board of the Kentucky River Foothills Development \nCorporation. An elder of Richmond's First Christian church, Dr. Todd \nprovided missionary dental work in Haiti and helped found a local \nclothing bank. He was also instrumental in the organization of Richmond \nLittle League baseball, and the founding of Stanton Woodcraft in \nRichmond.\n  I am certain that the legacy that Dr. Stanley E. Todd Sr., left \nbehind will continue on. Indeed, he possessed a tremendous personal \nstory that serves as a testament to the strength of his spirit and his \nfaith and God. His faith, valor and strength of character should serve \nas an inspiration to us all. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in \nthe Senate, I offer my deepest condolences to Dr. Todd's friends and \nloved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed to the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky and to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10840-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10840-S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TED POSNER\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to thank Ted Posner, \nwho has worked for me for a year-and-a-half as Trade Counsel for the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Ted joined my staff in April 2001 after working for 2 years for \nCongressman Sandy Levin, who is the Ranking Democrat on the Ways and \nMeans Subcommittee on International Trade. There, Ted established \nhimself as a nuts-and-bolts expert on trade laws. He earned the respect \nnot only of his colleagues in the House and Senate, but also in the \nbusiness community, and in the environmental and labor communities.\n  Perhaps Ted's biggest achievement in the House was his work to help \npass permanent Normal Trade Relations for China. Most people are aware \nof the strong efforts of the House Democrats to forge a compromise that \nwould help pass this important legislation. But few recognize the \nbehind-the-scenes efforts of staff. Ted's work on this issue was \ntireless, and all who support trade with China owe Ted their gratitude.\n  Here in the Senate, Ted has continued his outstanding work--and \nhelped\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\nus pass the most comprehensive trade bill in more than 14 years. The \nTrade Act of 2002, as most people know, included not only Trade \nPromotion Authority and Trade Adjustment Assistance, but also an \nextension and expansion of the Andean Trade Preference Act and the \nGeneralized System of Preferences.\n  Ted worked on most of these issues, but his work on the Andean trade \nbill and the provisions in TPA dealing with investor-state dispute \nsettlement deserve particular mention. Especially on the issue of \ninvestment, Ted deserves great praise. This is a complicated and \ndivisive issue. And Ted worked with all parties to come up with ideas \nthat could win bipartisan support.\n  Like many staff on Capitol Hill, Ted is an extraordinarily hard \nworker. But the consistent thread in all of Ted's work that separates \nhim from so many is that he constantly strives for perfection. That is \nsomething that is rare, and it is something that has earned him my \ngreat respect.\n  Now Ted is moving on to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, \nwhere he will be Associate General Counsel. I have no doubt that Ted \nwill be a great litigator, and I have full confidence in his \nrepresenting the United States at the World Trade Organization.\n  I thank Ted for his efforts and wish him good luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10841-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. SISEL KLURMAN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate \nand recognize Mrs. Sisel Klurman for being honored by the Florida \nFriends of Bar-Ilan University and setting the standards for ``Women \nand Entrepreneurship: From Adversity to Achievement.''\n  Bar-Ilan, Israel's largest university, is a leading academic \ninstitution with over 30,000 students and extensive disciplines. Mrs. \nKlurman is a founder of the Rabbi Emanuel Rackman International Center \nfor Women and has been a benefactor to the University. Her affiliation \nwith Bar-Ilan University is based on the University's philosophy that \nblends its unique formula of tradition with modern technologies and \nscholarship.\n  Mrs. Klurman was raised with a true love and appreciation for her \nJewish culture and tradition by her parents and grandparents. In 1944 \nshe and her husband, Shmuel Aba, opened a way to safely smuggle \nHolocaust survivors from Poland to Chernowitz and, ultimately, to \nIsrael. During the next few years, Sisel and Sam worked intensely with \nunderground organizations fighting for the liberation of Israel and \nworking with new immigrants. Their drive and inspiration led them to \nfocus on perpetuating the importance of Jewish identity and education. \nThey began to support many causes, with broad outreach, in support of \nJewish education.\n  Today, Mrs. Klurman supports Jewish education, health and welfare \nthroughout the United States and Israel. She serves on may national \nboards, including Bar-Ilan University.\n  As a businesswomen, Mrs. Klurman is President of Ganot Corporation, a \nreal estate and development company, and president of AG Holdings, \nInc., operators of nursing and rehabilitation centers. Founded by her \nlate husband, both companies have flourished under her leadership.\n  With all of her accomplishments and achievements, Mrs. Klurman is \nmost proud of her family. Her four daughters, six grandchildren and \ntheir spouses, and five great grandchildren bring her endless pride and \njoy.\n  Mrs. Klurman has proven that adversity can embody accomplishment. Her \ndrive, commitment and leadership are a motivation to all women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10841-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING MR. OTOK BEN-HVAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to \ncommend and honor New Hampshire resident Mr. Otok Ben-Hvar for his \nachievement in serving his country and spreading the message of \npatriotism and unity in the United States and throughout the world.\n  As a retired U.S. Army, 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper, Mr. Ben-\nHvar has served as an ambassador of American goodwill for more than 25 \nyears. He has traveled throughout the world to deliver toys and \ntrinkets to poor, young children, many of whom are victims of war. \nDuring the Balkan War, Mr. Ben-Hvar spent months in Bosnia and Croatia \ndelivering toys, food, clothing and medical supplies to those in need. \nHis tireless effort, while on the front lines of battle, earned him \nstatus as the first American to receive honorary citizenship in \nCroatia. He has been nicknamed ``America's Santa to the World,'' and I \ncan think of no more appropriate title to match his kind and heroic \ndeeds.\n  Mr. Ben-Hvar has returned to embark on a mission to plant America's \nfirst National Tree. Collecting and using the native soil of every \nAmerican state, territory and commonwealth, as well as Washington, \nD.C., Mr. Ben-Hvar planted and nurtured the seed of his `American \nTree'. Since its planning in 1999. Mr. Ben-Hvar has escorted the tree, \na sugar maple, to each of the states and territories from whence its \nsoil came--a trip of 103,928 miles, taking close to three years.\n  The tree brings with it a great message of national harmony, and has \nbeen treasured by those who see it. This gesture of patriotism and \nunity from Mr. Ben-Hvar truly deserves to be honored--which is why I am \nsharing his effort with the Senate today, and asking the President to \nrespond to his request to have the tree permanently planted on the \nWhite House lawn. This tree will stand as a testament to the great \nstrength and character of our nation.\n  My home state of New Hampshire is renowned for its forested beauty. \nHowever, Mr. Ben-Hvar's tree indeed belongs to the entire United \nStates. It is my distinct honor to represent Mr. Otok Ben-Hvar in the \nUnited States Senate and to recognize him now for his tribute to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10841-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10841-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10841-5", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOTICE STATING THAT THE EMERGENCY DECLARED WITH RESPECT TO THE \nGOVERNMENT OF IRAN ON NOVEMBER 14, 1979 IS TO CONTINUE BEYOND NOVEMBER \n                            14, 2002--PM 118\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Madam President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on November 12, 2002, by the President \nof the United States: Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism, \nTreaty Document No. 107-18.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States: \n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith, the Inter-American Convention \nAgainst Terrorism, adopted at the Thirty-Second Regular Session of the \nOAS General Assembly meeting in Bridgetown, Barbados, on June 3, 2002, \nand opened for signature on that date. At that time it was signed by 30 \nof the 33 members attending the meeting, including the United States. \nIt has subsequently been signed by another two member states, leaving \nonly two states that have not yet signed. In addition, I transmit \nherewith, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State.\n  The negotiation of the inter-American Convention Against Terrorism \n(the ``Convention'') was a direct response to the terrorist attacks on \nthe United States on September 11, 2001. At that time, the OAS was \nmeeting in Lima, Peru, to adopt a Democratic Charter uniting all 34 \ndemocracies in the hemisphere. The OAS member states expressed their \nstrong commitment to assist the United States in preventing such \nincidents from occurring again anywhere in our hemisphere. Within 10 \ndays, the foreign ministers of the OAS member states, meeting in \nWashington, D.C., endorsed the idea of drafting a regional convention \nagainst terrorism. Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Mexico played \nparticularly important roles in the development and negotiation of the \nConvention.\n  The Convention will advance important United States Government \ninterests and enhance hemispheric security by improving regional \ncooperation in the fight against terrorism. The forms of enhanced \ncooperation include exchanges of information, exchanges of experience \nand training, technical cooperation, and mutual legal assistance. The \nConvention is consistent with, and builds upon previous \ncounterterrorism instruments and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373, \nwhich mandates certain measures to combat terrorism.\n  The Convention provides for regional use of a variety of legal tools \nthat have proven effective against terrorism and transnational \norganized crime in recent years. Since fighting terrorist financing has \nbeen identified as an essential part of the fight against terrorism, \nthe Convention addresses crucial financial regulatory, as well as \ncriminal law, aspects. Existing Federal authority is sufficient to \ndischarge the obligations of the United States under this Convention, \nand therefore no implementing legislation will be required.\n  In particular, the Convention mandates the establishment of financial \nintelligence units for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of \nterrorist financing information and the establishment and enhancement \nof channels of communication between law enforcement authorities for \nsecure and rapid exchange of information concerning all aspects of \nterrorist offenses; the exchange of information to improve border and \ncustoms control measures to detect and prevent movement of terrorists \nand terrorist-related materials; and technical cooperation and training \nprograms.\n  The Convention also provides measures relating to the denial of \nrefugee or asylum status. In addition, the Convention provides that \nterrorist acts may not be considered ``political'' offenses for which \nextradition or mutual legal assistance requests can be denied, and \nprovides for other mechanisms to facilitate mutual legal assistance in \ncriminal matters.\n\n[[Page S10847]]\n\n  In sum, the Convention is in the interests of the United States and \nrepresents an important step in the fight against terrorism. I \ntherefore recommend that the Senate give prompt and favorable \nconsideration to the Convention, subject to the understandings that are \ndescribed in the accompanying report of the Department of State, and \ngive its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, November 12, 2002.  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/12/senate-section/article/S10847-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID.
