At 10 a.m., the majority leader or his \ndesignee is to be recognized, and at that time there will be an effort \nto move to the conference report on terrorism. A rollcall vote is \nexpected on the motion as soon as possible. At 10:45, the Senate will \nvote on cloture on the substitute amendment to the Homeland Security \nAct.\n  There is much work to be done today, including completing the \nhomeland security legislation. The chairman of the Banking Committee is \nhere, and also the chairman of the Rules Committee, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd. They have worked long and hard on the terrorism \ninsurance legislation. The House passed that last night, and that will \nbe passed as soon as possible. We are not going to leave here until \nthat legislation is passed--whether it takes the next 10 minutes or the \nnext 10 days. Both leaders have indicated it will be passed. It is \nsomething the White House wants very badly.\n  Finally, we have things worked out. We now have a conference report. \nI don't know it if has been given to us yet. But, if not, it will be \npresented shortly.\n  I would indicate for all those who are listening that there are ways: \nFor example, someone could call for a quorum. Of course, we could call \nfor a live quorum immediately. That is going to happen.\n  We are not going to have games played with terrorism insurance any \nlonger. This legislation is supported by the President of the United \nStates and the two leaders. It passed the House, and the legislation is \ngoing to pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11162-5", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am curious, if I could get the attention \nof the distinguished majority whip, what is the plan this morning, if I \ncan inquire of how we are going to proceed?\n  Mr. REID. We, of course, in 55 minutes, are going to vote on cloture \non homeland security. Prior to that time, it would be our desire to \nmove to the very important antiterrorism legislation that has been here \nfor more than a year. We are going to do that. We would like to do it \nby unanimous consent. As the chairman knows, it is a nondebatable \nmotion to move to that matter. We are going to have a vote on that in \nthe near future. We do not know exactly when.\n  We are going to try to get a unanimous consent agreement, perhaps, to \nonly have one vote and get rid of the legislation. That would be \npreferable, rather than trying to mess around with a cloture motion on \nit because, if necessary, we will file cloture on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator talking about a conference report when he \nsays it is a nondebatable motion? Is he talking about a conference \nreport?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. What I am talking about is, we have terrorism \ninsurance legislation passed in the House last night.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that a conference report?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it is a conference report.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am taken aback by the notion that we are not going to \nbe able to go to this legislation by some unanimous consent, that we \nare going to have to invoke cloture, and all the rest of it. I do not \nquite understand where that opposition is coming from.\n  In fact, it passed the House on a voice vote without any opposition \nwhatever expressed over on the House side. And this is something that \nhas been laboriously worked over under the very effective leadership of \nmy very distinguished and able colleague from Connecticut. I was \noperating under the assumption that we would be able to go to it in \nshort order.\n  People will want to make some speeches and explanatory statements, I \nwould assume, although I don't see any need for any lengthy debate or a \nlong involvement of time in order to finally conclude this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, logic, reason, common sense has not applied to this \nlegislation. We have worked on this for more than a year, and just when \nit appears we are over the hill, some phantom objection comes and we \nare not able to do it.\n  We are now at this point, and I think that what should happen is \nthere should be a couple of hours. This is some of the most important \nlegislation that has passed this body. It is extremely important to all \nsectors of our economy. I think we should have a couple hours to \nexplain the legislation and then have a vote on it and get it out of \nhere and send it to the President's desk. I think that would be the \npreference of a vast majority of the people here.\n  But I want to make it very clear to everyone here, if we cannot do it \nin a logical, reasonable, orderly way, we are going to do whatever it \ntakes to get this legislation out of here. If we have to work tomorrow, \nSunday, Monday, this legislation will pass. And we are now in the \nprocedural perspective where alternatives to slowing this down are very \nslim.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope we are not going to work on Sunday. That is a \nreligious holiday for this Senator. We do observe religious holidays \naround here. Furthermore, I think the distinguished Democratic whip's \nmention of reason and logic and common sense should be applied to the \nhomeland security legislation as well.\n  I hope all Senators within the sound of my voice here in this Chamber \nand listening on the TV--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time controlled by the majority \nleader has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute.\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope that all Senators within the sound of my voice will \nvote no on cloture today. Here is a 484-page bill that we have not seen \nuntil the wee hours of the morning on Wednesday, the day before \nyesterday. And the Senators are being asked to invoke cloture on this \nmeasure when we do not know everything about it. What is in it? We are \nentitled to have some time to study this bill. We owe it to \nour constituents.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield, if I may have an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, could the Senator have an additional 10 \nminutes so we could discuss this?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just wondered, has the Senator noticed that the \nnewspapers are filled now with stories about provisions that are in \nthis legislation that have appeared, in a sense, out of nowhere? All of \na sudden they have manifested themselves in this legislation, \nprovisions that were not in this bill before, dealing with unrelated, \nextraneous matters.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, exactly, one of which happens to appear to target a \nfacility for a district represented by a Member of the House from \nTexas. We do not know what that facility is, but it has been slipped \ninto this measure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the distinguished Senator, I was not even \naware of that one. That one has not yet risen to the level of being \ncovered in these newspaper stories.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think that is where I got a glimmer of it, somewhere in a \nnewspaper story.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I missed that. But that is just another example of what \nmay well be stacked away--it is not as though this is simply or \nstraightforwardly a revision or an alteration of provisions directly \nrelated to homeland security which we have been dealing with here, and \nso there have been some changes or modifications.\n  As I understand it, it is becoming increasingly evident that there \nare a number of provisions in here that have nothing to do with \nhomeland security. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly. And I am very much alarmed by it. I spent 3 hours \nyesterday talking about some of these provisions. And, of course, there \nis a provision in here to reward the pharmaceutical companies. That is \npork for pharmaceutical companies. That just came to light. That did \nnot go through any committee. That had no hearings, no testimony of \nwitnesses--just slipped into the bill in the wee hours of the morning \nof Wednesday. It is alarming.\n  Here we are about to pass this massive bill without our knowing its \ncontents. It has never seen a day or an hour of hearings in any \ncommittee, and it is just put together by somebody in the shades of \ndarkness. And then, here it is, dropped on our desks yesterday morning.\n  We are supposed to pass this. It provides for a massive shift of \npower to the executive branch, a massive shift, and Congress will be \nleft out of the loop. I think we ought to at least have a few more days \nto study this bill, have our staffs able to study it, and advise us as \nto what is in it. That is all I am asking.\n  I do not doubt cloture will be invoked at some point, but it should \nnot be invoked today. We ought to at least have until sometime next \nweek to further study this before cloture clamps its beartrap on us.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator raises a very important point. It \nwould at least then give us the weekend to go through the provisions of \nthis proposal.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for \nhis observations.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from West \nVirginia will yield further for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be glad to, if I may do so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator from West Virginia \ncontinues to have time--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to make an inquiry similar to the inquiry \nmade by my colleague from Maryland.\n  There is an article in this morning's newspaper which contains some \ninformation which is very surprising to me, which was referenced \nbriefly yesterday on the Senate floor, relative to the homeland \nsecurity bill. This homeland security bill has a provision in it which \nsays:\n\n       Riding along on legislation to create a new federal \n     Department of Homeland Security is a White House-backed \n     provision that could head off dozens of potential lawsuits \n     against . . . pharmaceutical [companies].\n  It goes on to further explain what this is. It says: Richard Diamond, \na spokesperson for the retiring majority leader in the other body, \nRichard Armey:\n\n       . . . said the provision was inserted because ``it was \n     something the White House wanted. It wasn't [Armey's] idea.''\n\n  This is a circumstance where a homeland security bill contains a \nprovision dealing with protection for pharmaceutical companies. The \npharmaceutical companies, according to a Wall Street Journal article, \nspent $16 million.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much?\n  Mr. DORGAN. They spent $16 million in the recent election. Much of it \nwent through organizations such as Seniors United and others set up to \nmove this money out under the guise of an organization called Seniors \nUnited in order to defeat Democratic lawmakers and support Republican \nlawmakers.\n  The point is, this provision now is slipped into a homeland security \nbill. It has nothing to do with homeland security. Yet it is a \nprovision that likely will be very beneficial to the pharmaceutical \nindustry that spent $16 million in the last election.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is a blatant payoff to the pharmaceutical companies in \nreturn for their massive contributions to candidates during the \nelection. That is a massive payoff.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I may inquire further, has the Senator from West \nVirginia or have other Senators heard from the President or the White \nHouse by what justification would they insert--again, the White House \napparently wanted it; that is what the majority leader of the House \nsays--a special provision benefiting one industry in something called \nhomeland security. Has anyone heard an explanation of that?\n  Mr. BYRD. That was very revealing what the majority leader's staff \nperson from the other body had to say, pointing the finger at the White \nHouse. That was very revealing. I hope we have more time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CARPER). There are 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This morning the Baltimore Sun has an editorial--they \nentitled it ``Homeland Insecurity''--discussing this legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. And rightfully so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One paragraph follows right along with what the able \nSenator from North Dakota was bringing to our attention. I want to \nquote it:\n\n       Most alarming is that the version of the legislation passed \n     by the House on Wednesday--with the Senate apparently soon to \n     follow--is a 500-page, 11th hour rewrite few lawmakers have \n     read and perhaps none fully understands.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Well stated.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Continuing:\n\n       New snakes slither out daily, but doubtless many will \n     remain hidden until long after the measure is enacted into \n     law.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Well stated. Well stated. I hope Senators will take notice \nof that editorial. I hope the Senator will put that in the Record.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the \neditorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Sun, Nov. 15, 2002]\n\n                          Homeland Insecurity\n\n       ONE LAMENTABLE result of this month's elections is that the \n     stalemate has been broken over the creation of a monstrous \n     Department of Homeland Security. This cosmetic\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\n     response to the myriad failures that made the nation \n     vulnerable on Sept. 11, 2001, offers no assurance that \n     Americans will be safer. Instead, it poses new dangers.\n       Most alarming is that the version of the legislation passed \n     by the House on Wednesday--with the Senate apparently soon to \n     follow--is a 500-page, 11th-hour rewrite few lawmakers have \n     read and perhaps none fully understands. New snakes slither \n     out daily, but doubtless many will remain hidden until long \n     after the measure is enacted into law.\n       How can a bill that purports to protect the homeland be so \n     scary? Let us count some ways:\n       First, the basic concept is flawed. Combining 22 separate \n     departments and agencies with nearly 200,000 employees into \n     one super agency is a recipe for bureaucratic chaos that will \n     distract workers from their security duties rather than \n     sharpen their focus. New bosses, new locations, new personnel \n     rules, new rivalries, new turf battles. These are the issues \n     that will most concern workers in the years just ahead. How \n     helpful is that?\n       The recent squabble between the FBI and the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, neither of which is to be \n     included in the new department, demonstrates there is little \n     chance that blending separate agencies to eliminate overlap \n     and clarify control can be anything but a bloody task.\n       This proposal came originally from Democrats and was \n     opposed by President Bush. But the pressure on Congress to \n     take some action that promised Americans greater security was \n     so great that Mr. Bush decided to board the train before it \n     ran over him.\n       Second, the White House refused to accept a Senate \n     provision that would have created an independent commission \n     to investigate government failures that preceded the Sept. 11 \n     attacks, squelching what looked like the best chance of \n     authorizing such an inquiry. Unless another opportunity \n     emerges soon, there may never be a detailed look at what went \n     wrong and why.\n       Third, union rights and other worker protections will be \n     stripped from the employees of the new department because the \n     president says he needs new flexibility to hire, fire and \n     move people around. No convincing national security rationale \n     has been offered to justify this broad power grab.\n       Fourth, citizen access to information about risks or \n     threats related to critical infrastructure is sharply curbed, \n     and criminal penalties will be imposed on workers who violate \n     these strictures. This is a sweeping and unjustified \n     infringement on press freedoms.\n       Fifth, the Defense Department is working on a plan to \n     collect financial and other personal information on all \n     Americans in the name of homeland security. The new \n     legislation doesn't permit this outrageous privacy \n     violation--but it doesn't prohibit it, either.\n       There's more, but critics are cowed.\n       Mr. Bush snatched the homeland security issue from Senate \n     Democrats, then clubbed them with it in a campaign that \n     challenged their patriotism. A cynical play that matches this \n     bill.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator can't do that. I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Oh, you have the floor. Sorry about that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nAs the distinguished Senator knows, we were on the floor last evening \ntalking about this very subject related to the pharmaceutical industry \nand the fact that there is a provision in this bill that has been \nslipped in, more for the financial security of Eli Lilly and the \npharmaceutical industry than homeland security. In fact, it jeopardizes \nthe rights of families who are now in court as a result of an additive \nto a vaccine for infants that contains mercury, where the concern is \nthat it may, in fact, lead to autism. That is yet to be determined, but \nthere are serious issues of health.\n  What we now have in this homeland security bill is an effort to \neliminate any responsibility from the Eli Lilly company for the \npossibility that a product of theirs may, in fact, lead to an extremely \nharmful health problem for children, autism. I find it outrageous that \nin the middle of trying to deal with homeland security and legitimate \nissues for the American people that we would find it is, in fact, the \nWhite House slipping into this bill an effort to protect people who \nwere clearly one of their biggest backers in the last campaign. It is \nclear that when the pharmaceutical industry put up millions of dollars \nto support the efforts finished on election day, they already are \nreceiving rewards as a result of what they did in the election.\n  The American people do not deserve this kind of approach. I \nappreciate the Senator bringing it to our attention again. I know there \nis an amendment to strike these items which I strongly support. I think \nit is absolutely outrageous that, while we are trying to do something \nserious for the American people, we would see this kind of help put \ninto this bill for an industry that is already heavily subsidized by \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator have \n10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest for 10 additional minutes for the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I didn't hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senator from West Virginia be recognized for an \nadditional 10 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me compliment the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nfor her correct, characteristic, acute perception of what is in this \nbill. She spoke about this very item on yesterday. I wonder how many \nSenators were listening. She is speaking again today, quite \nappropriately, calling it to the attention of the Senate and the \nAmerican people. I thank her.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding to me. Isn't it interesting, in the eleventh hour, the closing \nhours of the session, when the country is at war and a bill that is \nperceived to be vital to the defense interests of this country--\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.--that there would be suddenly inserted or \ndeleted--\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.--for example, the provision that was deleted \nthat passed unanimously in the Senate that we would have a bipartisan \ncommission to understand the ramifications of September 11? That was in \nour version of the bill. And because the White House objected to that, \neven though an overwhelming vote had taken place in the House of \nRepresentatives, it was deleted. And because there was such an outcry, \nthe morning's news says they are going to try to resurrect some \nbipartisan commission.\n  But it shows the legislative sleight of hand in the rush to \nadjournment that would now delete a provision so important to the \nsecurity of this country, such as a bipartisan commission to find out \nwhat went wrong in the intelligence apparatus that led to September 11 \nand at the same time would insert provisions into this bill that would \ncreate all kinds of havoc, as enumerated by the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Michigan.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for his observations and for his contribution and for his \nservice to his country, his service here in the Senate.\n  Liberty, freedom, justice, and right cry out today to be heard here \non the Senate floor. I urge Senators not to vote later today for \ncloture. Let's see what else is in this bill. Let us have time to amend \nit, to correct the errors that may be in it, on behalf of the American \npeople. I ask that we not vote for cloture today.\n  I suppose my pleadings, my importunings will fall upon deaf ears in \nmany areas of the Senate Chamber, but please, let our constituents be \nheard on this bill which comes to us in the name of homeland security \nbut within it has many injustices, many wrongs, I am sure, many things, \nmany provisions the American people do not want.\n\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has done a tremendous service to our Nation by pointing out, \nover the last several hours while we have been in session, some of the \nflaws in this 484-page bill, which many of us have been trying to \nstudy.\n  One of those flaws--and I would love to hear the Senator's comments--\nis with regard to freedom of information and the provision of that \ninformation\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\nto the American people, and to the people in Congress who are \nresponsible for oversight of this new Department. Is it not true that \nin this new Department there have been given broad waivers of \nopportunity for the administration--any administration--to pick outside \nadvisory committees to come in and give advice, to make specific policy \nrecommendations with regard to the direction of the country--not unlike \nwhat we saw with regard to our energy policy--and then not have any of \nthat information made available to the public, where it can be \nchallenged in situations where there is a serious concern about \nconflicts of interest and about how people might approach these issues.\n  I think, if I have read this right, there is an almost blanket \nability for the administration--any agency, and not necessarily \nRepublican or Democrat--to completely keep from Congress, keep from the \nState, keep from others the ability to understand what is taking place \nwithin the policymaking arrangements of this new Department.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for what \nhe has just called to the attention of the Senate. What he has made \nreference to, I have every reason to believe, is section 871 dealing \nwith advisory committees. Let me read it. I will have more to stay \nabout this. As a matter of fact, I will have an amendment to change \nthis. It is section 871:\n  Advisory Committees.\n\n       (A) In General.--The Secretary may establish, appoint \n     members of, and use the service of, advisory committees, as \n     the Secretary may deem necessary. An advisory committee \n     established under this section may be exempted by the \n     Secretary from Public Law 92-463, but the Secretary shall \n     publish notice in the Federal Register announcing the \n     establishment of such a committee and identifying its purpose \n     and membership. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, \n     members of an advisory committee that is exempted by the \n     Secretary under the preceding sentence who are special \n     Government employees (as that term is defined in section 202 \n     of title 18, United States Code) shall be eligible for \n     certifications under subsection (b)(3) of section 208 of \n     Title 18, United States Code, for official actions taken as a \n     member of such advisory committee.\n\n  A separate reading of this language does not stir one's blood, but a \nclear understanding of the laws that are referenced begin to stir one's \nblood.\n  Under current law, advisory committees may be appointed and the \nPresident may exempt a committee on a case-by-case basis. The public \nhas a right to know what these advisory committees are doing. The \npublic has a right to know what is happening. They have a right to know \nwhat is going on in Government, in these advisory committees.\n  But here is a provision that will give the Secretary blank authority \nto keep from the public the knowledge of what these advisory committees \nare saying, as to what's going on, and so on.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield for one more quick question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Am I not correct this was neither in the original \nLieberman proposal that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nnor was it in the compromise proposals that were on the floor before we \nwent into recess? This is another one of these midnight strikes, \nadditions, that is completely outside of any of the review process that \nwe normally have, is that right?\n  Mr. BYRD. To the best of my knowledge, it is. My staff, upon a \ncursory examination of this bill, informs me this is something that is \nnew. So the President and the Secretary will be given blanket \nauthority. Whereas, at the present time, under the Advisory Committee \nAct--I believe that is what it is called, and it is referenced in this \nlanguage--one has to see what is being said behind the lines here. But \nnow the Secretary would have blanket authority to shut out the press. \nThe press ought to be aware of what is in this bill, and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is calling the attention of the Senate and the world--\nmay we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take advantage of these few \nseconds to thank the very able Senator from West Virginia for raising \nthese extremely important questions about this legislation. This \neditorial I made reference to that was in the Baltimore Sun talked \nabout all these other provisions that were coming in, and it went on to \ntalk about the basic concept of this bill itself--something the Senator \nhas been addressing for days on the floor of the Senate. Listen to \nthis. They are talking about the homeland security bill:\n\n       First, the basic concept is flawed. Combining 22 separate \n     departments and agencies with nearly 200,000--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will quote this:\n\n       First, the basic concept is flawed. Combining 22 separate \n     departments and agencies with nearly 200,000 employees into \n     one super agency is a recipe for bureaucratic chaos that will \n     distract workers from their security duties, rather than \n     sharpen their focus. New bosses, new locations, new personnel \n     rules, new rivalries, new turf battles--these are the issues \n     that will most concern workers in the years just ahead. How \n     helpful is that? The recent squabble between the FBI and the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, neither of which is \n     to be included in the new Department, demonstrates there is \n     little chance of blending separate agencies to eliminate \n     overlapping, and clarifying control can be anything but a \n     bloody task.\n\n  Then they go on to say:\n\n       Union rights and other worker protections will be stripped \n     from the employees of the new Department because the \n     President says he needs new flexibility to hire, fire, and \n     move people around. No convincing national security rationale \n     has been offered to justify this broad power grab.\n\n  The problems inherent in this legislation, I have come to the \nconclusion, will divert focus, energy, and attention from the \nsubstantive challenge of providing homeland security to this kind of a \nprocedural fight.\n  They are going to have to get a new location, new organization. They \nare going to be spending all their time on getting the boxes on the \nchart instead of focusing on the substance of the job that confronts \nthem.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is one of the basic points the Senator has been \nmaking consistently, as I understand it.\n  Mr. BYRD. How telling, how telling, how revealing what the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland just said in this excellent \neditorial in the Baltimore Sun. I thank him for that.\n  Senators need to wake up. Senators need to wake up as to what is \ngoing on.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to take more time than I have because \nI know the leaders want to speak. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and ten seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the distinguished Senator from Maryland have anything \nfurther to say?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry? The majority leader \nis in the Chamber and will take just a few seconds to offer a unanimous \nconsent request. Can that happen? Then this dialog can take place for a \nlong time after that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield to the majority leader. I hope I retain my 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia retain the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia retains the \nremainder of his time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, after I have propounded this unanimous \nconsent request.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Agreement--H. R. 3210\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\nupon passage of H.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill, the Senate \nproceed to the terrorism insurance conference report to accompany H.R. \n3210; that the Senate then vote immediately on cloture on the \nconference report; that if cloture is invoked, the Senate then \nimmediately, without any intervening action or debate, vote on passage \nof the conference report; that if cloture is not invoked, the \nconference report continue to be debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not fully understand this request. I want to know what \nthis does to homeland security.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can respond to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, this has no effect at all on the debate on \nhomeland defense. All Senators are protected with regard to their \nrights under cloture, if cloture is invoked on homeland security. This \nonly deals with the next issue, the terrorism insurance bill, to be \ntaken up once homeland defense has been completed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, further reserving my right to object, and I \nwill be very brief, I am supportive of the measure the distinguished \nmajority leader is seeking to advance in connection with this request. \nDoes this in any way have a psychological effect with respect to the \ncloture we are going to vote on this morning?\n  I plead to Senators--further reserving my right to object--I plead \nwith Senators not to invoke cloture today. I understand cloture will be \ninvoked at some point. I just hope it will not be today. I hope we will \nhave the weekend for our staffs to study this bill so that we will be \nbetter prepared after we have had more time to study it.\n  What I am concerned about is the desire to get to the bill about \nwhich the majority leader is speaking and which I fully support. I hope \nthat desire will not have some psychological impact on Senators causing \nthem to vote for cloture today.\n  I wonder if our two leaders would propose a unanimous consent request \nthat would vitiate a cloture vote for today, push the cloture vote over \nuntil Monday. I know cloture is going to be invoked, but for God's \nsake, for Heaven's sake, for the sake of liberty and justice, and for \nthe sake of Senators being able to understand what they are voting on \nin this 484-page bill that has been sprung on us--and we have only been \nable to see it at the beginning of Wednesday, the day before \nyesterday--would the leaders please consider at least vitiating that \nvote and putting it over until Monday so that we and our staffs will \nhave some more time for study?\n  For Heaven's sake, would the majority leader and minority leader \nconsider this request? That is all I am asking.\n  I know cloture is going to be invoked at some point, but for Heaven's \nsake, we have a right to know what is in this 484-page bill, and the \npeople out there who are watching this debate through those electronic \nlenses have a right also to know. We have a duty to know what we are \nvoting on. At this moment, as we get ready to invoke cloture, we do not \nknow what is in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank all of my colleagues. I thank in particular the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.

If cloture is invoked, not only nongermane but even \nrelevant amendments would be precluded from being offered.\n  My parliamentary inquiry is this: How many of the amendments which \nhave been filed and reviewed by the Parliamentarian would fall as being \nnongermane?\n  Mr. BYRD. What bill is the Senator referencing?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will attempt to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The list I have, they all appear, most appear to be \nrelevant amendments, but because of the technical rules, many of these \nwould not be allowed apparently; many would be not allowed if they are \nnot strictly germane. How many of these amendments are nongermane in \nthe eyes of the Parliamentarian?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises the Chair that of \nthe list of approximately 40 amendments, preliminary analysis indicates \n10 are not germane and roughly 30 are either germane or are clearly \nrelevant.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Chair repeat the response?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Ten of these amendments could not be offered after the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Would the Chair please repeat the response that was given \nto the Senator from Michigan so we can hear it? I did not hear the \nresponse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Of the list of approximately 40 amendments, \npreliminary analysis indicates 10 are not germane. Approximately 30 are \neither germane or are arguably germane.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, we have drifted into a debate which I think \nwe should be engaged in now, and that is a debate on whether we should \nvote for cloture on the pending amendment and, therefore, cloture to \nproceed with homeland security.\n  At this late hour, I do not think anybody is going to be convinced in \nterms of whether this is a good thing or a bad thing as it is written. \nI think people have pretty well reached that decision. I simply would \nlike to make a couple of points that I think are important in making \nthe decision.\n  I begin by saying I do not think anybody set out with a goal of \nhomeland security becoming an issue that sort of divided us along party \nlines. I do not think anybody had that intention, but the net result is \nit happened. We now are at a point where we have one last opportunity \nto do this bill.\n  I make two arguments for doing it that I think are strong, and I make \nthem not to the people who are for it--they are already convinced and I \nhope they will not listen because I do not want to change their mind. I \nwant to make my argument to the people who are on the other side of the \nissue.\n  The first argument is that we have had an election. It is very easy \nin elections to read into them what you want\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\nto read into them. Elections are sort of like the Bible in the sense \nthat everybody finds something in them that they want to find and they \nneglect the things they do not want to see. I do think one of the \nthemes of the election was a desperate desire of the American people to \nsee a homeland security bill passed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Whether it was this one or another one, I think that is \nopen to interpretation, but I think they wanted to see it passed.\n  I certainly will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Just one quick observation. I hope the Senator will delete \nfrom his remarks which will appear in the Record any reference to the \nHoly Bible in the context that he was speaking. I do not think that has \nany place in this argument. I say that lovingly and fondly.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, I appreciate that. Let me remove ``the Bible'' and \nput ``teaching'' or ``holy script.''\n  What we tend to do with revered documents--whether it is the \nConstitution, the Koran, or some other holy teaching--is we take from \nit what we like and we tend to leave out what we do not like, and that \nwas the point I was making. I thank my colleague for making the point.\n  The point I want to make beyond that is, I do believe an objective \nreading of the election shows a desire, an almost desperation of the \nAmerican people, to see action taken on a homeland security bill, \nthough I am not claiming necessarily this bill.\n  The second argument I hope opponents of the bill will listen to is, \nthis bill does represent a compromise. The President would have not \nbeen subject to much criticism if, after the election, he had said: \nLook, I have already compromised too much on this issue. Given the \nresults of the election and the mandate, I am going to get exactly what \nI want, and so as a result I am going to stop negotiating. We are going \nto go home, come back in January, and do it exactly my way.\n  He could have done that, and I do not think people could have been \ncritical of him. But the President did not do that. Even though he \nperceived, and many others perceived, that he got a mandate in the \nelection on this issue, he came back and compromised again. He \ncompromised again by not giving public employee labor unions the \nability to veto a homeland security reorganization, but by \nstrengthening their ability to have input into it. That represented an \nadditional compromise.\n  The bill before us is not a bill that all of our colleagues support. \nI know our dear colleague from West Virginia is very sincere in his \nopposition, but I say this: The first major issue that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia raised, in opposition to the \noriginal bill, was that it interfered with Congress's power of the \npurse by giving the President power--and the Senator and others argued \narbitrary power--to rewrite appropriation bills.\n\n  I argue to our colleagues that whether they support or oppose this \nbill, that concern was responded to, and the bill before us sets an \namount that the President has flexibility in, but it gives him no \npower, without reprogramming--which means the approval of the chairman \nand the ranking member--to move money around.\n  I simply say to my colleagues this is a compromise, even though it \nmay not be one that the Senator finds supportable. But I ask the \nfollowing question: Does the Senator believe the bill that will be \nadopted in the new Congress will be closer to what he wants than this \nbill is? Does he have a guarantee that in the new Congress the concerns \nthat were dealt with here will be dealt with?\n  I guess really what I am saying--and not doing a very effective job \nin saying it--is the following: I ask my colleagues who oppose the bill \nto look at it in its totality, to look at the compromises that are in \nit, protecting our right to the purse, giving public employees an \nopportunity to have an input but not a veto. We all know the bill is \ngoing to pass now or it is going to pass later, and so will the bill \npassed in the new Congress be more to the liking of my colleagues who \nwould vote no today than this bill? The answer is probably no.\n  Finally, the one thing we all agree on is, in creating this new \ndepartment - whether it is a good idea or a bad one--if we do not do it \nnow and do it 3 months later, we have lost the 3 months. So the bill we \nwould do in 3 months might very well be less to the liking of the \npeople who oppose it and we will be doing it 3 months later.\n  I think if I were on the other side, what I would probably conclude \nis I am not for the bill and I am going to vote against it, but doing \nit in the new Congress with the makeup of the new Congress will \nprobably produce a bill that I like less and that the victories that \nhave been won in it--and there have been some; this is a compromise--\nwould be lost, could be changed, and waiting 3 months to get a bill \nthat might be worse from my point of view is not a good decision.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is absolutely right in what he says with \nreference to the appropriations process. That was a major weakness of \nthe original bill, and the Senator from Texas knows that. He had a lot \nto do with a compromise that developed with respect to the \nappropriations process--he and Senator Stevens, above all, on that side \nof the aisle. That part has been vastly improved. So I have not had \nmuch to say in my expressions of opposition to the way we are \nproceeding. I have had little to say except to compliment Senator \nStevens, and I will compliment the distinguished Senator from Texas \nbecause he has privately told me upon occasion that that was almost an \nunassailable position I was taking with reference to that \nappropriations process within the constitutional system.\n  This measure has gone a long way. It has not gone all the way, but it \nhas gone a long way. I have had very little to say about that.\n  Finally, let me say, would we have a better bill 3 months later?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 4 minutes if the \nSenator is going to speak. I want to conclude with one remark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with reference to the question, will the \nbill be better 3 months from now? I say there is an excellent chance \nthe bill would be better, that the failings of this compromise as \nbrought to light by the press and by Members, through the help of their \nstaffs, the things that they are complaining about in this bill, yes, \nwe would have time to remove those after debate and we would come out \nwith a better bill. I think always that more debate results in a better \nend product.\n  As far as I am concerned, the answer is, yes, 3 months from now we \ncould have a better bill. We would have more time. Our staff would have \nmore time. The press would have more time. I am just pleading for us \nnot to invoke cloture today so we can have at least the weekend to look \nat this bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield, but I do want to make sure I \nhave 3 minutes at the end to sum up and we are 5 minutes from the vote.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One of the things we could do if we had more time is \nget the special interest provisions out of this bill. As I understand \nit, and with appropriate respect to the Senator from Texas, those \nprovisions were never in the alternatives being offered in the Senate \nas we considered homeland security.\n  In fact, I may or may not agree with your provisions on homeland \nsecurity and think it should be done differently, but at least it was \nhomeland security. Now we discover and are discovering every moment \nthere are other special interest provisions that are in this \nlegislation. I argue we should not invoke cloture, if for no other \nreason than in order to address those special interest provisions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me address that and get back to the \nSenator's point, which is the relevant point.\n  First of all, this bill results from three things: One is the old \nGramm-Miller substitute with which we are all familiar and we debated \nfor 6 weeks. It also includes compromises that were reached with three \nDemocrat Members to try to increase input that public employees have in \nthe process. I am first\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\nto say it does not give them veto power, but it gives them a greater \ndegree to be heard. The third thing it entails is a compromise with the \nHouse. We had to meet with Members of the House to try to bring the two \nbills together, given we are at the end of the session, so they could \npass the bill in the House and we could pass it in the Senate.\n  Are there special interest provisions in the bill? There are. But \ndoes anyone believe we would go to conference in February or March and \nnot have special interest provisions in the bill? I am proud that my \ncolleague has noted I didn't have any in the substitute we offered.\n  I say the following in addressing the important point of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and then I will conclude. I believe this is a good \namendment. I believe it is a result of 6 weeks of work. It is a \ncompromise that has been made, and then an additional compromise has \nbeen made on top of that. I believe from my point of view we might get \na better bill in February, but I don't believe from the point of view \nof the opponents of this bill they would get a better bill. And to the \nextent we got greater support, we would get a bill that is not as good.\n  Secondly, I remind my dear colleague from West Virginia that when \nBenjamin Franklin read the Constitution, he asked himself: Is this the \nbest product that we are going to get? As he knows, better than I, \nthere were things in it he was doubtful of. I am not comparing this 484 \npages to what, in a secular sense, is a document that is pretty holy to \nme and the Senator from West Virginia, and that is the Constitution.\n  But the point is relevant. This is a compromise. Even the Senator \nsaid his biggest concern has been dealt with. I say to critics, the \nfact that is the case says something about the fact that there was a \ngenuine effort to compromise. I am not asking my colleagues that have \ntaken a hard position to vote yes. I know that will not happen. I know \nI will not convince the Senator from West Virginia, but I hope I will \nconvince him of two things.\n  The first is the most important one, and that is this bill is not all \nbad and there are some good things in the bill and there has been some \nlegitimate effort to compromise. Second, when we do get cloture, we are \nat a point where we need to go ahead and act and adopt the bill.\n  I thank my colleague for the debate. Probably the Senator from West \nVirginia has had more impact in changing this bill than anyone else \nbecause of the strength of his arguments. I simply say, it is a long \nway from what he would like. I have voted on many bills here in my 18 \nyears in the Senate, and they were a long way from what I liked. But \nyou ultimately come down to, especially in these circumstances, the \nfollowing questions: Is it going to get any better? Might it get worse? \nIs it worth waiting 3 months to find out?\n\n  My conclusion, and it is one I feel very strongly about, is that I \nbelieve it is a good bill. I don't believe it would get better with \ntime, especially from the point of view of people who are concerned \nabout workers' rights. And finally, waiting 3 months does not serve \nanybody's interests.\n  Thomas Jefferson said good men with the same opinion are prone to \ndisagree.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  How much time does the Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and nineteen seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope he has 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I give the 2 minutes to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with reference to Benjamin Franklin, when \nthe Constitutional Convention ended we are told a lady approached \nBenjamin Franklin with the question: Dr. Franklin, what have you given \nus?\n  His response: A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.\n  That is what is wrong with this bill. That is the problem. The third \nleg of the trilogy of reasons we have this compromise, which was \nrelated to us by the distinguished Senator from Texas, is that third \nleg, that compromise that he spoke of, which was entered into with the \nHouse so that the House could pass this measure over there virtually \nwithout debate, that is the leg I think we could improve with an \nadditional 3 months. That is the leg which has the major flaw. That is \nthe leg which has the dagger pointed to the heart of the Republic, \nwhich we all love. It is that leg which I think another month or 2 \nmonths or 3 months would vastly improve, I say with all due respect.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have the time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, I think it is clear, I understand \nhis point on the homeland security provisions about now or next year. \nBut it seems to me clear that next year you will not have these special \ninterest provisions that are in this legislation. They were not in your \nlegislation. They have been put in here by the House. Some of them are \nabsolutely outrageous.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say when Senator Miller and I wrote the substitute, \nit is true we did not have any special interest provisions in it. It is \ntrue that there are a few special interest provisions in this bill. But \nI would have to say--without getting into an argument with anybody on \nwhat may be my last words in the Senate--that more often than not when \nyou are negotiating between the two bodies, you end up with some \nprovisions, (a) you don't like, and (b) that have are promoted by some \nspecial interest. I would have to say--and I am sure my colleagues will \nremember me going through bills at midnight looking at proposed \namendments that were going to be accepted--seldom have I seen a bill \nthat had none of those. I am not going to be here in future years, so I \nguess I will read about it in the paper. But if we do not invoke \ncloture, I would be willing to bet good money, and I hope to have it to \nbet at that time, that there will be more special interest provisions \nin it 4 months from now than there are right now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all time is expired on this; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. I advise all Senators, we heard a lot of debate this \nmorning. There will be immediately an up-or-down vote on cloture on the \nGramm-Miller substitute amendment to the Homeland Security Act. On our \nside this is opposed by Senator Byrd. It is my understanding that \nSenator Lieberman will vote in favor of the cloture motion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to inquire of the Senator from \nTexas where this negotiation took place?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom----\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know the Senator objects.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of the \nquorum be terminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, reserving the--I can't reserve the right to object. I \nobject until we get a clear understanding that the Senator from North \nDakota can have 1 minute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senator from North Dakota be recognized for \n1 minute and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, be recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And the vote occur immediately thereafter.\n  Mr. REID. The vote to occur immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I merely wish to inquire of the Senator from Texas: He \nindicated in the process of completing legislation, sometimes at \nmidnight there is a negotiation that goes on and things happen. I am \nwondering if the Senator from Texas can tell us where the negotiation \noccurred that put in the homeland security bill the special piece for \nthe pharmaceutical industry\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\nthat shows up now, today, that says there will be special liability \nprotections for the pharmaceutical industry. And the majority leader of \nthe House, Mr. Armey, says: Well, I put it in, but it wasn't my idea; \nit was the White House.\n  I am asking, was there a negotiation someplace, sometime, between \nsome people, of which I am unaware? Because I have heard of no such \nnegotiation by which that provision should have ended up in this bill.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Texas where this negotiation occurred. \nWho was involved in it? Who made the decision that a special protection \nfor the pharmaceutical industry that just spent $16 million in the last \nelection ought to be stuck in this bill? Who was involved in it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The Senator from Texas \nhas 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am glad the Senator picked one with which I am totally \nfamiliar.\n  In the Senate bill, we had a provision where the Federal Government \nindemnified those manufacturers that produced items to be used in the \nwar on terrorism whereby the taxpayer would pay liability that arose \nfrom it.\n  I was never much for that provision, but I was desperately trying to \nget the votes to prevail, and so I took that provision.\n  The House had a provision that limited liability, similar to what we \ndid in World War II and what we have done in most major conflicts. When \nyou produce an item for defense purposes, there is a limited liability. \nIt seemed to me that, rather than the taxpayer bearing the burden, \nforcing these cases into Federal court and limiting liability was a \npreferable choice.\n  That is where the negotiation came from. This was not a provision out \nof the clear blue sky. We had a provision, they had a provision, and we \ntook less liability protection than they had. This is a good provision \nof the bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in support of cloture on the \nHomeland Security bill because our country needs a unified effort to \ndefend our shores. But I want my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to know that I am ashamed of the tactics that you have used. And \nthis Senator will not forget what you and your patrons in the \npharmaceutical industry have done to this bill and to the American \npeople in the dark of the night. It appears that the $12 million PhRMA \ndonated during the last election cycle can buy more than a handful of \nHouse and Senate seats. It can also buy a sneak attack on people--\nautistic children--who have been harmed by vaccines.\n  I say to my friends across the aisle and to my friends in the \npharmaceutical industry: sneaking this unrelated provision into \ncritical legislation like Homeland Security is not the way to make good \npublic policy. It is unAmerican, and something to be ashamed of.\n  Why should the parents of autistic children--children who were \ninjured by thimerosal in vaccines--lose some of their legal options in \nthe name of Homeland Security? They too care about the security of our \nnation, but you cannot doubt their love and concern for their precious \nvulnerable children. The homeland security bill is not an appropriate \nvehicle to make this change to the vaccine injury compensation program \non behalf of one interest group.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11169-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11169-S11198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thompson (for Gramm) Amendment No. 4901, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Lieberman/McCain Amendment No. 4902 (to Amendment No. \n     4901), to establish within the legislative branch the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States.\n       Dodd Amendment No. 4951 (to Amendment No. 4902), to provide \n     for workforce enhancement grants to fire departments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that during the next 90 minutes--\nthat is until 1:30 today--there be no action, other than debate, on the \nmatter now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not want to give a lengthy speech, but \nbriefly I will talk about where we are and then talk about the \namendment that is pending. We have now invoked cloture on the pending \nsubstitute, and so we are in a very tightly scripted 30-hour period. \nThe Democrat majority leader put into place two amendments, and in the \nprocess no amendment now is in order. This produces a situation where \nat some point, at the end of 30 hours, there will be a vote on the \npending Lieberman amendment.\n  The pending Lieberman amendment is the amendment I will discuss. It \nis clear these amendments will not be dealt with until the 30 hours \nexpires. So we will have one vote on the Lieberman amendment and then \nwe will move to vote on final passage. I want to address the Lieberman \namendment because what tends to happen in these cases, where things are \ndone at the last minute, is that it is sort of easy to confuse people \nas to what has been done. I want people to understand where the \nprovisions came from and why they are important. One can agree with \nthem or disagree with them, but I want my colleagues to basically know \nwhere they came from.\n  Over the weekend, we had a series of negotiations. I want to go back \nto the point that the President could have said, after the election, \nthat he had a mandate, that this Congress could go home, that we would \nthen have a new Congress and he would write the homeland security bill \nthe way he wanted it written, or he would have Congress write it that \nway. I think it tells us a lot about our President that he decided not \nto do that.\n\n  In fact, after having gotten a strong electoral mandate, the \nPresident actually negotiated further and made additional changes in \nhis bill.\n  The substitute that is before us is basically the Gramm-Miller \namendment, which is well-known, which we debated for 6 weeks--few \namendments have ever been debated that long in my 18-year career in the \nSenate--with two sets of changes. One, the agreements that the \nPresident reached with three Democrat Senators and an Independent \nSenator in negotiations over the weekend, whereby the following changes \nwere made: Workers in the Federal sector and unions that represent them \nwere given a greater voice in expressing their views about how the new \nDepartment is organized, and they were given more clearly defined due \nprocess. They were not given veto power, but they were given a \nguaranteed input under a specific time period. That is the significant \nchange that was made. That represents a compromise from the original \nGramm-Miller amendment.\n  The second change that was made was recognized that the House had \npassed its own bill. So realizing that we were coming to the end of the \nSenate, one of the things we did over the weekend is we met with the \nHouse to try to make changes in our substitute to assure that at the \nend of the session we would not have to do a conference once we had \npassed the bill. Quite frankly, the Democrats who have been supportive \nof this effort felt strongly that they did not want to negotiate with \nus and then end up negotiating with other Republicans in conference. \nThat makes sense. When a deal is cut, one wants it to be a deal. So we \nbrought in the House. As a result, we took 95 percent of our \nprovisions, took about 5 percent of the House provisions, and that now \nis the bill before us. This bill has been adopted by the House, which \nhas now left town. They will be here in pro forma session on Monday, \nbut practically the House has adjourned.\n  I will address the generic issue about add-on provisions and then I \nwant to talk about something else. I hope nobody is offended by this, \nbut I have to\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\nsay I have probably been as strong in speaking out against add-on \nprovisions as anybody. I remind my colleagues that many times at \nmidnight or 2 in the morning we have had seemingly noncontroversial \namendments that did all kinds of special projects that we were going to \naccept. In fact, earlier this Congress I sat in that very room and went \nthrough a list of amendments. One amendment would have the Federal \nGovernment absorb a billion dollars of liability for a project in one \nState. Now that is pretty targeted. I am not going to mention the \nState, and it does not matter.\n  Any time we negotiate with the House, with 435 Members focused on a \nvery small congressional district, they are going to put in provisions \nthat relate to their district. That has been the nature of the body \nfrom the very beginning. It started with the first Congress. It will \nend with the last Congress. It will never go away.\n  For the people who say there are extraneous matters in this bill, of \nall the major bills I have looked at that have been agreed to by the \nHouse and Senate, there are probably fewer extraneous matters in this \nbill than any major bill I have looked at in a very long time. I would \nlike go down the list of amendments being discussed and explain where \nthey came from and why they make sense.\n  The first one has to do with vaccines. We had a provision in our bill \nrelated to vaccines and related to the production of items to be used \nin the war on terrorism. In every war we have ever fought we have had \nsome form of indemnification for people who produce things used in that \nwar. The provision we had in the Senate bill was a taxpayer \nindemnification. I did not like that provision, but I had Republican \ncolleagues who were for it. We were trying to get 51 votes. So I took \nit.\n  The House had a far better procedure. That was a limit on liability. \nWe did not take all the limits on liability they had in the compromise \nbecause we were afraid that might offend powerful special interest \ngroups. But what we did in three of the six items mentioned is we \nsimply applied the principle that has been applied to every war this \nNation has ever fought: if you are producing a new vaccine or new \nweapon or new system for use in that effort, there are some liability \nlimits involved. That is where the item of vaccines came from and where \nthe item of airport screening came from and the item on manufacturers \ncame from.\n  To suggest this is some special interest sweetheart deal makes good \npolitical rhetoric, but the bottom line is it is not true. Not only do \nthe provisions fit, not only are they part of the fabric of the bill, \nbut we had a provision to have the taxpayer pay for the liability risk, \nand we picked a better, preferable approach, which is to limit \nliability when we introduce new technology like airport screening and \nnew vaccines. We always had some limit on vaccines because they are \nrisky, but the threat is now serious. It has never been relevant to a \nwar effort before because we have not viewed smallpox as being a \nweapon. We do now.\n  In three areas our colleagues have singled out as being special \ninterests--vaccines, airport screening, and manufacturing of items used \nin the war on terrorism--those items were in the Senate substitute, but \nthey were in it in the form where the taxpayer would have paid. We put \nin simple limits that make sense and that have been part of every war \nwe ever fought of any significance in American history.\n  The next item viewed as being extraneous is a change made to the \nWellstone amendment. Senator Wellstone introduced an amendment adopted \nby a voice vote because it was clear it would pass and nobody wanted to \nvote on it. It said if any company has ever been domiciled in America, \nthroughout American history, and that company is now domiciled \nsomewhere else, that company cannot bid on contracts related to the war \non terrorism.\n  The change made in the amendment is a good government change. It is \nnot an extraneous special interest provision. It is simply a provision \nthat says the President, for national security reasons, has a right to \nwaive this requirement. Why would he do it? First, there might be only \none supplier. Second, there might be no competitor if it is not waived, \nin which case you could end up paying an exorbitant price. Finally, it \nmight actually be better from America's point of view if the company \nhas substantial production in America, even though its home office is \nsomewhere else, for us to buy from that company for national security \nreasons, for job reasons, and for economic reasons. That provision is \nhardly an add-on provision. It is, in fact, a good government \nprovision.\n\n  Now, let me discuss transportation security rules. We know the \nprovisions and deadlines we mandated for air travel security are so \nstrenuous they cannot be met. Occasionally, we get into these \nsituations where we are debating some deadline and we know the deadline \ncannot be met and will not be met, no matter what we write into law. \nWhat this bill does in a careful and reasoned way is set out a new \ndeadline for meeting them, a deadline that can be met and that is \nreasonable. Instead of creating a farce in law where we say something \nwill be done by December 31--and we know very well it cannot and will \nnot be done and, as a result, you get no pressure to do it on time--we \nset a realistic deadline.\n  Next we have these advisory committees. If there is anything more \nuseless than an advisory committee, I don't know what it is. I am not \nsaying advisory committees cannot be valuable. I am not saying there \nare not some that are valuable. But we use them so often they become \nirrelevant. The striking or not striking of these advisory committees \nhas no import, no significance to this bill. If, however, by striking \nthe committee we change the bill and end up killing homeland security \nbecause the House has adjourned, then it becomes very significant.\n  Those are five of the six items that have been listed. The final item \nis the designation that a university be involved in the process. It is \none item where there is an earmark. Seldom do we see a major piece of \nlegislation that we do not have several dozen earmarks.\n  We are down to a simple question, and I will conclude on this. This \nis hardly an unknown amendment. We have debated it for several weeks. I \nknow there are strong feelings on the issue, but we had an election, \nand if anybody got a mandate out of that election on any issue, the \nPresident got a mandate: Pass homeland security.\n  The House passed a bill. They negotiated with us in good faith. Was \neveryone involved in the negotiations? No. But I didn't help write the \nLieberman amendment, either, because it was his amendment. We have \nbipartisan effort. We have a majority vote. We are down, now, to where \nan amendment has been proposed that would strike six provisions. I \nbelieve if the amendment is adopted, it will jeopardize the bill. The \nHouse passed the bill, they have gone home, and they are only going to \nbe back in pro forma session. Five of the six provisions represent \nimportant elements in the bill.\n  To suggest trying to protect and encourage the production and \ndistribution of smallpox vaccine is a special interest favor to a drug \ncompany is taking politics beyond the realm of reason.\n  On airport screening and manufacturer protection, this liability \nprotection is something we have done in every war we fought. This is \neither a war or it is not a war. Should we start to buy from foreign \ncompanies over companies that are producing products in America but the \nheadquarters was here in 1804 and it is now in London? I think we take \nthis Buy America stuff too far. We should buy the best product at the \nlowest possible price that conforms with our national security. But to \ngive the power to waive it when our national security interest is \ninvolved is hardly unreasonable.\n  Changing the deadline on airport security--every Member of the Senate \nknows we are not going to meet the deadline. Why not change it?\n  Finally, advisory committees--who cares? You could strip all of them \nout and I wouldn't care. But by stripping them out you are risking \nkilling the bill.\n  So, in the end, this amendment really comes down to a threat to the \npassage of homeland security. Five of the six provisions are totally \ndefensible. The sixth one is important only if appropriations occur and \nwe are going to pass the appropriations later, so we are not committing \nto anything.\n  Contrary to the criticism that there are extraneous materials in this \nbill, there are fewer extraneous matters in\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\nthis bill than any major bill I have seen in many years. When you reach \nan agreement between the two Houses, you are always going to have \nextraneous material.\n  So, we will have a vote at 5 o'clock on Monday. First of all, I think \nit is bad policy to strike these six provisions. I think no legitimate \ncase can be made against four of them. I think one of them is \nirrelevant--whether we have advisory committees or not. I think the \nother one is a small item in a big bill and I do not think it is worth \nrisking this bill to make that change. Nor do I believe this issue \nwould ever have been raised, that this amendment would ever have been \noffered, had this not been an extraordinarily controversial bill to \nbegin with.\n  So I just have to say, in the big picture, I feel totally comfortable \nin defending the great majority of these six provisions. I think we \nneed them. On substantive grounds, we should limit liability for new \nvaccines that may save American lives; for airport screening equipment \nthat may keep our children, our spouses, or ourselves from being killed \non airplanes; and from new manufactured items and new weapons we need \nin the war on terrorism. Those items should not be stricken.\n  I know special interest groups like the plaintiffs' attorneys are \nopposed to these provisions. But they are limited, they are narrow, \nthey are reasonable, and the alternative, which we had in the Senate \namendment, was to have the taxpayer pay all these damages. So this \nseems preferable to me.\n  I urge my colleagues when we vote on Monday to vote against this \namendment and, in the process, let us pass this bill in the form it \npassed the House and, to the maximum extent possible, guarantee that we \nare successful in seeing this bill become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). The senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name may be \nadded as a cosponsor of the pending Daschle-Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator's name is added as cosponsor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is a very special moment on the floor \nof the Senate to hear my colleague from Texas defend special provisions \nbeing put in legislation--actually to hear him describe the \nnegotiations at the end of the process that result in these special \nprovisions. Because he has been a tireless opponent of provisions that \nare put in pieces of legislation that in most cases or many cases have \nnothing to do with the underlying bill. So it is a real treat today to \nhear my colleague from Texas justify and support and ask Members of the \nSenate to support these special provisions that were put in the \nhomeland security bill which, in most cases, had nothing at all to do \nwith homeland security.\n  I must say, with respect to the issues of childhood vaccines \nliability protection, manufacturer liability protection, transportation \nsecurity--I would wonder whether these have had hearings. Because we so \noften hear our colleagues, especially my colleague from Texas, say: You \nknow, someone has put a provision in the bill. There has been no \nhearing on the bill. I am wondering whether these provisions have had \nhearings and discussion, and if there were negotiations, as was \nrepresented earlier by my colleague, were the parents of autistic \nchildren part of the negotiations? Where were the negotiations? Was it \nlate at night? Early in the morning? Was it at the White House, as \nCongressman Armey would have us believe? I don't know the answer to \nthat. But my hope is our colleagues will vote to strip these provisions \nfrom the bill.\n  Homeland security, that is what this legislation is about. Frankly, \nthe way this legislation has been created, it was not under normal \ncircumstances, where you have committee exploration in some detail and \nsome depth of all of these provisions. What has happened is at the \neleventh hour a piece of legislation is written and it is placed on \ndesks. It has a rubber band around it. It is four-hundred-and-some \npages and I know of very few Members of the Senate who would have read \nall of it at this point.\n  But having heard my colleague from Texas, for whom I have great \nfondness, describe his support for special provisions, especially at \nthe end of his career here in the Senate, I must say that this is a \nvery unusual moment. We will, of course, miss him for a lot of reasons. \nAmong other things, I will miss him because at the end of most bills, \nhe will be the one counted on to stand up and say: I object to these \nspecial provisions.\n  But he seems to have hit a speed bump here at the end of the road, on \nspecial provisions. I hope my colleagues will decide they want to vote \nto strip these provisions out of this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will, of course, yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will only be a moment. The distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, has referred to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Gramm. May I interpose this observation.\n  Diogenes went about the streets of Athens with a lantern, saying that \nhe was looking--in broad daylight--he was looking for a man, he was \nseeking a man.\n  Plato, upon going to Syracuse, was asked by Hieron the--I wouldn't \nsay he was a beneficent dictator. But he was asked why he came to \nSyracuse.\n  He said: I came seeking an honest man.\n  I rarely make the observation as a premise to what I am about to \nsay--I believe the Senator from Texas is not only a man, but is also an \nhonest man. He is very frank and open. He doesn't have to come to the \nfloor with written speeches as I often do. He speaks from the heart and \nfrom the head and is very up front. He has always been that way. He \nexplains his reasons. He doesn't hide his reasons. And he will answer \nyour questions and he will answer honestly.\n  So I pay tribute to the Senator from Texas in that regard. I am glad \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota has given me the platform \nfor a moment to say that. We may not agree with the distinguished \nSenator from Texas. I certainly don't agree with the request for some \nof the special interest provisions here in this bill. But I do say here \nis an honest man, as far as I am concerned. He is aboveboard. He will \nanswer your questions. He doesn't need a written speech to do it.\n  So I say I wish we had more Phil Gramms in the Senate. Excuse me for \ntaking this time. I will say no more, except to thank him for the good \nrelations.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for just 30 seconds? It is said, in \nthe old Confederate Army, that they didn't give medals.\n  So the single honor was to be mentioned in Robert E. Lee's \ncommuniques to Richmond.\n  Having the distinguished Senator from West Virginia say something \nabout me and to pronounce me a honest man I take in the same way that \nany private in Hood's brigade would have taken in the mention of their \nname in one of those communiques.\n  I love the Senator from West Virginia, as he knows. I think he serves \na great purpose in the Senate. In my opinion, he is not always right, \nbut right is not always easy to find. I think it is the give and take \nthat ultimately produces it. Senator Wellstone, in my opinion, was not \nalways right, he did speak honestly and with clarity. And he knew where \nhe was coming from, and you could be for it or against it. I do think \nthat is important to the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the comment that not always right but \nnever in doubt may well apply to every Senator. I must say to my \ncolleague from Texas that I intend for a few moments on Monday to say a \nword about the Senator from Texas, and my colleagues from South \nCarolina and North Carolina, and others who are leaving the Senate. I \ndon't know if Senator Byrd indicated that he wished there were more \nsuch as the Senator from Texas, and he is, indeed, an extraordinarily \nbright and talented Senator. There are times at midnight when he is \nobjecting to all kinds of provisions that I suspect the Senator from \nWest Virginia and a few others would not wish that we had 25 more \nexactly in the same mood at midnight on important pieces of \nlegislation. But he and so\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\nmany others contribute in very significant ways to this body.\n  This body produces for the American people best when it achieves the \nbest ideas that everyone has to offer. There are times when we end up \nwith the worst rather than the best. I have always thought that \npolitics and our political system is not who is the worst; it is who is \nthe best, who has the best ideas, and who can best manifest those ideas \nin public debate to achieve a result for this country.\n  Regrettably, too much of American politics--especially if you are \ncoming off recent campaigns--is not at all about who is the best but \nrather who is the worst. That, in my judgment, becomes an anvil on the \nbody politic. John F. Kennedy used to say with some beautiful prose \nthat mother kind of hopes her child might grow up to be President, as \nlong as they don't have to become active in politics. But, of course, \npolitics is the way we make decisions in America.\n  I am enormously proud of this political system of the participation \nby Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, Independents, and \nmoderates. I think all bring a great deal to the public debate and \ndiscussion, and strengthen our country.\n\n  Having said that, on Monday I will say a few words about our \ncolleagues who will be leaving us--Senator Cleland, Senator Carnahan, \nand others who have been mentioned on the Republican side. I believe \nthat it is a great privilege to serve with each and every one of them, \neven though we from time to time have our differences. It is a \nremarkable privilege to be here and to serve with them.\n  I wish to make a point about homeland security that is not a part of \nthis bill but I think a part of something that is very important. To \nunderscore how important it is, I would note that we have been told by \nthe head of the CIA that the threat of attack by al-Qaida and other \nterrorists now is as high as it was the day before September 11.\n  On October 25 of this year, a task force headed by former Senators \nWarren Rudman and Gary Hart issued a report on America's homeland \nsecurity. That report was entitled ``America Still Unprepared, America \nStill In Danger.'' It was a bipartisan task force sponsored by the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, which included former Secretaries of \nState, Warren Christopher, George Shultz, ADM William Crow, Retired, \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  They found that 1 year after the September 11 attacks America remains \ndangerously unprepared for another terrorist attack.\n  I specifically wish to talk about one of their concerns raised in \nthis report that I read, which gave me great personal concern.\n  In the report, the task force concluded that the 650,000 local and \nState law enforcement officials around the country ``continue to \noperate in a virtual intelligence vacuum without access to the \nterrorist watch list provided by the U.S. Department of State to \nImmigration and consular officials.''\n  Our government has a watchlist to identify foreign nationals \nsuspected of ties to terrorist organizations. That watch list is at the \nState Department. It is provided to the Immigration Department and to \nconsular officials. It sets out the names of people whom we ought to \nwatch because they are known terrorists. They are people who associate \nwith terrorists; they are a terrorist threat to this country.\n  Guess what. That watch list is unavailable to state and local law \nenforcement officials around this country.\n  Thirty-six hours before the September 11 attack, one of the hijackers \nwas pulled over by a Maryland State police trooper for driving 90 miles \nan hour on Interstate 95. The hijacker's name was Ziad Jarrah. He was a \n26-year-old Lebanese national. He was one of the key organizers of the \nal-Qaida terrorist cell formed in Germany 3 years ago. He shared an \napartment with Mohammed Atta. And he was at the controls of flight 93 \nwhen it crashed in a rural area of Pennsylvania.\n  When that hijacker--or at that point the potential hijacker--was \npulled over by the Maryland trooper, he was driving a car rented under \nhis own name.\n  There are a couple of things with respect to this issue that are \ninteresting.\n  No. 1, his name was not on the watch list.\n  No. 2, had it been on the watch list, it wouldn't have mattered \nbecause a highway patrolman or a city police officer has no access to \nthat watch list. The officer can run the name of an individual through \nthe NCIC computer and find out if that individual has an outstanding \nwarrant, or if there are law enforcement warnings about him but the \nofficer has no way of knowing if the individual is on the State \nDepartment terrorism watch list.\n  The State Department watch list has the names of 80,000 terrorists or \nsuspected terrorists on it. And 2,000 names are being added each and \nevery month. The watch list is drawn from a good many area intelligence \nagencies. And as we speak, there is no way for law enforcement \nauthorities to access the database.\n  Let me read in detail an excerpt from the Hart-Rudman report:\n       `With just fifty-six field offices around the nation, the \n     burden of identifying and intercepting terrorists in our \n     midst is a task well beyond the scope of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation. This burden could and should be shared with \n     650,000 local, county, and state law enforcement officers, \n     but they clearly cannot lend a hand in a counterterrorism \n     information void. When it comes to combating terrorism, the \n     police officers on the beat are effectively operating deaf, \n     dumb, and blind. Terrorist watch lists provided by the U.S. \n     Department of State to immigration and consular officials are \n     still out of bounds for state and local police. In the \n     interim period as information sharing issues get worked out, \n     known terrorists will be free to move about to plan and \n     execute their attack.'\n\n  This comes from the report of former Senators Hart and Rudman, \nentitled ``America Still Unprepared, America Still In Danger.''\n  I asked my staff--after I read this in the Report--to contact the \ntask force. The task force, through my staff, has told me that they are \nnot aware of any administration initiative to fix the problem. This, \ndespite the fact that this is a top recommendation of a blue-ribbon \ntask force.\n  So I asked the Congressional Research Service to contact the White \nHouse Office of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the \nDepartment of Justice. They have done this in recent days.\n  My understanding is that after I made these inquiries the White House \nconvened a meeting with State and Justice officials, and they are now \napparently looking into ways to integrate the State Department \nterrorist watch list--called the ``Tipoff'' database--with the National \nCrime Information Center, which is accessible by State and local law \nenforcement authorities.\n  This effort must be expedited. Let me quote from the article in the \nWashington Post of just yesterday:\n\n       U.S. intelligence officials, increasingly confident that al \n     Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is the speaker on a new \n     audiotape released this week, said yesterday that the message \n     was part of a disturbing pattern indicating that terrorist \n     groups may be planning a new wave of attacks on Western \n     targets.\n       Even before the purported bin Laden tape surfaced on the \n     al-Jazeera satellite network on Tuesday, the CIA, FBI and \n     National Security Agency had detected a significant spike in \n     intelligence ``chatter'' over the previous 10 days that \n     strongly indicated new assaults are being planned, officials \n     in U.S. intelligence agencies said.\n\n  That is from the Washington Post.\n  They continue to say:\n\n       The amount of alarming information was approaching the \n     volume seen in the weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \n     in Washington and New York, and again in the middle of last \n     month following a wave of attacks on overseas targets, some \n     sources said.\n\n  The point is this: Homeland security and homeland protection rests, \nyes, with our intelligence-gathering agencies, yes, with the FBI, the \nCIA, and all of the officials who are working very hard, spending a lot \nof hours doing the best job they can to make it work. But beyond that, \nit also rests with cooperation with all of the local responders, \nespecially local law enforcement officials across this country. There \nare 650,000 of them.\n  If, today, a terrorist drives through a rural county in North Dakota \nthis afternoon, or a rural county in Vermont, or Kentucky, or in the \nmiddle of New York City, and is picked up for a traffic violation, and \nis a known terrorist on a watch list--guess what--\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nthat highway patrolman, that city police officer is going to run that \nterrorist's name through the database at the NCIC, and they are going \nto get no warning that what they have on their hands is a terrorist in \nthe car in front of them. There would be no warning at all because they \ncannot access the watch list.\n  If we have a watch list in which we have identified the names of \nterrorists and suspected terrorists, it makes no sense at all to \nwithhold that information from law enforcement officers, who every \nsingle day climb out of bed and go protect this country on America's \nstreets, on our highways. They are our eyes and ears. They are also \nwatching out for the security of this country. They ought to have \naccess to that watch list.\n  Again, let me say, this was the No. 1 recommendation in the report \noffered by former Senator Rudman and former Senator Hart. The report, \nwhich I would urge everyone to read, is entitled: ``America Still \nUnprepared--America Still in Danger.'' These are former Secretaries of \nState, former Senators, Republicans, Democrats, evaluating what needs \nto be done to protect this country for this country's security.\n  I want to go back to read just a portion of the report. The task \nforce had this to say:\n\n       With just fifty-six field offices around the nation, the \n     burden of identifying and intercepting terrorists in our \n     midst is a task well beyond the scope of the FBI. The burden \n     could and should be shared with 650,000 local, county, and \n     state law enforcement officers, but they clearly cannot lend \n     a hand in a counterterrorism information void.\n\n  Yesterday, I was on the phone with a community in North Dakota, and \nthe county sheriff was there in the room, and we talked by conference \nphone. We talked about this issue. He is not too far from the Canadian \nborder. If one of his deputies or that county's sheriff stops a car on \na rural highway, and it turns out to be a terrorist driving a rented \ncar, he is not going to know because he does not have access to the \nwatch list, he does not have access to the information. The FBI will \nnot know, the CIA will not know, no one will know that terrorist was \ndriving a car on that rural road because the person who apprehended \nhim--the county sheriff, the city police officer--had no access to the \ninformation the State Department has, the consular officials have, the \nCIA has. It is not that the information does not exist, it is that it \nis not shared with local law enforcement officers across this country \nfor the purpose of securing this country's homeland.\n\n  So this was the task force's top recommendation. This was not No. 5 \nor No. 10, it was the top recommendation of this group, a group that \nincluded several former Secretaries of State under Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, Republican and Democratic former Senators, \nand others.\n  So I implore the President and the folks who are apparently now \nworking on this to do everything they can in this regard. When a \ntrooper stops someone for speeding tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, \nor the day after that, and the individual that was pulled over is a \nterrorist, I want that trooper to realize who he has in that car--for \nthe trooper's protection, and for the protection of this country.\n  Let me talk briefly about one other piece of homeland security, and \nwe addressed part of it yesterday.\n  I have told my colleagues previously, I was recently at a port in \nSeattle. I don't know much about ports because I come from a landlocked \nState. I don't come from a State near an ocean. So I went down to see \nhow the ports worked. They showed me all these ships that come in with \nall these containers.\n  I asked: What is in all these containers? They said: We have all \nthese bills of lading and invoices, so we know what is in them. I \nasked: Can I see? And they showed me some containers they were opening.\n  They showed me a container from Poland that had frozen broccoli in it \nin 100-pound bags. They pulled out a bag of frozen broccoli and cut it \nopen. Sure enough, it was frozen broccoli. I asked: What is in the \nmiddle of the container? I know what is in this bag. And they said: \nWell, we just know what's on the invoice.\n  We are spending $7 to $8 billion to see if we can stop an incoming \nmissile because we are very afraid a terrorist group might get hold of \nan ICBM. But it is more likely a terrorist group might put a weapon of \nmass destruction in a container on a container ship that comes in at 3 \nmiles an hour pulling up to a dock in New York City or Los Angeles.\n  We have 5.7 million containers every year coming into our ports. So \n5.7 million containers every single year; 100,000 are inspected, 5.6 \nmillion are not. Is that a matter of homeland security? You bet your \nlife it is.\n  A fellow in the Middle East--many of you read about this fellow--\ndecided he was going to ship himself to Toronto and then come into this \ncountry. He had a GPS, a computer, a toilet, fresh water, a cot, all in \na container loaded on a container ship, shipping himself to Toronto, \nCanada, with the intention, apparently, of coming into this country.\n  Do we need to be concerned about these things? You better believe it. \nAnd many of these issues, even if we passed a homeland security bill, \nwill not be resolved.\n  The first issue I mentioned today is not resolved, and will not be \nresolved with the passage Monday of this bill: The fact that 650,000 \nlocal law enforcement authorities have no ability to access a watch \nlist to determine who is a terrorist and who isn't. And 5.6 million \nuninspected containers coming into our ports will not be inspected next \nTuesday when the homeland security bill is passed.\n  So my point is, there is much left to be done for those of us--and I \nam sure that is all of us--who care deeply about homeland security in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York was on his feet. I \nknow the Senator from Tennessee is waiting.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield, I was waiting behind the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. If we are going back and forth--\nI only want to speak for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I sought recognition first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a particular order. The custom is \nusually to go back and forth from side to side. I am wondering if we \nmight recognize the Senator from Tennessee, to follow the normal \ncustom.\n  Mr. FRIST. Normal procedure would be to turn to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry. I heard the Senator from New York, \nbut if the Senator from Tennessee says he sought recognition earlier, \nthen I will apologize for not hearing him.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield, although I felt \nI was--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York. Is that enough time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I appreciate it. I don't want to break the protocol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am prepared to recognize the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank both my colleagues for helping the \nChair out of a difficult situation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let us hope and pray that is the Chair's most difficult \nsituation in the upcoming months.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for allowing me to speak. I will \ntry to be brief. I would like to talk about two related subjects in \nthis bill: What is in the bill and what is not in the bill.\n  What is in the bill, aside from the original homeland security \nprovisions which we have been debating for a very long time, are little \npieces of legislation unrelated to homeland security, none of which \ncould stand the scrutiny of individual debate. In other words, if any \nof these little provisions were put in separate legislation and brought \nto the floor of the Senate, my guess is they would be overwhelmingly \ndefeated.\n  For those to be in homeland security right now, for those pieces of \npork, for those rifleshot pieces of legislation that benefit one \ncompany to be in this bill, particularly after the President made such \na fuss about keeping this bill the way he wanted it without any other \nprovisions in it, is very wrong.\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\n  I hope we will support the Lieberman amendment. There are a few that \nare particularly galling to me. Probably the worst is a provision in \nthis bill that was in the original bill that the House just took out \nthat said, if you go overseas to avoid paying taxes, the original \nprovision said, you can't bid on homeland security contracts. This \ntakes it out. It says to companies that move overseas that they can \nbenefit from the homeland security issues. I find that very troubling.\n  There is a provision that exempts one company, Eli Lilly, from any \nliability against a drug that is already subject to many lawsuits \nbecause of its mercury levels. That kind of provision would never pass \nstanding on its own, and it was slipped in in the dark of night by the \nother body. We should not countenance it here.\n  There are provisions that redebate the tort law. We will have plenty \nof debates about tort law next year; I am sure of that. But to put them \nin this legislation with no debate would make the Founding Fathers gag.\n  We should stop doing these things, but particularly in a homeland \nsecurity bill that was so subject, in the election, to a debate that \nthe President wanted it his way or no way and led, at least if you \nbelieve some of the pundits, to some of our colleagues losing their \nelections because they wanted it a slightly different way. Now to put \nthese sometimes pork, sometimes lard, sometimes extraneous provisions \nin this legislation is unfair, is wrong. We should support the \nLieberman amendment.\n  I also would like to talk about what is not in the bill. This bill is \na reorganization of agencies. All things being equal, it is better than \nnot having it. But anyone who thinks, as my colleague from North Dakota \nhas outlined, that this is going to make us safer, this is going to do \nthe job, is sadly mistaken. I will support the legislation because it \nis a little bit better than the present situation. But I am worried \nthat then we will think we have done all we can on homeland security.\n  This administration is letting our Nation down on domestic security--\nnot by design but by effect--when they say that nothing can be added to \nhomeland security that costs money. I don't get it. We are willing to \nspend $80 billion on a war in Iraq which I have supported, but we are \nnot willing to spend $250 million to prevent nuclear weapons from being \nsmuggled into our country. Where is the logic there?\n\n  Does anyone think that rearranging agencies is going to get the INS \nto have better computers or the Coast Guard to better defend our \nborders? No. And this administration is going to run up against a \nserious problem if it continues to have the view that we cannot spend a \nnickel on domestic security. The analogy, the comparison is stark. The \nmilitary gets all the money it needs--it should--but our domestic \nagencies, both Federal and State and local, that deal with homeland \nsecurity get virtually no dollars at all.\n  I was told that my provision, which had bipartisan support--Senator \nLieberman, Senator Thompson, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings--that \nwould have enabled us to have nuclear detection devices attached to the \ncranes that load and unload containers and could detect a nuclear \nweapon that would be smuggled in, had to be out of the bill because it \ncost money. I find that to be sad. I find that to be troubling in the \nsense that we are letting our national guard down. If we were under \nsuch spending constraints when it came to the rest of the parts of the \nwar on terrorism, I would say OK. But I don't understand why we can \nspend all the money we want overseas but when we come to the water's \nedge, even carefully thought out small amounts of money are not \nallowed.\n  This bill is problematic for what was just added in and what was not \nput in. It is a little bit better than nothing. It is a baby step in \nthe direction of better homeland security because our agencies do have \nto be reorganized. But I hope and pray that not only we take out the \nextraneous provisions that should be debated another day, but that we \ndon't make the mistake that this reorganization bill is doing what we \nneed for homeland security.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time and once again thank my \ncolleague from Tennessee for his graciousness in allowing me to speak. \nI will now exit for the shuttle to New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nLieberman amendment and will spend a little bit of time over the next \nprobably 30 minutes going to the substance of what this amendment does, \ntalking policy, but also talking to the impact that passing the \nLieberman amendment would have on our homeland security.\n  The bottom line is that I believe striking the provisions, which is \nwhat the Lieberman amendment does--it pulls out certain provisions from \nthe underlying bill--will put the people of our Nation at greater risk, \nwhen we are talking about homeland security and safety and protection \nof individuals, of families, of children. That is a broad statement. It \nis a bold statement for me to make. But over the next several minutes I \nwant to give you the substance of it.\n  A lot of people have said these provisions having to do with vaccines \nand smallpox are one-company provisions. The second argument is that in \nsome way these provisions cut off the rights of individuals to go to \ncourt. We have heard statements by the proponents that one agent, one \npreservative, causes autism and thus in some way the underlying bill \nwill hurt families with children with autism.\n  As a scientist, as a physician, as someone who is very familiar with \nthe provisions that were placed in the homeland security bill, I have a \ncertain obligation to walk my colleagues and the American people who \nare listening through what the Lieberman provision would do by \nstripping out the smallpox provisions, by stripping out the vaccine \nprovisions.\n  Let me begin by saying we are a nation at risk. We are at risk from \nnuclear weapons and from chemical weapons; we know. But when it really \ncomes to what could potentially happen to our homeland--remember this \nis homeland defense that we are talking about--I would argue that the \ngreatest risk for a weapon of mass destruction to be microorganisms, to \nbe anthrax, which terrorized the Nation, when we don't even think, we \ndon't know, we don't think it was used by a State, or the introduction \nof smallpox, which we know is a weapon of mass destruction, if \nintroduced into a population that is unprepared, that has not been \nvaccinated. Vaccine is the front line for people at risk from anthrax. \nIt is the front line for people at risk from smallpox. That means your \nchildren. That means your spouse. That means your grandparents. That \nmeans your family.\n\n  So we must not do anything and the Lieberman amendment would do \nthis--to increase the barrier for you to be protected.\n  Iraq has been mentioned. Most of my colleagues know that Iraq had one \nof the most robust biological weapons programs in the history of the \nworld. It loaded anthrax, it loaded botulism toxin on missiles during \nthe gulf war, inserted it into the warheads of these missiles. We don't \nknow about smallpox. We didn't know that refrigerators had been found \nin Iraq that said ``smallpox'' across them, but we do know this robust \nbiological weapons program is the foundation for a program of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  The interesting thing about these microorganisms, these viruses, \nthese bacteria, is that you don't have to have a big ship out there to \nsend in a missile. We know that once you put smallpox in a society, it \nwill travel through our schools, it will travel through our businesses \nand through our homes, and the only defense we have--the only defense, \nin terms of a medical treatment, is that vaccine. That is why, when we \ntalk vaccines and when we talk smallpox, it is incumbent upon us to \nhave those provisions in this bill.\n  I will begin with smallpox because it is the one that, a week from \nnow, can be a problem. What about right now, or tomorrow morning, if we \nhear of three or four smallpox cases in the country? What actually \nhappens at that standpoint? Smallpox is a disease that is one of the \nmost deadly infectious diseases. There is a 30-percent chance, to \nanybody who gets it, that they are going to die. If three people are \nhere, one of those three will die if they get smallpox.\n  What is the treatment? The only treatment--real treatment--is to get\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\nthat vaccine on your arm within 3 days. Some people say 4 days. I \npersonally think it is 3. Some say 5 to 10, but if your child has \nsmallpox, not from when the manifestations start appearing but from the \ntime of actual contact, and that entails having a vaccine out there--\nsay 300 million doses, because we know smallpox in an unprotected \npopulation, which we are, knows no barriers. Right now, if I had \nsmallpox lesions within my mouth, people around these four or five \ndesks probably would already be infected. The only protection is the \nvaccine itself. The only treatment for smallpox--and this isn't true \nwith all biological agents, but the only treatment is the vaccine \nwithin 3 days.\n  The administration has a policy, that I agree with, that basically \nis, if there is an outbreak, or a case, you can inoculate people in \nthat area. That is a great policy. We don't need to mass-vaccinate \neverybody. What about right now?\n  People listening, saying we are a nation at risk--Iraq has had \nbiological weapons programs. We know Saddam Hussein is a mass killer, a \nserial killer, who kills his own people and other people. He hates the \nUnited States. We know the most powerful weapon of mass destruction is \nsmallpox, and we know there is a refrigerator sitting there that has \n``smallpox'' written on it.\n  What if I wanted to get the vaccine now, just in case? Right now, you \ncannot get it. I argue that you should be able to get it. But that is \nnot yet the policy of the United States. I think with informed consent, \nknowing the side effects and knowing what the advantages could be--\nlifesaving--weighing the relative risk--what about if a case breaks out \nin the Northwest, say Oregon, tomorrow? If you wanted to get the \nvaccine and you live in Nashville, TN, you could not get it. We ought \nto change that. That is not what we are talking about today, but you \nsee that vaccines are a front line for homeland security.\n\n  I don't know what is going to happen in Iraq; none of us knows. If we \ncome back and deal with this 6 months from now, or a year from now, or \n2 years from now, we are inadequately protecting the American people. I \ndon't want to overstate it, but that is my belief.\n  If smallpox hits here, right now, we are inadequately protected. The \nLieberman legislation would strip out a provision, within 2 days or 3 \ndays or 4 days, that would make us more adequately protected as a \nnation.\n  The threat of liability--this is where the other vaccine provisions \nare important--should not become a barrier to the protection of the \nAmerican people. I will repeat that. The threat of liability should not \nbecome a barrier to the protection of the American people.\n  Then you go back to the question, What is this threat of liability? I \nwill boil it down and use smallpox as an example. Smallpox can hit here \ntomorrow or in 30 days or in 60 days from now or in 90 days or maybe \nnever. We all pray it never hits. We have 300 million doses of vaccine. \nIt is not all licensed yet, but it is good vaccine and I have utmost \nconfidence in it. It is a risky vaccine. The childhood vaccines we use, \nwhich we are inoculated with--even the anthrax vaccine that potentially \nhas certain side effects--if you look at these, I put smallpox among \nthe most risky because we know the side effects are that about 1 in a \nmillion people would die. If you vaccinated 300 million people, about \n300 would die. Ten times that number would have serious side effects--\nmaybe encephalitis or many others that are life threatening. As a \nmatter of fact, probably 30, 40 times that many would have a bad rash, \nmany of which would cause hospitalization. So it is a vaccine, in \nmedical terms, with more potential side effects than others.\n  What would you say if there were an outbreak tomorrow? You would call \nin nurses and public health officials, and pediatricians and other \ndoctors, and you would say, as part of the American response to \nbioterrorism and the use of bioterrorist agents or microorganisms as \nweapons of mass destruction, you need to get this vaccine to as many \npeople as you can within 3 days. It could be maybe 100 or maybe 1,000, \nor 10,000; and in a city such as New York, it could be a million easily \nwithin 3 days. Okay, you have the vaccine. You have willing health care \nproviders. I think of myself as a physician. Everybody could be \nmobilized to do that. You are basically saying, as American policy: You \nneed to give that vaccine. It has side effects, but we are not going to \nprotect you in the event there is a side effect--death or encephalitis. \nWe are not going to protect you in any shape or form, although you are \nfulfilling the mandate and the policy, the emergency response of the \nAmerican people.\n  Why would they not do that? Because of the lack of protection from \nskyrocketing lawsuits. I have a great fear--and I don't want to say I \nknow for sure, but I have a fear in talking to health care providers \nand to the nurses who recognize, given that vaccine is important to \nlife saving, but at the same time is subjected to these unlimited \nlawsuits with punitive damages--they just might say: I cannot subject \nmyself to giving a thousand of those doses, even looking at the \nstatistics. That is the problem, that is why the smallpox provision has \nto be in there.\n\n  We have had so many people make all these statements, but nobody has \nbeen to the substance. The bill extends the Federal Tort Claims Act--\nthe FTCA--protection to any person, such as a doctor, or a \npediatrician, or a nurse, or somebody who is qualified to be giving \nthat inoculation, lifesaving inoculation, in your arm. It provides them \na protection of the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n  What is important there--people say if that is the case, you cannot \nsue. Well, that is simply not true. It basically says that the Federal \nGovernment is going to be on your side and will defend you in any \nlawsuit and the Federal Government will pay the damages. It does not \ndeny adequate, just, fair compensation if there is a side effect, but \nwhat it does do is you are going to have somebody behind you; namely, \nthe Federal Government, to pay you damages. It does say you go to \nFederal court. People say Federal courts cannot do this. In truth, we \nall know Federal courts can do that.\n\n  It is important to point out that in Federal court, the rules that \nare actually used are going to be applicable to that State or according \nto State law.\n  Thus, you can still sue, but the Federal Government pays. A lot of \npeople say you should be able to punish anybody--punish that nurse who \nput that vaccine in your arm--so let's have punitive damages on top of \ncompensation. The underlying bill says you get adequate, just, fair \ncompensation. You are defended by the Federal Government and they will \npay you, but there is no punitive damages component, which makes sense \nbecause, remember, that nurse is putting that inoculation on your arm \nto save your life under a plan put forward by our Government, probably \nin response to an emergency.\n  Over time, I think we need much more balance in terms of the overall \nprovisions. It was not my idea, although I support these provisions \nstrongly, to take these specific provisions out and to put them into \nthe bill. So over time, we need to develop a more comprehensive policy \nto make sure we have both a full range of vaccines developed, that we \nhave appropriate countermeasures, and if somebody is harmed by a \nvaccine, there is fair compensation.\n  We need to come back and visit this in a more comprehensive way as we \ngo forward. I will add, though, there is some sense of urgency to this \ngiven the threats today.\n  The issue of what is front line is important because the use of \ngerms, microorganisms, and bacteria is new to the American people as \nweapons of mass destruction. It is causing us to say we understand \nnuclear weapons, gas, but what about these organisms that can wind \ntheir way through a society? What is the front line?\n  That is why vaccines are absolutely important because they become the \nfront line, and that is why we address vaccines in the homeland \nsecurity bill, especially since we are at risk today. One cannot turn \non a television or read a newspaper without learning of this enhanced \nrisk, this higher risk.\n  Let me back out of this broader issue of vaccine. Smallpox is one \ncase. It happens to be a virus. What about the plague which wiped out a \nthird of Europe? What about anthrax? We have an old vaccine. The \nvaccine has to be administered over and over, so we need newer vaccine \ndeveloped for anthrax.\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\n  What about Ebola? About 3 months ago, the National Institutes of \nHealth said in their response to bioterrorism that one of its major \npriorities is going to be the development of a vaccine for the Ebola \nvirus. That makes sense because we know that other states in their \noffensive biological weapons programs--and there are 12 offensive \nbiological weapons programs outside the United States; people need to \nknow that--there has been a linkage of smallpox with the Ebola virus. \nWe know Ebola has a 90-percent mortality rate; smallpox has a 30-\npercent mortality rate. We should at least be thinking of a front line \nthere which means a new vaccine. NIH said 4 months ago--and most people \ndo not even know it--has as one of their major initiatives development \nof an Ebola vaccine. Why? Because intelligence tell us people have \nattempted to link viruses. Thus, we need to have an effective response \nsystem in terms of the development of vaccine.\n\n  Research is good. NIH is doing research. But unless we have \nmanufacturers in the field manufacturing vaccines, we can have the \ngreatest research in the world and know how to do it, but unless we can \nproduce it and produce it quickly, the know-how does not do us any good \nbecause we are not going to be able to develop the vaccine to put on \nyour arm and protect you from the Ebola virus.\n  There are provisions in this bill that provide smallpox as a \nmicrocosm, but in the macro sense, there are other vaccines. Every \nyear--and the distinguished Presiding Officer knows this--we hear about \nthese shortages of vaccines about every 6 months. People ask: Why are \nthere these shortages? It is multifactorial, and we have to address \nthat.\n  One of the issues we know is this unlimited liability. Think back to \nthe smallpox vaccine. It is put on your arm, and you have a bad side \neffect. Somebody is going to sue for that side effect. There are no \nprotections today. In the same sense, the manufacturers, the \npharmaceutical companies, which is very popular for people to beat upon \naggressively these days, the manufacturing companies, the \npharmaceutical companies are the only ones that can make the smallpox \nvaccine, the front line for that weapon of mass destruction, for the \nEbola virus.\n  We can, through NIH, promote the research, but only a manufacturing \nfirm, a pharmaceutical firm can make the Ebola vaccine. There used to \nbe in the eighties 12 pharmaceutical companies making vaccines. Then it \ndwindled to 10, then to 8, then to 7, then to 6, then to 5, and there \nare now only 4 vaccine manufacturers licensed to sell vaccines in the \nUnited States, and only two of these are American companies.\n  Why is that the case? Why would they stand out totally exposed for \nmaking a medicine that is lifesaving, yes, but one that with one \nlawsuit can wipe out their whole development process, their whole \nmanufacturing process today?\n  That is an issue that has to be developed, and the urgency of it is \nthe fact we are a nation at risk from biological agents, and there are \n12 states that have offensive biological weapons programs, and we are \ntoday unprotected.\n  On the liability issue, people have said one preservative causes \nautism. They mentioned this on the floor. That is just wrong. The \nInstitute of Medicine has made it very clear that there is no \nestablished causal relationship between that preservative and autism. I \nwill and others need to go back and look at the data, but the Institute \nof Medicine has basically said that to date. We need more research.\n  I was one of the primary authors of the autism research bill. We need \nto look at it again. I want to assure families in the country that \nthose statements made on the floor of the Senate are wrong. There is \nnothing in the underlying bill that slows down research for autism or \njust compensation, if there is an association between autism and a \ncertain preservative.\n  It is interesting, with these vaccines being sort of inherently \nrisky, with the risk of liability costs driven up so high because it is \neasy--it is not easy, but we can have lawyers coming in and starting \nthese lawsuits.\n  In the 1980s, this body started the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram. They did this through the National Children's Vaccine Injury \nAct. It was passed in 1986, I believe. The whole purpose of this \nprogram is to provide injured patients compensation while attempting to \ncontrol litigation, based on the recognition that vaccines will always \nbe an easy target because they have inherent side effects and everybody \ngets vaccines--everybody in this body has been vaccinated. Everybody \nlistening hopefully has been vaccinated. We all depend on those \nvaccines. That at the end of the day, since everybody gets it and there \nare certain side effects, that if you want to make a lot of money you \ncan go out and start getting these people and start creating these \nlawsuits. That is why in the mid-1980s we said we have to put all of \nthis together and look at it in a reasoned way, a way that is \nefficient, a way that is fair to people broadly. The vaccine injury \ncompensation program is essentially a no-fault alternative to the \ntraditional tort system in this whole area of vaccines. It has been a \nkey component of stabilizing the vaccine market, of not driving even \nthose last four companies--or the last two in this country--out of \nmaking vaccines. It has a streamlined process. It puts down a less \nadversarial alternative so not everybody is going to court and spending \nweeks, months, and in some cases years trying to have their cases \nactually looked at.\n\n  It encourages research and development of new and safer vaccines, and \nit provides the appropriate liability protection to that nurse who is \nputting that inoculation, that vaccine, in your arm, as well as the \nhealth care providers, the facilities, and the manufacturers.\n  What is in the underlying bill is a narrow set of provisions that \nwere actually taken from a bill that I have studied for the last 3 \nyears and that I introduced this Congress, that should eventually be \npassed in this comprehensive form, but the provisions have been taken \nout and included in the underlying bill I feel strongly about and I \nwill continue to talk to my colleagues about them individually as they \nunderstand why those provisions were included.\n  I will say that the provisions that are in the bill are far narrower \nthan what I think we actually need to do to have this balance in our \nliability system so we can continue to develop vaccines to protect our \nchildren, the current generation. In the event there is a bioterror \nattack a week from now, a month from now, a year from now, we will be \nadequately prepared.\n  The Lieberman proposal would strike these sections that are in the \nunderlying bill. And all of them merely restate to some extent what was \nintended by Congress. This is a clarification, a restatement. In 1986, \nwhen it passed the bill, the underlying bill called the National \nChildren's Vaccine Injury Act, what that act did was to create an \nadministrative mechanism by which those children who have a serious \nside effect from a vaccine can receive compensation without ever having \nto prove in court a vaccine caused their particular injury. So you do \nnot have to go to court. You can go to this new administrative body.\n  There are a handful of people who do not believe in vaccines. They \njust say all vaccines are bad. Most know that they are invaluable and \nhave spared our children from many of the diseases that haunt us. Thus, \nwhen you have that which we all really fully understand today, that \nthey are a protection for our children, plus this new threat of \nbioterror, that is why you link it to homeland security and that is why \nit is important in this bill. We know we must preserve that \nmanufacturing base so with the research that is done, yes, by the \npharmaceutical companies, but also maybe even more importantly by the \nNIH, we can actually manufacture those vaccines.\n  Section 171 clarifies that the components and ingredients of a \nvaccine listed in the vaccine's product license application and label \nare not contaminants or adulterants. Importantly, the advisory \ncommittee, from which all of this essentially was taken, is an advisory \ncommittee called the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines. They \nunanimously concur with this particular provision.\n  The next section, section 1716, adds a definition of ``vaccine'' to \nthe Public Health Service Act since that term was not defined at all in \nthe initial legislation back in 1986. This section states\n\n[[Page S11178]]\n\nthe obvious--that the term ``vaccine'' includes all components and \ningredients listed in the vaccine's product license application and \nproduct label. Again, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines \nrecommended the appropriate modification which is a part of the \nunderlying homeland security bill, again, which the Lieberman amendment \nwould strip out.\n  Sections 1715 and 1716 restate the original intent of the law that a \nvaccine is all the ingredients and components in the product which are \napproved by the FDA. This is an important one because there have been \nsome allegations that all this was stuck in for a single company. The \nfact is that there are presently more than 150 of these lawsuits \nagainst the four vaccine manufacturers, as well as pediatricians, \nchildren's hospitals, state health departments and other healthcare \nproviders. From my comments, one can see that it is not a single \ncompany. We are talking about a huge issue that reflects back to the \nprotection of our families and our Nation.\n  Section 1714 clarifies that the term ``manufacturer,'' under the \nVICP, includes any corporation, organization, or institution that \nmanufactures, imports, processes or distributes any vaccine on the \nvaccine injury table, including any component or ingredient of such \nvaccine. The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, again, an \nindependent body making specific recommendations--it is composed, by \nthe way, of trial lawyers, medical providers, and injured parties--\nunanimously supported this provision. This provision restates \nCongressional intent to ensure that any lawsuit alleging vaccine-\nrelated injury or death follow the same process and groundrules \nregardless of whether it is against the final manufacturer, a physician \nor hospital, or a component or ingredient manufacturer and addresses \nthose lawsuits seeking to circumvent the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram.\n  I also want to point out that these provisions are supported by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and I will talk more about that in a \nminute.\n  I want to run through a couple of other specific ones, again because \nnobody has really talked to the substance underlying what this \namendment would mean.\n  The congressional intent very much was to encompass the manufacturers \nof component materials of vaccines in the definition of ``vaccine \nmanufacturer,'' and these provisions--what they do is clarify this \nintent. They restate the congressional intent as part of the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Act. The courts are presently correctly ruling that \nthese amendments--what they are doing is part of that congressional \nintent. The courts have correctly rejected the contention that a \ncomponent or ingredient of an FDA-approved vaccine can also be \nconsidered substitute an adulterant or contaminant.\n  Among these decisions, the court charged with adjudicating the \nvaccine injury compensation program recently concluded that the \nlanguage and legislative history of the National Children's Vaccine \nInjury Act demonstrated that claims relating to components of covered \nvaccines are plainly subject to the act. As to the misconceptions that \nhave been presented on the floor, No. 1, these provisions do not \nprevent patients from suing in court. The statement has been made that \nit takes away rights. It does not. It does not prevent patients from \nsuing in court. Instead it merely requires, as is required under \ncurrent law, claimants must first go through the compensation program \ndesigned in the 1980s which has worked effectively but does need to be \nmodified, as is being carried out in these provisions. They maintain \ntheir right to pursue a court case.\n\n  One can go through that program itself, the administrative program, \nin a timely way. If someone does not agree with the compensation that \nthey put forward, they can go to court. I will say that without this \nclarification, litigation outside the program--and that is what is \nhappening today--will continue and the supply of vaccines could well be \njeopardized as we have these huge lawsuits.\n  One lawsuit today is $30 billion. That is what they are looking for \nin one lawsuit, $30 billion. The whole vaccine industry is only $5 \nbillion. There are about 150 of these lawsuits out there today. Those \nwho desire to bring litigation outside the compensation program will \ncontinue to sue the manufacturers of components of vaccines and \nultimately that is going to result in the manufacturers of the products \nthemselves simply walking away and not making vaccines and getting out \nof the vaccine business. Then who is going to make the vaccine for the \nEbola virus, which our Federal Government, through intelligence, has \nidentified as one of the six agents of which we are at risk, one of the \nsix agents against which other nations have had offensive biological \nweapons programs.\n  If litigation continues against component manufacturers outside of \nthe vaccine injury compensation program, those companies that make the \ncomponents simply are going to be unnecessary to provide the vaccine or \nthose people who make FDA-approved components and give them to the \nvaccine manufacturers will stop making those components. We saw that in \nthe mid-1990s when raw material suppliers refused to sell the necessary \ncomponents to the medical device manufacturers. People just stopped \nmaking materials there because of this fear of litigation. Ultimately \nthere it took an act of Congress to protect those component \nmanufacturers, the people making the pieces that go, for example, into \na pacemaker or, in this case, it would be a component of the vaccine. \nIt took an act of Congress to prevent a shortage back then of \npacemakers and of other vital medical devices.\n  These provisions that are in the underlying bill have been \nunanimously supported by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines. \nAs I mentioned, that includes injured patients, trial lawyers, and an \nexpert group of patients as well. They have been endorsed by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a portion of letters from the \nAdvisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines and the American Academy of \nPediatrics printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Advisory Commission\n\n\n                                       on Childhood, Vaccines,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Tommy G. Thompson,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n      Washington, DC\n       Dear Secretary Thompson: The Advisory Commission on \n     Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) is authorized under Section 2119 of \n     the Public Health Service Act to advise the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (the Secretary) on the \n     implementation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \n     Program (VICP). At the June 6 meeting, the ACCV discussed in \n     detail the need for urgent modifications of the VICP and the \n     necessity to ensure the viability of the Vaccine Safety \n     Datalink Project. Actions are needed to address a variety of \n     concerns that directly impact the VICP.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       As of May 2002, more than 50 individual and class action \n     lawsuits with millions of plaintiffs alleging potential \n     thimerosal-related injuries from childhood vaccines have been \n     filed in state and federal courts. The plaintiffs in these \n     lawsuits argue that their claims are not governed by the VICP \n     because they allege that thimerosal is an ``adulterant'' to, \n     and not a part of the vaccines. These claims have been filed \n     against vaccine companies and, in some instances, against \n     health care providers. Thimerosal, as you know, is approved \n     for use by the Food and Drug Administration and is part of \n     the vaccine formulation when licensed; hence clarification is \n     needed to direct these claims to the VICP before tort \n     remedies can be pursued.\n       Concurrently, some 500 incomplete cases have been filed as \n     placeholders with the VICP alleging that thimerosal (mercury) \n     has caused vaccine-related injuries. The medical records that \n     the Act requires upon filing do not accompany many VICP \n     petitions, including these cases. This causes problems \n     because of the time constraints spelled out in the Act. The \n     presiding special master must generally resolve a case within \n     240 days (this period excludes any period of suspension and \n     any period during which a petition is being remanded). If the \n     special master fails to issue a decision within such time, \n     the petitioner may withdraw from the VICP and pursue outside \n     litigation without affording respondent or the special master \n     any meaningful opportunity to evaluate the VICP claim.\n\n\n the ACCV believes this disturbing new mend in civil litigation could \n                           circumvent the Act\n\n       We submit the following recommendation for action:\n\n\n      recommendation on certification of completeness of petitions\n\n       The ACCV recommends that the Secretary propose legislation \n     to amend the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, \n     as amended, to require special masters to issue a certificate \n     of completeness once a determination is made that a petition \n     is complete in accordance with section 2111. The time period \n     described in sections 2112(g) and 2121(b) of the Public \n     Health Service Act would begin from the date the special \n     master issues\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\n     a certification of completeness. This would allow for a \n     period of 240 days excluding any period of suspension of any \n     time the petition is on remand) for the parties to consider \n     all of the evidence and for a decision to be reached. If the \n     special master fails to issue a decision within this time \n     period, calculated from the date the certificate of \n     completeness is issued, the petitioner could withdraw from \n     the VICP and pursue outside litigation.\n\n\n                          senator frist's bill\n\n       In addition to the previous request, we also ask that you \n     consider our recommendations regarding legislation introduced \n     by Sen. William Frist (R-IN), ``Improved Vaccine \n     Affordability and Availability Act'' (S. 2053). The ACCV \n     concentrated on Title II of the bill that has provisions to \n     ensure that all claims for a vaccine-related injury or death \n     are first filed with the VICP. The ACCV makes the following \n     recommendations:\n\n\n      recommendations on the ``improved vaccine affordability and \n                           availability act''\n\n       The ACCV unanimously concurs with the following sections of \n     S. 2053 which are the same as or very similar to proposals \n     made in the ``Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Amendments \n     of 1999'' (the 1999 Amendments), which were developed from \n     recommendations made by the ACCV and sent to Congress as \n     legislative proposals by the former Secretary:\n       Section 206, ``Clarification of When Injury is Caused by \n     Factor Unrelated to Administration of Vaccine'';\n       Section 208, ``Basis for Calculating Projected Lost \n     Earnings'';\n       Section 209, ``Allowing Compensation for Family Counseling \n     Expenses and Expenses of Establishing Guardianship'';\n       Section 211, ``Procedure for Paying Attorneys' Fees'';\n       Section 212, ``Extension of Statute of Limitations'';\n       Section 213, Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines''; \n     and\n       Section 218, ``Conforming Amendment to Trust Fund \n     Provision.''\n       The ACCV unanimously concurs with the following sections of \n     S. 2053:\n       Section 204, ``Jurisdiction to Dismiss Actions Improperly \n     Bought'';\n       Section 215, ``Clarification of Definition of \n     Manufacturer'';\n        Section 216, ``Clarification of Definition of Vaccine-\n     Related Injury or Death'';\n        Section 217, Clarification of Definition of Vaccine''; and\n       Section 220, ``Pending Actions''.\n       The ACCV does not concur with the following sections of S. \n     2053 and recomends:\n       Replacing Section 201, ``Administrative Revision of Vaccine \n     Injury Table'', which changes the public comment period from \n     180 to 90 days with Section 2, ``Administrative Revision of \n     Vaccine Injury Table'', of the 1999 Amendments which changes \n     the public comment period from 180 to 60 days and shortens \n     from 90 to 60 days the period that the ACCV has to review a \n     proposed rule;\n       Modifying Section 202, ``Equitable Relief'', and Section \n     214, ``Clarification of Standards of Responsibility'' to add \n     ``past or in front of present physical injury''. Some \n     individuals may have sustained a vaccine-related injury in \n     the past, but do not have a present physical injury. These \n     individuals should not be prohibited from obtained relief in \n     a civil action filed against a vaccine manufacturer or \n     administrator;\n       Replacing Section 207, ``Increase in Award in the Case of a \n     Vaccine-Related Death and for Pain and Suffering'' with the \n     2001 ACCV recommendation to increase the $250,000 benefit \n     caps for both death and pain and suffering. These $250,000 \n     benefit caps should be retroactively increased since 1988, \n     and increased annually, thereafter, to account for inflation \n     using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers (CPI-U) \n     as envisioned by Congress in the original National Childhood \n     Vaccine Injury Act of 1986;\n       Replacing Section 210, ``Allowing Payment of Interim \n     Costs'' which does not stipulate a timeframe for when the \n     interim payment is to be made with Section 6, ``Allowing \n     Payment of Interim Costs of the 1999 Amendments, which states \n     that the interim payment can only be made after a \n     determination has been made concerning whether or not the \n     petitioner is entitled to compensation;\n       Modifying Section 219, ``Ongoing Review of Childhood \n     Vaccine Data'' by deleting the phrase, ``together with \n     recommendation for changes in the Vaccine Injury Table''; and\n       Replacing Section 221, ``Report'', which this language, \n     ``The ACCV shall provide the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services with annual status reports on the Vaccine Injury \n     Compensation Trust Fund (the Trust Fund), including \n     recommendations on the allocation of funds from the Trust \n     Fund.''\n       With regard to Section 203, ``Parent Petitions for \n     Compensation'', the ACCV believes that the language in this \n     section must be modified. The issue of compensating parents \n     and third parties was raised when the original Act was \n     drafted, but the focus remained on the need for an adequate \n     compensation package that would cover the life of the injured \n     child. Over the years, a few parent or third party petitions \n     for compensation have been filed in state and federal courts. \n     However, many of the class action suits contain parent \n     petition, which prompted ACCV to revisit the issue. ACCV \n     strongly believes that parent or third party petitions for \n     compensation are more appropriately managed and \n     adjudicated through the VICP rather than through outside \n     litigation. Because of our concern for the well being of \n     the child, the ACCV recommends that the award to the \n     vaccine-injured child be separate from any award offered \n     to the parent. At your request, the ACCV will develop \n     options for such an award. In addition, this Section, as \n     is currently drafted, raises serious constitutional \n     concerns. The ACCV recognizes that the proposed provision, \n     as drafted, may need to be supplemented to: (1) address \n     potential constitutional concerns; and (2) assure that \n     such parents or third parties claims may be properly \n     administered by the VICP. Moreover, the ACCV believes that \n     further consideration should be given to review of whether \n     a third party's claim should be tied to the injured \n     party's claim in civil actions.\n       Section 205, ``Application'', is a conforming charge to \n     Section 203, and therefore, the ACCV does not concur with \n     this Section until the language in Section 203 is \n     sufficiently modified.\n\n\n           background on the vaccine safety datalink project\n\n       In order to enhance the understanding of rare adverse \n     effects of vaccines, CDC developed the Vaccine Safety \n     Datalink (VSD) project in 1990. This project is a \n     collaborative effort, which utilizes the databases of eight \n     large health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The database \n     contains comprehensive medical and immunization histories of \n     approximately 7.5 million children and adults. The VSD \n     enables vaccine safety research studies comparing prevalence \n     of health problems between unvaccinated and vaccinated \n     people. Over the past decade, the VSD has been used to answer \n     many vaccine-related questions, and has been used to support \n     policy changes that have reduced adverse effects from \n     vaccines.\n       Rep. Dan Burton, (R-IN), Chairman of the Committee on \n     Government Reform, requested any and all records collected \n     under the VSD and was prepared to subpoena the records if he \n     was not given access. The CDC and HMOs, understandably, do \n     not want to give this data to Rep. Burton because these \n     records include confidential patient information. For now, \n     Rep. Burton agreed to a compromise with CDC which would allow \n     an independent researcher to replicate or conduct a modified \n     analysis of a previous VSD study, while maintaining the \n     confidential nature of the data, but Rep. Burton has not \n     rescinded his threat of the subpoena. Therefore, the ACCV \n     makes the following recommendation:\n\n\n         recommendation on the vaccine safety datalink project\n\n       The Vaccine Safety Datalink Project (VSD) is a critical \n     component of our vaccine safety infrastructure. Participation \n     by health maintenance organizations in the VSD is predicated \n     on confidentiality of patient identifiers. In order to assure \n     the continued viability of the VSD, the privacy of individual \n     patient data must be protected. Therefore, the ACCV \n     recommends that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     take all steps necessary to protect the privacy of patient \n     data in order to ensure the continued support and viability \n     of this important project.\n       In conclusion, Mr. Secretary, we believe that the VICP \n     plays a critical role in our nation's childhood immunization \n     program, and we urge your immediate attention to our \n     concerns. The ACCV greatly appreciates your continued \n     support, and looks forward to your timely reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Elizabeth J. Noyes,\n                                                      Chair, ACCV.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. In part it says:\n\n       These claims have been filed against vaccine companies and, \n     in some instances, against health care providers. Thimerosal, \n     as you know, is approved for use by the Food and Drug \n     Administration and is part of the vaccine formulation when \n     licensed; hence clarification is needed to direct these \n     claims to the VICP before tort remedies can be pursued.\n\n  That is what the underlying bill does. That is what the Lieberman \namendment strips out.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics also wrote in support of this. \nI'll quote a final sentence from this letter of June 19, 2002:\n\n       The AAP has reviewed S. 2053 and has the following comments \n     beginning first and foremost with our strong support that all \n     claims for vaccine-related injury or death first must be \n     filed with the VICP.\n       In addition, we concur with the ACCV's most recent \n     recommendations in support of sections 204, 215, 216, 217 and \n     220.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The American Academy of Pediatrics \n     (AAP), and the 57,000 pediatricians we represent, greatly \n     appreciates your leadership and support of the various\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\n     immunization provisions outlined in your bill, S. 2053, the \n     Improved Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act. This \n     legislation addresses several issues of critical importance \n     to the Academy.\n\n\n                  vaccine injury compensation program\n\n       Enacted in the late 1980's, with the support and guidance \n     of the AAP, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program \n     (VICP) has helped to stabilize what was then and appears to \n     be again a fragile vaccine market. For the past 14 years, \n     this program has been successful in its efforts to ensure an \n     adequate supply of childhood vaccines, promote more research \n     and development of even safer and better vaccines and most \n     importantly to provide for a fair and just compensation \n     program for those that suffer vaccine-related injuries. \n     However, over time, as reflected in your legislative \n     proposal, some modifications are necessary to ensure that the \n     VICP is working at it full potential.\n       The AAP has reviewed S. 2053 and has the following comments \n     beginning first and foremost with our strong support that all \n     claims for vaccine-related injury or death first must be \n     filed with the VICP.\n       The Academy concurs with several sections of the bill, some \n     of which were previously proposed in 1999 by the Advisory \n     Committee on Vaccine Compensation (ACCV) and you have \n     incorporated in S. 2053. These include: Sections 206, 208, \n     209, 211, 212, 213 and 218. In addition, we concur with the \n     ACCV's most recent recommendations in support of sections \n     204, 215, 216, 217, and 220. The AAP is particularly pleased \n     that S. 2053 includes language that allows compensation for \n     family counseling, ongoing review of childhood vaccine data \n     and clarifies the definition of vaccines, manufacturers, and \n     vaccine-related injury or death.\n       The AAP, however, does have specific concerns about Section \n     203, ``Parent Petitions for Compensation,'' as currently \n     drafted. The AAP believes that petitions for compensation by \n     parents or third parties must be adjudicated through the VICP \n     and not through the judicial system. Moreover, in addition to \n     potential constitutional issues that this provision may \n     pose, we contend that such claims by parents should be \n     separate and apart from awards to the vaccine-injured \n     child. Although the issue of the compensation of parents \n     and third parties was initially raised during the drafting \n     of the VICP in the 1980's, it was rejected to maintain the \n     focus of the Act on providing appropriate and just \n     compensation that covers the life of the vaccine-injured \n     child. We believed then, as well as now, that this \n     approach is in the best interest of the child. The AAP \n     would suggest that consideration could be given to \n     providing, within the scope of the VICP, a provision for \n     the loss of consorrum that would be separate from the \n     award to the vaccine-injured child.\n       The AAP agrees with your identification in Section 207, of \n     the need for an adjustment to the award for a vaccine-related \n     death and for pain and suffering. However, we recommend a \n     modification to this section as written. Use of the Consumer \n     Price Index (CPI) to account for annual inflation in \n     providing these benefit awards had been the original intent \n     of Congress in drafting the VICP. The AAP encourages your \n     adoption of this approach that was also recommended in 2001 \n     by the ACCV. In 2002 dollars, such an award would be the \n     equivalent of an award of over $300,000.\n\n\n                   meningitis and influenza vaccines\n\n       The AAP supports your recommendation in Section 103 to \n     provide information to a variety of entities concerning \n     bacterial meningitis. We are ready to work with you to \n     implement these efforts.\n       This past June, the Advisory Committee of Immunization \n     Practices (ACIP) made the decision to expand the Vaccine for \n     Children (VFC) program coverage of the influenza vaccine to \n     all healthy children aged 6 to 23 months. This will take \n     effect March 1, 2003. As physicians, we are both aware that \n     this age group has a high likelihood of hospitalization if \n     they get the flu, therefore the availability of an adequate \n     supply of the influenza vaccine is critical. In addition, \n     this expanded recommendation means that adequate funding--\n     both public and private--is essential. The estimated first-\n     year costs of influenza vaccination of children, according to \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are $11.5 \n     million in the VFC program, $2.6 million in Section 317 \n     funds, and $1.42 million in state funds. This assumes \n     vaccination of 20% of children aged 6 to 23 months (most \n     requiring two doses), 15% of high-risk children aged 2 to 18 \n     years, and 5% of children living with high-risk household \n     contacts. These costs dramatically increase as we assume \n     higher vaccination coverage rates for these populations of \n     children. We applaud your support of increasing the supply of \n     the influenza vaccine (Section 101) and encourage your \n     proactive support to ensure sufficient public and private \n     funding to meet the need and demand of the pediatric \n     population. We should expect nothing less than, at a minimum, \n     coverage by the Medicaid program for our youngest citizens as \n     is received under Medicare for our senior citizens.\n\n\n                           immunization rates\n\n       The AAP appreciates the recognition of increasing \n     immunization rates and data collection especially for \n     adolescents as well as adults included in Section 102 of S. \n     2053. However, as pediatricians dedicated to the health, \n     safety and well being of infants, children, adolescents and \n     young adults we would be remiss if we also did not encourage \n     the inclusion of all infants and children in the collection \n     of data and in efforts to increase immunization rates. We \n     have made remarkable progress. Presently, the rates of \n     immunizations for children may well be at an all time high. \n     But we still have significant disparities and pockets of need \n     among rates of immunization for racial and ethnic groups. \n     This is further exacerbated by the potential impact that \n     vaccine shortages may have on the rates of immunizations. We \n     cannot allow complacency or less vigilance of rates for \n     infants and children at this critical time.\n\n\n                             vaccine supply\n\n       Although pediatricians over the years have encountered \n     brief childhood vaccine shortages nothing compares to the \n     most recent situation because of both the number of different \n     vaccines involved and the scarcity of the available supply. \n     For most of the first half of this year, the shortage of \n     vaccines included eight of the 11 diseases preventable \n     through routine vaccination of children. In many instances \n     these shortages and delays by necessity resulted in temporary \n     changes to immunization entry requirements for day care and \n     school. Until just recently the longest-standing significant \n     shortage was with the Td vaccine that began about a year ago \n     and affected the ability to give teens the booster Td they \n     need. Currently, the most serious shortage continues to be \n     with the new 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, \n     Prevnar). The AAP supports and appreciates the recognition in \n     Section 104 of the need to maintain a sufficient vaccine \n     supply. Moreover, we also support the discretionary authority \n     of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a \n     national vaccine stockpile for a minimum of six months and as \n     long as 12 months. This stockpile should include all of the \n     routine recommended childhood vaccines and certain other \n     vaccines that may be critical to the public's health such as \n     Hepatitis A and meningococcal.\n       Thank you for your commitment to an immunization strategy \n     that promotes the safety, efficacy as well as the adequacy of \n     the supply of vaccines for the nation. We look forward to \n     working with you as this legislation moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Louis Z. Cooper,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I will read from a statement by Dr. Timothy Doran, \ntestifying on behalf of AAP, to the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee earlier this year on behalf of the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, relating to these provisions. He testified it was \ncrucial:\n\n     to preserve and strengthen the liability protections for \n     consumers, manufacturers and physicians through the Vaccine \n     Injury Compensation Program. The VICP has been an integral \n     part of maintaining the vaccine market. Enacted in the last \n     1980's with the support and guidance of the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics the VICP has helped to stabilize what was then \n     and appears again to be a fragile vaccine market. We \n     reiterate our strong support that all claims for vaccine-\n     related injury or death must be filed first with the VICP. We \n     appreciate the intent of the legislative proposal put forth \n     by Sen. Frist and others to craft appropriate modifications \n     as necessary to ensure that the VICP is working to its full \n     potential.\n\n  Those are the provisions in the underlying bill. That is exactly what \nis in the homeland security legislation that would be stripped out by \nthe Lieberman amendment.\n  The effect of these provisions in this bill is important because of \nthe new era of bioterrorism, not knowing the direction the world is \nmoving, recognizing we are unprotected today from smallpox. We now have \na tremendous initiative by the administration, the private sector, and \nthe public sector. We have better coordination and better public health \ninfrastructure, better communication, better coordination. But at the \nend of the day, if smallpox is in your community and you know it, you \nknow where to go, that is good, but unless you have a health care \nprovider to put it on your arm, you are not protected. We do not know \nwhen it will hit again.\n  The fact the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines endorses these \nprovisions is important. The fact that the American Academy of \nPediatrics endorses these provisions is also important. This shows they \nare not just pulled out or from a single company or they have not been \nthought through by both trial lawyers and patients and families and \nproviders. We have heard the claims that these are not relevant to the \nunderlying bill. But at the end of the day, in this world where we are \nat risk from bioterrorism, germs, viruses, I guarantee, based on \neverything I know and everything I have read, it is critical we \nincrease our protection for these agents. That is what the underlying \nbill does.\n  The liability protections are important for health care providers. I \nargue,\n\n[[Page S11181]]\n\nalso, for the facilities where they are administered and the \nmanufacturers. If we allow out-of-control lawsuits to drive people out \nof the business of making these vaccines, no matter how good our \nresearch is, we will not be able to make vaccines which are critically \nimportant. We started with 12 companies and we are now down to 4 \ncompanies in the United States who make the vaccines. We have no \nguarantee they will stay in the business. They are unlikely to stay in \nthe business if the huge lawsuits hit them in a way that simply is not \nfavorably judged.\n  The provisions in the underlying bill only restate the original \nintent of Congress. They restate current law that individuals claiming \ninjury for covered vaccines must first file for compensation under the \nvaccine injury compensation program, the VICP. These sections state \nwhat really should be obvious. A vaccine itself is the sum total of all \nof its parts as determined by our Food and Drug Administration, and \nthat the manufacturers of vaccines include those who contribute to each \nof these various components. We have the vaccine, the components, the \nmanufacturers who make the vaccine, and also the people who make the \ncomponents.\n  Nothing in this language takes away one's right to sue. These \nprovisions simply clarify and restate current law which requires all \nclaims of injury related to a vaccine covered by the compensation \nprogram must first go through the compensation program before a lawsuit \ncan be filed. There is much more that needs to be done, I believe in a \nmore comprehensive way, but these provisions take the first step in a \ntimely way, when time certainly matters.\n  In the long run, it is critical to expand the vaccine market for a \nwhole range of microorganisms we are not protected from. We need to \nprovide greater access to their vaccines. We need to be able to look \nthe parents in the eye and say, when you take your child to the doctor \nor the public health center, those children, as well as all Americans, \nare not going to be in some way turned away by a barrier that we failed \nto address in the Senate. That is why a vaccine provision is necessary, \nis necessary now, is necessary in this homeland security bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a consent in order for debate only \nuntil 1:30 p.m. There are numerous Senators who wish to speak. I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for debate only be extended until 3 \no'clock today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to discuss the amendment proposed \nby the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman. First, I commend the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, not only for his amendment but \nalso for his work on this very important legislation. He introduced \nthis legislation months ago, even before the administration recognized \nthe need for a homeland security bill. He has brought to the floor a \nvery well-crafted, well-balanced, thoughtful piece of legislation, a \nproduct of deliberation over many months. It is disheartening at this \nmoment to see a piece of legislation that has arisen in the last couple \nof days, almost 500 pages long, with greater omissions but also \nincluding what I argue in certain cases to be are extraneous \nprovisions.\n  One of the provisions at issue is the of curtailing the ongoing \ndiscussion about the scope of the vaccine injury compensation program. \nWe have a situation where vaccine manufacturers included a \npreservative, Thimerosal. This preservative has been alleged to have \ncaused medical harm; it has not been scientifically proven. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee has indicated the Institute of Medicine has suggested \nthere is no causal link between Thimerosal and autism or other \nchildhood diseases. Yet there is ongoing litigation to determine if \nthis, in fact, is a causal factor.\n  In a homeland security bill designed to focus our attention on the \nmost urgent and dramatic threats to the United States, we find a very \ntransparent attempt by at least one manufacturer to curtail potential \nliability because of their products. Frankly, there is no other \nrationale for putting this one provision in the legislation. It is \ninappropriate to be included in this legislation. It certainly does not \nraise the urgency of the issues the Senator from Tennessee discussed in \nterms of smallpox protection or potential for a mass casualty crisis \nbecause of the use of a biological agent.\n  In point of fact, Thimerosal was withdrawn from use in vaccines in \n1999. So this is not a situation where we have to act today, in this \nvery critical legislation, to ensure that manufacturers will continue \nto use this material. In fact, quite the contrary, this material, \nalthough no one has established a definitive link to any particular \ndisease, has been voluntarily withdrawn from inclusion in vaccines.\n  So what we have is a situation where allegations have been made by \nparents of children that this preservative caused a disease in their \nchild. And as the Senator from Tennessee rightly pointed out, in 1987 \nCongress enacted the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program as a no-fault \nalternative to the tort system for resolving these types of claims. The \nprocedure for the compensation program is that you must first go \nthrough this system of evaluation of your claim and determination of \naward, if any, before you are allowed to pursue your claim in court.\n  What has occurred in this situation is that families have alleged \nthat this particular element, Thimerosal, is not covered under the \nVaccine Injury Compensation Program because, even though it is an \ningredient listed on the label, was a contaminant or adulterant and, as \na result, is not included in the scope of the VICP. That is a legal \nissue. That legal issue is being decided as we speak.\n  In fact, the VICP has requested that the Special Master of the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims consider this question, and the Special Master \nis currently deliberating the issue, but has not yet ruled.\n  So here we are, at the 11th hour of this legislative session, trying \nto pass a homeland security bill. And what we find, mysteriously and \nsurprisingly, is a provision in the bill that would short circuit the \nongoing litigation, that would thrust our view on the courts. And, \nfrankly, I suspect the Special Master has a much more attuned notion of \nwhat are the permutations, what are the consequences, what are the \nlegal precedents of concluding whether or not Thimerosal is covered \nunder the VICP, than we have on this floor.\n  Again, this is reduced quite easily, quite simply, quite \ntransparently, to an attempt by an industry to insert, within a bill \nthat is deemed to be absolutely necessary to pass, a provision that \nshort circuits all of the legal discussion and potentially short \ncircuits the rights of parents to recover the full compensatory and \nother damages that they deserve because of their child's illness.\n  None of this has been settled in terms of scientific cause and \neffect. But procedurally I think we have to, in short, allow the \nprocess to take place. It is not uncommon--in fact, it is quite \ncommon--that there are disputes about the interpretation of a \nparticular statute, the coverage of a particular statute. But we \nseldom--unless of course there are very well connected and influential \nproponents--we seldom pick out these items for legislative relief prior \nto any type of judicial conclusion. So I suggest, particularly with \nregard to this matter--the striking of these specific provisions--is \nappropriate.\n  Indeed, one wonders why we are spending time debating this issue on a \nhomeland security bill when in fact there are so many other needs that \ndeserve our attention and deliberation. Many of my colleagues have \nsuggested that, not just with regard to what is in this bill but, \nfrankly, the need to support more vigorously those programs and \npolicies that we already have in place might take precedence over \nsimply recreating and reshuffling the deck in terms of the organization \nof the Federal Government with respect to homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lieberman's efforts, at least \nto eliminate these items which are entirely extraneous to the homeland \nsecurity bill, and in fact fall far from the urgency that is so \napparent, appropriately, in the homeland security bill.\n  A final point I should say, and I think my colleague from Tennessee\n\n[[Page S11182]]\n\nsaid it so well, is that the issue of access to vaccines is a very \ncritical issue that warrants our close attention. I was fortunate \nenough to chair a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee in which the General Accounting Office testified \nabout existing obstacles to a dependable and adequate supply of \nvaccines for children. The Senator from Tennessee, with his unique \nperspective as a physician, not only has been helpful but has taken a \nvery prominent role, working with others and myself, in developing a \ncomprehensive approach. That comprehensive approach might require an \nexamination of the VICP program. It certainly might also require \nvaccine stockpiles, notification by manufacturers, if they chose not to \nproduce a vaccine, so that our public health authorities know prior to \nthe onset of a particular shortage that you will have one, two, three, \nor four manufacturers in the market to meet the demand.\n  So I would argue that a comprehensive approach to maintaining the \nsupply of vaccine is important. The Senator from Tennessee has been \nworking on it. I have been working on it. But that is not what we are \ntalking about this afternoon. We are not talking about protecting the \nAmerican public in a systematic, comprehensive way by ensuring that \nvaccines are available. What we are talking about today is a special \ninterest provision that short circuits ongoing litigation involving a \nproduct that is no longer being used as a preservative. It is not about \nwhat we need to do today to protect ourselves from the very real threat \nof bioterrorism. Frankly, my assumption was, when we came to the floor \nto talk about the homeland security bill, we would be talking about \nwhat we need to do today to protect this country in the future.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lieberman, to recognize \nthis bill would be much improved by adopting the provisions he has \nsuggested.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, we have heard hours and weeks of \ndebate on the Senate floor on this legislation. Among the principal \narguments of some of the opponents of this bill is that President Bush \nand his administration cannot be trusted. I think the election last \nweek proved that many Americans do believe our President can be \ntrusted. He is a man of character. He is a man of integrity. He says \nwhat he means, and he means what he says.\n  I think an example of that was--if you recall, there were many people \nwho were opposed to the passage of the Iraq resolution by the Senate. \nMany of the calls I got in opposition to it were from folks who \nbelieved the President, if the resolution passed, would peremptorily go \ninto Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein.\n  I think all of us were quite impressed with his patience and the \ndiplomacy of Secretary of State Powell that somehow was able to get \nthrough a very strong resolution in the Security Council that will \nfinally enforce Iraq's compliance with those 16 previous resolutions of \nthe United Nations.\n  I think we do have a President who can be trusted. I think that is \nthe basis of this legislation. It is not perfect, but I am confident it \nwill not be abused. It is not, as some say, an encroachment on \nlegislative branch prerogatives, as I have heard some contend.\n  Madam President, I rise today to talk about an issue of critical \nimportance to our Republic, and that is the urgent need for Federal \ncivil service reform. I came to this floor earlier this fall to discuss \nhow civil service reform can improve our ability to secure the \nhomeland, and I rise again today because this issue remains at the crux \nof our renewed debate on the homeland security legislation.\n  As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee and chairman and \nranking member of the Oversight of Government Management subcommittee, \nI have worked to focus the spotlight on this issue since I came to the \nSenate 4 years ago. During the course of 12 hearings and numerous \nmeetings with national leaders in management and public policy, it \nbecame crystal clear that we were in the midst of a human capital \ncrisis in the U.S. Government. Moreover, it became clear that this \ncrisis is growing and will only get worse unless this Congress acts \ndecisively to address it.\n  Some people still ask what the human capital crisis is, how serious \nis it, and whether it really threatens the operations of the Federal \nGovernment. The human capital crisis is, simply stated, the inability \nof the Federal Government to properly manage its workforce. Robust \npersonnel management includes the ability to recruit the best \ncandidates, hire people in a timely manner, award performance bonuses \nand other motivational tools to provide training and professional \ndevelopment opportunities and the flexibilities to shape a balanced \nworkforce. Good management includes the flexibility to act quickly and \nto compete as an employer of choice in this fast-paced 21st century \nknowledge economy.\n  Madam President, I believe that if a Federal agency or department is \nimportant enough to receive the hard-earned tax dollars of my \nconstituents and yours, we have a moral responsibility to see to it \nthat the people's money is spent wisely. Outdated personnel practices \nand lack of training not only put agencies at risk of not being able to \nfulfill their mission and providing needed services to the American \npeople, they also represent wasteful spending. We simply must provide \nthe flexibility agencies need and give them the right tools to do their \nwork.\n  Within 2 years, more than 50 percent of the 1.8 million person \nFederal workforce will be eligible for early or regular retirement. It \nis virtually impossible to predict accurately the amount of experience \nand institutional knowledge that is literally going to walk out the \ndoor by the end of the decade. That is why it is not only right to \nfocus attention on our human capital crisis, it is essential.\n  Unfortuantely, until recent months, very few Members of Congress have \npaid much attention to this growing set of challenges.\n  Now, as the Senate is considering legislation designed to reorganize \nthe Federal Government in a way that will help secure our Nation \nagainst future terrorist attacks, civil service reform is front and \ncenter. This issue, which for years has not been substantively \naddressed, is of paramount importance in the consideration of the most \nsignificant government reorganization to take place in our Nation in \nhalf a century. It's about time.\n  Congress last enacted major civil service legislation for the entire \nFederal Government 24 years ago in 1978. To operate effectively, the \nFederal Government cannot afford to revise its personnel laws only \nevery quarter century. So much has changed over the years, and changing \ntimes require new thinking and new laws--policies that allow \nflexibility in our Federal government's civil service system.\n  During the 107th Congress, I have worked with some of the Nation's \npremier experts on public management to determine what new \nflexibilities are necessary to create a world-class 21st century \nFederal workforce. These include: the Council for Excellence in \nGovernment, Partnership for Public Service, Private Sector Council, \nBrookings Institution, National Academy of Public Administration, and \nthe Volcker Commission; Administration officials including OPM Director \nKay James, and former OMB Deputy Director and current NASA \nAdministrator, Sean O'Keefe; and representatives of federal employee \ngroups like Bobby Harnage of the American Federation of Government \nEmployees, Colleen Kelley of the National Treasury Employees Union, and \nCarol Bonosaro of the Senior Executives' Association. I am grateful for \nthe respective and recommendations all of these groups provided and we \ndrafted our legislation based on their insights.\n  Our bill, S. 2651, the Federal Workforce Improvement Act of 2002, \nwhich I introduced with Senators Thompson and Cochran, is designed to \nget the right people with the right skills in the right jobs at the \nright time. It is a consensus package of human capital reforms that I \nbelieve will have a positive impact on the Federal Government's \npersonnel management.\n  Working closely with Senator Akaka, I successfully amended key \nprovisions of this bill to the homeland security legislation during its \nconsideration by the Governmental Affairs Committee in July. I am \ngrateful for the support that Senator Akaka provided as we adopted \nthose important government-\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nwide personnel flexibilities. I only wish we had put more of S. 2651 in \nthe homeland security bill. We need to get it all done.\n  Next year, I intend to introduce these provisions again, as well as \nother human capital legislation that was not enacted this year. For \nexample S. 1817, which would make Federal student loan forgiveness \nbenefits tax-free; S. 1913, the Digital Tech Corps Act, which would \nestablish a public-private exchange program for IT professionals, and \nS. 2765, the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Equity and Reform Act, which \nwould create an employee exchange program between Federal agencies that \nperform law enforcement functions and state and local law enforcement \nagencies. These bills would strengthen the performance of our Federal \nworkforce throughout the government.\n  In the 108th Congress, I also intend to take a closer look at \ncompensation issues, especially for the Federal law enforcement \ncommunity. Serious recruitment and retention challenges have been a \nproblem at agencies such as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies \nfor a long time and we simply have to address this issue.\n  The governmentwide human capital provisions we have already included \nin the homeland security legislation will have an impact not only on \nthe new department, but on all Federal agencies. Our language will help \nthe Federal Government begin to address its human capital challenges--\nchallenges that extend far beyond the corridors of the proposed \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The language does the following:\n  It creates Chief Human Capital Officers at the Federal Government's \n24 largest departments and agencies--officials who will have \nresponsibility for selecting, developing, training and managing a high-\nquality workforce;\n  And, it establishes an interagency Chief Human Capital Officers \nCouncil, chaired by the OPM Director, to advise and coordinate the \npersonnel functions of each agency and meet with union representatives \nat least annually.\n  In other words, we are giving human capital a much higher priority in \nthe Federal Government, just as it is given in most corporations that \nare successful.\n  It requires OPM to design a set of systems, including metrics, for \nassessing agencies' human capital management, something that has been \nlargely ignored;\n  It reforms the competitive service hiring process, allowing agencies, \nconsistent with merit principles (including veterans' preference), to \nuse an alternative category ranking method for selecting new employees \ninstead of the ``Rule of 3,'' making the process more efficient and \nfair--a practice that has been very successful at the Department of \nAgriculture for the past decade;\n  It provides government wide authority for offering voluntary \nseparation incentive payments and voluntary early retirement \n(``buyouts'' and ``early outs'') for the purposes of workforce \nreshaping, not downsizing. This authority, which I was able to secure \nwith legislation three years ago, is currently being used effectively \non a limited basis at the Department of Defense;\n  It lifts the total annual compensation cap for senior executives, \nallowing performance bonuses to be paid in full in a single year;\n  And, it reduces restrictions on providing academic degree training to \nFederal employees, thereby emphasizing the importance of individual \nprofessional development.\n  All of these things I just talked about are not only going to impact \nthe homeland security department, but they are governmentwide. All \nagencies will be able to take advantage of these provisions in the \nhomeland security bill.\n  In light of the fact that there has not been government-wide civil \nservice reform in a quarter century and, as the Hart-Rudman Commission \nnoted just last year, personnel is the basis for maintaining national \nsecurity, it is absolutely appropriate that this legislation be \nincluded in the bill to create the Department of Homeland Security. In \nfact, in testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, former Defense Secretary and member of the Commission, \nJames Schlesinger noted:\n\n       . . . it is the Commission's view that fixing the personnel \n     problem is a precondition for fixing virtually everything \n     else that needs repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. \n     national security policy.\n\n  If we do not fix the personnel problem, we are not going to be able \nto fix anything else that is wrong with the system.\n  I thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for including these \nimportant provisions in the compromise language we are considering \ntoday.\n  The Homeland Security Department is not the first--and not the last--\nagency that needs to have greater flexibility. Flexibilities and \nreforms, similar to those proposed in the compromise language for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, which I will describe in a moment, are \nneeded throughout the executive branch.\n  I would like to take a few moments now to discuss the personnel \nprovisions in the compromise language that apply specifically to the \nnew department. As I said, I have worked with Republicans and Democrats \non these provisions and I believe this language will provide the \nDepartment with the tools it needs to get the job done, and at the same \ntime will respect the rights of those union workers being transferred \ninto the new department.\n  First, the compromise language includes the House-passed language \nproposed by Representatives Connie Morella and Chris Shays with an \nadditional provision that I have recommended. This language would, for \nthe first time, limit the current authority of the President to exclude \nan agency or agency subdivision from participation in a collective \nbargaining unit.\n  Under current law, the President may exclude participation in a \ncollective bargaining unit upon determining that the entity has as a \nprimary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or \nnational security work and that permitting the entity to have \ncollective bargaining rights would be inconsistent with national \nsecurity requirements and considerations.\n  The compromise language would limit the President's current authority \nonly with regard to the new department. It would prohibit the President \nfrom using the exclusionary authority unless the mission and \nresponsibilities of a transferred agency materially change and a \nmajority of the employees within such an agency have as their primary \nduty intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work directly \nrelated to terrorism. So in effect, we have limited the President's \nauthority to exclude employees from union membership.\n  The language does provide, however, that the President could waive \nthe above limitations on his authority if he determines in writing that \ntheir use would have a substantial adverse impact on the department's \nability to protect homeland security. If he does this, I presume he \nwill do it under this provision.\n\n  We have also added some language I have proposed requiring that if \nthe President does not execute his authority under the Morella \nlanguage, he must notify Congress at least 10 days prior to the \nissuance of his written order. This will bring the light of day into \nhis decisionmaking process. I don't expect him to do it, but I think \nthat is one way we can guarantee that such action will not be arbitrary \nand capricious.\n  The second compromise provision in this bill was proposed by \nRepresentatives Jack Quinn and Rob Portman over in the House. I want \neveryone to understand this so they can see how much more limited this \nbill is than what the President originally sent us.\n  That initial proposal featured a personnel system that was similar to \nthe one established last fall for the Transportation Security \nAdministration, which waived most of title 5. Of course, the Homeland \nSecurity Department, the President realized Congress would flesh out \nhis proposal, and that is what happened. This legislation we are \nconsidering would create a new agency under title 5, allowing \nmodifications in only six areas.\n  The House-passed version is less flexible than what the \nadministration wanted, but it is designed to deal with the personnel \nflexibility sought by the President, and to address the collective \nbargaining rights that many of our colleagues seek to protect, \nincluding me.\n\n[[Page S11184]]\n\n  This language would preserve employee rights, including hiring and \npromotion based on merit and equal pay for equal work, and would \nprotect employees from improper political influence and reprisal for \nwhistleblowing. Employees would still be protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, such as illegal discrimination, politicized hiring \nor promotion processes, and violation of veterans' preference \nrequirements.\n  Furthermore, employees would still have the right to organize, \nbargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of \ntheir own choosing in decisions that affect them.\n  The compromise language requires the new Department collaborate with \nunions and other employee organizations in creating its personnel \nsystem. The language also improves the arbitration process by ensuring \nboth employees and management concerns are fully and publicly vetted.\n  If a collective bargaining unit disagrees with a management proposal \nrelated to one of the 6 areas subject to modification, the union \nrepresentative would have 30 days to consult with agency management on \nrule changes and offer recommendations. If agreement is not reached, \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security could declare an impasse and submit \nthe dispute to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a \nprocess that could last an additional 30 days. At the conclusion of \nthat period, the Secretary could proceed with the proposed changes, \nregardless of the mediator's recommendations.\n  Again, this is very much like the language I added requiring the \nPresident to make public his decision if he waives the Morella \nlanguage. In this case, at the beginning of the 30-day arbitration \nperiod, the differences between collective bargaining unit employees \nand management would be established so everyone would know what the \ndifferences are. In other words, if there is a difference of opinion, \nit is aired publicly. It is not going to be hidden somewhere. We are \nall going to know about it. The American people will know about it, and \nCongress will know about it.\n  After the 30-day period, the differences would be resolved. At the \nend of the total of 60 days, it is over.\n  I would have been open to more robust participation of the Federal \nMediation and Conciliation Service or another third-party mediator in \nresolving disagreements over title 5 modifications. However, the system \nestablished by this legislation is a compromise, and I support it.\n  The real test of this language is going to be how the administration \nhandles work rule changes, whether or not disputes are handled openly, \nand the unions' concerns treated fairly. It will be imperative for the \nadministration to demonstrate its commitment to an open and fair \nprocess in a spirit of cooperation rather than confrontation with the \nunions.\n  If we do not resolve some of the differences between the \nadministration and the unions, the chances of this new agency being \nsuccessful are remote. And I have encouraged the President to meet with \nBobby Harnage and with Colleen Kelley.\n  As a mayor and Governor, I went through reorganizations, and I \nlearned that you cannot get it done unless you have built trust with \nyour labor union members.\n  I would like to make one final observation on this bill before us \ntoday. We should not sacrifice the good for the perfect. I recognize \nMembers on both sides of the aisle have some concerns about certain \nprovisions. So do I. For example, I disagree with the language that \nwill transfer the first responder program from its current location in \nFEMA to the new Department's Border Security Directorate rather than \nthe Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate. That does not make \nsense to me. Nevertheless, the legislation before us to create a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I think, overall, is a good bill, and \nI intend to vote for it.\n  I have been one of the leaders on civil service reform during the \nlast two sessions of Congress. I believe I have probably dedicated more \ntime than any other Senator to addressing the Federal Government's \npersonnel needs. I have tried to raise the profile of this issue, and \nthen to work in good faith with all interested parties to develop \nsolutions.\n  Based on my work, I want my colleagues to know I feel that the \npersonnel provisions in the compromise language can go a long way \ntowards putting personnel management in the executive branch back on \ntrack.\n  I urge the passage of this very important bill. We have to get on \nwith it. It is going to take time to establish this new department. We \nhave to secure the homeland. We need to get going.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Ohio \nfor his very thoughtful and important comments in which he reached to a \ndeeper level, which I was going to do, but now I do not feel the need \nto because he spoke of the importance for good working relations \nbetween management and those who work with management, particularly in \na field as important as homeland security.\n  I rise today to lend my support to the Homeland Security Act. I thank \nSenator Lieberman for taking really the lead, before anybody else did, \non this issue and for his tireless work to bring the new Department to \nthe point it is today. I think it is a remarkable feat on his part.\n  I also would be remiss in not thanking my senior colleague from West \nVirginia, with whom I disagree on this important issue, but who has, \nnevertheless, led the opposition with clarity, with conviction, and \npassion.\n  In the end, I am glad it now appears we will be able to answer the \nPresident's call to pass this legislation, and to do so before we \nadjourn this session.\n  The tragedies of September 11, and the continuing terrorist threat to \nour Nation, demand powerful and decisive action from us and from the \nPresident.\n  He has asked this Congress, after the leadership of Senator \nLieberman, to support him by creating a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I think we should do that. The President believes this \nmassive reorganization of government, combining our currently \nfragmented homeland security functions into a single Cabinet-level \nagency, makes sense.\n  Anybody who thinks we are prepared, no matter what reports you read--\nincluding the most recent ones--that we are prepared to handle attacks \nof any sort, is just greatly wrong. In each of our individual States, \nas you look at hospitals and police departments, and all the rest, we \nknow that is the case.\n  So I think a single Cabinet-level agency is crucial in providing this \nNation and its citizens with the protection they deserve.\n  I agree this historic reorganization is a bold and necessary step \nthat we, as lawmakers, must take, quite frankly, in order to be \nfaithful to our first and foremost duty as lawmakers--I do not think \nthis is generally understood by the American people--because our first \nand foremost duty as lawmakers is the guaranteeing of the safety of \npeople we represent in our individual States, and also throughout the \ncountry.\n  I hope all who are present will recognize this is but a first step. \nThis is going to be an extraordinarily complicated evolution.\n  When the Aviation Security Act was passed not very long after \nSeptember 11, it became the assumption of the American people that all \nairport security would be in place, ready to go, with all of the \nequipment and people trained, within a matter of months. I said from \nthe very beginning it was probably a matter of 3 to 4 to 5 years before \nwe would arrive at a point where we had the kind of aviation security, \nthe training, personnel, and the equipment that we needed.\n  People have to understand all of this is going to take time, but you \ncan't start the clock running unless you pass a bill to get homeland \nsecurity going.\n  I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that this new \nDepartment will solve all of our security problems at home. I hope we \nwill remember the lessons of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which \nbasically made the largest previous reorganization of Government--that \nis, the creation of the Department of Defense in 1947--a working \nreality. I strongly believe this new Department of Homeland Security \nwill be a work in progress; that the public has to understand it is a \nwork in progress; that you cannot take 170,000 people, meld them \ntogether, create a whole new series of\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\nlayers of intelligence agencies, and expect them all to work very \ncrisply together, when they don't work crisply together now. \nNevertheless, there needs to be a central point. I believe in that \nfirmly.\n  So with the understanding it is a work in progress, we will, \ntherefore, have to shepherd its ongoing development, and we will.\n  Although the homeland security act should not be mistaken for the \ndefinitive answer for all of our security woes, I believe it is a \nstrong piece of legislation with a lot of potential to serve its \npurpose and all of us and the people we represent well.\n  The Department we are creating is strikingly similar to the original \nproposals both the White House and Senate introduced last summer. It \nhas been some time since then.\n  The new Department will combine the functions of 22 Federal agencies \nand subagencies. Again, this will be complicated. There will be all \nkinds of problems. We have to assume that. That is not a bad thing. \nThat is the evolution of anything that large that takes place, whether \nit is in business or in government; change, reorganization of that \nsort, does not happen quickly.\n  By placing these agencies and all of their people in one new \nDepartment, we should foster much better communication--it will take \ntime--eliminate internal redundancies--that will take time--and greatly \nimprove our ability to detect, respond to, and recover from future \nactions from terrorism.\n  The new Department is intended to be a cooperative environment in \nwhich intelligence from all sources is brought together, analyzed, and \nthen used more efficiently than in the past, guiding the customers, as \nthe term is used, which is the President and his National Security \nCouncil, allowing us a much clearer view of all threats from whatever \nsource against America.\n  The Department is charged with carefully coordinating with State and \nlocal governments, none of which is prepared at this point to handle \nwhat could very well and probably will be confronting them. As well, I \nmight say, private industry faces this same challenge. Some have \nresponded, most have not, partly because they don't know what to do. \nSecondly, the economy is not strong, and they don't feel they can do \nthat now. But their condition will be much worse if they don't. So to \nthem we have to collect and pass along threat information. They have to \nrespond. This whole system has to begin to function in a rational way.\n\n  This is the most serious subject we could be discussing in the Halls \nof this Congress. Border security should be greatly improved under the \nnew agency. Our ability to prevent chemical and biological and \nradiological and nuclear threats may be stronger than ever before. We \nhave to make sure that is the case.\n  In the event the horrors of terrorism, in fact, visit our shores \nagain, as I think they will, the new Department should be better \nequipped to respond with disaster relief.\n  However, we must not forget that many of the assets that we will need \nto respond to disaster or terrorism will continue to reside in agencies \nwhich are outside of the homeland security bill. The one that comes to \nmy mind is, of course, the Veterans' Administration, which is the \nlargest health care system in this country. That whole system is going \nto have to be not incorporated in the bill but incorporated into the \nprocess which I hope this bill will engender of its own force and \nmomentum.\n  I have confidence in this act. I nevertheless would like to go on \nrecord as saying that clearly it does not do everything that I and many \nof my colleagues, including the Chair, to whom I am particularly \ngrateful, wanted. I regret that we were unable to work effectively to \ncreate a new Department where dedicated employees are guaranteed the \ncivil service protection to which they are entitled. However, having \nsaid that, I think that, as the Senator from Ohio said in his very \npowerful and deep speech, I have to believe our President will act \nwisely, partly because of the light that will be on him, partly because \nof the situation, partly because of the need for workers to be happy \nand to be doing their work well, assuming the flexibility that we give \nhim only when he really needs that, and that he will be wise in that \nrespect.\n  So with this act, Congress and the White House have cooperated to \nmake a powerful statement to our citizens as well as to our enemies. We \nwill work together to ensure that the American people are as free as \npossible from terror and as free as possible from the fear of \nterrorism.\n  I am very thankful to have been able to play a role in the creation \nof the Department. I look forward to playing a continuing role, as I \nindicated, in watching this development in sort of a congressional \noversight mode.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with their support of this homeland \nsecurity act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take to the floor to talk about where we \nare in the homeland security bill, and to call attention to some \nspecial interest provisions added to this bill in the hope that the \nAmerican people will take a look at what is happening to their country.\n  As Senator Voinovich has stated, Osama bin Laden is still alive. \nWhile we cannot be positive of that, it appears that he is still alive. \nCertainly, al-Qaida is alive and certainly al-Qaida is working full \ntime to hurt us--meaning the American people. That we know. The world \nis a terribly dangerous place.\n  Taking care of America is crucial. That is why I was so stunned and \nupset when the President refused to spend $5.1 billion that this \nCongress gave him for homeland security to ensure that our ports are \nmore secure, to ensure that our nuclear power plants are safe, to \nensure that our chemical plants are safe, to ensure that our airports \nare safer, and to speed up development of necessary vaccines. I was \nstunned when the President did what he did.\n  I was also stunned when he opposed the idea of making the Homeland \nSecurity Department a Cabinet position. Stunned. Only after Senator \nLieberman and his committee had voted out a bill--at least the \nCommittee Democrats did--did the President decided he wanted to support \nthis concept.\n  We know one thing about September 11th. We know that the CIA and the \nFBI were not speaking to each other. We know that they were not \ncommunicating with each other. And yet there is not one thing in this \nhomeland security bill that addresses that issue.\n  The homeland security bill tinkers around the edges with creating new \nways for the intelligence community to let the Homeland Security \nDirector know what is happening. But we do not get to the heart of that \ncultural problem that exists between these agencies. That is amazing to \nme, since we know one thing--that there was a breakdown in \ncommunication between these two agencies.\n  I also happen to believe that massive reorganization is generally an \ninvitation to chaos and more bureaucracy. I began my political career a \nlong time ago in a small county of about 200,000 people. We found that \nwhen you combine agencies in the name of trying to be efficient, \noftentimes you have less accountability. That is what is happening \nhere--combining all of these agencies, with some 170,000 people, \ncreating all kinds of subheads, and so on and so forth.\n  So I am very worried. I hope to be proven wrong because this bill \nwill pass, but I am worried that there will be less accountability \nrather than more. That is why I supported the Byrd amendment, way back \nwhen we started this debate, which would create a Cabinet level \nHomeland Security Director and a streamlined Homeland Security \nDepartment, with people who would be held accountable, and with a way \nfor the Congress to continue to play a role as we develop this very \nimportant agency. I thought that would have been the way to go. I was \nproud to stand with Robert Byrd on his amendment.\n  I happen to believe in my heart of hearts that the President's change \nof heart about the need for a homeland security department had a lot to \ndo with the fact that he is very interested in stripping away worker \nprotections. I have to believe that deep in my heart. Why do I say \nthat? Because of his actions. Of the 170,000 people in the new \nDepartment, only 40,000 of them have worker protection, that is all. \nThere are people at the bottom of the barrel,\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\nin terms of pay; the secretaries, the janitors, the file clerks. I \ndon't understand--and I have said this before on the floor of the \nSenate--why a President who calls himself ``compassionate'' would want \nto take away the most minimum of rights from such people, endanger \ntheir level of health care. I don't understand why this President would \nhave held up this bill all this time for that.\n  Now there is a compromise. I am glad a few more protections are \nadded. That is good. But I don't know how a person who says he is \ncompassionate could go after people who have the most minimal job \nprotections. They don't have the right to strike. No Federal employee \nhas the right to strike. They can scarcely collectively bargain given \nthe provisions of this bill. That, to me, is a sour note in this debate \nand continues to weigh on my heart--that maybe this President changed \nhis mind, in part, because of this ``opportunity'' to take after these \nworkers. It is really a sad thing to me.\n  If we look at the economy today--and I know my colleague from West \nVirginia gets this because he talks to me about it all the time--it is \na tough economy we have. The fact is, in the last couple of years, as \nthe President came into power, we have seen a tremendous loss of \nprivate sector jobs. More jobs have been lost than at any time in 50 \nyears. We know what is happening to people's retirement security \nbecause of the stock market, with the worst performance in more than 50 \nyears. People are frightened. So why do you go after 40,000 workers and \ngive them insecurity?\n  We heard yesterday that the President is going to move more than \n800,000 jobs into the private sector from the Federal Government--more \nthan 800,000 jobs. At a time when people are feeling insecurity, he is \ngoing to throw them out into the marketplace where they will have very \nlittle security. There is something missing here that is upsetting to \nme.\n\n  So here we are. In my opinion, we have a bad choice to make when we \nfinally vote on homeland security. I will make what I consider to be \nthe best of that bad choice--a choice between no homeland security bill \nand one that I believe was thrown together in a way that is going to \nmake it less accountable and is going to hit a lot of bumps in the \nroad. Taking FEMA and putting it in there--what will happen when we \nhave an earthquake in California? What is going to happen with the \nCoast Guard when they have to do search and rescue? These are troubling \nquestions to me.\n  We will have that choice to make. That is life. We often don't have \ngreat choices here, and we will make that decision. But one thing I \nknow I am going to vote for with great pride on Monday is the Daschle-\nLieberman amendment.\n  I see a couple of colleagues on the floor who care about these \nissues, and I want to recognize my friend from Michigan, who called us \ntogether today to explore the ramifications of a particular rider that \nwas added in the dead of night. I will explain it, and I hope she will \nengage me in a bit of a colloquy.\n  In the dead of night, with no one watching, after we thought we had \nmade the compromise on these workers, a few things were snuck into this \nbill. A big campaign contributor of the Republican Party was rewarded \nphenomenally. A provision was added to the homeland security bill that \nprotected that big contributor but it has nothing to do with homeland \nsecurity or protecting the American people. In fact, I say that this \nprovision which was added will create insecurity in our homeland by \nsending a message to thousands of families that their children's health \ntakes a distant second to the interests of large, wealthy, powerful \ncorporate America.\n  Let me explain. In my State of California, autism--a very haunting \nand mysterious brain disorder--has increased an astonishing 273 percent \nover the last decade and a half. Dr. Neil Halsey, a respected \npediatrician and an expert in vaccination, for years said there was no \nconnection between vaccines and autism. I am quoting from an article \nthat appeared in Sunday's New York Times. There is ``some real risk to \nchildren,'' he said, ``from vaccines that contain mercury. It is used \nas a preservative in some of these vaccines.''\n  So what provisions did the Republicans put into the bill? A provision \nthat holds harmless the company that produces Thimerosal, a mercury-\nbased preservatives for vaccines.\n  What does that have to do with homeland security? Absolutely nothing. \nChildhood vaccines have nothing to do at all with homeland security. \nWhat does it mean if this stands and we don't have the guts to strip it \nout? What does it mean to real people who are fighting this disease? \nMany of the families have filed class action lawsuits because--if you \nhave ever seen an autistic child, although their symptoms range from \nmild to severe, in severe cases you are talking about essentially 24-\nhour care for that child. What will these families have to do? They \nwill have to go to a taxpayer fund--a compensation fund that taxpayers \npay for--which has very little money left in it, which is capped at an \namount that will never pay for the cost of raising a child with this \nterrible disease.\n  We heard testimony on the House side that some families trying to \ncollect from this compensation fund have had to fight for 10 years to \nreceive their awards.\n  All the while, if this special interest rider passes, the companies \nthat cause the problems will continue about their business. There is a \nlot about this rider which is upsetting and disturbing.\n  First of all, how would you feel if you were a parent of a young \nchild and all of a sudden, without any science, you have a liability \nwaiver for this mercury compound? They are going to think: My goodness, \nif the Republicans--the Bush administration--is protecting their \nbiggest contributors, maybe they know something we do not know; that \nthis is really a problem because why would they bother doing it if they \nwere not worried?\n  This has nothing to do with homeland security. If it did, they would \nhave said smallpox vaccines; they would have cited the vaccines.\n  There are moments when I wonder why we are here if we are not willing \nto stand up and fight for the American people. The special interests, \nthe powerful interests have so much behind them. They can so easily \nhire the lawyers they need, the representatives they need to come here \nto lobby. But the average family that gets struck with this type of a \ntragedy, all they have is the love in their family to get them through. \nWhat are we doing here? We have to help these people, not have a \nspecial interest provision that is put in in the dead of night that \nsays to them: We do not care about you; we do not care about your kids; \nand if you have to suffer through, too bad, because we are going to \nprotect the people who write the large contributions.\n  (Mr. ROCKEFELLER assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my friend from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Ms. STABENOW. On that point, we actually have counted the number of \npharmaceutical lobbyists in the Senate. There are six lobbyists for \nevery Member of the Senate: Six for me, six for the Senator from \nCalifornia, six for the Senator from New Jersey. Six lobbyists are \nbeing paid full time to lobby and bring in these kinds of provisions \nand also to kill other provisions.\n  We passed legislation to lower prescription drug prices for everyone, \nto increase competition of generic drugs, and open the border to \nCanada. There is a bill that has been languishing in the House for \nmonths that has been stopped by the same group that could take the time \nat the last minute to put this outrageous provision into the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her eloquence and for \nstanding up for families, because as a mother--and I know she is as \nwell--it is outrageous to think that parents who are concerned about \ntheir children will not have an opportunity to have their day in court \nover something that potentially is extremely damaging and hurtful to \nthem.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for her leadership. I point out to my \ncolleagues who are here that four desks down from me sat Paul Wellstone \nfor 12 years. If Paul was here now, he would be stepping outside that \ndesk and telling us: Now is the time to stand up for people, for \nchildren, for people without a voice.\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\n  Autistic kids sometimes cannot talk. We have to stand up and be \ncounted on Monday when this vote takes place and take the consequences \nif somebody gets mad at us here or there because there is no reason to \nbe here if we do not protect the people of this country.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take the Senate's time anymore. I \nhave expressed myself. I look forward to casting a vote on the Daschle-\nLieberman amendment to strike this rider and the other riders that were \nattached at the last minute, which I think is just a blatant attempt to \ngive out special favors to the detriment of the American people.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before I begin, I commend the Senator from California \non raising not only the issue regarding childhood vaccines but the \nwhole issue of adding riders about which I am going to speak in a \nmoment on a whole series of issues. It makes a complicated and \ntroubling piece of legislation even more difficult to weigh and balance \nas to whether it is truly one that gets us to a more secure future for \nAmerica. All of us want to protect our freedoms and protect the lives \nof citizens across this country, but one has to think about it in the \ncontext of what is the give and take and whether it actually works.\n  My first comment is not dissimilar to what I heard from a number of \nMembers who are supportive and not supportive of the direction we are \ntaking. It is hard to conceive of how we can put 170,000 or 175,000 \npeople together who had trouble in the organization that was in place \nbefore when it was smaller and more manageable and come up with a sense \nof security that we are actually going to make things better by pushing \nthem together.\n  At least in my experience in my private life, sometimes mergers do \nnot always amount to what is intended, and value is not always created. \nIt certainly leads to a question of whether we have the flexibility and \nresponsiveness in an organizational structure.\n  I am certainly troubled by the idea of creating a larger organization \nmade up of parts that apparently have not been working so well \nhistorically. Clearly, we need to take positive steps. It may very well \nbe we are doing that with the proposal with regard to homeland \nsecurity, but at least as one individual, I am troubled with the \noverall size of the operation and whether it will bring about the \nresponsiveness to the need, which I think all of us feel quite clearly \nneeds to be addressed, of protecting the American people.\n  I also am equally concerned about a number of these provisions that \nwere added in a closed manner.\n  I have to second my colleague's comments with regard to liability \nprotection for pharmaceutical companies on vaccines. That should be an \nissue that is debated openly and understood. It should be fully vetted. \nIt is an open question about whether this is a serious problem, but I \ndo not think adding it as a rider that is particularly attractive to a \nparticular segment is germane to the context of homeland security. It \nattacks the fundamental premise about which we are talking.\n  I wish to relate that to something about which I will talk which is \nreally the heart of my comments today--chemical plant security--which I \nthink is missing from the homeland security debate.\n  It is also troubling and hard to understand why pieces of the \nWellstone amendment which prohibited contracting with corporate \nexpatriates is pulled out of the bill. We have some adds and we have \nsome drops. I am not sure why we are doing that. This was unanimously \naccepted by the Senate. I find it very difficult to understand why we \nare resourcing, promoting, or allowing those companies which choose not \nto be supportive of America with their tax dollars to have equal access \nand participate in contracting with the Federal Government with regard \nto homeland security issues.\n  It is hard for me to understand why this particular amendment was \ndropped. There are a whole series of these. There are special earmarks \nfor a given university. There are liability protection issues that \nreally get at tort reform debates which we ought to have on the Senate \nfloor--no question about that--with regard to airport screening, \nnegligent manufacturing of homeland security devices. All of those \nissues should be the subject of fair debates. So why are they added as \na so-called element of compromise, on the floor of the Senate, without \na debate? It is unclear to me, other than we are more interested in \nrewarding special interests than the general interests, which is what I \nthink is the basic theme of both the administration and certainly \nSenator Lieberman's initial proposal coming out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee with regard to homeland security. There is a need. We \nall embrace that concept and think we should move forward.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why we are putting down new \nbarriers to the Transportation Security Agency with respect to rules \nfor rail transportation in this country--it is one of those areas of \nvulnerability assessments that almost anyone would talk about--other \nthan we are responsive to special interests and that it is going to \ncost too much.\n  As I earlier entered into a colloquy with the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia on the freedom of information activities, I continue to \nbe troubled as to why we are writing a blank check to cover up the kind \nof advisory meetings that could be held with private industry, hand-\npicked advisers, with regard to setting policy within an \nadministration.\n  There may be things that should be carved out from public view, but \nwhen private sector individuals can have a perspective of conflict of \ninterest in the advice, it seems perfectly clear that ought to be made \navailable to the American public, and I am very troubled by the blank \ncheck mentality we are taking with regard to secret activity, \nparticularly when it involves the private sector.\n  We have had that debate with regard to our energy policies, and I \nthink we are now making that a normal course of events.\n  So for all of those reasons--and those are mostly adds, except for \nmaybe the drop with regard to the Wellstone initiative--I am troubled.\n  Finally, this National Commission on September 11 and the review, to \nme, is incomprehensible. Hopefully we will find another way to bring \nthis back, but in my 30 years in the world of management I have never \nseen a situation where you have a failure, a breakdown, a problem that \npeople do not stand back and say, what went wrong and what could we \nhave done differently to make sure we are secure going forward, without \nan independent review that people can have confidence that all of the \nfacts are laid upon the table, including, by the way, observing whether \ncongressional oversight is operated with its most effective provision.\n  I find it difficult to understand why we are investing so much with \nso great certainty about the direction we should be taking with regard \nto homeland security.\n  As I said, this is going to be a tough weekend for me because I have \ntrouble with the conceptual issue of putting so many people together. \nNow that the senior Senator from West Virginia is present, we could \nargue that the Constitution he is carrying in his pocket would also \nraise serious questions about some of the authorities there. These \nspecial additions and drops at the end are particularly concerning to \nme.\n  So for all of those reasons, this is going to be a very difficult \nweekend for weighing and balancing these various elements because, like \neveryone else, and particularly for the people of New Jersey who lost \n691 lives on September 11, there is an expectation that we have a \nresponsibility to protect our homeland. It is obvious. It is self-\nevident. But it is not obvious and self-evident that we are, in my \nview, improving dramatically that effort.\n\n  I certainly believe there are risks in the transition from where we \nare today to the full implementation of this measure and that we may \nvery well be operating under the analogy that people talk about of \nrunning a marathon while you are performing open heart surgery. Whether \nwe are going to be more secure while that process is going on in the \nmidst of a war is an open question. It has not been proven to me that \nwe are actually developing greater certainty.\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n  Now, there is another issue which has not been discussed on which I \nhave worked very hard through most of this year and feel deeply about \nbecause it deeply impacts my State. Actually, it impacts almost every \nState in the Union.\n  I see the ranking member from the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, the Senator from New Hampshire, who has heard much of this \ndiscussion in the committee, which I think is something that is missing \nfrom this bill, and that is the need to protect Americans from attacks \non our Nation's privately owned chemical facilities.\n  I realize this is also one of those things that is futile in the \ncontext of the cloture debate, but it is absolutely essential that \nAmerica be aware of an issue that needs to be focused on and needs to \nbe moved forward. I would be remiss in not having brought this farther \nin the process, and hopefully this discussion and the efforts that have \ngone on before will keep it in the debate, in the committees, and in \nthis new Department which is most certainly going to come to pass.\n  I will discuss it in the context that there are literally thousands \nof chemical facilities in the United States where a chemical release \ncould expose tens of thousands of Americans to highly toxic gases. That \nis why these facilities are potentially so attractive to terrorists. As \na matter of fact, if one goes to a chemical facility in Israel, they \nwill see it protected by a security infrastructure that is not unlike \nwhat one would see at a nuclear powerplant in the United States.\n  As I will relate, if someone visits some of these facilities in the \nUnited States, they will see an entirely different standard by which we \nare securing them. In fact, there are currently no Federal security \nstandards for chemical facilities--none--so that the private sector is \nleft to do whatever it desires or believes it can afford. It is a \ncompletely voluntary situation.\n  Many facilities simply have not fulfilled their responsibilities, in \nmy view. Many are certainly vulnerable to attack. As the statistics and \nstudies show, literally millions of Americans are at risk. They are at \nrisk in New Jersey. If one flies into Newark Airport and looks at the \nchemical plant storage facilities, the refining facilities that are \nright in the path of the landing strips, they will get a sense of the \nkind of exposure we have.\n  Also, if one looks at how easy it is to access, which I will speak \nmore clearly to in a minute, they get an even greater sense of the \ninsecurity with regard to this area of our infrastructure.\n  According to the EPA, there are 123 facilities in 24 States where a \nchemical release could expose more than 1 million people to highly \ntoxic chemicals. One of these plants in New Jersey has exposure to 7\\1/\n2\\ million people inside the metropolitan region of New York. A lot of \nchemical plants are located in our urban communities, not scattered out \ninto the hinterland but right smack dab in the middle of where we have \nhigh concentrations of populations. There are about 750 facilities in \n39 States where chemical release could expose more than 100,000 people \nto toxic chemicals. There are nearly 3,000 facilities spread across 49 \nStates where a chemical release could expose more than 10,000 people to \nhighly toxic chemicals.\n  I think the numbers speak for themselves, and they are \nstaggering. There is a large exposure in a broad context in our Nation.\n\n  A single attack on a facility could unleash highly toxic chemicals \nsuch as chlorine, ammonia, and hydrogen fluoride that cause widespread \ninjuries and death. Considering the literally thousands of potentially \ndeadly facilities across the country, we cannot escape the conclusion \nthat it represents a major vulnerability, a major homeland security \nproblem.\n  It is not just my opinion. In fact, the Justice Department issued a \nreport on this matter a year and a half before September 11. I will \nread a brief excerpt from a summary of the report issued April 18, \n2000.\n\n       We have concluded the risk of terrorists attempting in the \n     foreseeable future causing industrial, chemical release is \n     both real and credible . . . Increasingly, terrorists \n     engineer their attacks to cause mass casualities to the \n     populace and/or more large-scale damage to property. \n     Terrorists or other criminals are likely to view the \n     potential of chemical release from an industrial facility as \n     a relatively attractive means of achieving these goals.\n\n  That report was issued before September 11. Its conclusions have been \nechoed by several other Government agencies and individuals since.\n  For example, Governor Ridge said the following in recent testimony \nbefore EPW:\n\n       The fact is, we have a very diversified economy and our \n     enemies look at some of our economic assets as targets. And \n     clearly, the chemical facilities are one of them. We know \n     that there have been reports validated about security \n     deficiencies at dozens and dozens of those.\n\n  Let me talk about the reports Governor Ridge may have been referring \nto. Earlier this year, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review conducted a major \ninvestigation of western Pennsylvania. Here is what they found:\n\n       A Pittsburgh Tribune-Review investigation has shown that \n     intruder has unfettered access to 30 of the region's \n     deadliest stockpiles of toxins and explosives, despite \n     repeated warnings from the Federal intelligence agencies to \n     safeguard large chemical tanks.\n\n  This Tribune-Review went on to say:\n\n       Security was so lax at the 30 sites that in broad daylight \n     a Trib reporter--wearing a press pass and carrying a camera--\n     could walk or drive right up to tanks, pipes and control \n     rooms considered key targets for terrorists.\n\n  After this initial story, the Tribune-Review expanded the scope of \ninvestigation. They went to Houston, Baltimore, and Chicago to see if \nwhat they found in western Pennsylvania was a fluke. They looked at 30 \nor more facilities in 3 other States and the findings were equally \ndisturbing.\n  I point out in metropolitan New York the local television station has \ndone similar sorts of walk-ons to chemical plant facilities, including \nthe one that has the 7.5 million people exposure in metropolitan New \nYork.\n  This is troubling, to say the least. There is a pattern. Perhaps that \nis why the chemical industry got low marks for post-September 11 \nterrorism response.\n  On September 10 of this year, the Washington Post graded critical \ninfrastructure sectors, giving the chemical industry a D. Newsweek, \nwhich is owned by the same people, did a similar piece. They were even \ntougher. Newsweek gave the chemical industry an F. I have seen this \nrepeatedly in a number of surveys of America's infrastructure.\n  While some companies may be doing everything they can, and I know \nthere are some that are working very hard, they are concerned about it \nfor security reasons and protecting their people and maybe themselves. \nBut the fact is we need to do a lot more. We need to be a lot more \ncertain the breadth of the industry is being attended to.\n\n  That is why in October 2001 I introduced the Chemical Security Act. \nThat is why I worked with Senators on both sides of the aisle to move \nthe bill through the EPW Committee. This is the hard part. Ultimately, \nthe committee approved the legislation on a vote of 19-to-0. Not a \nsingle Senator voted no. I note Senator Inhofe did, in fairness, \nexpress concerns about the bill at markup and I agreed to continue to \nwork with him on those issues afterwards, particularly so we could \npotentially add it as an amendment to homeland security.\n  In fact, as I suggested, I talked with other Members and we tried to \nkeep the concerns of the bill, deal with them, and while I will not go \nthrough the post-markup negotiations, there were substantial revisions \nso it could get added to the bill. Unfortunately, we have not been able \nto get to conclusion in that process even though it was a 19-to-0 vote \nin committee for it. Sometimes I wonder whether special interests \nsometimes trump the people's interests.\n  I will not be offering my amendment; it is not germane. But I think \nwe need to come back and go to work on this issue as soon, as \nforcefully, as possible. It is absolutely relevant to homeland security \nand protecting the American people. I know that is the case in New \nJersey.\n  I will not go through it in detail, but the first thing we have to do \nis be very specific about identifying high priority chemical \nfacilities. That can be done relatively straightforwardly. It will take \ncooperation between EPA and the new Homeland Security Department. There \nis some debate about that. We\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nneed a list. It does not have to be published on the front page of the \nNew York Times, but we need to understand what the exposures are and \nget about protecting the American people.\n  Second, we need to have audits of what that process is so there is a \nreality to what has been talked about. There is not a moral hazard \nsaying we have done something and nothing really has occurred.\n  In a nutshell, that is what this is about. It is a little more \ncomplicated than that in detail, but I suggest this is something that \nreally should be a priority when we return. I hope we do not face the \nstonewalling that has come up from some elements in the industry. The \nneed to act is urgent. This is, by the way, consistent with some of the \nthings other people who have looked at homeland security on a broader \nbasis have talked about.\n  I will quote from a recent op-ed piece by Warren Rudman and Gary \nHart, who have been following homeland security as effectively as any \ntwo Americans studying this. They have an op-ed page written in October \nof this year:\n\n       America's corporate leaders must accept their new \n     responsibilities to protect the privately owned critical \n     infrastructure and cease the behind-the-scenes lobbying \n     against measures requiring them to do so. If necessary, the \n     President must deliver this message bluntly and directly.\n\n  Some of those things that were added in the middle of the night, the \nkind of experience that I have experienced with regard to trying to \ndeal with chemical plant security, is indicative that that process of \nresisting, protecting the American people, is not fully embraced in the \nprivate sector.\n  I could not agree more. We need to work together as a Congress, with \nthe administration, and deal with this issue.\n  Homeland security in general, time is of the essence, as someone said \naround here. It is not neutral. So I hope we can move very quickly on \nthis. I am sorry we have not been able to deal with this. There are \nsome good voluntary efforts with regard to chemical security. But I \ndon't think we have gone far enough. Voluntary efforts alone are not \ngoing to be sufficient. We need to work in Congress to make it happen.\n  Finally, I am proud to be an author, a promoter, a sponsor of this \nlegislation with regard to chemical plants. I am also proud to be a \ncosponsor of the Daschle amendment that will deal with some of these \nother special interests. I think the two relate in the sense that we \nare not all on the same page pushing forward to protect the American \npeople on homeland security. We need to get there. With both the \nprivate sector and the public sector.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that there be debate only on the \nmatter now before the Senate until 3:30 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Chair will bear with me momentarily.\n  Mr. President, over recent weeks as the President crisscrossed the \nNation on campaign stops--campaign stop after campaign stop--he used a \nnumber of gimmicks, including this legislation, to rally support for \nhis chosen candidates. He painted this bill as a panacea for the \nterrorist threats that plague us and challenged this Congress to pass \nthis bill quickly.\n  On each occasion, as I followed the newspaper accounts of the \nPresident's stops during the campaign, the President left the \nimpression among the public that this bill is urgently needed, and that \nit will make life safer for American families. But there was much he \ndidn't say. Here is what the people can expect after the Congress \napproves this legislation to transfer 28 agencies and offices to a new \nHomeland Security Department.\n  Next February, the President will submit a plan--his plan--to the \nCongress about how he intends to transfer 28 agencies and offices into \na massive new Department over the period of just 12 months. We don't \nknow what is in the President's plan today, and we will not know what \nis in the President's plan when and if Congress passes this bill and it \ngoes to the Chief Executive for his signature.\n  We will not know what is in the President's plan. After we have \npassed this bill and it becomes law, the President will then inform the \nCongress about how he intends to reorganize, consolidate, and \nstreamline these 28 agencies as they are moved into the new Department. \nHe will not seek approval of the Congress--the elected representatives \nof the people. He will not seek our approval. He will not need to \nbecause--according to the provisions of this bill on which we are being \nhurried and stampeded to act, according to the provisions of this \nbill--he will simply drop the plan in the laps of the committees so \nthey can be informed about what he intends to do. He will not be asking \nfor their approval. We will have already given our approval when we \npass this bill.\n  I hope Senators understand that. When we pass this bill, we, the \nCongress, are out of it. The President will in due time submit his \nplan. In due time he will inform the Congress as to what he intends to \ndo. He won't have to ask us if we approve of what he is going to do. We \nwill have already said to him: Here it is. You submit your plan. \nAccording to the provisions of this bill, your plan will go into effect \nin due time. And we will not have any more to say about it.\n  He will simply drop the plan. It will not fall like manna from \nheaven, because it won't come from heaven. This is what we are \nauthorizing the President to do when we adopt this bill that is before \nthe Senate.\n  Here it is. Those who are watching this floor through the electronic \nlenses before us, here is the bill. It is made up of 484 pages. These \npages are not like reading ``Robinson Crusoe'' or Milton's ``Paradise \nLost.'' They are very difficult pages to understand. On only a single \npage there may be many references to various and sundry laws that are \nalready on the statute books, so that in order to understand what may \nbe on a single page, we have to go back, look at the references, and go \nback to those statutes that have been on the books--some of them--for \nmany years or decades. We have to go back and see what those laws \ncontain before we understand what is on a single written page. It is \nnot like reading a novel. In some senses, it is made to sound like a \nfairy tale. But it is indeed not a fairy tale.\n  This is a bill that affects you--a bill that affects those two \nmembers of the staff back here who are talking. This is a bill that \naffects you. This is a bill that will affect you, each of you--you, \nyou, you, you, each Senator. Each of those persons out there who are \nwatching this debate--it is really not a debate. There is only one \nSenator talking here and one Senator listening and one Senator in the \nchair. So there are not too many Senators here. Hopefully, they are \nwatching from their offices, as we all do.\n  This is the bill. Let me say it again: 484 pages of complicated \nmaterial.\n  How long have we had it? A little over 48 hours. It came to us early \nin the morning on the day before yesterday. Today is Friday--early in \nthe morning of Wednesday. There it is. There is the whole thing--the \nwhole thing. I don't know what is in it. I know about some of the \nthings that are in it. But no Senator in here knows everything that is \nin this bill. I daresay that. I would be happy for any Senator to stand \non his feet and challenge me on that and say: Hold up here a minute; I \nknow everything that is in it.\n  We are authorizing the President to submit this plan. He can do it \nwithout our subsequent approval. This legislation authorizes the \nPresident to reorganize, consolidate, or streamline these 28 agencies \nand offices any way he chooses--any way he, that one man, the President \nof the United States--as these various agencies are moved into the new \nDepartment.\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\n  All this legislation asks of the President of the United States is \nthat he let us know what he has decided. That is not asking a lot from \nthe Chief Executive of this country. That is all he needs to be \nconcerned about. All he needs to be concerned about is to explain what \nhe plans to do. Too late. I am sorry to say to any of you Senators that \nyou can't do anything about this. You have already given him the \napproval. When you vote aye on this 484-page bill, you will have given \nthe President the approval that he needs. You can be sorry for what you \nhave done. You can crab about it and be cranky and wish you had not \ndone it. But it is too late now.\n  You remember that old song: ``It is too late now.'' Well, it will be \ntoo late for any of us--too late.\n  We can weep and gnash our teeth--if we have any teeth left. And I \nhappen to have my full set after 85 years. I have a full--I can't say \nquite a full set. But I have lost about I think four teeth in my \nlifetime of 85 years. These are real teeth. I can't take them out at \nnight and scrub them, wash them, and put them in a big glass of water. \nI can't do that. They are real. They are real teeth. And they can bite, \nthank God. We didn't have all of this fancy medicine and all of these \nfancy health programs that the young people and children have today, \nwith which mothers and fathers are blessed. We didn't have anything \nlike that in those days.\n  So all I have is what the good Lord gave me through my mother's and \nfather's genes. Well, that is all I have.\n  So here we are. I can gnash my teeth. They are real teeth. I can \ngnash those teeth. I seldom show them around here, but they are there. \nI can gnash my teeth, and complain all I want, and say I wish I had \nknown--I wish I had known. Well, it is too late now. That will be the \nway it is.\n  He can move these agencies any way he chooses. All this legislation \nasks the President to do is: You please just tell us what your plan is. \nWill you do that? Please, just tell us what your plan is.\n  There are 1.8 million people in West Virginia whom I represent, and \nwho are represented by my colleague, Senator Rockefeller.\n  My people, my 1.8 million, would love to know what those plans are. \nBut bless his name, the President does not have to tell us today. And \nwe don't ask him. But we will get on our knees and fold our hands and \nsay: Mr. President, will you just please tell us, when you are ready, \nwhat you plan to do? You can do it now. Here is the bill. We are \npassing it today, but just please tell us what you are going to do.\n  All this legislation asks is that the President let us know what he--\nhe, the President of the United States. He will be with us 2 more \nyears, maybe 6. Who knows. But anyhow, this man down here in the White \nHouse, one man out of 280 million, he will tell us what he plans to do.\n  A few months after we receive the President's proposal--after he is \nso generous to come up here and tell us what he plans to do--a few \nmonths after we receive his proposal, we will begin reading articles in \nnewspapers and magazines. I am going to come back to the floor--the \nLord willing, if He lets me live--I am going to come back on the floor \nand remind my colleagues; I am going to remind all these staff people \naround here: This is what I told you. I told you.\n  After we start reading all these articles in newspapers and magazines \nabout special advisory committees--this is exactly what that Senator \nwho is sitting in the Chair right now, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nCorzine, talked about this morning. He told us about it. He told us \nabout these special advisory committees. And they will have been \nestablished, by the new Homeland Security Secretary, to make \nrecommendations about certain homeland security-related issues.\n  Now, look at that. I hope Senators will go back and read today's \nRecord or that of the first of the week about what Senator Corzine had \nto say about this, yes, about certain homeland security-related issues.\n  Possibly, we will hear about an advisory committee being \nestablished--maybe we will see it in the Federal Registry, that an \nadvisory committee has been established--to make recommendations about \nhow the new Directorate of Information Analysis can look at our e-mail \naccounts. This will not be a laughing matter. I will tell you, this \nwill not be a laughing matter.\n  Now, let me say that again. Possibly, we will hear about an advisory \ncommittee that has been established to make recommendations about how \nthe new Directorate of Information Analysis can look at our e-mail \naccounts, can look at our banking transactions, can look at our \ntelephone conversations, or can even look at our credit card \ntransactions.\n  I don't have any credit cards. Let them look at mine. They can't look \nat my credit card transactions. I grew up the old-fashioned way. I pay \nfor it as I get it. No credit card for Robert C. Byrd, or the Mrs. But \nto those who have credit cards, he can look at your credit card \ntransactions to trace everything you purchase from butter to bullets. \nWelcome, Big Brother. How do you like that?\n  The American people will want to know, and will deserve to know, what \nrecommendations are being made to the Homeland Security Secretary. The \npress will try to provide the public with answers. But under this bill, \nyou can be sure that the press will not be allowed to access the \nminutes of those committee meetings. That is what we are making \npossible by the passage of this legislation. We are making it possible \nfor the American public not to know what these special committees \nare considering. And the public will not be able to find out because \nthis bill--this bill--here it is; 484 pages, new, never been in a \ncommittee, never seen the light of day in a committee meeting. There is \nno analysis of this bill that I know of from any departments here. \nThere have been no witnesses appearing before Senate committees \nsupporting this bill. Nobody had any committee markup that I know \nabout. This bill just suddenly emerged out of the darkness on the \nmorning of Wednesday, the evening of Tuesday night. There it was.\n\n  But that bill--that bill--will allow the new Secretary to exempt such \nadvisory committees from the public disclosure laws that are on the \nbooks now that enable the press--the fourth estate--and the American \npublic to find out what these advisory committees are doing.\n  This bill will allow the Secretary to drop a veil, to bring the \ncurtain of secrecy down, to drop a veil of secrecy over these advisory \ncommittees and hide their work from the press--from the all-seeing eyes \nof the press--and from the public.\n  Do you want to vote for that? Is that what you Senators want to vote \nfor? Is that what your constituents want you to vote for, Senators? I \nhope, if you are not hearing me now, that your staffs are listening. I \nhope, if you don't hear me, that somebody will show it to you in the \nRecord on Monday morning what Senator Corzine, the distinguished able \nSenator from New Jersey, who presides over this Senate at this moment, \nI hope they will read what he said and what I am saying here about \nthese advisory committees and about what we are about to let happen. \nAnd here is the bill that will allow it to happen.\n  I hope you Senators who vote on this matter--probably one day next \nweek--will have to answer to your constituents for that. I have been in \nthis Congress 50 years, and I have cast many votes. I have cast more \nvotes, than any Senator who ever lived, in the Senate of this Republic. \nAnd I just have to say, I have cast some votes that were critical \nvotes, but I think that what we are doing in this bill, more than \nanything else I have voted on in my 50 years in Congress, is shifting \npower to an administration, shifting power to a President.\n  I would say this: God, so help me--and God could drop me in my tracks \nright here in this moment if I were not saying what I believe--I would \nsay the same thing about this bill if it were a Democratic President in \nthe White House.\n  I have no ax to grind. I am not on the payroll of any pharmaceutical \ncompany or any other company in this country. I am on the people's \npayroll right here in this Senate. That is it. So I have no ax to \ngrind. I am just saying that if it were a Democratic President in the \nWhite House, I would be standing here today saying the very same thing. \nIt isn't because the current President of the United States is a \nRepublican. That is not it. But there is something about this \nRepublican administration that is far different from\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\nwhat I have seen in former Republican administrations. And I served \nunder Republican administrations, beginning with the Eisenhower \nadministration.\n  This is a different kind of administration. This is a bill that I \nwill vote against regardless of who might be in the office of the \nPresident. This bill will allow the Secretary to drop a veil of secrecy \nover these advisory committees and hide their works from the press and \nthe public.\n  So what we are doing when we vote next week on this bill, if we vote \nnext week, what we are doing is putting our hands over our eyes, and we \nare saying the public has no right to know. We are taking away the \npublic's right to know.\n  That is what we are about to do to you out there in the land, across \nthe land, across the plateaus, the Plains, the mountains, the valleys. \nThat is what we are saying to you. You may not catch us at it, but that \nis what we are doing to you. That is exactly what we are doing to your \nright to know.\n  Later in the year, the people may begin to read in the newspapers \nabout start-up problems in this vast new Department. The papers will \npossibly report about a failure by the new Immigration Service to deny \nentry to a known terrorist because the relevant immigration officials \nwere too preoccupied with moving their offices, reconnecting their \ncomputers, reinstalling their phones, or even changing the heading on \ntheir stationery to handle their primary responsibility; namely, \nprotecting our borders.\n  This would bring about a clamoring of public disgust as agency \nofficials are found to be too busy organizing their offices to properly \nhandle their duties. Editorials will appear around the country \nremarking about the failures of the new Department, and the public very \nwell may have reason to lose trust in that Department.\n  These kinds of high-profile debacles could carry over to the \nTransportation Security Administration, the Customs Service, FEMA, the \nCoast Guard, or any of the 28 agencies and offices and 170,000 \nemployees being transferred to the new Department. Senators may well \nread a few months from now about Federal workforces in their home \nStates and the jobs of Federal employees being privatized under the \nlabor rules included in this bill.\n  Don't say that you were not warned, I say to my colleagues. Don't say \nthat you were not warned.\n  The Washington Post reported today that the administration plans to \nopen as many as 850,000 Federal jobs to private contractors. Have you \nread it? If you haven't, go to today's Washington Post. Look for that \nstory. It is there. Read it with your own eyes, and you will believe \nit. What a nice plum that is for the big business friends of the \nadministration. How about that? What a shortsighted, ill-conceived \npolitical gimmick it is. What a hoax it is to play on the taxpayers.\n  Privatization has nothing whatsoever to do with improving security. \nLook at the private security firms that were in charge at some of our \nNation's largest airports on September 11. Remember reading about these \nin the newspaper? Go back and look at some of those old newspapers. Is \nmore of that what this administration really wants? I ask, is more of \nthat what this administration really wants?\n  The Wall Street Journal editorialized today about the fallacy of \npushing this bill through at such a late date.\n  Now, imagine that. The Wall Street Journal. Hear me now. Paul Revere \nawakened Concord. I would like to be able to awaken this Senate and the \nother body. Do you suppose I could do that? Paul Revere did that. He \nwas able to awaken Concord. Get out of your beds; the redcoats are \ncoming.\n\n  Let me say that again. The Wall Street Journal editorialized today \nabout the fallacy of pushing this bill through at such a late date.\n  How many of our Senators today voted for cloture? If Senators had \nread the Wall Street Journal, the editorial today about the fallacy of \npushing this bill through at such a late date, would the Senators who \nvoted yes--and I implored and I importuned and I urged, which I seldom \ndo, I urged Senators right there in front of that desk, that table in \nthe well of the Senate. There were several Senators I urged: Please \ndon't vote for cloture today. You can vote for it next week perhaps, \nbut don't vote today. Let's take a little more time and study this \nbill.\n  The answer I got: Well, you have the weekend. You have 30 hours. You \nhave 30 hours; isn't that enough?\n  Do we have? No. We have already been told by the minority: You won't \nbe able to offer any more amendments.\n  The only amendment that is going to be offered is the amendment that \nhas been offered by the majority leader, Mr. Daschle, that amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Lieberman, and I added my name to it afterwards, when \nI saw what was going on. So there it is, the Daschle-Lieberman-Byrd \namendment.\n  But we are told by the current minority--soon to be the majority--\nthat you can't offer any more amendments. That is the only amendment we \nare going to let you offer.\n  So how about that cloture now? I was told by some of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle: Well, you have the whole weekend. You can \nstudy.\n  Who saw this thing coming? Who saw the situation coming in which we \nwould offer one amendment and we are told by our Republican friends, \nthat is it, no more; that is the only amendment that will be offered?\n  So what about it now, my colleagues who reminded me that we have this \nweekend? Even under cloture, we have this weekend.\n  I said to one of the Senators who said that to me: I wasn't born \nyesterday. I am not a new kid on the street here. I have been in this \nCongress 50 years. I know a little something. I have learned a little \nsomething about the rules of the Senate, and so forth.\n  But here we are, one amendment. That is all.\n  We are not going to be allowed to have any other votes on amendments, \nexcept that one. ``You have 30 hours,'' I was told by Senators down in \nthe well there. ``Well, you have 30 hours; you have the weekend, and \nyour staff has the weekend. You have 30 hours.''\n  I have several amendments I would like to offer, but I cannot do it. \nThe tree is filled. Remember the tree at the Garden of Eden? It is the \nfirst thing you read about in the Bible. The greatest scientific \ntreatise ever written is that first chapter of Genesis. That will tell \nyou more about science than many scientists today can tell you. It \ntells you the order of things in which they were created. The \nscientists of today will tell you that is the correct chronological \norder. Go back and read that first chapter of Genesis and you will read \nthe chronological order of creation, and that was written thousands of \nyears ago. What a piece of science that is.\n  I have three grandsons, two of whom are physicists. I have a son-in-\nlaw who is a physicist. I have a grandson who married a physicist. So \nwe have lots of physicists, lots of scientists in my family. But before \nall those scientists came into being, the greatest scientific treatise \never written had been written right there in the Book of Genesis. We \nhave no reason to stay dumb about how creation went forward. It is \nright there.\n  Anyhow, there it is for us. So here the Wall Street Journal \neditorialized today about the fallacy of pushing this bill through at \nsuch a late date. Here were these great Senators who stood up there in \nmy face and two or three of them told me, ``Well, you have this \nweekend, you have 30 hours,'' as though I didn't know that. How many \nSenators would like to tell me that? One or two of them did. I did say \nto one that this is not a new kid on the block. I know about that 30 \nhours.\n  Now look at what we have. I cannot offer an amendment, even though we \nhave 30 hours. The tree is filled. But it is not that tree in the \nGarden of Eden. That is the tree of knowledge and we all can continue \nto learn. But I cannot offer an amendment. Our Republican friends would \nsay you can go this far but no farther. You have an amendment pending, \nbut that's all. That is the only amendment you are going to have to \nvote on before that 30 hours is up.\n  How do you like being given that kind of medicine? That is what we \nhave to deal with here. Here is what the Wall Street Journal said. Get \nthis:\n\n       There's little or nothing that this rump session can \n     accomplish that couldn't be done better starting anew in \n     January.\n\n  That reminds me of the distinguished Senator from Texas. I love him \nin many ways, and I agree with him on\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\noccasion. He stood right here today and said, ``This bill is the best \nyou will get. How many in here are willing to believe that by putting \nthis over another 3 months they can get a better bill?'' I said, ``I \ndo.'' But that was his position, that this is the best bill you are \nlikely to get. Do I think we will get a better bill after 3 months in a \nnew Congress? Yes, I do. But that was his question.\n  I don't need to answer that. Let the Wall Street Journal answer that \nquestion. Do you think you can get a better bill if you wait 3 months? \nThat is the question.\n  The first question that was ever asked was asked by God as He went \ninto the Garden of Eden and started looking for Adam--Adam and Eve in \nthat garden. God was walking in the cool of the day and he was looking \nfor Adam in that paradise setting. How lovely that must have been. Here \nis old Adam over here somewhere under a tree, or back in the bushes, \nwith some figleaves hiding from God. God said: ``Adam, where art \nthou?'' That was the first question ever asked.\n\n  The people are going to say to us: Senator, where were you? Those \nSenators who voted for cloture, God love them--and I love them and I \nrespect their viewpoints. They have a right to cast the votes they want \nto cast them. I don't like to tell them how to vote. But let my \nconstituents say: Robert, where were you? Where were you when you cast \nthat vote?\n  So here is what the Wall Street Journal would say:\n\n       There's little or nothing that this rump session can \n     accomplish that couldn't be done better starting anew in \n     January.\n\n  Hallelujah. Thank God for the Wall Street Journal. They answer the \nquestion well--better than I.\n\n       There's little or nothing that this rump session can \n     accomplish that couldn't be done better starting anew in \n     January. That includes President Bush's priority of a new \n     Department of Homeland Security . . . the proposal is mostly \n     about rearranging the bureaucratic furniture . . . And as \n     with any bill whipped through this quickly, we can expect to \n     learn later about many bad ideas that deserved more scrutiny.\n\n  Mr. President, at a later moment, I will ask unanimous consent that \nthe entire editorial be printed in the Record but not at this point. I \nsuspect it won't be long before we begin to hear about the bad ideas \nthat deserved more scrutiny.\n  Some Senators may find comfort in the fact that this bill has been \ntouted as a compromise. It won't compare with the great compromise of \nJuly 16, 1787, which created this Senate. If it had not been for that \ncompromise, you would not be here today, Mr. President. You would not \nbe presiding over a Senate of equals, regardless of the size of your \nState, or the size of its population; you would not be in a Senate in \nwhich two Senators from the smallest State would have the same \nstrength, as to their vote, as two Senators from the largest State in \nthe Union. I would not be here. The Senator from New Hampshire would \nnot be here. The Senator who is the minority leader from Mississippi \nwould not be here. The Senator who is the majority leader, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, would not be here. All of these pages, they would \nnot be here. No, this would not be the Senate. But it is that \nConstitution--here it is; I hold it in my hand. Senators should, above \nall people, become more acquainted with this Constitution.\n  Some Senators may find comfort in the fact that this bill has been \ntouted as a compromise. I don't know who this bill was a compromise \nbetween, other than the White House and the congressional Republicans, \nwho already supported some version of the President's original plan.\n  Call me old-fashioned. Yes, there he is, there is that old-fashioned \nguy. I am married to an old-fashioned sweetheart. Thank God for her. \nShe has been my sweetheart now for 65 years and going on quickly to the \n66th. Thank God for that kind of an old-fashioned sweetheart. I hope \nshe thinks the same thing about her old-fashioned husband--ha, ha, ha, \nthat old-fashioned guy. That is the man. He has been around 85 years--\nan old-fashioned guy.\n  I remember a time, Mr. President, when compromises were crafted by \nindividuals who had differing views on an issue. This kind of \ncompromise, this 484 pages--let me make sure I am right. Yes, it is 484 \ndifficult, complicated, hard-to-read, harder-to-understand pages. There \nit is. This kind of compromise is like legislative shadow boxing.\n  Have you ever tried boxing? I tried it, and I got knocked on my \nanterior. That was the end of my boxing. I found I was not so good at \nboxing. This kind of compromise here is like some kind of shadow \nboxing. It would be laughable if it were not so serious. This kind of \ncompromise is like legislative shadow boxing--punching and jabbing and \nsparring with absent opponents. The opponents are not there.\n  This ephemeral compromise makes no concessions with regard to the \nPresident's efforts to exempt this new Department from public \ndisclosure law, such as the Federal Advisory Committee Act. You will \nnot find that spelled out, but you will find reference is made to it. \nYou have to go beyond the plain print in section 871. You have to go \nbeyond the plain print. It is referenced there, but you have to go back \nto the statute books to see what they are talking about.\n  This ephemeral compromise makes no concessions with regard to the \nPresident's efforts to exempt the new Department from public disclosure \nlaws, such as the Federal Advisory Committee Act. It includes no \nconcessions with regard to the President's reorganizing the 28 agencies \nand offices being transferred to this new Department without \ncongressional approval.\n  I have never seen anything like it. In 50 years in Congress, I have \nnever seen anything like it--never. All this without congressional \napproval. It includes only token concessions to those who have \nsubstantive, genuine reservations about this bill with regard to the \ncivil service and collective bargaining issues. How can we pretend that \nthis amendment is a serious attempt at a compromise when it is only an \nagreement between the President and the few supporters of the \nPresident's bill?\n  Oh, there are compromises in this. Yes, there are compromises in this \namendment. It compromises the rights of Federal workers. It compromises \nthe civil liberties of the American people out there. It compromises \nyour daddies' and mothers' civil liberties, the parents of these nice \npages we have here.\n  They are just the most wonderful people. They come here seeking to \nunderstand the legislative process. What are they getting? They are not \ngetting the legislative process in this monstrosity. They are not \ngetting the legislative process. These--I said kids; these are young \npeople. They are all juniors in high school. They are at that tender \nage where they learn quickly. They have come here wanting to learn the \nlegislative process. They are being cheated. I say to you young fine \npages here, I love you.\n  From time to time, I meet out in the corridor with the pages, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I tell them good stories, I mean wholesome \nstories. That is right. They are wholesome stories. I tell them stories \nin which there is a moral lesson. I tell them the story of the house \nwith the golden windows. I tell them the story written by that great \nRussian, Tolstoy, ``How Much Land Does A Man Need?'' I tell them the \nstory about ``Acres of Diamonds'' that was told, I understand, 5,000 \ntimes by that great Chautauqua speaker, Russell Conwell.\n  I tell these pages good stories, wholesome stories. I talk about the \nBible. I talk about Milton. I talk about the Constitution. I talk about \nhistory. I talk about Nathan Hale to these young people here. Bless \ntheir hearts. I always am inspired when I talk to these young people. \nThese are the cream of the crop. Mind you, there are millions across \nthis country just like these. But they are being fooled. We are fooling \nthese young people.\n  They come here to learn the legislative process. What do they get \nfrom this bill? This is not the legislative process. They do not learn \nin this amendment. They will go back one day and they will say: I heard \nSenator Byrd say that was not how our laws are made. No. We short \ncircuited that process on this amendment, this 484-page bill. Here it \nis, 484 pages. What is in it? Don't ask me. I know a few things that \nare in it, and I have heard other Senators talk about a few things that \nwere left out of it in the darkness of the night.\n  We talk about compromise. This 484-page monstrosity compromises the \ncivil liberties of the American public.\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nIt compromises the constitutional doctrines of the separation of powers \nand checks and balances that we find in the Constitution, which I hold \nin my hand.\n  This bill compromises the notion that the Senate should debate and \namend legislation and act as the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld before passing massive--massive--reorganizations of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, we have allowed ourselves to be stampeded, and I could \nbe as King Canute. A lot of King Canute's followers thought he could do \nanything. He thought he would disabuse his followers of that fallacy, \nthat belief that King Canute could do anything. So he went down to the \nsands of the oceanside, and he commanded the waves to be still. The \nwaves were not still. They did not go still, so the people finally \nunderstood that King Canute could speak to the ocean and it would not \nnecessarily heed him.\n  I say that to say this, Mr. President: I might as well speak to the \nocean. I might as well be like King Canute as to speak to some of my \ncolleagues here. My speech would fall upon deaf ears, and they would \nsay: There he goes again, that old-fashioned guy who believes that we \nought to take the time; there he goes again.\n  We have allowed ourselves to be stampeded into passing this bill. \nAfraid to be on the wrong side of this issue, we hear cries from both \nsides of the aisle that we must support our President. We hear cries \nof, ``My President,'' ``My party,'' ``My Commander in Chief.'' When \nwill we hear, Mr. President, ``My country''? When will we hear, ``My \ncountry''?\n  Senators are obviously upset about the miscellaneous provisions that \nwere included in this bill at the last minute. The Washington Post this \nmorning outlined a number of these provisions ranging from language \nthat would help the FBI obtain customer information from Internet \nservice providers to language incorporated in the bill by the House \nRepublican leadership that gives Texas A do not believe it \nmentioned Texas A gives Texas A the inside track in hosting \nthe first university center on homeland security to be established \nwithin 1 year.\n  It will not say that in the bill. Senators will not find that in the \nbill.\n  But the language in the bill is so targeted only that one--at least \nthat one institution would be most favored over others.\n  Probably the most egregious provision inserted is a White House-\nbacked provision designed to head off dozens of potential lawsuits \nagainst Eli Lilly and Company and other pharmaceutical giants that are \nbeing sued by parents who have linked their children's autism to those \ncompanies' childhood vaccines.\n  How about that? I ask the distinguished Members of the other body. \nHow do they feel about having passed this bill with that kind of \nlanguage in it? Hear me over there at the other end of the Capitol. \nYes, explain your vote, explain your vote to your constituents. You, \nback there in the other--we are not supposed to refer to the other body \nin our speeches, but the other body passed this bill in a hurry.\n  Those in the other body who voted for this, go back and look at what \nyou voted for.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield to me on my time for a few \nquestions?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. May I have this counted against my time under cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the distinguished Senator from West Virginia: In \nJuly, the Brookings Institution issued a report concerning this \nreorganization, and they said the following, and I am quoting from them \nnow:\n\n       Any fundamental reorganization represents a huge managerial \n     undertaking, one that becomes ever more daunting as the \n     number of agencies to be included increases. The danger is \n     that top managers will be preoccupied for months, if not \n     years, with getting the reorganization right, thus giving \n     insufficient attention to their real job, taking concrete \n     action to counter the terrorist threat at home.\n\n  This Brookings report advocated some consolidation of agencies, but \nit proposed a much smaller, more streamlined consolidation, and the \nreport went on to say: ``Reorganization is not a panacea. In fact, \nthere is a risk that reorganization could interfere with, rather than \nenhance, homeland security tasks.'' Certainly, changes should be made \nonly when there is a compelling case that consolidation offers clear \nbenefits.\n  I supported a proposal--and this leads up to my question--that the \nSenator from West Virginia offered earlier in the consideration of this \nissue, which would have undertaken to do a reorganization, but would \nhave phased it and would have brought it back at periodic times for \nfurther scrutiny, examination, and implementation by the Congress. Was \nthat the approach which the Senator had taken?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, it was. Mr. President, if I may respond to the \ndistinguished Senator. The amendment I offered to the legislation that \nwas being proposed by Mr. Lieberman in his committee, the language I \noffered with several cosponsors and supporters, such as the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, would have provided \nfor the recommendations of the administration to come back to the \nCongress periodically--every 4 months, for the next 12 months--which \nrecommendations would have to do with the phasing in of the various and \nsundry agencies, a few at a time, three times, every 120 days. Some \nof the agencies would be phased in.\n\n  Those recommendations would come back to the Congress and would go to \nthe appropriate committees having jurisdiction--in this case it would \nbe Mr. Lieberman's committee and his committee's counterpart in the \nHouse of Representatives--and expedited procedures would require that \ncommittee to act to bring out a bill implementing those \nrecommendations, or amending them or changing them. Then the Senate, \nunder expedited procedures, would proceed to call up that bill and pass \nit. That would be done three times.\n  So the amendment which the distinguished Senator from Maryland refers \nto would provide for a phased-in approach over the same period of time \nthat is going to be utilized by the President and the Secretary under \nthis bill--namely, 12 months--and over that same period of time a \nphased-in approach with Congress still in the mix. Congress would still \nhave a say at each of these three junctures.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It seems to me that this is a far more sensible way to \nproceed. First, I think it maintains a better balance with respect to \nthe roles of the executive and the legislative branches of our \nGovernment. I think the Senator has been absolutely right to underscore \nthe fact that what is at stake here is a tremendous grant of authority \nto the executive branch.\n  Mr. BYRD. Tremendous.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is sweeping in its dimension.\n  Mr. BYRD. Sweeping.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Secondly, I think that review process is more likely, \nfar more likely, to produce beneficial results, because as the Senator \nsaid earlier today, the more scrutiny and discussion you have, the \nhigher the likelihood--not a guarantee, but the higher the likelihood--\nthat you will have a better result.\n  As I have listened to the Senator over these weeks of the debate, I \nhave increasingly come to have very deep concerns about what we are \ndoing with this legislation. I feel for the Senator when he says people \nare not--even now, as we near the last hour, focusing fully on the \nimplications and the consequences of what we are discussing.\n  Back in September, the Baltimore Sun published an editorial, and I \nwant to read a couple of paragraphs from it. This is from September 23 \nof this year:\n\n       Months of debate have made clear that this bureaucratic \n     boondoggle offers no promise of making the homeland more \n     secure. Worse, it takes the focus off the need for tighter \n     oversight of the Nation's security systems. President Bush \n     offered the most sweeping government reorganization in a half \n     a century, largely as a political and public relations \n     tactic. He was trying to counter Senate Democrats who were \n     advancing similar legislation of their own. He timed the \n     unveiling of his plan to drown out the testimony of FBI Agent \n     Coleen Rowley, who was blowing the whistle on the security \n     failures of her hidebound agency that blinded it to the clues \n     of the September 11 attacks. Shifting 22 Federal agencies and \n     170,000 workers into a new department will cost billions but \n     will do nothing to solve the problems agent Rowley\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n     addressed. What is needed is greater sharing, coordination \n     and synthesis of the security information collected by the \n     myriad agencies. But this new department will not even \n     include the FBI and the CIA which are the two premier \n     intelligence gatherers. Nor is there any guarantee that \n     greater sharing would take place between them if they were \n     together.\n\n  I think this is right on point and parallels much of what the \nSenator, as I understand it, has been arguing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before I respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, I understand that the able Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Akaka, has a unanimous consent request he would like to make. Will \nthe Senator from Maryland yield for that request since this is on his \ntime?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Maryland for yielding to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my hour under cloture be \nyielded to Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, Mr. Akaka, who is about to take the chair. He wanted to make \nthe request before he took the chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order now \nin effect, that there be debate only until 3:30, be extended until 5 \no'clock today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. On the time of the distinguished Senator, let me be just a \nlittle bit loquacious in my response. I have served in this Senate for \n44 years and in the Congress for 50 years. In my time in the Senate and \nin the House, the Senator from Maryland--I don't have to say this; I \ndon't owe the distinguished Senator from Maryland the tribute I am \nabout to say, except it is honest and he is entitled to it.\n  We often pass around our warm words of praise because we are Senators \nand this is a happy family here. I admire this son of ancient Greece. \nHe is a son of Athens. He is American. He grew up in this country. His \nparents came to this country. He knows what being an immigrants means. \nHe is a Rhodes scholar. I can't say that about Robert Byrd. But this \nman from Maryland is a Rhodes scholar. He is a true son of Athens, a \nson of the people whom Socrates, Sophocles, and Plato were a part. He \nis one of the most thoughtful Senators I have ever seen.\n  When I was majority leader and when I was minority leader--thank \nHeavens, thank Heavens that experience is in the background now; it is \nlong past--but when I was the leader duly elected by my colleagues, I \nalways had meetings in which I tried to get from the most brilliant, \nmost thoughtful Senators on my side of the aisle, their thoughts, their \nopinion, their advice as to this or that issue, whatever issue might be \nbefore the Senate or about to come before the Senate. Paul Sarbanes was \none who was always there. He was never out of the room. Not because he \nwas the ``yes'' American. He wasn't, by any means. But I knew I would \nget the real stuff from Paul Sarbanes.\n  Here is a man who is head and shoulders above some Senators with whom \nI have served, and I have served with a great many Senators. This man \nis a true thinker. We have seen the picture of The Thinker. This is the \nthinker, Paul Sarbanes.\n  A little while ago he said something which brought to my mind the \nwords of William Wordsworth who said: No matter how high you may be in \nyour department, you are still responsible for the actions of the \nlowliest clerk in your department.\n  I forget now what the Senator said, but it brought that thought to \nmind. We are talking about 28 agencies. Who is going to be responsible \nfor the lowliest clerk's actions in this conglomeration, the epitome of \nchaos that will occur?\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland. Please, if he has \nsomething further I will sit down at any moment. If he has anything \nfurther of me, I will be glad to respond.\n  (Mr. AKAKA assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. First, Mr. President, I appreciate the generous and \ngracious remarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I \nmust say that with all of my schooling he mentioned, I have learned \nmore from him than at any other point along the way. I am extremely \nappreciative to him for that.\n  I did want to cite this quote that the Senator has used in the course \nof this debate, which is so appropriate to our situation, from the \nRoman poet and the adviser to Nero, Gaius Petronious Arbiter. It is \nanother instant in which the Senator has enlightened this institution \nthrough his use of Roman history. The quote could not be more on point. \nIt is written as though it were written for the current situation. It \nis as follows:\n\n       We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were \n     beginning to form into teams, we would be reorganized.\n       I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new \n     situation by reorganizing, and the wonderful method it can be \n     for creating the illusion of progress while producing \n     confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.\n\n  We could not have a more appropriate quote to the situation that we \nare confronting today.\n  If the Senator would indulge me for just a couple of minutes, I tie \nin with the demoralization, confusion, and inefficiency what this \nlegislation is doing to loyal, dedicated, hard-working, committed \nFederal employees. I am very frank to say taking from our employees \nrights that they now have, which this legislation will do on the \ngrounds of flexibility to enhance homeland security, will do just the \ncontrary. It will deal a blow to homeland security. We are talking \nabout dedicated employees who are serving our country. They have been \ninvolved in protecting homeland security. They are loyal and committed \nworkers. We want them to go on providing our high level of service, yet \nthis legislation does not protect longstanding rights to bargain \ncollectively about issues of importance, nor does it retain important \ncivil service protections which have been worked out over a very long \nperiod of time.\n  The Federal employees in this new Department, all of whom are already \nworking to protect our national security, ought to have the same rights \nand protections they heretofore have had. Taking these rights away, \ncutting them down, will undercut the morale of these employees. We will \nget lesser performance, although I think these are very dedicated \npeople. In contrast, if we protect our workforce, our workforce will \nprotect us.\n  Let me turn it around the other way. Our federal employees have been \nprotecting us. Why should we withdraw from them important employee \nprotections? Many of these protections came into being in order to \nprotect whistleblowers who are trying to do a better job, to eliminate \ncronyism or favoritism or unfair labor practices. Some say that \nmembership in unions by employees in the Homeland Department will \nimpede efforts to protect our national security. I find this difficult \nto understand. There are currently 200,000 union employees--employees \nwho have a union affiliation--at the Department of Defense. Many of \nthose employees have high-level security clearances. This never seemed \nto impair our national security during the cold war. Many of the first \nresponders on September 11 were union members. Their membership in \nunions in no way hindered their remarkable displays of bravery. They \nwere thinking only of their duty to their country.\n\n  Many agencies that already protect homeland security have union \nmembers amongst their ranks: The Border Patrol, the Customs Service, \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, to name just a few. These \nemployees are already doing their job well. Are they to be rewarded by \nstripping them of these union protections, of these civil service \nrights?\n  We have spent a long part of our history working out these employee \nrights, and they are important to the success of the Government and to \nthe attraction and retention of the best possible Federal employees. We \nought not to be diminishing these rights and protections, as this \nlegislation does.\n  I think that stripping the employees of these protections will harm \nnational security rather than help it. That is a subissue within the \nlarger issue on which the Senator from West Virginia has been focusing, \nabout the dislocation that is going to be created by this sweeping \nproposal, the one that brings us back, of course, to this wonderful \nquote from Gaius Petronius Arbiter.\n  I urge my colleagues to reexamine this closely. I know this issue has \nnow\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nbeen politicized. No one is against homeland security. No one is \nagainst enhancing the security that our people feel, and protecting it. \nThe question then becomes, what is the best way to do it?\n  We have had studies on this point. The Brookings Institute made a \nvery careful evaluation. They said they thought some consolidation was \nin order, but they thought it should be limited, it should be done \ncarefully, it should be done thoughtfully, it should be done with \nprudence. They pointed out, of course, that it is a huge managerial \nundertaking; that it becomes more daunting as the number of agencies to \nbe included increases. And then last summer they said in their report:\n\n       The danger is top managers will be preoccupied for months \n     if not years with getting the reorganization right, thus \n     giving insufficient attention to their real job, taking \n     concrete action to counter the terrorist threat at home.\n\n  I think that is absolutely on point and it is a point which the able \nSenator from West Virginia has made repeatedly, of course, during this \ndebate. It really tracks what Gaius Petronius Arbiter said, when he \nsaid:\n\n       I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new \n     situation by reorganizing, and a wonderful method it can be \n     for creating the illusion of progress while producing \n     confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear, hear.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that is exactly what we are confronted with here.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncontribution today, and for his references to the ancient Roman, Gaius \nPetronius Arbiter, whom the Senator from Maryland more than once has \nquoted on this floor. I thank the Senator for his defense of the \npatriotic Federal employees who work day and night to protect us.\n\n  Mr. President, we will not have one whit more protection with the \npassage of this 484 pages, not one whit protection more than we have \nnow. The same people who will protect us at the borders, at the ports, \nat the airports and throughout the land at the ports of entry, the same \npeople who will protect us then are out there now. They are there day \nand night protecting us.\n  So I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, continuing my statement, and I will not be overly \nlong, probably the most egregious provision inserted is a White House-\nbacked provision designed to head off dozens of potential lawsuits \nagainst Eli Lilly and Company and other pharmaceutical giants that are \nbeing sued by parents who have linked their children's autism to those \ncompanies' childhood vaccines. The language would keep the lawsuits out \nof State courts, ruling out huge judgments and lengthy litigation and, \ninstead, channel complaints to a Federal program set up to provide \nliability protection for vaccine manufacturers. The program, funded \nthrough a surcharge on vaccines, compensates persons injured by such \nvaccines to a maximum of $250,000.\n  A number of Senators, including the very distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow, strongly criticized these provisions yesterday. \nAnd yet at the same time, some Senators who have made these \nstatements--not the Senator whose name I have expressed just now--but \nsome Senators at the same time have pledged to vote in favor of this \nbill, regardless of whether these provisions are included or removed. \nHow about that. We are acting as though this is a conference report \nthat cannot be amended, as though its passage is a fait accompli. We \nstill have the opportunity to amend this bill, except for the fact that \nour Republican friends on the other side of the aisle have said: This \nfar and no further. We have got an amendment pending in the tree and \nthat is all you will get. You will get a vote on that amendment--up or \ndown on or in relation to it, I suppose, at the end of the 30 hours--\nbut no more amendments. That is it. That is the only amendment.\n  Well, we will see about that.\n  We still have the opportunity to amend the bill, at least the basic \nbill, H.R. 5005, even postcloture. So this amendment introduced by \nSenator Daschle will strike language in this bill which the Senate has \nnot previously considered, the language that would allow the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary to establish advisory committees within the Homeland \nSecurity Department and to exempt these committees from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act.\n  When I saw that in the amendment that the leader was introducing on \nbehalf of Mr. Lieberman--I saw that in the amendment, and I immediately \nwanted my name attached because I have been complaining, I have been \ncriticizing that, complaining about that language in the bill.\n  This statute which has been on the books, the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, which has been on the books for 30 years, ensures that \nthe ad hoc committees used to craft policy in the executive branch \nprovide objective advice that is accessible to the public. These public \ndisclosure rules allow Congress and the media and groups outside of \nGovernment to know how the executive branch is making important policy \ndecisions.\n  Section 871 of this new substitute we have just been given, less than \n60 hours ago, provides the Secretary of Homeland Security blanket \nauthority to exempt all advisory committees in the Department from \nexisting public disclosure rules. This provision was not included in \nSenator Lieberman's substitute, but it has been slipped into this new \nbill, which was made available to us, as I say, less than 60 hours ago, \nwith the hope that Senators will not have enough time to scrutinize \nthis dramatic change to existing statute.\n  Many of the advisory committees in this new Homeland Security \nDepartment will be dealing with issues of national security that should \nnot be subjected to public disclosure rules. But the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act already allows the President to exempt these public \ndisclosure rules for advisory committee for national security reasons. \nThis is authority that the President has used for 30 years, and \nauthority he will be able to use for advisory committees in the \nHomeland Security Department.\n  But instead of relying on the President's current authority to exempt \ncommittees on a case-by-case basis, the new language in this bill \nallows the Secretary to exempt ANY advisory committee from public \ndisclosure rules, regardless of whether national security is pertinent \nor not.\n  This new blanket authority is not necessary. As a matter of fact, we \nought not have it. It shouldn't be that way because it interferes with \nthe people's right to know, and it is a danger to our liberty. It is a \ndanger to our constitutional system.\n  The provisions in this bill allow the Secretary to use ad hoc \nadvisory committees to craft policy in secret, without making specific \nfindings that such secrecy is necessary in any particular instance.\n  The press, I hope, will read this bill and understand this bill. I \nhope the press is fully aware of how this presents a danger and a \nthreat to the media's efforts to probe, to ask questions, and to \nscrutinize and to protect the public's right to know.\n  This unnecessary new blanket authority will give the President carte \nblanche to respond and expand the culture of secrecy that now permeates \nthis White House--this administration.\n  Let me say that again.\n  This unnecessary new blanket authority can be used to give the \nPresident carte blanche to expand the culture of secrecy that now \npermeates this White House--this administration.\n  The public disclosure exemptions in this bill are a license for \nabuse. They are a danger. They are un-American. They should not become \nlaw.\n  I hope that Senators, before they cast their vote on the passage of \nthis bill, will think about this. I hope they will be prepared to \nanswer the public--their constituents--in the next election, whatever \nelection down the road awaits them. I hope they will be prepared. There \nare going to be stories in the press as time goes on, I would wager, \nabout this particular authority that the Senate will extend with \npassage of this bill to this administration and to this new \nDepartment--to the Secretary of this new Department.\n  We see on the front page of the Washington Times today--I have \nalready mentioned the Wall Street Journal, and I mentioned the \nWashington Post. Now I call attention to the front page of the \nWashington Times this morning. There is a headline which reads\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n``Homeland Bill a Supersnoop's Dream.''\n  There are many dreams to which we can allude--Jacob's dream--the \ndreams.\n  ``Homeland Bill a Supersnoop's Dream.''\n  In yesterday's New York Times, William Safire warned that if this \nhomeland security legislation is passed as it is currently written, the \nFederal Government may be planning to use its new intelligence \nauthority to compile computerized dossiers on every American citizen, \nincluding ``every piece of information that government has about you . \n. . ''\n  --every piece of information that the Government has about you, each \nof you, about you, about you, about you--\n  . . . including ``every piece of information that government has \nabout you--passport applications, driver's license, bridge toll \nrecords, judicial and divorce records, complaints from nosy neighbors \nto the FBI, your lifetime paper trail . . . ''\n  That is a long trail.\n  . . . ''your lifetime paper trail plus the latest hidden camera \nsurveillance.''\n  No one knows about those hidden cameras and where they are.\n  They may be looking at you. Who knows. They may be in your office \nlooking at you.\n  Do we need to add to all of this by providing even more authority for \nthe Federal Government to hide decisions behind locked doors--decisions \nwhich affect the safety of every man, woman, and child in this Nation?\n  Exampting these committees from the Federal Advisory Committee Act \nalso removes requirements that the advice of these committees be \nobjective and that the membership of the committees represent balanced \nviewpoints on the issues. With this new authority, the Secretary will \nnot have to make any effort whatsoever to ensure the integrity and \nobjectivity of these committees.\n  The language in this bill--here it is--484 pages. It wasn't around a \nweek ago today. Nobody saw one page a week ago today. This bill didn't \nexist a week ago today.\n  The language in this bill even exempts individual members of advisory \ncommittees from financial conflict-of-interest rules. We should not \nallow our homeland security policies to be crafted by corporate \nadvisors with a financial interest in those policies. This bill should \nnot become a vehicle for lining the pockets of corporate fat cats.\n  Section 232 of the new bill also exempts advisory committees within \nthe Office of Science and Technology in the Justice Department. This \nmeans that this new office, which will serve as the focal point for \ndeveloping law enforcement technology, may rely on advisory committees \nwhose members have a personal stake in the policy recommendations \nadopted by the committees. I am worried that exempting this new Science \nand Technology Office will allow the administration to provide special \ntreatment for corporate campaign contributions who are pushing new \nanti-terrorism technologies.\n  It worries me that issues as important as homeland security and the \nsafety of the American people may be decided in secret by ad hoc \ncommittees that are exempt from traditional good government laws. Under \nthis language, the Secretary will be able to exempt not only new \nadvisory committees, but also existing committees that are transferred \ninto the Department along with these 28 agencies and offices.\n  This amendment, which I have cosponsored, will strike this exemption \nauthority from the bill.\n  This dangerous new authority should not be slipped under the cover of \ndarkness, as it were, into legislation that Senators have had little \ntime to study or amend. If the Secretary of the new Department of \nHomeland Security needs this blanket authority, let him come to \nCongress and make his case. Congress must not hand over blanket \nauthority to this administration which would allow it to cloak \ndecisions in secrecy.\n  Now, Senators, this is what we are about to vote on, this bill. Now, \nif the amendment fails, Senators should not then go ahead and vote for \nthis bill. If this amendment to strike these provisions fails to be \nadopted, Senators have no right then to go home and say: Well, I voted \nfor the amendment. I was for that, but it failed and I, therefore, went \nahead and voted for this bill.\n  What a crappy bill. Don't hide behind your vote when you vote on this \namendment or you vote in relation to it or whatever the vote is when it \ncomes. Don't hide behind that. If that amendment fails, don't hide \nbehind that and say: Well, I voted for the amendment, and so I tried to \nget it in there, but the Senate voted it down, so I went ahead and \nvoted for the bill. Shame on you. And your constituents should say so: \nShame on you. Now, you say you voted for the amendment, and that the \nSenate didn't adopt it. Your convictions were not very strong, so you \nwent ahead and voted for the bill, then, after that amendment failed. \nShame on you.\n  Mr. President, I don't know of any measure that has ever come before \nthe Senate in connection with which I have spoken more passionately, \nwith greater conviction, than I have in regard to this bill. I have no \nspecial ax to grind. No, I have no special ax to grind. I am on \nnobody's payroll except the people's.\n  I am concerned about this. I am more concerned about this bill than I \nbelieve any bill I have ever voted on or will ever have voted on. And I \nhave cast more votes than any Senator in the history of this Republic.\n  I have no special ax to grind. You say: Well, he's 85. He won't be \nrunning again. Don't bet on it. Don't bet on it. That is a matter for \nthe Good Lord to determine and the people of the State of West \nVirginia. So don't count me out. There are those who may say: Don't \ncount me in. I believe there is a song to that effect: ``Don't Count Me \nIn.'' But don't count me out.\n  That is my belief.\n  This dramatic reduction of transparency should not be clandestinely \nslipped into this eleventh-hour legislation, and the Senate should not \nallow such a dangerous provision to be rushed through this Chamber \nduring the final minutes of this Congress.\n  So shame on you if you vote for this amendment, and then, if it \nfails, you turn around and vote for this 484-page bill. Don't use that \nas an excuse when you go back to your constituents.\n  Every Senator has the right to do what he thinks best, but, believe \nyou me, your constituents, if you vote for this bill--if that amendment \nfails, and you still vote for this bill, I hope you won't try to hide \nbehind your vote for the amendment that is before the Senate: Oh, I \nvoted for that amendment, but the Senate rejected it, so I then felt \nthat I had done my best, and I went ahead and voted for the bill. Shame \non you.\n  This administration has worked hard to keep the Congress out of the \nloop. The President has sought to isolate himself from the American \npublic and their Representatives in Congress. He has asked for the \nCongress to provide him with broad statutory powers to further block \ncongressional involvement.\n  That is what this bill will do. Pass this bill, and you will say to \nthe President: Well, I don't know what your plan is--you have not told \nus what your plan is--but we have approved it. Here it is. Here is the \nbill. So you have the next 12 months in which to determine your plan, \nand all you need to do--we hope you will tell us about it. The language \nhere provides for the President ``informing'' the Congress about the \nplan.\n\n  Well, in some cases, Senators have supported the President on these \nissues, either to show unity with the leader of their party or because \nthey fear political attacks if they do not. Less and less, it seems to \nme, do we think about these grants of power that will affect the \nconstitutional checks and balances and separation of powers that \nprotect the constitutional freedoms of our country.\n  I must say this, that the shelf life of appreciation one might expect \nfrom this administration, in having supported it--those of us, may I \nsay, on this side of the aisle, in particular--the shelf life of \nappreciation from this administration for your efforts to curry favor \nwith the administration, if that is what it is, is very short indeed.\n  We saw that in the case of the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Cleland. We saw that in the case of the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri, Mrs. Carnahan. We have seen it in the cases of other Senators \nwho supported the administration. They did\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\nwhat they thought was right. But in any event, their votes were in \nsupport of the administration on various issues--the tax cut, the Iraq \nwar resolution, whatever it might have been--and yet, the President, \nhimself, went into those very States and campaigned against those \nSenators. So this administration's thanks don't go very far, may I say \nto Senators.\n  So the best thing to do, as always, is to do your best, vote your \nconvictions, and stand by your people who send you here, and stand by \nthe Constitution.\n  Henry Clay, as a Senator from Kentucky in 1833, in building the case \nfor the censure of President Andrew Jackson, asked the Senate:\n\n       How often have we, Senators, felt that the check of the \n     Senate, instead of being, as the Constitution intended, a \n     salutary control, was an idle ceremony . . . We have \n     established a system, in which power has been most carefully \n     separated and distributed between three separate and \n     independent departments. We have been told a thousand times, \n     and all experience assures us, that such a division is \n     indispensable to the existence and preservation of freedom. . \n     . .\n\n  This is Henry Clay talking:\n\n       The president, it is true, presides over the whole . . . \n     but has he power to come into Congress, and to say such laws \n     only shall pass . . . to arrest their lawful progress, \n     because they have dared to act contrary to his pleasure? No, \n     sir; no, sir.\n\n  Well, Henry Clay was an opponent of the Presidential veto. He thought \nthat was a despicable thing, the President's veto.\n\n  So he spoke, as I have just read. He spoke of the President and he \nsaid: It is true, he presides over the whole:\n\n     . . . but has he power to come into Congress, and to say such \n     laws only shall pass . . . to arrest their lawful progress, \n     because they have dared to act contrary to his pleasure? No, \n     sir; no, sir.\n\n  The Senate must not blindly follow in the name of party unity. I \ndon't blindly follow in the name of the Democratic Party unity. I don't \ndo that. I won't do that. That will not be my guiding star. In storm or \nin tempest or in fair weather, that will not be my guiding star.\n  The Senate must not blindly follow, in the name of party unity or \nunder the yoke of political pressure, a shortsighted path that \nultimately undermines our sworn duty to support and defend the \nConstitution.\n  I will vote against this homeland security bill because even the \namendment that is before the Senate is not enough. I have some \namendments that I would like to offer. If this amendment fails, I would \nlike to offer my amendments. It is very questionable as to whether I \nwill get to do that, very questionable as to whether or not those \namendments will pass the Senate. I doubt that they will.\n  So I intend to vote against this homeland security bill. I will raise \nmy voice as long as I have a voice, and I will raise my hand as long as \nI can raise that hand to attempt to derail this blatant power grab and \ngiveaway of the people's liberties.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nreclaim 5 minutes of my time that I yielded to Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Daschle, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Byrd to the pending \nlegislation concerning homeland security.\n  I voted earlier against invoking cloture on this legislation because \nin part I disagreed with many of the amendments which were added at the \nlast moment by the House to this bill. The amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lieberman would correct many problems in this House \nbill, although not all. There is much about the underlying bill which \nstill needs to be corrected. I laid out earlier my concerns. Today \nhowever, I want to address the House's legislative ``add-ons'' that \nshould be stripped from this bill. I think it is clear what the house \nhas done in the midnight hour of this Congress.\n  The House leadership has taken a moving train--legislation for a \nDepartment of Homeland Security--and attached gilded carriages for \ntheir special friends to travel on this legislative express.\n  What has been added does not enhance the security of the American \npeople. It enriches a select few companies and special individuals, and \nvery special people. One provision is clearly meant to earmark a new \nuniversity-based homeland security research center program for Texas \nA University, avoiding an open and competitive award process. All of \nus have universities, distinguished centers of higher learning in our \nstates, all of which would welcome the opportunity to make their case \nfor this funding. but under this bill, they will not get that chance. \nHowever, if the Daschle amendment passes, other colleges and \nuniversities would be permitted to demonstrate their competence to be a \ncenter for homeland security research, including Texas A\n  Another provision in this legislation would limit liability to \ncompanies producing homeland security technologies. The main intent of \nthis provision is to eliminate the ability of Americans to obtain \ncompensation should they be harmed by any of these technologies. The \nprovision is open-ended. It does not define how anti-terrorism \ntechnologies will be identified. Under the liability provision \nsections, the Secretary has the discretion to designate which \ntechnologies will benefit from this additional protection from \nliability. This section is not about stimulating the development of new \ntechnologies to protect us. It is about finding new ways to protect \ncompanies from legal liability. Indeed one section of this bill is \nlabeled ``Litigation Management.'' That says it all.\n  The subparagraphs, almost too small to be noticed, undermine the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, and the public's right to know \nthe make-up, meeting schedules, and findings of federal commissions, \ncommittees, councils, and task forces. These groups are chartered by \nthe President, Congress, and agency heads to give independent advice \nand recommendations on substantial policy issues and technological \nproblems.\n  Congress enacted FACA in 1972 to address concerns of committees being \nredundant, having inadequate oversight, using secretive operations, and \nnot representing public interest. FACA requires that the advice \nprovided by such committees be objective and responsive to public \nconcerns. Committee meetings are required to be open and properly \nnoticed, with specific exceptions. The House bill would give the \nSecretary of Homeland Security a blanket exemption from FACA \nrequirements once the Secretary notices the creation of a committee and \nits intent. One wonders why the House Leadership wants to overturn \nsunshine rules. What do they want to hide?\n  This is a very serious matter. What sort of oversight will these \ncommittees have? Who will serve on them? Will all interests be \nrepresented? How will we confirm that the public interests have been \nmet? To allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to set up advisory \ncommittees that are free from the balanced regulations of FACA is to \nretreat back to a time when special interests groups ran roughshod over \nthe public's interest and recommended one sided-views without \nappropriate oversight.\n  The original Lieberman substitute, and the original Gramm-Miller \namendment, were based upon provisions that were debated and discussed \nwithin the Governmental Affairs Committee through hearings and business \nmeetings. The bill before us today has several provisions that have not \nhad that treatment and will directly benefit the airline and rail \ncompanies and other special interests.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee spent weeks and months studying, \ndebating, and drafting legislation on homeland security. In contrast, \nthis bill was not written in committee and some parts of the bill \nbefore us today have had only special interest input. That is not the \nbest way to ensure public safety and national security.\n  I yield my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator Jean Carnahan. After \nlosing her husband and eldest son in a tragic plane accident, Missouri \ncalled upon Mrs. Carnahan to fill the remainder of her husband's Term. \nSenator Carnahan answered the call of duty and did it with a fair, \ncourageous hand.\n  Senator Carnahan was Missouri's first member of the Armed Services \nCommittee in over 25 years. She also served on the Small Business \nCommittee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Commerce Committee, \nand the Special Committee on Aging.\n  Senator Carnahan made a strong economy her top priority. Her ability \nto secure defense projects for Missouri and safeguard funding for \nfamily farmers hurt by flooding and drought clearly shows Senator \nCarnahan's desire to bolster Missouri's economy, provide good jobs for \nMissouri workers, and support our Nation's effort in the war against \nterrorism.\n  Senator Carnahan also knew that a highly skilled workforce required \nequal educational opportunities. Her Quality Classrooms Amendment \nallowed local schools greater flexibility in deciding how to utilize \nFederal dollars. She also worked to secure over $1.3 million for \nprograms boosting postsecondary education assistance to low-income \nstudents. These initiatives illustrate Senator Carnahan's deep \ncommitment to a better education and a brighter future for all Missouri \nstudents.\n  Filling the seat of her late husband, Senator Carnahan led with \ndignity and courage as Missouri's first female Senator. She took office \nat a time of personal loss and hardship, yet prevailed and proved to be \na strong leader for Missouri. I would like to join my colleagues in \nwishing Senator Carnahan and her family the very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11198-6", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11198-S11199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PHIL GRAMM\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Phil Gramm.\n  Without Senator Gramm, none of us would ever know who Dicky Flatt is. \nWe would not know nearly as much as we know about Texas A as we do. \nAnd we would probably still be trying to repeal Glass-Steagall.\n  I met Senator Gramm on a number of occasions when I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, but I did not really get to know him \nuntil I joined that Banking Committee in January 1999, when he was the \nchairman.\n  Senator Gramm's first order of business was to finally pass a repeal \nof the Glass-Steagall banking law. I had worked on this same repeal \nduring my first term in the House, 12 years earlier, and I know many \nothers had been working on this effort for much longer than that. But \nit was Senator Gramm's dogged determination that finally pushed the \nball over the goal line and brought our banking laws into the 21st \nCentury.\n  I won't bore everyone by going into a long list of Senator Gramm's \nother legislative accomplishments; they are too numerous to mention, \nbut I would put him right up there with a small group of other senators \nwho have had the greatest impact on the Senate in the past century.\n  Outside of our working relationship, I have also gotten to know \nSenator Gramm, and his lovely life Wendy, very well over as friends.\n  I would also like to tell a little story about how Senator Gramm's \nunselfishness greatly assisted me when I was in a tight spot. Everyone \nin this body remembers the anthrax attacks of last year. As a resident \nof the Hart Building, I was one of those who was forced to find other \nspace when the Hart building was closed. The Architect of the Capitol, \nthe Senate Superintendent and the Rules Committee did a great job, \nunder very trying circumstances, of finding space for everyone. But \nthere were about fifty offices that were relocated so space was tight. \nMy staff and I were sitting on top of each other down in EF-100 \nunderneath the back steps of the Capitol.\n  We were glad to have the space. But it wasn't much more than a \nglorified broom closet.\n  Well, Senator Gramm heard about my predicament and very graciously \nlet me use his Capitol hideaway office until the Hart building was \nreopened. He only asked that I did not ``trash the place and leave \nempty whiskey bottles on the floor.'' I can assure the Members of the \nSenate and the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that I followed \nhis instructions.\n  I am also fairly confident that as much as I appreciated the kind \ngesture, my staff appreciated the fact I had somewhere else to go even \nmore. It is not just Members who will miss Senator Gramm, but staff as \nwell.\n  We will miss his leadership, but I think we will miss his courage \neven more. Senator Gramm is wiling to take unpopular stands. He is \nwilling to lose a vote 99-1. He is willing to keep the Senate in all \nnight to fight for what he believes in, no matter how unpopular that \nstand may be.\n  One example that stands out clearly in my mind was at the beginning \nof the debate on the Clinton health care bill. Many don't remember now, \nbut when we first started working on that issue in Congress, President \nClinton had a lot of momentum and it looked like only a foregone \nconclusion that he would get some sort of bill passed. Those of us who \ndidn't the President's proposal really felt like we were swimming \nupstream.\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\n  Then Phill Gramm took the Senate floor, and laid out a withering \nassessment of the bill and why it would do so much harm to the country \nif passed. He wrapped up his remarks by saying that ``the Clinton \nhealth bill would pass the Senate over my cold, dead political body.'' \nThat served as a rallying cry for the rest of the Congress and signaled \na real turning point in the debate. But, at the time, it wasn't popular \nand most people on Capitol Hill thought it wasn't very smart. But it \nwas right. That's Phil Gramm for you.\n  I have heard him say on more than one occasion. ``I've never taken a \nhostage I wasn't willing to shoot.'' Everyone knows Senator Phil Gramm \nwill kill a bill if he thinks it's bad for America or if fellow Texans \nare being treated unfairly. And he has shot some legislative hostages.\n  But more often than not, he was able, through negotiation, to work \nout a better product.\n  I think the Senate will miss his homespun eloquence. I don't think \nthere is anyone better at simplifying a complicated bill for his \ncolleagues and the American people. Whether he uses the ``Dicky Flatt \ntest'' or the wisdom his mama passed down to him, Senator Gramm has the \nunique ability to make the complicated simple. On this side of the \naisle, that eloquence will be missed, he always did a great job of \narticulating our position.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gramm will be missed not just by me, but this \nentire body, the people of Texans and all Americans. I will miss him as \na Senator and a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11199-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Fred Thompson.\n  Since his arrival in the Senate in 1994, Senator Thompson has been \none of the most respected Members on both sides of the aisle. His \nconstituents clearly have great admiration and respect for him. In \n1996, Senator Thompson received more votes than any other candidate in \nthe history of Tennessee and won his reelection by more than twenty \npoints!\n  Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Senator Thompson has been a \ntremendous supporter of conservative ideals and principles. As a member \nof the Senate Finance Committee, he has fought to reduce taxes for his \nfellow Tennesseans and all Americans, and helped to stabilize Medicare \nand Social Security for future generations.\n  As a member of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, I have had \nthe privilege of working with Senator Thompson on various projects when \nhe served as chairman, and later as the ranking Republican member. The \nSenator should be congratulated for his hard work on the President's \npriority to create the Homeland Security Department.\n  In a recent interview, Senator Thompson said he has ``always looked \nat public service as more an interruption to a career than a career \nitself.'' It is now time for Senator Thompson to begin his new career \nas the District Attorney on the hit television show ``Law and Order.'' \nI wish my good friend Senator Thompson well in his new job, and I leave \nhim with this little piece of advice: don't let Hollywood turn you into \na liberal!\n  Senator Thompson will be missed not just by me, but this entire body, \nthe people of Tennessee and all Americans. I will miss him as a \nSenator, but look forward to watching my friend on Wednesday nights as \nhe begins his new career on ``Law and Order.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11199-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TIM HUTCHINSON\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today \nto pay tribute to Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas\n  Since 1985, when he first began his career in public service as a \nmember of the Arkansas State House of Representatives, Tim Hutchinson \nhas fought for the people of Arkansas and the citizens of the United \nStates of America. Throughout his 12 years in public office at the \nState and Federal level, Tim has worked hard to push his conservative \nagenda and ideals. He has been a strong proponent of a balanced budget, \ntax relief and reform of our Nation's education system.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives from 1992 to 1998, Tim \nauthored the much needed $500-per-child tax credit, which allows \nparents to place as much as $2,000 per year, per child, in a designated \nsavings account. He was also one of the main actors in the pursuit to \nreform this nation's struggling and inefficient welfare system. Besides \nhis many accomplishments in the areas of tax relief, education and \nwelfare reform, Tim has been a major advocate of issues affecting our \nnation's veterans. He has worked tirelessly over the years to open \nadditional outpatient clinics for veterans across Arkansas.\n  As a Member of the U.S. Senate, Tim Hutchinson served on the Armed \nService Committee, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nAgriculture Committee, Veterans Affairs Committee and the Special \nCommittee on Aging. As a member of the Education Working Group, Senator \nHutchinson led the charge to pass the ``Education Savings Accounts'' \nLegislation. I am also very proud to have worked with Senator \nHutchinson on trying to pass legislation which bans human cloning.\n  I have had the honor of serving with Tim Hutchinson in both the House \nand Senate. I have served with him on the Senate Armed Service \nCommittee and know first hand how hard this individual has worked to \nmake this Nation a safer and better place for all to live. With his \nbackground as a teacher and businessman, Tim was able to bring both \nexpertise and leadership to the Republican party. We need more public \nservants like Tim Hutchinson who champion empowerment over dependency. \nIt was a pleasure and honor to serve with him in this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11199-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11199-S11204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE PROTECT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed, by unanimous \nconsent, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act providing important new tools to \nfight child pornography. I want to take a moment to speak about the \npassage of this important bill and the effort that it took to get to \nthis point. Although they have recessed subject to the recall of the \nSpeaker of the House, I also want to implore the Republican leadership \nin the House of Representatives not to miss this important opportunity \nto pass such important bipartisan legislation as this.\n  In April, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in \nintroducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (``Free Speech''). \nAlthough there were some others who raised constitutional concerns \nabout specific provisions in that bill, I believed--and still believe--\nthat unlike the Administration proposal, it was a good faith effort to \nwork within the First Amendment.\n  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect \nour children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be \nan easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law \nthat will both do that and will stick. In 1996, when we passed the \nChild Pornography Prevention Act, ``CPPA'', many warned us that certain \nprovisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme \nCourt's recent decision in Free Speech has proven them correct.\n  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond \nto the Supreme Court decision. It is just as important, however, that \nwe avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 CPPA, this time \nwe should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our \nchildren deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They \ndeserve a law that will last.\n  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of \nreal children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we \npass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law \nwith real teeth, not one with false teeth.\n  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, I \nconvened a Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation. We heard \nfrom the Administration, from the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, NCMEC, and from experts who came and told us that \nour bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the \nHouse-passed bill would not.\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\n  I then placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the \nOctober 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator \nHatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator \nHatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute \nthat improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. \nUnfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because \nof procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with \nthis important legislation, including the refusal of Committee members \non the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on \nthe Committee's agenda.\n  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in \nOctober, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute \nto S. 2520 that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute \nin nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted \nparts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and \nstate law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate \nfloor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, \nevery single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged \nRepublicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--\nso similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could \nswiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. \nUnfortunately, instead of working to clear that bipartisan, \nconstitutional measure, colleagues on the other side of the aisle opted \nto use this issue to play politics before the election.\n  They redrafted the bill, changed crucial definitions, and offered a \nnew version. Facing the recess before the mid-term elections, we were \nstymied again.\n  Even after the election, however, during our lame duck session, I \nhave continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation \nthrough the Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I \ncalled a meeting of the Judiciary Committee yesterday. In the last \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th \nCongress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda \nagain. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee approved this \nlegislation, as amended. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements \nin the victim shield provision that I authored. Although I did not \nagree with two of Senator Hatch's amendments because I thought that \nthey risked having the bill declared unconstitutional, I nevertheless \nboth called for the Committee to approve the bill and voted for the \nbill in its amended form.\n  I then sought, that same day, to gain the unanimous consent of the \nfull Senate to pass S. 2520 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, and \nI worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the \naisle. I am please that late last night that the Senate passed S. 2520 \nby unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for his help \nclearing the bill for passage last night.\n  I am glad to have been able to work hand in hand with Senator Hatch \non S. 2520, the PROTECT Act, a bill that gives prosecutors and \ninvestigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious \nproblem.\n  The provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 2520, as we introduced it \nare bipartisan and good faith efforts to protect both our children and \nto honor the Constitution. At our hearing last month, Constitutional \nand criminal law scholars--one of whom was the same person who warned \nus last time that the CPPA would be struck down--stated that the \nPROTECT Act could withstand Constitutional scrutiny, although there \nwere parts that were very close to the line.\n  Unfortunately these experts could not say the same about the \nadministration's bill, which seems to challenge the Supreme Court's \ndecision, rather than accommodate the restraints spelled out by the \nSupreme Court. I have also received letters from other Constitutional \nscholars and practitioners expressing the same conclusion, which I will \nplace in the Record with unanimous consent. The Administration's \nproposal and House bill simply ignore the Supreme Court's decision and \nreflect an ideological response instead of a carefully drawn bill that \nwill stand up to scrutiny.\n\n  The PROTECT Act is a good faith effort, but it is not perfect and I \nwould have liked to have seen some additional changes to the bill. \nUnfortunately, I could not obtain agreement to make the following \nmodifications:\n  First, regarding the tip line, I would have liked to clarify that law \nenforcement agents cannot ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key \nprotections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to \nensure that there is an affirmative defense for the new category of \nchild pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in \ncourt that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child \nbut only actual, identifiable adults.\n  Nevertheless, we were able to reach agreement in Committee on \nmodifying the bill with my amendment to the victims' shield law by \ngiving federal judges and prosecutors the discretion to override the \nnew victim shield law when there is good cause, such as cases where the \nshield law is actually used as a sword by the defendant to help assert \na defense.\n  As a general matter, I would have thought it far simpler to take the \napproach of outlawing ``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which \nwe do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would \nproduce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also \nsupported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nwhich we all respect as the true expert in this field.\n  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions \nsubmitted after our hearing, which I will place in the Record in its \nentirety:\n\n       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child \n     pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and \n     juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in \n     criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under \n     community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any \n     community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .\n       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate the \n     prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach \n     is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n\n  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional \nquestions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one.\n  Because that is not the approach we decided to use, I recognize that \nS. 2520 contains provisions about which some may have legitimate \nConstitutional questions. These provisions include:\n  A new ``pandering'' provision with a very wide scope;\n  a new definition of `obscenity' that contains some, but not all, of \nthe elements of the Supreme Court's test;\n  a new affirmative defense for pornography made not using any minors \nthat does not apply to one new category of child pornography.\n  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of \nmaking progress I am pleased, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nto have tried to balance all the competing interests to produce a bill \nwith the best chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.\n  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more \nimportant to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media \nreport just this week on this legislation noted the wide consensus that \nS. 2520 is more likely than the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but \nquoted a Republican House member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to \nCongress three times we will have created better legislation.''\n  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' \nright now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of \nlitigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim \nperiod before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of \nCongress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what S. 2520 \nseeks to accomplish as drafted.\n  I want to commend Senator Hatch for working with me to include many \nother important provisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill that we developed \ntogether and are not as controversial. These include:\n  A tough new private right of action for victims of child pornography \nwith punitive damages;\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n  a victims' shield law to keep child victim's identity out of court \nand prevent them from suffering a second time in the criminal process;\n  a new notice provision designed to stop ``surprise defenses;''\n  sentencing enhancements for recidivists and a directive to correct \nthe disparity in the current sentencing guidelines that provides a \nlighter sentence for offenders who cross state lines to actually molest \na child than for offenders who possess child pornography that has \ncrossed State lines.\n  These provisions are important, practical tools to put child \npornographers out of business for good and in jail where they belong.\n  I support S. 2520 as a good faith effort to protect our children and \nhonor the Constitution, and the Committee substitute, which improved \nupon the original bill.\n  There were two amendments adopted in Committee to which I objected. I \nfelt that they needlessly risked a serious constitutional challenge to \na bill that already provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do \ntheir jobs. Let me discuss my opposition to two amendments offered by \nmy good friend Senator Hatch that were adopted by voice vote by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n\n  Although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering \nprovision in S. 2520, I do not support Senator Hatch's amendment, which \ncriminalizes speech even when there is no underlying material at all--\nwhether obscene or non-obscene, virtual or real, child or adult.\n  The pandering provision is an important tool for prosecutors to \npunish true child pornographers who for some technical reason are \nbeyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or production \nstatutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking dirty over \nthe internet or the telephone when the person never possesses any \nmaterial at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.\n  The current pandering provision in S. 2520 is quite broad, and some \nhave argued that it presents constitutional problems as written, but I \nthought that prosecutors needed a strong tool, so I supported Senator \nHatch on the current provision.\n  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First \nAmendment expert, testified at our hearing that he thought that the \nprovision was Constitutional, barely.\n  Unfortunately, Professor Schauer has since written to me stating that \nthis new amendment ``would push well over the constitutional edge a \nprovision that is now up against the edge, but probably barely on the \nconstitutional side of it.'' I will place that letter and other \nmaterials in the Record with unanimous consent of the Senate.\n  Because this amendment endangers the entire pandering provision, \nbecause it is unwise, and because that section is already strong enough \nto prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I oppose this \namendment. Nevertheless, in light of the broader support for this \namendment on the Committee, it was adopted over my objection.\n  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. \nBut regardless of our personal views, any law must be within \nconstitutional limits or it does no good at all. Even though it is \nclose to the line, I support S. 2520 as Senator Hatch and I introduced \nit in the Senate. Senator Hatch's amendment which would include all \n``virtual child pornography'' in the definition of child pornography, \nin my view, crosses the constitutional line, however, and needlessly \nrisks protracted litigation that could assist child pornographers in \nescaping punishment.\n  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, even when it \nwas introduced I expressed concern over certain provisions. One such \nprovision was the new definition of ``identifiable minor.'' When the \nbill was introduced, I noted that this provision might ``both confuse \nthe statute unnecessarily and endanger the already upheld `morphing' \nsection of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that it ``could present \nboth overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later constitutional \nchallenge.''\n  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child \npornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it \ninvolves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, \nwhether or not we agree with it.\n  The ``identifiable minor'' provision in S. 2520 may be used without \nany link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what saves it is that it \napplies to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision is \ndesigned to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or \naltered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child \ninvolved. That is the provision as Senator Hatch and I introduced this \nbill.\n  The Hatch amendment adopted in Committee that redefined \n``identifiable minor'' by creating a new category of pornography for \nany ``computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable from \nan actual minor'' dislodged, in my view, that sole constitutional \nanchor. The new provision could be read to include images that never \ninvolved real children at all but were 100 percent computer generated.\n  That was never the goal of this provision and that was the reason it \nwas constitutional. There are other provisions in the bill that deal \nwith obscene virtual child pornography that I support. This provision \nwas intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of \nreal children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution.\n  I support the definition of `identifiable minor' as we originally \nwrote and introduced it. Because Senator Hatch's amendment seriously \nweakened the constitutional argument supporting this entire provision, \nI opposed it. Nevertheless, given the broader support for this \namendment on the Judiciary Committee it was been adopted, over my \nobjection and I still sought passage of the bill, which we achieved \nlast night.\n  Even though S. 2520 is not perfect, I was glad that I was able to \nwork with Senator Hatch to secure its approval last night. I had hoped \nthat the House of Representatives would adopt the bill before they \nrecessed for the end of the year. That way, we could have sent a bill \nto the President for his signature right now. Instead, the House of \nRepresentatives' Republican leadership decided to adjourn without \neither taking up the Hatch-Leahy bill or working with us to resolve any \ndifferences. I hope that the House leadership will reconsider this \ndecision and consider this measure, rather than start all over again in \nthe next Congress. It is certainly unfortunate that the House \nRepublican leadership would rather adjourn for a recess than take the \nopportunity to pass a bipartisan bill which passed the Senate \nunanimously.\n  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I \nhave been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I \ndo not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is \nhow legislation is normally passed. Again, however, I fear that some in \nthe Administration and the House have decided to play politics with \nthis issue that is so important to our nation's children. I urge them \nto reconsider their ``take it or leave it approach'' and consider the \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act--or at least come back to discuss our \ndifferences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and materials to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            University of Virginia\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                              Charlottesville, VA.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: On October 2, 2002, I testified before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee concerning S. 2520 and H.R. \n     4623. Each of these bills was drafted in response to Ashcroft \n     v. Free Speech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002), in which \n     the Supreme Court threw out key provisions of the federal \n     child pornography laws. As I stated in my testimony, the new \n     sections contained in S. 2520 have been carefully tailored \n     with an eye towards satisfying the precise concerns \n     identified by the Supreme Court. Recently, Senator Hatch \n     offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2520 \n     (hereinafter ``the Hatch Substitute''). I have examined the \n     Hatch Substitute, and I believe that it contains a definition \n     of child pornography that is nearly identical to the \n     definition rejected by Free Speech Coalition. Therefore, the \n     Hatch substitute is unlikely to survive constitutional \n     challenge in the federal courts, and the Committee should \n     decline to adopt it.\n       As you know, each of these bills contains some complicated \n     provisions, including especially their definition sections. \n     As you also\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\n     know, this complexity is unavoidable, for the Congress aims \n     to intervene in and eliminate some of the complex law \n     enforcement problems created by the phenomenon of virtual \n     pornography. In the following comments, I will try to state \n     my concerns about the Hatch Substitute as concisely as \n     possible, while identifying the statutory nuances that are \n     likely to generate significant constitutional questions in \n     the event that the Hatch Substitute is enacted.\n       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court scrutinized \n     provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 \n     (``CPPA'') that were designed to eliminate obstacles to law \n     enforcement created by virtual child pornography. The \n     proliferation of virtual pornography has enabled child \n     pornographers to escape conviction by arguing that it is so \n     difficult to distinguish the virtual child from the real one \n     that (1) the government cannot carry its burden of proving \n     that the pornography was made using real children and/or (2) \n     the government cannot carry its burden of providing scineter \n     because the defendants believed that the images in their \n     possession depicted virtual children, rather than real ones. \n     In order to foreclose these arguments, the CPPA defined \n     ``child pornography'' broadly so that it extended not only to \n     a sexually-explicit image that had been produce using a real \n     minor, but also to an image that ``appears to be of a minor'' \n     engaging in sexually-explicit conduct. Free Speech Coalition \n     rejected this definition of First Amendment grounds. The \n     Court reaffirmed the holding of New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. \n     747 (1982), under which the government is free to regulate \n     sexually-explicit materials produced using real minors \n     without regard to the value of those materials. However, the \n     Court refused to extend the Ferber analysis to sexually-\n     explicit materials that only appear to depict minors. The \n     court noticed that many mainstream movies, as well as works \n     of great artistic, literary, and scientific significance, \n     explore the sexuality of adolescents and children. Such \n     works, including ones that are sexually explicit, are \n     valuable in the eyes of the community, and, as long as \n     their production involves no real children, such works are \n     protected by the First Amendment against governmental \n     regulation.\n       In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme court expressly \n     considered and rejected a number of arguments made by the \n     Solicitor General on behalf of the CPPA definition. One of \n     these arguments was that the ``speech prohibited by the CPPA \n     is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography, which \n     may be banned without regard to whether it depicts works of \n     value.'' In his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy \n     explained that this argument fundamentally misconceived the \n     nature of the First Amendment inquiry. Materials that satisfy \n     the Ferber definition are regulable not because they are \n     necessarily without value; to the contrary, Ferber itself \n     recognized that some child pornography might have significant \n     value. Indeed, the Court there reasoned that the ban on the \n     use of actual children was permissible in part because \n     virtual images--by definition, images ``virtually \n     indistinguishable'' from child pornography--were an available \n     and lawful alternative. Hence, as Justice Kennedy put it: \n     ``Ferber, then, not only referred to the distinction between \n     actual and virtual child pornography, it relied on [the \n     distinction] as a reason supporting its holding. Ferber \n     provides no support for a statute that eliminate the \n     distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as \n     well.''\n       S. 2520 aims to reform the CPPA in ways that are sensitive \n     to these First Amendment value judgments. By contrast, the \n     Hatch Substitute proposes that the Congress should reenact a \n     definition that is almost identical to the one that the \n     Supreme Court just rejected. In the Hatch Substitute, the \n     definition of child pornography would cover, among other \n     things, sexually-explicit materials whose production involved \n     the use of an ``identifiable minor.'' The Hatch Substitute \n     defines ``identifiable minor'' as including a ``computer or \n     computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable \n     from an actual minor.'' As I explained above, the Solicitor \n     General suggested in Free Speech Coalition that the First \n     Amendment would be satisfied if the Supreme Court limited the \n     CPPA to depictions that are ``virtually indistinguishable'' \n     from child pornography, and the Court rejected that \n     interpretation. To put it mildly, it is hard to imagine that \n     the Supreme Court would be inclined to view the Hatch \n     Substitute as a good faith legislative responses to Free \n     Speech Coalition when all it does is reenact a definition \n     that the Court there expressly considered and disapproved. \n     You will notice that I here am paraphrasing the definition \n     provisions in the Hatch Substitute and omitting some of their \n     complexity. In particular, the Hatch Substitute provides a \n     further definition of the phrase ``virtually \n     indistinguishable,'' requiring that the quality of the \n     depiction be determined from the viewpoint of an ``ordinary \n     person'' and providing an exception for ``drawings, cartoons, \n     sculptures, or paintings.'' But neither the definition of \n     ``identifiable minor'' nor these refinements of ``virtually \n     indistinguishable'' are calculated to satisfy the concerns \n     raised in Free Speech Coalition. As Justice Kennedy explained \n     for the Court, an absolute ban on pornography made with real \n     children is compatible with First Amendment rights precisely \n     because computer-generated images are an available \n     alternative, and, yet, the Hatch Substitute proposed to \n     forbid the computer-generated alternative as well. Likewise, \n     an exception for cartoons and so forth is insensitive to the \n     Supreme Court's commitment to protect realistic portrayals of \n     child sexuality, a commitment that is clearly expressed in \n     the Court's recognition of the value of (among other things) \n     mainstream movies such as Traffic and American Beauty.\n       In this regard, you will notice that the Hatch Substitute \n     closely resembles some of the defective provisions of H.R. \n     4623, which would prohibit virtual child porn that is \n     ``indistinguishable'' from porn produced with real minors. \n     Unlike S. 2520, both H.R. 4623 and the Hatch Substitute seem \n     to embody a decision merely to endorse the unconstitutional \n     portions of the CPPA all over again. The Committee should \n     refuse to engage in such a futile and disrespectful exercise. \n     The law enforcement problems posed by virtual pornography are \n     not symbolic but real, and the Congress should make a real \n     effort to solve them. In my judgment, S. 2520 is a real \n     effort to solve them, and the Committee should use S. 2520 as \n     the basis for correcting the CPPA.\n       The Hatch Substitute contains additional innovations that \n     the Committee should study carefully. Because this letter \n     already is too long, I will allude to only one of them here. \n     The ``pandering'' provision set forth in the Hatch Substitute \n     contains some language that strikes me as being both vague \n     and unnecessarily broad, and the provision therefore is \n     likely to attract unfavorable attention in the federal \n     courts. The Hatch pandering provision would punish anyone who \n     ``advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits . \n     . . any material or purported material in a manner that \n     conveys the impression that the material or purported \n     material'' is child pornography. To be completely candid, I \n     am not sure that I understand what problems would be solved \n     by defining the items that may not be pandered so that they \n     include not only actual ``material,'' but also ``purported \n     material.'' I suppose that there might be cases where a \n     person offers to sell pornographic materials that do not \n     actually exist and that the person might make the offer in a \n     manner that violates the pandering prohibition. If that is \n     the problem that the drafters of the Hatch Substitute have in \n     mind, it seems that they might solve that problem more \n     cleanly by adding the word ``offers'' to the list of \n     forbidden conduct and deleting the references to ``purported \n     material.'' (In other words, the provision would punish \n     anyone who ``advertises, offers, promotes, presents, \n     distributes, or solicits through the mails . . . any material \n     in a manner that conveys the impression that the material'' \n     is child pornography.) If that is not the problem that the \n     Hatch Substitute has in mind, I would suggest that the \n     drafters identify the problem precisely and develop language \n     that is clearer and narrower than the phrase ``purported \n     material,'' for that ambiguous term is likely to generate \n     First Amendment concerns that otherwise could and should be \n     avoided.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 Anne M.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I want to thank you for your efforts \n     to protect American children by filling the gap left by the \n     Supreme Court's decision to strike down the Child Pornography \n     Prevention Act. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition dealt a \n     blow to those who appreciate the important role the federal \n     government must play in protecting young people from those \n     who would exploit them. Your efforts to craft a bill, the \n     PROTECT Act, that will withstand Constitutional scrutiny \n     deserves the public's applause.\n       I would like to draw your attention to a similar, but \n     separate, matter that also reflects on the health and \n     security of our children in regards to pornography. Like the \n     Child Pornography Prevention Act, the Child Internet \n     Protection Act (CIPA), which was passed by the 106th \n     Congress, has been struck down by the federal judiciary. In \n     American Library Association, et al. v. United States of \n     America, et al, a District Court in Pennsylvania threw CIPA \n     out, arguing that its efforts to prevent children from \n     exposure to harmful material on school and library computers \n     amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. The Justice \n     Department has appealed that case to the Supreme Court, where \n     the lower court's decision will very likely be upheld. \n     Unfortunately, as Harvard Law School professor Frederick \n     Schauer testified at the hearing you recently held on CPPA, \n     ``constitutionally suspect legislation under existing Supreme \n     Court interpretation of the First Amendment, whatever we may \n     think of the wisdom and accuracy of those interpretations, \n     puts the process of [prosecution] . . . on hold while the . . \n     . courts proceed at their own slow pace.''\n       I think we ought not wait for what will likely be a \n     disappointing conclusion. Rather, I hope you will lead an \n     effort to craft new legislation which (1) passes \n     Constitutional muster, and (2) better enables schools and \n     libraries to protect children from harmful images and \n     websites. Let me take a moment to delimit how exactly a new, \n     improved Children's Internet Protection Act would differ from \n     the bill passed by the 106th Congress.\n       First, a new bill should distinguish clearly between \n     measures affecting adults and minors. Though the title of the \n     legislation is\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\n     the Children's Internet Protection Act, it requires \n     technology protection measures on all computers with Internet \n     access, regardless of the age of the patron using each \n     computer. If the aim is to protect minors, it is unnecessary \n     to put filters on every computer in a library. This, of \n     course, was one of the District Court's primary concerns. I \n     hope you will draft legislation requiring separate computers \n     for adults and minors. All those under 18 should be required \n     to use filtered computers, unless accompanied by a parent or \n     teacher. Those over 18 should have access to un-filtered \n     computers in a separate area. In smaller facilities, where \n     only one computer is available, special adult hours could be \n     set during which the filter is disabled and only adults may \n     use the computer. The rest of the time a filter would be in \n     place.\n       Second, I would encourage you to incorporate language that \n     distinguishes children 12 and under from teenagers 13-18. \n     Teenagers have greater capacities to process information than \n     children, as well as different needs for information. In \n     recognition of this, I would hope that your new bill would \n     require different policies for children and teenagers, such \n     as providing different filter settings.\n       Third, I hope you will consider expanding the scope of your \n     bill to include provisions that protect minors from violent \n     images as well as sexual ones. I realize that limiting the \n     access of children to violent content poses a potentially \n     more difficult constitutional question, but based on the \n     weight of social science evidence showing the harm caused to \n     children by violence in the media, I believe that violence \n     must be included in any definition of content that is \n     ``harmful to children.''\n       To further explain the reasoning behind these \n     recommendations, I am enclosing a law review article, ``On \n     Protecting Children from Speech,'' which will be published \n     next fall in the Chicago-Kent Law Review. I would welcome the \n     opportunity to discuss our position with you further. In the \n     meantime, please feel free to contact Marc Dunkelman, \n     Assistant Director of the Communitarian Network, with any \n     questions. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Amitai Etzioni.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 13, 2002.\n     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern \n     with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of \n     Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No. \n     00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed \n     legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene \n     nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly \n     targets images that do not involve real human being at all). \n     Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same \n     infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at \n     issue in Ashcroft.\n       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel \n     toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate \n     efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in \n     Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act \n     within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the \n     bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Jodie L.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement \n     and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday, \n     October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to \n     comment on the constitutional implications of changing the \n     current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in \n     section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to \n     ``purported material.''\n       In my opinion the change would push well over the \n     constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against \n     that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of \n     it.\n       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme \n     Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling \n     decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in \n     2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be \n     an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the \n     offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child \n     pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition \n     in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five \n     years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision, \n     however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as \n     commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of \n     an unlawful product or service is not protected by the \n     Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made \n     clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press \n     v. Human Relations Commission 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is \n     important to recognize, however, that this feature of \n     commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial \n     speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is \n     fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not \n     applicable here, of immediate incitement.\n       The implication of this is that moving away from \n     communication that could be described as an actual commercial \n     advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to \n     defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if \n     advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all \n     (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a \n     substantial risk that the change moves the entire section \n     away from the straight commercial speech category into more \n     general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy. \n     Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of \n     this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech \n     Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a \n     straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction \n     increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including \n     ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks \n     less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and \n     thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlined in my \n     written statement and oral testimony.\n       I hope that this is helpful.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                            Frederick Schauer,\n\n                                    Frank Stanton Professor of the\n     First Amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Media Coalition Inc.,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 23, 2002.\n     Re S. 2520 and H.R. 4623.\n\n     Sentor Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC\n     Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: I am General Counsel of The \n     Media Coalition, a trade association whose members represent \n     most of the publishers, booksellers, librarians, periodical \n     wholesalers and distributors, movie, recording and video game \n     manufacturers, and recording and video retailers in the \n     United States. While Media Coalition and its members \n     unanimously deplore child pornography and support prosecution \n     of offenders, they are also concerned that the dictates of \n     the First Amendment remain inviolate, even as to material \n     that one finds to be offensive.\n       The Media Coalition and its members believe that the \n     various attempts to respond to the decision in Ashcroft v. \n     Free Speech Coalition, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (2002), are \n     unconstitutional and problematic in a number of respects, as \n     described below.\n\n\n                                S. 2520\n\n       1. As to proposed Sec. 2252A(a)(3)(B)--the ``pandering'' \n     provision--it seems to criminalize commercial fraud as child \n     pornography. Ginzburg v. U.S., 383 U.S. 463 (1966), held only \n     that pandering could convert borderline non-obscene material \n     into obscenity. (``Where the purveyor's sole emphasis is on \n     the sexually provocative aspects of his publications, that \n     fact may be decisive in the determination of obscenity.'') \n     This goes must further. It applies without regard to the \n     nature or quality of the material ``pandered''.\n       2. Proposed Sec. 2252A(c) adds an affirmative defense that, \n     for computer-generated images, each pictured person was an \n     adult and, for virtual child pornography, it was not produced \n     using any actual minor. With respect to non-virtual child \n     pornography, this results in a reversal of the usual burden \n     of proof. IN a prosecution for traditional child pornography \n     (e.g., as defined in Sec. 2256(8)(A)), one of the elements of \n     the crime that the government must prove is that the \n     production of the material involved the use of a minor. \n     Further, under United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., \n     513U.S. 64 (1994), in the case of a librarian, retailer or \n     distributor, the government must prove that he or she knew \n     that the material was of an actual minor. This proposal \n     impermissibly and unconstitutionally shifts this burden.\n       With respect to virtual child pornography, there are \n     similar constitutional problems. The Supreme Court in Free \n     Speech Coalition found that the evil in child pornography, \n     and the basis for excluding it from First Amendment \n     protection, is the unlawful conduct vis-a-vis an actual \n     child. Thus, the Court held that, unless an actual child is \n     used and thus abused in the creation of the material, there \n     can be no crime as to otherwise First Amendment-protected \n     material. The government must provide this necessary factual \n     predicate. To shift the burden of proof as to this \n     necessary element of the crime to the defendant is \n     unconstitutional, even putting aside the often impossible \n     task of proving the negative--that no child was used.\n       3. S. 2520 also amends the record-keeping provisions, which \n     themselves have had a checkered constitutional history, \n     having\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\n     been held unconstitutional (ALA v. Thornburgh, 713 F. Supp. \n     469 (D.D.C. 1989)), revised in 1990, again held \n     unconstitutional by the District Court (ALA v. Barr, 794 F. \n     Supp. 412 (D.D.C. 1992)), held constitutional, although \n     certain regulations were invalidated (ALA v. Reno. 33 F. 3d \n     78 (D.C. Cir. 1994)), and subsequently the Tenth Circuit has \n     held a regulation more central to the regulatory scheme \n     unconstitional (Sundance Assocs. Inc. v. Reno, 139 F. 3d 804 \n     (10th Cir. 1998)). Throughout, however, the records kept have \n     been barred from use in prosecutions other than for the \n     failure to keep the records.\n       S. 2520 would permit the use of the recordkeeping records \n     in a child pornography prosecution. However, requiring \n     producers to maintain records at the risk of criminal \n     liability for not doing so, which records can be used against \n     them in a child pornography prosecution, violates the \n     constitutional prohibition against mandatory self-\n     incrimination.\n       4. Finally, there is a provision in Section 9 creating a \n     new Sec. 2252A(f), which is particularly pernicious. It \n     permits a person aggrieved by reason of child pornography to \n     commence a civil action for injunction relief and \n     compensatory and punitive damages. First, it is vague, since \n     both the grievance and the person aggrieved are apparently in \n     unlimited, undefined categories; and the potential civil \n     defendant is in another unlimited, undefined category. \n     Moreover, apparently a defendant is liable whether or not he \n     or she knows of the minority of the child. And, since it \n     applies to both the pandering and ``appears to be'' prongs of \n     the statute, there may be civil liability even when no child \n     is involved.\n       Most important, it opens a Pandora's Box. Under state law, \n     a person using a minor to create child pornography is not \n     only criminally liable, but is also liable to the child whom \n     he or she has used. But to open the protected class to \n     parents, spouses, etc. and the defendant class to \n     distributors, retailers, etc. is inappropriate and ultimately \n     harmful to legitimate First Amendment interests. It raises \n     the specter of the Pornography Victims Compensation Act, \n     which raised such an outcry that it failed to pass Congress.\n\n\n                               h.r. 4623\n\n       A. Section 3(a) of the Bill criminalizes as child \n     pornography computer images as long as they are, or are \n     indistinguishable from, actual child pornography. The \n     majority in Free Speech Coalition clearly held that unless \n     material either meets the Ferber test, which protects \n     children exploited in the production process, or is obscene \n     under, Miller v. California, it is protected by the First \n     Amendment. Like the material covered by the unconstitutional \n     CPPA, the material described in the ``indistinguishable \n     from'' portion of section 3(a) does not involve or harm any \n     children in the production process. Thus, section 3(a) is \n     unconstitutional under Free Speech Coalition.\n       B. Section 3(c) of the Bill provides an affirmative defense \n     to a child pornography prosecution that no actual child was \n     involved in the creation of the material. Thus, despite \n     section 3(a) discussed above, the Bill actually permits \n     computer-generated sexually explicit depictions of minors \n     (other than pre-pubescent minors and computer morphing which \n     appears as an identifiable minor), if the defendant meets the \n     burden of proving the affirmative defense. (Curiously, the \n     provision limiting the defense excludes material defined in \n     Sec. 2256(8)(A), i.e., that which used an actual minor in its \n     production. Read plainly, that suggests that in a non-\n     computer child pornography case, one cannot escape liability \n     by proving that only adults were photographed. It is unlikely \n     that this is what was intended.)\n       As Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, says in Free \n     Speech Coalition (122 S.Ct. at 1404), shifting the burden of \n     proof on an element of the crime raises serious \n     constitutional issues. In fact, in the First Amendment \n     context, we believe that shift is unconstitutional; among \n     other things, it violates Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, \n     153 (1959) in that it eliminates the requirement that the \n     government prove knowledge of minority by shifting the burden \n     of proof to the defendant. Thus, defendant must prove a \n     negative--that no children were used--a difficult chore, \n     particularly if the computer programmer-designer is not \n     available or known to the defendant. Finally, under United \n     States vs. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), in the \n     case of a librarian, retailer or distributor, the government \n     must prove that he or she knew that the material was of an \n     actual minor This proposal impermissibly and \n     unconstitutionally shifts this burden.\n       C. Section 4 creates a crime of pandering child \n     pornography, defined as the sale or offer of material \n     intending to cause the purchaser or offeree to believe that \n     the material is child pornography, whether it is or not. \n     Similarly, one who accepts or attempts to receive or purchase \n     material, believing it to be child pornography (whether or \n     not it is such), is also guilty of this new crime. This, in \n     effect, transforms consumer fraud into a felony. Once could \n     be selling copies of Mary Poppins or the Bible, but if one \n     intends to cause the buyer to believe that the book contains \n     a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexual conduct, it \n     is a felony. In fact, the Bill goes one step further and \n     provides that the crime can be committed even though no \n     person actually provides, sells, receives, purchases, \n     possesses or produces any visual depiction (e.g., selling an \n     empty box). In effect, it criminalizes the intent to market \n     or to procure child pornography if some action is taken to \n     effectuate that desire, even if the material actually is not \n     child pornography. As discussed above, this seems to go \n     significantly further than Ginzburg v. U.S. permits and is \n     therefore likely unconstitutional.\n       D. The first portion of section 5 of the Bill (new 18 USC \n     Sec. 1466A) provides that computer images of persons \n     indistinguishable from pre-pubescent children in sexually \n     explicit conduct are punishable as child pornography. (A pre-\n     pubescent child is defined as a child whose ``physical \n     development indicates'' the child is 12 or younger, or who \n     ``does not exhibit significant pubescent physical or sexual \n     maturation.'' ``Indistinguishable'' is defined as ``virtually \n     indistinguishable, in that . . . an ordinary person . . . \n     would conclude that the depiction is of an actual minor'' \n     engaging in sexual acts. Drawings, cartoons, sculptures and \n     paintings are excluded.) This is based on Justice O'Connor's \n     distinction between virtual youthful-adult and virtual-child \n     pornography. However, there appears to be no requirement \n     under 1466A that minors were involved in the creation of the \n     depiction. Thus, it falls under Free Speech Coalition.\n       E. The second part of Sec. 5 of the Bill is new Sec. 1466B, \n     which appears to be similar to Sec. 1466A except it does not \n     have the ``indistinguishable'' concept and it does apply to \n     drawings, cartoons, sculptures and paintings. Thus it seems \n     directly contrary to the Free Speech Coalition holding, \n     differing only in its limited application only to depictions \n     of younger children (i.e., 12 and under). Further, it appears \n     that material covered by Sec. 1466A is a subset of that \n     covered by Sec. 1466B, and would be covered by both.\n       Media Coalition and its members urge you and the other \n     members of the Judiciary Committee not to approve either of \n     these bills. Not only are they clearly unconstitutional, but \n     passage of either bill would result in constitutional \n     challenges that could be exploited by person charged with \n     possession of actual child pornography.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Michael A. Bamberger,\n     General Counsel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11204-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 11, \n2002, in New York, NY. A gay man, Eric D. Miller, 26, was shot in the \nchest on a Harlem street by a man who shouted anti-gay remarks at him, \naccording to police. Miller and his partner were walking down a street \nwhen they were confronted by two men who became enraged at the sight of \nthe couple. The assailants yelled, ``Black men shouldn't be gay,'' and \nthrew rocks and bottles at the victims. During an ensuing scuffle, one \nof the assailants shot Miller in the chest. Miller was treated at a \nlocal hospital and released.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11204-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11204-S11205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN HONOR OF THE NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of National \nVeterans Awareness Week, a time to commemorate and appreciate all the \nmen and women who have served in America's Armed Forces. The week of \nNovember 10, 2002, is for honoring the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines--some now gone, and some still alive--who have fought to \nprotect our freedoms and liberties.\n  The Nation's veterans have often stood as the last barrier between \nour country and the terrors of fascism, communism, and anarchy. They \nhave waged war, kept peace, and deterred the threat of the unknown. The \nwork of those in uniform is dangerous and difficult; it requires a \npersonal commitment and sacrifice, as well as the patience and support \nof their families. Members of the armed services have a brave, \nadmirable responsibility and a privileged perspective of history. It is \nwith deepest respect that I thank them for their courage and their \ncontinued dedication to our Nation's security.\n  Pennsylvania is the proud home of more than a million veterans, all \nof\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\nwhom have demonstrated their love of country in defending our borders \nand our way of life. But in remembering and applauding their service, \nwe must also recognize America's next veteran generation: the men and \nwomen in uniform today. Our duty as lawmakers is to ensure that our \nservice members' commitment to the Nation is matched by the \nGovernment's diligence in preparing them to face our current and future \nthreats. Also important is the quality of life that these service \nmembers and their families deserve. It should, therefore, be a priority \nto improve the salaries, benefits, and facilities that our military men \nand women, and their families, rely upon.\n  America's troops on the ground, on the sea, and in the air make up \nthe most capable military force in all the world, and their equipment \nand support systems should be nothing less than first rate. The current \nwar on terrorism and the changing threats of the 21st century demand a \nnew level of readiness from our military that can only be met with \nbetter funding and more effective programs. The Nation's Armed Forces \nneed to be prepared for the realities of a new security paradigm and a \nnew kind of combat. Last year's terrorist attacks have changed our \nunderstanding of modern warfare and the need to protect our cities and \nour citizens. And in response to this realization, the Senate has \npassed legislation to increase spending so that our military can be \nequipped and trained to counter the world's growing, nontraditional \nthreats.\n  We owe much to our veterans: respect and admiration, in addition to \nappropriate retirement and healthcare benefits. We can most greatly \nhonor these men and women, however, by focusing on the needs of the \ncurrent service members who will one day be veterans themselves. We \nmust support their mission today so that we can celebrate their \naccomplishments tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues and my fellow \nAmericans to join me in paying tribute to the veterans, past, present \nand future, who are an indispensable part of what makes our country the \ngreatest in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11205-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF JAMES L. JONES TO BE SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, EUROPE, \n                                 SACEUR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nomination \nof Gen. James Jones to be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. General \nJones has served in the Marine Corps with tremendous skill and \ndedication, and I know he will make an equally effective U.S. and NATO \ncommander in Europe.\n  I first met General Jones when he served as a Corps liaison here in \nthe U.S. Senate in the mid-1980s. Like other Marines, then Major Jones \nwas quiet about his war record but I learned he served gallantly in \nVietnam. In some of the worldwide travel that the Corps supported and \nhe helped arrange, I quickly realized that the service had itself a man \nof exceptional intellect, skill, and determination. In other words, the \nCorps possessed a leader in every sense of the word.\n  Despite his fluent French and obvious sense of diplomacy, General \nJones is foremost a warrior and his career is dominated by such \ncritical assignments as commanding the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. \nI visited this prestigious unit when it participated in Operation \nProvide Comfort after the Gulf War. One of the most impressive sights I \nhave ever seen was then Colonel Jones giving crisp orders to his \nMarines only miles outside of the Iraqi town of Zaku while Air Force A-\n10 Thunderbolts provided aerial cover. He brought his typical \nprofessionalism to other combat-related assignments.\n  As the 32d Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Jones has served \nexceptionally. Under his leadership, the Marine Corps has developed new \ncapabilities that will help America's 9-1-1 force to operate \neffectively at greater distances. In response to September 11 attacks, \nGeneral Jones ordered the creation of a new unit to protect the country \ndomestically, in addition to inspiring Marines to serve in truly \noutstanding action in Afghanistan and across the turbulent Middle East.\n  It is a testament to his achievements and character that the \nPresident selected General Jones to become the Supreme Allied \nCommander, Europe. General Jones will be the first Marine to take on \nthis most prestigious military command. He faces a number of \nchallenges, including navigating the expansion of the Atlantic Alliance \nalong with the prosecuting the war on terrorism. He will command an \nenormous Area of Responsibility, including much of Africa where the \nAIDS/HIV epidemic promises to create untold security instabilities. If \nanyone is up to leading allied forces to protect our interests and \npromote our values it is Jim Jones.\n  Marcelle and I wish General Jones and his wife Diane all the best as \nthey move to Mons, Belgium. Based on our friendship and contact over \nthe years, I know he will make us proud. I congratulate him, and, as an \nAmerican, I am thankful our country has his services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11205-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11205-S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ANTON'S LAW, H.R. 5504\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of \nAnton's Law, H.R. 5504, by the House of Representatives.\n  I introduced the Senate version of Anton's Law, S. 980, in May 2001. \nS. 980 is named in memory of Anton Skeen, a four-year-old who was \nkilled in a car crash in Washington State. Anton's mother Autumn--a \nnational passenger safety advocate--believes that Anton's life could \nhave been saved had he been riding in a booster seat. Designed \nspecifically to help standard adult seat belts fit better, booster \nseats are used to protect children who have outgrown their car seats \nbut are still too small to fit properly in an adult-sized safety belt. \nOn average, children in this group range from 4 to 8 years of age, \nweigh 40 to 80 pounds, and are less than 4 feet 9 inches tall. It has \nbeen reported that only about 5 to 6 percent of these 19.5 million U.S. \nchildren are using booster seats. In 2000, 721 children aged five to \nnine were killed and 103,000 were injured in car accidents.\n  The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation approved \nAnton's Law in August 2001, and the Senate passed the measure by \nunanimous consent on February 25 of this year. Last month, in order to \nhelp ensure that this important measure is placed on the President's \ndesk for signature before the end of the year, the Senate Commerce \nCommittee accepted my amendment to insert Anton's Law in the Senate \nversion of the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization \nbill, S. 2950, which the Committee then approved by unanimous consent. \nI would like to thank all of my colleagues for their continued support \nof this bipartisan legislation that will help to improve the safety and \neffectiveness of child restraints in automobiles and protect our \nNation's young people.\n  Like the bill that I introduced in this body, the bill that was \npassed yesterday by the House of Representatives will improve the \nsafety of children from 4 to 16 years old by requiring the Secretary of \nTransportation to initiate a rulemaking regarding establishing \nperformance standards for child restraints, especially for booster \nseats, for children weighing more than 50 pounds. This measure will \nalso lead to the development of a 10-year-old dummy that can be used to \ntest child restraint devices. It also requires automobile manufacturers \nto install three-point lap and shoulder belts in all rear seating \npositions of passenger vehicles.\n  Since February, I have been working to have this measure passed by \nthe House, and I commend them for the work that they have done on this \nimportant issue. While I am happy that Anton's Law will finally be \npresented to the President, this bill represents only part of what the \nSenate sought to accomplish when we passed Anton's Law in February. The \nSenate's version of Anton's Law, unlike the House bill, contained \nprovisions that would extend for 2 years a Federal grant program for \nStates to promote child passenger safety and education, and that would \nencourage State action by providing States with financial incentives to \nadopt mandatory booster seat laws by 2004. Absent this incentive grant \nprogram, States will have little impetus to promulgate the laws needed \nto adequately protect this group of children. As I have already \nmentioned, the version of Anton's Law passed by the Senate this year \nhas been incorporated in the Senate's version of the National \nTransportation Safety Board Reauthorization bill. I urge the conferees\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\nfrom both the House and the Senate to retain these grant provisions in \nthe conference report of this bill.\n  I thank Congressman Shimkus and Chairman Tauzin for their work in \nsecuring passage of Anton's Law by the House of Representatives, and \nurge President Bush to sign this necessary child safety bill into law \nas soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11206-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       2001 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION UNIFORM CRIME REPORT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2001, 15,980 people \nwere murdered last year; 8,719 of the 15,980 deaths were caused by a \nfirearm, and of those murders, 6,790 were caused by a handgun. Six \nhundred and seventy-two murders occurred in my home State of Michigan. \nThese numbers are staggering. There are several commonsense bills in \nthe Senate that would reduce gun violence and gun crime, and I am \ndisappointed that it appears that the 107th Congress will come to a \nclose without the enactment of meaningful gun safety legislation.\n  On April 24, 2001, Senator Reed introduced the Gun Show Background \nCheck Act. This bill would close a loophole in the law which allows \nunlicensed private gun dealers to sell guns without performing a \nNational Instant Criminal Background System check. I cosponsored that \nbill because I believe it would be an important tool to prevent guns \nfrom getting into the hands of criminals and other people prohibited \nfrom owning a firearm.\n  I am also a cosponsor of Senator Durbin's Children's Access \nPrevention Act. Under this bill, adults who fail to lock up a loaded \nfirearm or an unloaded firearm with ammunition would be held liable if \nthe weapon is taken by a child and used to kill or injure themselves or \nanother person. The bill also increases the penalties for selling a gun \nto a juvenile and creates a gun safety education program that includes \nparent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement and community \norganizations. This bill is similar to a bill President Bush signed \ninto law during his tenure as the Governor of Texas.\n  More recently, I cosponsored Senator Kohl's Ballistics, Law \nAssistance, and Safety Technology Act, or BLAST Act, which would \nrequire licensed firearms manufacturers to test fire firearms, and \nprepare ballistics images of the fired bullets and casings of new \nfirearms. Expanding the National Integrated Ballistics Information \nNetwork to include these ballistics images would increase the crime gun \ntracing capabilities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. \nATF agents could quickly identify firearms by using the ballistics \nimages of cartridge casings and bullets recovered at crime scenes, even \nwhen criminals obliterate the serial number.\n  In recent months, we have seen snipers with an assault rifle kill \npeople around the country and a student at the University of Arizona go \nto his school and kill three of his teachers and himself. These events \nrepresent only a few of the thousands of murders that have already \noccurred this year. These brutal killing sprees were given national \nmedia attention, and hopefully will generate legislative action. While \nthere is little time left in the 107th Congress to address these \nissues, it is critical that we press for consideration of these issues \nearly in 108th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11206-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11206-S11207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE CONFIRMATION OF 98 JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate confirmed the 98th \njudicial nominee of President George W. Bush.\n  These past 16 months, since the reorganization of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee following the change in majority last year, have \nbeen an historic and impressive period in which we have fairly \nconsidered hundreds of the President's executive and judicial branch \nnominees. Despite partisan rhetoric to the contrary, the Senate has \ndone a good job.\n  If this Senate had a ``lousy'' record on judicial confirmations, then \nthe Republican leadership, which controlled the pace on confirmations \nfrom 1995 through the first part of 2001, must have been far, far worse \nthan ``lousy''. Under Republican control judicial vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals more than doubled, from 16 to 33, and overall \nvacancies rose from 65 to 110. We have heard no criticism from the \nWhite House of that period, in which Senate Republicans blocked \nPresident Clinton's nominees. We have heard no apologies from the \nRepublican leadership that engineered those efforts.\n  Just last night, in one night, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed \nmore judges, 18, including more circuit judges, than the Republican-led \nSenate allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session more in one \nday than Republicans were willing to proceed on for an entire year. \nSeventeen of those judges were the nominations we were able to get \nreported from the Committee on October 8 with some significant effort \nand in spite of Republican efforts to divert the Committee into other \nmatters.\n  This week the Committee met, again, as I had said it would. We \nconsidered the nominations of Dennis Shedd and Michael McConnell and \nvoted on them as the 101st and 102nd judicial nominations voted on by \nthe Committee during the last 16 months and reported them to the \nSenate. One hundred judicial nominations have now been reported \nfavorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee during the past 16 \nmonths; two were rejected. One indication of the fairness with which we \nhave conducted ourselves is that as chairman I have proceeded to \nconsider nominations that I do not support and the Committee has \nreported nominations that I do not support to the Senate. As I said \nduring this week's Committee consideration of the Shedd nomination, for \nexample, having examined his record as a District Court Judge, I intend \nto vote against his nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  With the Senate's actions last night, we have confirmed 98 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees in only 16 months. This compares most \nfavorably to the 38 judicial confirmations averaged per year during the \nsix and one-half years when the Republican majority was in control of \nthe Senate. Last night, the Senate confirmed another 18 judicial \nnominees. In the entire 1996 session over the course of an entire year, \nthe Republican majority allowed only 17 district court judges to be \nconfirmed all year and would not confirm a single circuit court \nnominee--not one. Last night, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed all \n17 district court nominees reported to the Senate by the Judiciary \nCommittee after our October 8 business session as well as a 6th Circuit \nnominee from Kentucky. The Democratic-led Senate exceeded in one day \nwhat it took the Republican majority of the Senate an entire year to \naccomplish. That should put our historic demonstration of \nbipartisanship toward this President's judicial nominees in \nperspective.\n  The 17 district court nominees confirmed last night were on the \nSenate calendar because, on October 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwas able to report those nominations despite unparalleled personal \nattacks by Republicans on me as chairman. The circuit court nominee \nconfirmed last night, Professor John Rogers, is the second of this \nPresident's judicial nominees confirmed to the Sixth Circuit this year. \nThey are the first confirmations to the 6th Circuit since 1997, when \nRepublicans for four years shut down consideration of President \nClinton's nominees to that circuit. Three of President Clinton's \nnominees to that court were never allowed a hearing by the Republican \nmajority; the Democratic majority has, in contrast, proceeded to \nconfirm two new judges to that same circuit court.\n  The hard, thankless, but steady work of the Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee has reduced judicial vacancies substantially during \nthese last 16 months. We inherited 110 vacancies and an additional 49 \nhave arisen since July 10, 2002. Today, after 98 confirmations, \ndistrict and circuit court vacancies combined number only 60--not the \nmore than 150 vacancies that would exist had we shut down the process \nor the 111 vacancies that would exist if we had followed the Republican \npace of confirmation during the Clinton administration. The President \nhas failed to send nominations for almost half of the 60 current \nvacancies on the\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\ndistrict and circuit courts and only 11 of his remaining nominees have \nboth home-State consent and ABA ratings. Despite false attacks on our \nrecord, the Senate has acted with bipartisanship, fairness and \nexpedition on this President's judicial nominees, confirming 98 in just \n16 months. We have reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 we inherited \nto fewer than the 65 vacancies the Republicans began with when they \ntook over the Senate in 1995. Unlike the Republican majority that \nallowed judicial vacancies grow, we have outpaced attrition and reduced \nthe overall level of vacancies, including the vacancies on the circuit \ncourts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11207-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IN MEMORY OF LIVES LOST IN THE BERING SEA ON OCTOBER 20, 2002\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my condolences to \nthe families and friends of men who lost their lives recently because \nof an accident aboard the Galaxy, which was fishing for cod in the \nBering Sea.\n  Aboard the Galaxy were First Mate Jerry L. Stephens of Edmonds, \nWashington; Crewman Jose R. Rodas of Pasco, Washington; and Cook George \nKarn of Anchorage, Alaska. From the Clipper Express: Crewman Daniel \nSchmiedt of Arlington, Washington.\n  On October 20, 2002, an explosion occurred aboard the Galaxy, a 180-\nfoot vessel fishing for cod off of Alaska's remote Pribilof Islands. \nPreliminary reports indicate that crew members were battling a small \nfire below deck when a hatch was opened to allow smoke to escape. This \ntriggered an explosion which ignited multiple fires that quickly \nsuperheated its iron hull. With little time to act, the crew scrambled \nto don survival suits and release lifeboats as they tried to rescue \nshipmates who had been thrown overboard by the blast.\n  Captain Dave Shoemaker of Carnation, Washington, sustained burns and \nbroken ribs as he struggled through the fire to make the crucial Mayday \ncall alerting the Coast Guard and other fishing vessels to come to the \nGalaxy's assistance. The heroic efforts of Deck Boss Ryan Newhall of \nSan Antonio, Texas, saved the life of National Marine Fisheries Service \nbiologist Ann Weckback, who was thrown into the icy water without a \nsurvival suit. One of the fishing boats which responded to the Mayday \ncall, the Clipper Express, was drawn into the tragedy when 24 year old \ncrew member Daniel Schmiedt was swept overboard during the rescue \noperation.\n  It may be months until we know what caused the fatal explosion on the \nGalaxy. However, the immediate response of the Clipper Express and the \nother ships that came to the rescue of the Galaxy's crew is a testament \nto the industry. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the \nfour men who died on October 20, 2002. I extend my deep appreciation to \nall those in the fishing industry and the Coast Guard who responded \nquickly to prevent even greater loss of life from this accident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11207-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IDENTITY THEFT VICTIMS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senate, last night, took a great \nstep toward helping the victims of identity theft, and those law \nenforcement officers investigating identity theft, by passing S. 1742, \nthe Identity Theft Victims Assistance Act of 2002.\n  This legislation provides a consistent national remedy for victims of \nidentity theft to restore their credit and their good name. This bill \nis a critical step in helping victims of identity theft restore their \ngood credit.\n  Identity theft can be extraordinarily destructive to people's lives. \nPeople are denied credit, spend enormous time, effort, and money \ncorrecting the problems caused by identity theft, and suffer profound \nfrustration and distress in dealing with the problems that result from \nidentity theft.\n  These problems often arise when they have the potential to wreak the \ngreatest havoc: when buying a new home or a car, or getting a loan to \nput a child through college. It can be devastating to make a major life \nchange, only to find out that your creditworthiness has been destroyed \nby fraud, and it is going to take months of excruciating effort by you \nto clear your name.\n  These crimes rarely meet the threshold for prosecution because each \ncrime involves a small amount of money. Meanwhile victims must \nindependently contact numerous federal, state and local law enforcement \nagencies, consumer credit reporting agencies and creditors over a \nperiod of years, as each new event of fraud arises.\n  One of the most significant problems victims face is gathering the \nevidence of the fraudulent use of their identity. In order to prove \nfraud, the victim needs copies of creditors' business records, such as \napplications, invoices or other information related to the fraudulent \ntransactions. These records are often difficult to obtain because the \nvictim's personally identifying information does not match the \nfraudulent information on file with the business. Ironically, in the \ninterest of protecting consumer privacy, a business will refuse to \nprovide the information to the victim, believing the victim to be an \nunauthorized third party.\n  This bill establishes a nationwide process for all victims of \nidentity theft to obtain business records that are evidence of identity \ntheft to enable a victim to reclaim his or her identity and assist law \nenforcement in finding the thieves.\n  This legislation also requires consumer credit agencies to block \nreporting of bad credit that arises from identity theft, so the harm \ncaused to the victim is stopped dead in its tracks.\n  The bill also extends the statute of limitation from 2 years to 4 \nyears, giving victims a reasonable time period to decide whether they \nneed to sue a business under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  Finally, the bill amends the Internet False Identification Prevention \nAct of 2000 to expand the jurisdiction and membership of the \nCoordinating Committee currently studying enforcement of Federal \nidentity theft law. This will allow the Coordinating Committee to \nexamine State and local identity theft law enforcement and identify \nways the federal government can better assist state and local law \nenforcement in addressing identity theft and related crimes.\n  The bill is based on a Washington state law enacted in 2001. Other \nStates, including California and Idaho, have enacted similar laws. But \nidentity theft is a national problem growing at an exponential rate. \nIdentity information may be stolen in Washington state and used to \nperpetrate a fraud in Wisconsin, New Jersey, or Alabama. That is why it \nis critical that we have passed this bill to help all victims move more \nquickly and easily through the process of restoring their good name at \nthe least emotional and financial cost as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked hard with me to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. Particularly, my thanks goes to Senators \nEnzi, Grassley and Leahy, and Banking Committee Chairman Sarbanes.\n  I also want to mention the broad support that this legislation has \nreceived. The bill is supported by the National Center for the Victims \nof Crime, the Fraternal Order of Police, Consumers Union, Identity \nTheft Resource Center, U.S. Public Interest Group, Police Executive \nForum, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and Amazon.com, and the Committee \nhas received a letter of support signed by 22 Attorneys General.\n  The passage yesterday of this legislation is a win for consumers and \na win for businesses because identity theft leaves both as victims in \nits wake. It should be among the highest priorities in the waning days \nof this Congress that we work together to get the bill enacted into \nlaw. The sooner we give victims of identity theft these tools, the more \nvictims we will help and the fewer businesses that will be defrauded by \nidentity theft in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11207-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11207-S11208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS AND ATTORNEYS CAN IMPROVE CHILD \n                            WELFARE SERVICES\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator DeWine, as an original cosponsor of two important \nbills, S. 3165 and S. 3166, to offer loan forgiveness to social workers \nand attorneys willing to work in the child welfare field. Senator \nDeWine has been an inspiring leader on child welfare issues for many \nyears, and I am delighted to work closely with him to continue to\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\nseek ways to improve the administrative agencies and legal courts that \nserve such vulnerable children.\n  The bills are designed to encourage students graduating with social \nwork degrees and law degrees to spend several years working in the \nchild welfare system. Eligible students would receive loan forgiveness \nfor working in child welfare agencies and courts for abused and \nneglected children. The amount of loan forgiveness would increase over \ntime to reward experience, and to retain social workers and attorneys \nin the system.\n  Every day, approximately 500,000 children are in the foster care \nsystem. Services to such children need to be improved so that every \nchild's health and safety is paramount, and every child secures a \npermanent home. These priorities were established in the 1997 Adoption \nand Safe Families Act, thanks to the leadership of Senator DeWine and a \nbipartisan coalition. To achieve such bold goals, we must have trained, \ncommitted social workers and skilled attorneys serving such children \nand their families.\n  There is a compelling need to invest in social workers. The turnover \nrate for child welfare agencies has doubled in the past decade. Making \ndecisions about a child's health and safety is a serious challenge, and \nwe need more experienced and trained social workers to serve children \nand their families.\n  Many social workers are burdened with a staggering caseload. The \nnumber of social workers per children in the child welfare system \nvaries widely from state to state, and not all states even report their \nchild protective services workforce data. Still, we know there is a \ncompelling need in many places. The Child Maltreatment 2000 Report \npublished by the Department of Health and Human Services indicates that \nthe national average is 130 children per investigative workers, and \nseveral states acknowledge that workers have over 200 children to \nmonitor and assess. Obviously, we need to recruit and retain qualified \nsocial workers to serve children and families at risk.\n  Experienced attorneys are also needed to help manage the individual \ncases and to help ensure that the bold, new time frames established by \nthe Adoption and Safe Families Act are met. Under this new law, courts \nface stricter requirements to monitor and make decisions about a \nchild's safety, health, and placement in a permanent home. This means \nqualified attorneys need to work with the courts, the agencies, and the \nfamilies.\n  In West Virginia, and across our country, children and families in \nthe child welfare system need and deserve qualified social workers and \nattorneys. Senator DeWine's bill to offer student loan forgiveness \nwould provide the right incentive to recruit and retain new \nprofessionals in the system. It would be a meaningful addition to the \nHigher Education Act reauthorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11208-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SOWING THE SEEDS FOR DEMOCRACY IN CROATIA\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the Civitas International Civic Education \nExchange Program--a program that is helping to promote democratic \nprinciples in emerging and established democracies throughout the \nworld.\n  The Civitas Exchange Program, administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation and funded by the U.S. Department of Education under the \nEducation for Democracy Act, engages educators from around the world in \nthe development of effective civic education initiatives that can be \nimplemented in their own countries. The program provides international \nleaders in civic education the opportunity to learn from one another \nand to assist each other in improving education for democracy in their \nnations.\n  The Civitas Exchange Program makes use of the experience, expertise, \nand programmatic offerings of U.S.-based State and national civic \neducation centers by linking them in partnerships with public and \nprivate sector entities in emerging and advanced democracies. The \npartnerships serve to institutionalize civic education in these \nnations, creating working relationships that lead to tangible results \nfor both American and international students and teachers. Today the \nCivitas Exchange Program is operating in 30 countries linked with 22 \nAmerican States.\n  One of those partnerships involves my home State of Oregon, and the \nStates of Delaware and Maryland, linked with the country of Croatia. \nMarilyn Cover, the executive director of the Classroom Law Project in \nPortland, OR, manages the partnership. Ms. Cover recently brought a \ndelegation of American teachers and Croatian educators to Capitol Hill \nto observe our system of government first hand. I am pleased to \nrecognize the two Oregonian teachers participating in the exchange, \nBert Key from Sandy Union High School in Sandy, OR and Maggie \nMcSwiggen, from Vocational Village in Portland, OR. I would also like \nto recognize the Croatian teachers in the delegation, Jadranka \nKostanjsak from Zagreb, Jasminka Zagorac from Zagreb, and Natalija \nPalcic from Split.\n  These teachers, and others from Delaware and Maryland, are currently \nworking with teachers from Croatia to develop a series of lessons \ncomparing the Constitutions of the United States and Croatia, examining \npolitical parties within each country, and exploring ideas of personal \nand civic responsibility for use in their respective classes. Begun \nduring a summer writing program, the teachers continue to refine their \nlessons through team teaching in classrooms in both the United States \nand Croatia. It is an excellent example of the reciprocal nature of the \nexchange, which provides benefits to American students and \ninternational students alike.\n  The ideas exchanged in Oregon's partnership have led to at least two \nsignificant developments with the support of the Croatian Ministry of \nEducation and Sport: first, as part of the exchange, an American civics \ncurriculum, Foundations of Democracy program on justice, has been \ntranslated and is now a requirement in Croatian preschools and primary \nschools; second, We the People . . . Project Citizen, an American civic \neducation program which engages young people in learning how to monitor \nand influence public policy, has become a requirement in grades 7 and 8 \nfor secondary schools in Croatia.\n  The Civitas Exchange Program is an excellent example of how programs \nsupported by the federal government can help achieve U.S. foreign \npolicy objectives by helping emerging democracies develop a political \nculture supportive of democratic values, principles, and institutions. \nI wish to thank the Center for Civic Education for their successful \nadministration of the Civitas program and applaud Oregonian Marilyn \nCover for her excellent work in the project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11208-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11208-S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize \nthe accomplishments of a colleague who will be retiring at the end of \nthis term. Senator Fred Thompson has represented Tennessee in the \nSenate for 8 years. During his tenure, he has been an important \nadvocate for a wide range of legislative reform activities.\n  Throughout his Senate career, Senator Thompson has fought for \nprotecting our national security, making government more efficient, and \nimproving programs that are important to America's families, such as \nSocial Security and Medicare. Senator Thompson has also been nationally \nrecognized for his expertise in international affairs as was evidenced \nby his recent nomination to the prestigious Council on Foreign \nRelations.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Fred \nThompson held more than a dozen hearings on important national security \nissues, including missile defense technology and the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. As a result of his efforts, Senator \nThompson played a key role in bringing the issue of weapons \nproliferation to the forefront of the national agenda.\n  In addition, Fred Thompson has been the leader in many efforts to \nreform and improve government. He has strongly supported proposals to \nstreamline the regulatory process and to ensure the cost-effectiveness \nand benefit of regulatory programs. As the primary author of the \nGovernment Information Security Act, he also championed efforts to \nenhance the security of government computer systems and to strengthen \nprivacy protection on Federal Web sites.\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\n  Finally, as his colleague on the Finance Committee, I had the \nopportunity to work with Fred to address the challenges facing Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Among the efforts we jointly supported, a \nprimary concern we have shared is improving the long-term solvency of \nthese important social programs. As a Finance Committee member, as well \nas in the other roles he has served, Senator Thompson's work has been \nthoughtful, and our Nation is a better place because of his efforts.\n  Most of all, I will miss Senator Thompson's unfailing good humor. We \nshared many laughs as we bantered back and forth about his future in \nfilm and television. I will really miss his sense of humor and basic \ndecency.\n  Mr. President, for these and many other reasons, I have been honored \nto serve with Fred Thompson. I would like to join my colleagues in \nwishing the Senator and his family the best in the future and in paying \ntribute to his contributions to the Senate and our Nation. I wish him \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11209-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO VASHON HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the 75th \nanniversary of Vashon High School. In the early quarter of the 20th \ncentury, the high school that most African-American students attended \nin St. Louis was overcrowded and quite a distance from their homes. \nConsequently, in 1922, a citizens group called the Central School \nPatron Association led by Reverend George Stevens and other community \nalliances began formulating plans for a second high school designated \nfor African-American students. On September 6, 1927, Vashon High School \nopened and has been educating and changing the lives of students since. \nOver time, Vashon High School has established itself as a premier \neducational institute, known for its athletics as well as academics.\n  There are several outstanding individuals who have contributed to the \nfounding and success of Vashon High School. The school was named for a \nfamily with a long tradition of struggle and sacrifice dedicated to the \nimportance of education while battling to secure civil and human rights \nfor African-Americans. Specifically, the school was named for George B. \nVashon, 1824-1878, the first African-American graduate of Oberlin \nCollege, OH in 1844, and his son John B. Vashon, 1859-1924, an \noutstanding educator in the city of St. Louis for 34 years, James W. \nMeyers served as the first principal of Vashon from 1927-1932 and Otto \nBohanan, a member of the faculty, composed the school song, ``Vashon We \nLove''. Many students honed their talents, skills, and abilities to \nbecome future educators and community leaders from the positive \ninfluence and support of these and other influential faculty members.\n  Over the past 75 years, Vashon High School has undergone changes and \nrelocated to several different locations, but irrespective of physical \nlocation, the spirit of Vashon High School continues to inspire \nstudents to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals. \nCongratulations to the students, faculty, and alumni of Vashon High \nSchool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11209-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NEAL GONZALES\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

He was the \nrepresentative of labor and as such his influence was felt in most of \nthe important legislative battles that were waged.\n  Neal was a true professional at his job. Liked and respected by all, \nhe was a formidable adversary as those who found themselves opposing \nhim soon learned.\n  I learned much from watching Neal Gonzales work as the advocate for \nthe working people of New Mexico. He kept his focus on the impact of \nlegislation on the lives of those he represented.

LURA POWELL\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to say thank you to \none of the true leaders in the Washington state science community, who \nhas recently announced that she will be stepping down from her position \nat the end of the year. I am speaking of Dr. Lura Powell, vice \npresident of Battelle and Director of the Department of Energy's \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, in Richland, WA.\n  During the past 2 years, Dr. Powell has developed a bold strategy to \nensure that the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory will play a \nsignificant role in carrying out the missions of the Department of \nEnergy as we move forward into the 21st century. The recent \ninstallation of two major pieces of equipment will position the \nlaboratory to be a leader in molecular research--research that reaches \nacross many disciplines, including environmental cleanup, national \nsecurity, and the life sciences. The new 9.2 teraflops supercomputer \nand the 900-megahertz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, both of \nwhich are part of PNNL's Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, \nwill attract academia, industry, and other Government researchers to \nthe lab in an atmosphere of collaboration and discovery. I had the \nopportunity to attend the dedication of the NMR spectrometer on March \n28, 2002. This equipment is poised to play a central role in the fast-\napproaching revolution in systems biology, the seeds for which were \nsown by the amazing success of the Human Genome Project.\n  Dr. Powell has set out to establish a systems biology program for \nPNNL that will position the laboratory to play a significant role in \nthe Department of Energy's Genomes to Life initiative and to \nparticipate in the National Institutes of Health biomedical mission. \nCongress has consistently supported increased funding for scientific \nresearch in the biomedical sciences at NIH, and there is an equally \nimportant role for the Department of Energy to play in this field. \nGenomics research holds great promise for unraveling many previously \nintractable scientific problems, and will one day lead to the \ndevelopment of technologies that will help address some of our nation's \nmost pressing challenges: carbon sequestration and climate change, the \nnational security risks posed by bioterrorism, even clean and \nsustainable energy production. The Genomes to Life program will indeed \nenhance the Department of Energy's ability to fulfill its many diverse \nmissions, and PNNL--thanks in large part to Dr. Powell--is poised to be \na prime contributor to this initiative.\n  In her term as Director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, \nDr. Powell has reached out to create new partnerships within Washington \nState to support this agenda. They include the University of \nWashington, Washington State University, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nResearch Center, and the Institute of Systems Biology. Meanwhile, \nconversations are ongoing with still other institutions in the Pacific \nNorthwest that will further expand PNNL's collaborations. These efforts \nwill bring a strong bioscience presence to the State of Washington, \nprovide economic sustainability to the Tri-Cities area and lead to \nscientific discoveries that will ultimately benefit this Nation as a \nwhole. I want to recognize Dr. Powell for her vision and commitment to \npublic service and wish her much success in her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11209-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11209-S11210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

He was critically important in the \ndevelopment of knee prosthesis and its instrumentation, and invented \nthe double-edged bone cutting ``Z'' blade bone say. After such a long \nand distinguished career, it is especially noteworthy that Dr. Zecchino \nfounded an orthopedic clinic for people in need after his retirement in \n1982.\n  Throughout his medical career, Dr. Zecchino has benefited from the \nlove, compassion and commitment of his wife, Julia, who was in a nurse-\ntraining program when they met. Together, Dr. and Mrs. Zecchino have \nimproved the lives of thousands of people and with the dedication of \nthe Julia and Vincent Zecchino Pavilion; future generations will \ncontinue to benefit from the Zecchino's goodwill, dedication and \ntireless effort to improve the world around them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11210-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF HARTFORD MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH ON THE OCCASION OF \n                         THEIR 85TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

I rise today to let my colleagues know that \nOctober is National Spina Bifida Awareness Month and to pay tribute to \nthe more than 70,000 Americans--and their family members--who are \ncurrently affected by spina bifida--the Nation's most common, \npermanently disabling birth defect. The Spina Bifida Association of \nAmerica--SBAA--an organization that has helped people with spina bifida \nand their families for nearly 30 years, works every day--not just in \nthe month of October--to prevent and reduce suffering from this \ndevastating birth defect.\n  The SBAA was founded in 1973 to address the needs of the individuals \nand families affected by and is currently the only national \norganization solely dedicated to advocating on behalf of the spina \nbifida community. As part of its service through 60 chapters in more \nthan 100 communities across the country, the SBAA puts expecting \nparents in touch with families who have a child with spina bifida. \nThese families answer questions and concerns and help guide expecting \nparents. The SBAA then works to provide lifelong support and assistance \nfor affected children and their families.\n  Together the SBAA and the Spina Bifida Association of Texas work \ntirelessly to help families meet the challenges and enjoy the rewards \nof raising their child. I would like to acknowledge and thank SBAA and \nthe Spina Bifida Association of Texas for all that they have done for \nthe families affected by this birth defect, especially those living in \nmy State.\n  Spina bifida is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central \nnervous system does not properly close during the early stages of \npregnancy. Spina bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, \nwith more than half ending tragically in abortion. There are three \ndifferent forms of spina bifida with the most severe being \nmyelomeningocele spina bifida, which causes nerve damage and severe \ndisabilities. This severe form of spina bifida is diagnosed in 96 \npercent of children born with this condition. Between 70 to 90 percent \nof the children born with spina bifida are at risk of mental \nretardation when spinal fluid collects around the brain.\n  We must do more to ensure a high quality of life for people with \nspina bifida so more families choose the blessing and joy of having a \nchild with this condition. Fortunately, spina bifida is no longer the \ndeath sentence it once was and now people born with spina bifida will \nlikely have a normal or near normal life expectancy. The challenge now \nis to ensure that these individuals have the highest quality of life \npossible.\n  Today, approximately 90 percent of all babies diagnosed with this \nbirth defect live into adulthood, approximately 80 percent have normal \nIQs, and approximately 75 percent participate in sports and other \nrecreational activities. With proper medical care, people who suffer \nfrom spina bifida can lead full and productive lives. However, they \nmust learn how to move around using braces, crutches, or wheelchairs, \nand how to function independently. They also must be careful to avoid a \nhost of secondary health problems ranging from depression and learning \ndisabilities to skin problems and latex allergies.\n  The Spina Bifida Association of Texas has four chapters in San \nAntonio, Austin, Dallas, and Houston. These chapters serve the \nindividuals and their families with spina bifida in the great state of \nTexas through a number of programs and services including providing \nemergency assistance; running a summer camp for children and a weekend \nretreat for adults; scholarships; and medical seminars. In addition, \nthe Texas Scottish Rite Hospital is the largest single-site \ninterdisciplinary center for the treatment of spina bifida in the \nUnited States and provides ongoing treatment for more than 13,000 \nchildren annually, without charge.\n  During the month of October, the SBAA and its chapters make a special \npush to increase public awareness about spina bifida and teach \nprospective parents about prevention. Simply by taking a daily dose of \nthe B vitamin, folic acid, found in most multivitamins, women of child-\nbearing age have the power to reduce the incidence of spina bifida by \nup to 75 percent. That such a simple change in habit can have such a \nprofound effect should leave no question as to the importance of \nawareness and the impact of prevention.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am pleased that \nwe provided $2 million in much-needed funding to establish a National \nSpina Bifida Program at the National Center for Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities--NCBDDD--at the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention--CDC--to ensure that those individuals living with spina \nbifida can live active, productive, and meaningful lives. In\n\n[[Page S11211]]\n\naddition, I am proud that we in the Senate recently passed by unanimous \nconsent the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act \nof 2002, which takes many critical steps that will work to prevent \nspina bifida and to improve quality of life for individuals and \nfamilies affected by this terrible birth defect. I am hopeful that the \nHouse will act shortly to pass the measure so it can be sent to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I again wish to thank the SBAA and its chapters for all of their hard \nwork to prevent and reduce suffering from this birth defect and for \ntheir commitment to improve the lives of those 70,000 individuals \nliving with spina bifida throughout our Nation. I wish the Spina Bifida \nAssociation of America the best of luck in its future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11211-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11211-S11212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, each without \namendment:\n\n       S. 1010.

A bill to amend the impact aid program under the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve the delivery of payments \nunder the program to local educational agencies; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to make the \nImpact Aid Program a Federal entitlement.\n  Over the past few years, the need for a change in the delivery of \nImpact Aid payments to eligible school districts has become \nincreasingly clear. Impact Aid was originally designed to compensate a \nlocal school district for financial losses caused by a Federal presence \nin that district, whether due to a military base or to other designated \nFederal land in the community. Congress met its obligation and fully \nfunded the program for the first twenty years of its existence. When \nthe funding was cut in 1971, appropriations for Impact Aid were \nallocated for school districts according to a need-based formula. In \nsubsequent years, multiple changes in the law have revised and further \ncomplicated both the formula and the additional factors that determine \nfunding for each district. The result of these numerous revisions has \nbeen large payment disparities for the same types of students in \ndifferent districts, as well as inherent flaws in reimbursements due to \nhow school districts are defined in different states.\n  I have consistently defended increased appropriations for Impact Aid \nnot only because it is a vital source of revenue for many local school \ndistricts, but also because it constitutes a clear-cut Federal \nresponsibility. When the Federal Government's presence in a community \ndetracts from the local tax base, which often comprises nearly 90 \npercent of local schools' funding, we must compensate for the lost \nfunds. When we do not do so, the children suffer the consequences.\n  Despite increases in the past few years, Impact Aid remains \nsubstantially under-funded. We can no longer ignore the inequity this \ncauses in educating our students. It is for this reason that I have \nintroduced this bill today. When this legislation becomes law, Congress \nwill be required to meet its obligation to the children and the schools \nthat have been negatively impacted for so long. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting our local schools by permanently fully funding \nthe Impact Aid program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11215-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 358--CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF MOZAMBIQUE ON THEIR \n  SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH, BUILD, AND MAINTAIN PEACE IN THEIR \n         COUNTRY FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. Biden submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n       Whereas, on October 4, 1992, having overcome the hardships \n     of a colonial struggle, decolonization, and armed regional \n     and national conflict, the people of Mozambique, the parties \n     to the civil war in Mozambique, and the leadership of \n     Mozambique reached a peaceful settlement to the devastating \n     16-year civil war;\n       Whereas this peace was facilitated by the good offices of \n     the Comunita di Sant' Egidio in Rome and supported by \n     regional friends and the international community;\n       Whereas in 1994 and 1999 Mozambique held multi-party \n     elections deemed free and fair by the international \n     community;\n       Whereas this peace has been consolidated and strengthened \n     by Mozambique civil society, helping to keep the Government \n     of Mozambique on a course of political and economic reforms \n     despite the challenges currently presented by HIV/AIDS, \n     floods, droughts, and regional instability;\n       Whereas the Government of Mozambique has initiated sound \n     economic reforms, including the privatization of state-run \n     enterprises, the reduction and simplification of import \n     tariffs, and the liberalization of agricultural markets, \n     resulting in extraordinary economic growth;\n       Whereas the resources that have become available by \n     Mozambique's participation in the Highly Indebted Poor \n     Countries Initiative have been responsibly channeled by the \n     Government of Mozambique into anti-poverty programs;\n       Whereas, despite the progress that Mozambique has made, \n     more than one-half of the people of Mozambique over 15 years \n     of age are illiterate, twenty-eight percent of the children \n     under five are malnourished, infant mortality stands at more \n     than 12 percent, and life expectancy is only 42 years;\n       Whereas the United States values democratic principles, the \n     rule of law, peace, and stability in all nations that \n     comprise the community of states; and\n       Whereas Mozambique has been transformed from a war-torn \n     country to one where political disputes are settled through \n     peaceful means: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Mozambique on ten years of \n     continued peace and growing democracy and commends the \n     Government of Mozambique for continued economic and political \n     reforms;\n       (2) salutes the Comunita di Sant' Egidio for using its good \n     offices to facilitate and mediate the peace process that led \n     to the October 4, 1992, agreement;\n       (3) recognizes the indispensable role that civil society in \n     Mozambique has played in both achieving peace and deepening \n     democratic reforms; and\n       (4) stands ready to assist the Government of Mozambique on \n     a variety of programs, including humanitarian and development \n     assistance, HIV/AIDS prevention, and technical assistance to \n     fight corruption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 158--URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT AND \n    OTHER ARAB GOVERNMENTS NOT TO ALLOW THEIR GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED \n TELEVISION STATIONS TO BROADCAST ANY PROGRAM THAT LENDS LEGITIMACY TO \n      THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, it is my high honor and privilege to speak \non the confirmation of Professor Michael McConnell to the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Professor McConnell is a Utahn, a scholar of the \nhighest talent, and a man of profound integrity and judicial \ntemperament.\n  Professor McConnell holds the prestigious Presidential Professorship \nat the University of Utah College of Law in Salt Lake City. He began \nhis legal career at the University of Chicago Law School, where he was \nComment Editor of the Law Review and graduated Order of the Coif. \nThereafter he served as a law clerk for two of the leading liberal \njurists of the 20th century: Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, \nJr. and D.C. Court of Appeals Judge J. Skelly Wright.\n  After completing those clerkships, Mike became Assistant General \nCounsel of the Office of Management and Budget and then served as \nAssistant to the Solicitor General. He then joined\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nthe faculty of the University of Chicago Law School, where he was \nawarded tenure and later the William B. Graham Professorship.\n  In addition to his academic credentials, Professor McConnell is an \nable and experienced appellate lawyer. He has argued eleven cases \nbefore the United States Supreme Court--and won nine of them. In fact, \nthe Los Angeles Daily Journal named one of his presentations to the \nSupreme Court ``best oral argument'' of the year. His clients include a \nwide range of entities: Fortune 500 companies such as NBC and \nAmeritech; organizations such as the United States Catholic Conference; \nmunicipal authorities including the New York Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority; and many individuals.\n  This combination of intelligence and experience was very likely the \nreason that the American Bar Association rated Professor McConnell \nunanimously ``well qualified''--its highest possible rating.\n  Now, Mr. President, I imagine you have heard some of the attacks \nwaged against these fine nominees by the usual suspects--that group of \nWashington-based special interest lobbyists who make their living \ntrying to thwart President Bush's judges. Those groups are trying to \nmake believe that Professor McConnell is out of the mainstream of \nAmerican politics.\n  Well, let me set the record strait. I'll mention just a few of the \npositions Professor McConnell has taken that prove he is an \nindependent-minded thinker who calls things as he sees them, and does \nnot follow anyone else's political prescription. Professor McConnell \nrepresented, without charge, three former Democratic Attorneys General \nin opposition to an order of the first President Bush; publicly opposed \nimpeachment of President Clinton; urged the confirmation of several of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominations; testified against a school \nprayer amendment; worked, without charge, on a lawsuit representing \nboth People for the American Way and Americans United for the \nSeparation of Church and State; has been described by Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia as ``the most prominent scholarly critic'' of \nScalia's approach to the free exercise clause; and has served as co-\nchair--together with a former ACLU president and a former American Bar \nAssociation president--of an organization whose purpose is to oppose MY \nproposed constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from \ndesecration.\n  So you see, Mr. President, the idea that McConnell is in lock-step \nwith the Republican party is absolutely untrue. Rather than credit all \nof the unsupported attacks with responses, I instead would like to tell \nyou a couple of things the ARE true about Professor McConnell.\n  First, Professor McConnell is widely regarded as modern America's \nmost persuasive advocate for the idea that our government should ensure \nevery citizen's right to worship--or not worship--in his or her \npreferred manner. Through his scholarship and advocacy in court, he has \nstood up for the rights of all religious people--including members of \nsome politically out-of-favor faiths--to worship free of government \nrestriction or intrusion.\n  Many Americans believe that the freedom to exercise their own \nreligion is the most profound and important idea on which this country \nwas founded. Before Professor McConnell began his prodigious \nscholarship in the area of the First Amendment's religion clauses, the \nidea was taking root that the government must disfavor religion in its \npolicies. That is, judges and scholars believed that all groups must be \ntreated equally except religions, which must be excluded entirely from \nany government program or policy.\n  Professor McConnell's scholarship served as a dramatic wake-up call. \nHe researched the Founders' writing and presented with illuminating \nclarity that the point of free exercise is for government to remain \nneutral as between religions, and must accommodate religious activity \nwhere feasible. He demonstrated there was no basis in the founding for \nthe view that our government must be anti-religion. The persuasiveness \nof his writing reawakened American legal scholars and judges to the \nFounders' view that the First Amendment's purpose is to protect \nreligion from government, not the other way around. His work has helped \nreinvigorate the healthy and dynamic pluralism of religion that has \nallowed all faiths to flourish in this promised land, the most \nreligiously tolerant nation in human history.\n  McConnell's views defy political pigeonholing. Although he has \ngenerally sided with the so-called liberal wing of the Court on \nquestions of Free Exercise of Religion, McConnell's view of \nEstablishment of Religion is that religious perspectives should be \ngiven equal but not favored treatment in the public sphere--a view that \nhas led him to testify against a school prayer amendment, while \nsupporting the rights of religious citizens and groups to receive \naccess to public resources on an equal basis.\n  Few people in modern America have contributed more to their area of \nexpertise than Professor McConnell. He has written over 50 articles in \nprofessional journals and books. He has delivered hundreds of lectures \nand penned many op-ed pieces. He has contributed an immeasurable amount \nto the discourse of legal ideas. As Professor Laurence Tribe wrote to \nthe Judiciary Committee, ``McConnell is among the nation's most \ndistinguished constitutional scholars and a fine teacher.'' Tribe \nfurther explained that he and McConnell ``share a commitment to \nprincipled legal interpretation and to a broadly civil libertarian \nconstitutional framework.''\n  The significance of McConnell's contributions to the legal profession \nin part explains why 304 professors--ranging from conservative to \nliberal to very liberal--have signed a single letter urging us to \nconfirm McConnell's nomination.\n  Mr. President, When was the last time that 304 professors agreed on \nanything? Professor McConnell's peers consider him one of the nation's \nforemost constitutional scholars and appellate advocates and as a \nperson with a reputation for open-minded fairness.\n  Because of his outstanding reputation for scholarship, the attacks on \nProfessor McConnell have not focused so much on his judicial abilities, \nbut on his personal beliefs. I think this is wrong. All Americans have \nthe right to think their own thoughts and believe their own beliefs. \nThat right should apply as much to the Americans who don robes in \nservice of the Federal Judiciary as to any other citizen.\n\n  One of the Senate's most important roles in exercising advice and \nconsent on judicial nominees is to make sure that they are free from \nany bias--whether political, religious, personal or otherwise--that \nwould endanger their ability to follow the law as written by the \nlegislature and interpreted by higher courts. No one wants a judge who \nplays legislator from the bench. We want and expect judges who know \ntheir limited role and will uphold the law regardless of their personal \nviews. And as long as a judge is willing to do that, any other litmus \ntest on their personal views is contrary to our constitutional \nresponsibility, and an invasion into the freedom of conscience.\n  I am concerned that some who are involved in the judicial \nconfirmation process are pursuing a course that endangers the freedom \nof conscience for the Americans who serve on our courts. This is not \nonly a personal offense against nominees who are dragged through the \nmud or even rejected for their private, personal opinions, it is also \nan offense against the citizens of this great country, who rely on our \nfederal judges to enforce our many rights and liberties. The diversity \nof backgrounds and points of view are often the stitches holding \ntogether the fabric of our freedoms.\n  If I may be blunt about this, an impression has been created this \nyear that there are some in the Senate who are attempting to impose a \nlitmus test on the issue of abortion. No one should stand for this--not \neven people who are pro-choice as a matter of public policy. In fact, \npeople who are pro-choice should be especially reluctant to establish a \nprecedent that would allow the Senate to select judges according to \ntheir personal views rather than their willingness to follow and \nenforce established legal precedents. Pro-choice activists have as much \nto gain from the triumph of precedent over person view as anyone else.\n  The fact that most people who are pro-choice hold their position as a \nmatter of political viewpoint or ideology. They do so in good \nconscience no\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\ndoubt, and I respect that. But the great majority of people who are \npro-life come to their positions as a result of their personal \nreligious convictions. It is one thing to ensure that judicial nominees \npledge to follow the law--we must do that--but quite another to require \nnominees to have a particular private view. Enforcing such a test would \nnot only destroy the freedom of conscience, but also would exclude from \nour judiciary a large number of people of religious conviction who are \nprepared to follow the law.\n  Now, Professor McConnell has written about abortion, and it is very \nimportant for us not to violate his freedom of conscience while \nexploring his views. The most important thing he has written on this \ntopic, for the Senate's purposes, is that U.S. Supreme Court precedent \nsetting forth the basic abortion right is settled and secure. Indeed, \nhe believes that lower court judges have a clear duty to follow and \napply that case law, and he will do just that if confirmed.\n  Beyond that, Professor McConnell's scholarship on the subject defies \nstandard stereotypes. His writings have focused on two questions. First \nis the methodology or legitimacy of the Court's reasoning in Roe v. \nWade. Like many constitutional scholars--including prominent supporters \nof abortion rights such as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg--Professor \nMcConnell has written that the Court in Roe overstepped the bounds of \nproper judicial decision making and has argued that, when facing other \nissues of deep moral disagreement--for example, assisted suicide--the \ncourts should not constitute their judgment for that of the \nlegislatures, particularly where there is a broad consensus among the \nstates regarding the proper role for regulation.\n  The second area he has addressed is the possibility of middle-ground \napproaches to abortion that would find support even from many pro-\nchoice advocates--dealing with such problems as inadequate counseling \nand support for troubled pregnant women. He has been critical of the \nextremes on both sides of the questions surrounding abortion, and has \nargued that one result of the constitutionalization of abortion law has \nbeen that is has prevented political leaders from exploring middle-\nground approaches.\n  Professor McConnell has also written in defense of the free-speech \nrights of abortion protestors.\n  The fact is that, despite some attempts to confuse this issue, there \nis nothing in Professor McConnell's writings that should cause any \ndoubt that Professor McConnell is committed to the ideas of stare \ndecisis and controlling legal precedent. To look beyond that belief, to \nprobe his personal views based on religious conviction, is not only to \nmiss the point of our job but also to jeopardize the freedom of \nconscience of those who serve our country as members of the judiciary.\n  Many people across the political spectrum know that Professor \nMcConnell will obey precedent even when it is at odds with his own \nviews. That explains why Professor McConnell's nomination has been \npraised by a number of people who disagree with some of his opinions, \nincluding former Clinton administration officials Acting Solicitor \nGeneral Walter Dellinger, Deputy White House Counsel William Marshall, \nDomestic Policy Advisors Bill Galston and Elena Kagan, and Associate \nAttorney General John Schmidt.\n  Listen to part of a letter I received from the Legal Director of the \nACLU chapter in Utah. He wrote--in his personal capacity--to endorse \nProfessor McConnell ``enthusiastically and without qualification,'' \nsaying that ``there can be no doubt that [lawyers who appear before \nhim] will receive a fair and impartial hearing, thoughtful scrutiny and \ncareful consideration toward a decision that will be based solely on \nthe merits and not on any predetermined ideological or political \nagenda.''\n  Professor McConnell is immune to any political litmus test because he \nhas a solid bipartisan reputation for integrity and fairness. He is \ncommitted to the rule of law and to the ideal of nonpartisan judging. \nHe is known for his principled defense of a limited and restrained role \nfor the judiciary in our constitutional system. He has argued for \nconstitutional interpretation based on constitutional text, original \nunderstanding, historical experience, and precedent. He has criticized \nscholars and judges of both the right and the left for advocating \ninterpretation based on the judge's own political or moral views. He \nhas advocated a major role for Congress in defining and protecting \ncivil rights and has criticized the Supreme Court's decisions limiting \nsuch measures to mere enforcement of the Supreme Court's own \ninterpretations. Civil rights groups should take special note of his \ndefense of broad congressional power under Section Five of the \nFourteenth Amendment.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, Professor McConnell is one of the very \nbest people ever nominated to be a judge. I am very pleased that the \nSenate confirmed him today. He will be a great judge.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, tonight, the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Michael McConnell to a life-time appointment to the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I oppose this nomination.\n  Professor McConnell's record as a scholar, an advocate and an \nactivist show him to be far outside the American mainstream on a number \nof critical constitutional, civil rights, and other legal issues. His \nviews are so clear and consistent that I believe no litigant on areas \nsuch as reproductive rights or the separation of church and state could \nreasonably expect to receive a fair and impartial hearing in Judge \nMcConnell's court room.\n  Let me tell you why I believe that. Professor McConnell has called \nthe right to choose an ``evil'' and one of the greatest injustices of \nour day. He would not simply overturn Roe v. Wade--a disastrous outcome \nfor American women--he has gone so far as to suggest that the courts \nshould declare embryos persons under the Fourteenth Amendment. He has \ncalled Roe v. Wade ``illegitimate,'' and has called for a \nconstitutional amendment banning the right to choose and granting \nconstitutional rights to embryos.\n  Professor McConnell has also written and spoken against the Freedom \nof Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE). He believes--in contrast to \nevery Federal appellate court that has considered the question--that it \nis unconstitutional. In a recent article, he expressed admiration for a \ndistrict court judge who refused to apply FACE because the defendants \ndid not act with ``bad purpose.'' Mr. President, that is not in the \nstatute Congress passed. McConnell's statements of admiration for the \n``judicial nullification'' of a Federal statute that he does not agree \nwith speaks volumes about his inability to fairly and impartially apply \na range of civil rights statutes that my conflict with his views.\n  And it makes it clear that as a judge, he would be a judicial \nactivist.\n  McConnell has even criticized the Supreme Court's 8-1 decision in the \nBob Jones case from 1983. In that decision, the Court ruled that the \nIRS may deny tax-exempt status to a school that discriminates against \nminorities. In a 1989 article, McConnell wrote that the ``racial \ndoctrines of a Bob Jones University'' should have been ``tolerated'' \nbecause they were ``church teachings.''\n  Mr. President, I realize that this is not a Supreme Court nomination. \nBut, the reality is that Circuit Courts make new law in many areas \nwhere the Supreme Court has not spoken. The Supreme Court hears fewer \nthan 100 cases per year, while the Courts of Appeal decide close to \n30,000. The truth is, the appellate court are very often the courts of \nlast resort. As Justice Scalia recently wrote, ``the judges of inferior \ncourts often make law, since the precedent of the highest court does \nnot cover every situation, and not every case is reviewed.''\n  Already, Mr. President, increasingly conservative Federal courts are \nupholding greater and greater restrictions on the right to choose, \nchipping away at the protections of Roe vs. Wade. In the area of \nreproductive rights, the Circuit Courts routinely make new law, as \nanti-choice advocates test the constitutional limits with new and \ncreative restrictions on the right to safe and legal abortion. The \nimportance of each Federal judge in protecting the right to choose is \nunderscored by the fact that many recent abortion cases have involved \nreversals and dissents, demonstrating that judges often disagree on the \ncorrect application of law. I believe that Professor McConnell's \nextensive anti-\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\nchoice record shows that he will use every opening the law permits to \nfurther restrict a woman's right to choose.\n  Unfortunately, Professor McConnell does not stand apart from other \nBush nominees for his extreme ideology. I believe he was chosen because \nof it.\n  Remaking the Federal courts has been a long-term goal of the right-\nwing base of the Republican party. They have pursued this goal with \ndogged determination and persistence for more than two decades, and \nthey are succeeding. More and more restrictions on a woman's right to \nchoose are being upheld as constitutional by the increasingly \nconservative Federal courts, while portions of anti-discrimination law \nand Violence Against Women Act--a law that Senator Biden wrote and that \nI was proud to sponsor when I was in the House--are struck down. This \nis not the right direction for the federal courts.\n  Now Bush Administration is poised to tip the scales of justice even \nfurther to support an extreme anti-choice agenda, and the right to \nchoose may well disappear for more and more American women--especially \nfor poor women. Don't take my word for it. After last week's elections, \nformer Reagan Administration attorney Bruce Fein said that there will \nbe a philosophical revolution in the courts and that Bush nominees will \nimpose a variety of new restrictions on a women's right to choose. The \nimpact, he said, will be almost as great as if Robert Bork had been \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. President, during the Clinton Administration, I was repeatedly \ntold by the Republican leadership in the Senate that I should only \nrecommend moderate judges to fill judicial vacancies on the Federal \ncourts in the state of California. Otherwise, I was told, Republicans \nwould not let them be confirmed.\n  President Bush should be held to the same standard. In fact, \nPresident Bush said he wanted to govern from the middle. And he \nfulfilled that commitment on the district court level in California \nwhen he agreed to a bipartisan committee selection process. That \nprocess has worked well, producing well-qualified mainstream nominees \nfor eight open district court seats in California.\n  However, Professor McConnell's nomination does not meet the test. He \ndoes not fulfill President Bush's commitment to govern from the middle. \nHe does not meet the requirement established by the Senate Republican \nleadership during the Clinton Administration that nominees be moderate. \nNo, Mr. President, Professor McConnell is far outside the mainstream.\n  I again call on President Bush--as have so many in the Senate--to \nreach out across the aisle and to work with all of us to find and \nnominate the moderate, consensus judges that Americans deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11219-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MARY CARLIN YATES TO BE AMBASSADOR TO THE REPUBLIC OF \n                                 GHANA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3172 introduced earlier today by \nSenator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3172) to improve the calculation of the Federal \n     subsidy rate with respect to certain small business loans, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the small \nbusiness subsidy rate improvement bill before the Senate today. It is \nnot perfect, but it takes us a step in the right direction. It takes us \na step in the right direction by reversing a current 60-percent cut in \nloan dollars available to small businesses through the Small Business \nAdministration's flagship 7(a) loan program, and it includes a budget \nchange mid-year with OMB's blessing, which is unprecedented. However, \nit does not go far enough in correcting the way the government \ncalculates the\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\ncost and fees of the SBA's small business loans. Specifically, the \nAdministration would not also support our proposal to correct the \nerrors in the subsidy rate used for the 504 development company loan \nprogram--errors that result in severe overcharging of thousands of \ndollars to 504 borrowers and lenders.\n  As so many of us in the Senate, House and White House have heard for \nmoths, the small business community supported the Senate's plan to \nenact a recommendation by the General Accounting Office as part of one \nof the continuing resolutions. However, that provision was blocked time \nand again by a few Republican Congressmen on behalf of the \nAdministration. We are now faced with leaving small businesses strapped \nfor financing until next year or enacting this bill that would put in \nplace something called an econometric model to calculate the subsidy \nrate for the 7(a) program immediately, but for one year only.\n  Our goal--that of Senator Bond, Senator Conrad, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Hollings, Senator Byrd, and myself--was to right years of wrong \nin which the government has played budget games with the two largest \nloan programs at the Small Business Administration. Our goal was to end \na double-standard in which the government cooks the books but small \nbusinesses get penalized if a comma is missing on their financial \nstatements. Our goal was to put transparency, accuracy, and fairness \ninto a system that has overcharged small business borrowers and \nprivate-sector lenders more than $2 billion fees, fees that are \ntantamount to a tax on small businesses.\n  Specifically, our goal, in technical talk, was to put in place budget \nsystems in this fiscal year that would more accurately calculate the \ncost of providing loans through the SBA's 7(a) and 504 lending \nprograms, thereby maximizing appropriations to leverage an additional \n$6 billion in small business loans and assessing fees that are more in \nline with the true cost of providing the loans. In the end, it would \nstimulate lending by creating a greater incentive for lenders to loan \nin these uncertain economic times, it would leave more money in the \npockets of small businesses, and it would allow almost 190,000 jobs to \nbe created or retained.\n  There is a lot of concern among small business trade groups, bankers, \nand members of Congress about adopting an econometric model at this \nstage because the administration has not been forthcoming with \nsupporting documentation and the estimated subsidy rates over the \ntesting period have varied greatly. Without that information, it is \nunreasonable to expect the small business community to trust the \ngovernment. They have been fighting this problem for too long to settle \nfor mere promises, when promises have been broken time and again. In \nthe coming months I look forward to working with the Administration to \nget this information and give all of us confidence that this model is \nmore predictive and accurate.\n  On the plus side, as I mentioned earlier, passing this legislation \nwould reverse the 60-percent cut in the 7(a) loan program by patching \ntogether $6 billion in lending dollars. That restoration of loan \ndollars is significant on a micro and macro level. In my home state of \nMassachusetts, small businesses stand to lose $121 million in loan \ndollars and almost 3,700 jobs if this bill isn't passed. Nationwide, a \nloss of $6.2 billion in loans would translate into 189,000 jobs either \nlost or not created. In this economy, we can not afford to lose any \nmore jobs or block job creation.\n  To my many colleagues who have courageously fought for small \nbusinesses on this issue--from Senator Bond and Senator Conrad to \nCongressman Manzullo and Congresswoman Velazquez--I thank them. To the \nsmall business groups--from 7(a)'s NAGGL and 504's NADCO to the small \nbusiness coalition lead by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which included \namong many others, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, National \nSmall Business United, and the American Bankers Association--I am proud \nto work with them. Because of your grassroots efforts, probably every \nmember of Congress knows what a subsidy rate is and how it hurts the \nsmall business community when it is left uncorrected year after year. \nLast, I thank the Office of Management and Budget for reaching this \nagreement with our Committee, the Committee on Small Business & \nEntrepreneurship, the Committee on Budget, and the Committee on \nAppropriations. I know they are strongly opposed, in general, to \nchanges to their subsidy rates, and, in particular, to any adjustment \nto the budget mid-year. But, small businesses do not care about \ntechnicalities and budget intricacies; they care about access to \ncapital. This bill accomplishes that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be printed \nin the Record: a letter from the small business coalition; a letter to \nOMB from our Committee with the Committee on budget regarding this \nissue; and a letter from OMB Director Mitch Daniels regarding the \nFY2003 subsidy rate for the 7(a) loan program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Small Business Access\n\n\n                                         to Capital Coalition,\n\n                                               September 18, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry: On behalf of the hundreds of thousands \n     of small businesses represented by the undersigned \n     organizations, we are writing you to ask your support for \n     legislation that would limit the use of outdated default rate \n     data in calculating the subsidy rate for the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) 7(a) an 504 programs.\n       The undersigned associations believe government policies \n     that foster and encourage robust entrepreneurial activity and \n     small business ownership provide the basis for economic \n     prosperity important to the long term vitality and success of \n     our nation. Many of our small business members indicate that \n     one major obstacle to entry or expansion of a small business \n     is the availability and access to capital for small \n     enterprises.\n       One source of funding, the SBA 7(a) and 504 guaranteed loan \n     programs, play an important role in providing an alternative \n     means of accessing capital for some small business owners \n     where funding has not been available through conventional \n     lending methods. However, in a recent Government Accounting \n     Office (GAO) report, it was determined that the use of overly \n     conservative default rate data by the SBA resulted in \n     overestimated defaults for 1992 through 2000 by over $2 \n     billion for the 7(a) program alone when compared to actual \n     loan performance.\n       Indeed, overly conservative default rates used in \n     calculating the subsidy rate, according to the GAO report, \n     has during the same period, resulted in the overestimation of \n     the cost of the 7(a) program by nearly $1 billion. \n     Furthermore, consistent yearly program reestimates of this \n     magnitude serve to undermine the intent of Congress during \n     the appropriations process.\n       Even so, overly conservative default rate assumptions are \n     still being used to calculate FY 2003 subsidy rates, \n     resulting in diminished numbers or sizes the loans capable of \n     being made given current program funding levels. Taken into \n     account historic levels of demand, we can anticipate program \n     shortages that may needlessly shutout some small businesses \n     to sorely needed funds to start or grow their businesses, \n     thus limiting their contribution to the fragile economic \n     recovery.\n       The consistent use of overly conservative default rate \n     date, resulting in the overestimation of the subsidy rate for \n     the 7(a) and 504 programs by SBA is not only contrary to the \n     spirit and intent of the Credit Reform Act, but an affront on \n     Congresses role in determining program funding levels in the \n     appropriations process. As a result, we encourage Congress to \n     take legislative action to assure the FY 2003's subsidy rate \n     calculation and future calculations will be limited to the \n     use of recent default rate data that reflect the use of \n     revised program credit standards and thus preserve the \n     integrity of the appropriations process.\n       AeA, Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American \n     Bankers Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association, \n     American Nursey & Landscape Association, Association of Small \n     Business Developmemt Centers, Asian American Hotel Owners \n     Association, Hotel Brokers International, Independent \n     Community Bankers Association, International Franchise \n     Association.\n       National Association of Development Companies, National \n     Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, National \n     Association of Small Disadvantaged Businesses, National \n     Association of Women Business Owners, National Black Chamber \n     of Commerce, National Restaurant Association, National Small \n     Business United, National Tooling & Machining Association, \n     Tire Industry Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, United \n     Motorcoach Association, Women Impacting Public Policy, Yellow \n     Pages Integrated Media Association.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitchell Daniels,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Eisenhower \n         Executive Office Building,\n     17th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Daniels: We are writing to express our concern \n     about what appears to be the continued and routine over-\n     estimation by OMB of the cost of the Small Business \n     Administration's 504 and 7(a) loan programs to the government \n     under the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act \n     (Credit Reform). The Senate has repeatedly raised this issue \n     with the OMB, most recently in the FY 2002 appropriations \n     cycle, at a Roundtable held by the Senate Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship last fall, and in meetings \n     between Senate Budget Committee staff and OMB staff.\n       Last fall, the SBA Administrator publicly stated, and your \n     senior OMB staff indicated to our staff, that the subsidy \n     rate for the 7(a) program would be cut at least in half, all \n     else being equal. Unfortunately, the 2003 budget request \n     reflects that only half of that goal has been accomplished. \n     Given the systematic mis-estimates in these programs, this \n     progress, while in the right direction, has been too slow and \n     does not do much to engender confidence in the \n     Administration's approach in light of SBA or OMB mistakes in \n     budget documents over the years.\n       In our view, failure to solve the problem will continue the \n     unfair practice of forcing small business borrowers and \n     lenders, year after year, to pay fees that are substantially \n     higher than necessary to participate in and cover the \n     government's cost of these programs.\n       The nexus of the problem appears to be the use of overly \n     conservative loan default rates as part of each program's \n     cost calculation under Credit Reform and the failure to \n     adequately weight historical data to reflect more accurately \n     the program changes, both statutory and regulatory, that have \n     resulted in reduced default rates and improved program \n     performance.\n       The FY 2003 credit subsidy rate for the 504 program assumes \n     an 8.3 percent loan default rate. But program statistics from \n     the Bank of New York suggest the rate is in the 4 percent \n     range instead. Use of the higher default rate results in the \n     average 504 borrower unnecessarily paying approximately \n     $10,000 in excess fees to participate in this program. We \n     should emphasize that this program receives no federal \n     appropriations and is totally funded through fees. Yet, since \n     1997 the program has paid nearly $400 million in excess fees \n     to the U.S. Treasury as a result of OMB reestimates. Since \n     1995, the use of overly conservative default rate assumptions \n     in the 7(a) program has resulted in total downward re-\n     estimates of $1.429 billion, including interest.\n       The SBA testified earlier this year that it is developing \n     an econometric model to estimate more accurately the default \n     rate for each program. But, although we have already been \n     told for at least a year how ``econometric'' modeling \n     promises to be the solution, there is little to show for this \n     new approach--at least, we have not seen anything yet. \n     Because of the slow progress in the past and the experience \n     of unfulfilled expectations, we remain skeptical that the \n     emerging modeling approach will offer a significant \n     improvement over previous approaches or that it will be ready \n     with satisfactory results in time for the 2004 budget. \n     Therefore, we request that OMB keep all of us up to date of \n     the progress of the modeling through periodic briefings with \n     our staff so we have an opportunity to ask questions.\n       Continued use of overly conservative assumptions in the \n     credit reform model for both of these programs and the \n     resulting continuation of downward re-estimates could \n     undermine support for Credit Reform, which we do not want to \n     see happen. The bias in the estimates for these two programs \n     is simply unacceptable. We do not expect perfect subsidy rate \n     estimates year-in and year-out, yet we do expect that over \n     time the re-estimate will be randomly distributed around \n     zero. One year the estimates may be high and the next year \n     they may be low, but over time they should balance out. \n     Unfortunately, that is not true today, and we are not \n     optimistic that change will occur, absent your active \n     intervention, any time soon.\n       Repeated opportunities to address this problem have not \n     been realized. We believe the problem has dragged on too \n     long. At a minimum, we expect the Administration to submit \n     and support a budget amendment for 2003 for sufficient \n     subsidy appropriations that will make possible $11 billion of \n     7(a) loan volume given the too-high subsidy rate OMB is \n     currently using. Alternatively, if you expect that a review \n     of the 2003 submission will reveal mistakes in the subsidy \n     rates that would allow OMB to execute the 2003 budget using \n     rates other than those published in the submission, as has \n     occurred in other years, please submit that review. We would \n     appreciate receiving your response to our letter, including \n     the requests for an amendment and periodic meetings, by June \n     1, 2002. If legislative changes are necessary, we welcome \n     your suggestions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V. Domenici,\n     Kent Conrad,\n     John F. Kerry,\n     Christopher S. Bond.\n                                  ____\n\n                                Executive Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Donald A. Manzullo,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of November \n     12, regarding the subsidy rate for small business loans.\n       As you know, the Administration is committed to improving \n     the Small Business Administration's (SBA) ability to more \n     accurately estimate the cost of subsidizing small business \n     loans. This will enable the agency to allocate its resources \n     more effectively, determine program risk more precisely, and \n     increase its ability to target loan programs to the most \n     deserving recipients.\n       In accordance with the commitment that the Administration \n     made one year ago, the Office of Management and Budget has \n     just approved SBA's 7(a) econometric subsidy model to \n     calculate its fiscal year 2004 resource requirements. \n     Further, in light of the fact that this improved subsidy \n     calculation procedure is now available, the Administration \n     would support legislation that allows us to implement the \n     econometric model for fiscal year 2003 as well. Applying the \n     econometric model would produce a subsidy rate of 1.04 \n     percent rather than the 1.76 percent submitted in the FY 2003 \n     budget.\n       Please let us know if you need any more information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Mitchel E. Daniels, Jr.,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Last, I want to remember Senator Wellstone, a true \nadvocate for small business who faithfully attended our committee \nhearings and markups and worked hard to help the 7(a) and 504 programs \nnot just on this issue, but every single time. His contributions were \ngreat, and I wish he were here to see this agreement pass.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation that \nhas just been introduced to permit the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) to use a recently-completed econometric model to calculate the \ncredit subsidy rate for the 7(a) small business loan guarantee program, \nthe flagship loan program at the Small Business Administration. This \nbill, once signed into law by President Bush, will allow the 7(a) loan \nprogram to meet the borrowing demands of our Nation's small businesses, \nwhich is approximately $10 billion for Fiscal Year 2003. Without this \nbill, the program would limit 7(a) loans to less than $5 billion for FY \n2003. In addition, the bill will permit unobligated, no-year funds \npreviously appropriated for the STAR terrorist disaster recovery loans \nto be used for the 7(a) loan program.\n  The ``econometric model'' is a significant reform in the way the SBA \nand OMB calculates the credit subsidy rate for the 7(a) loan program. \nThe bill provides that the OMB and SBA will adopt the new econometric \nmodel effective retroactively to October 1, 2002. Developed by the SBA \nand OMB, the econometric model will use far more comprehensive data \nabout individual borrowers and loans when forecasting anticipated \ndefaults and establishing loan reserves to cover them.\n  Under the Credit Reform Act of 1990, the annual appropriation for the \nSBA must, in advance, provide sufficient funds to cover the cost of a \nFederal loan guarantee, after taking into consideration the fees paid \nby small business borrowers and lenders under the 7(a) program. This \namount, referred to as the credit subsidy rate, is determined by the \nOMB prior to the submission of the President's annual Budget Request to \nthe Congress.\n  Critics of the credit subsidy rate for the 7(a) program have cited \nthe use of historical loan-performance data that pre-dates the \nenactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act as a major cause of a credit \nsubsidy rate that greatly exceeds actual loan performance. The \nconsequence is the use of the most conservative loan-default rates, \nyear-in and year-out, and the failure by the OMB and the SBA to adjust \nhistorical loan performance data to reflect 7(a) program changes, both \nstatutory and regulatory, that have led to real reductions in the \ndefault rates and improved program performance. According to an in-\ndepth analysis undertaken by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the \nexcessively high credit subsidy rates have resulted in nearly $1 \nbillion in unnecessary fees being paid by small business borrowers and \nlenders to the U.S. Treasury.\n  It is very unrealistic to believe that a 100% accurate credit subsidy \nrate estimate can be derived for the 7(a) loan program, or for any \nother Federal credit program. The econometric model, designed to \ncalculate the 7(a) credit subsidy rate, is a major improvement over the \n``old'' model. Originally, the\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nAdministration stated that the econometric model would not be available \nuntil FY 2004. After exhaustive negotiations with the senior White \nHouse staff, I was able to secure an agreement to accelerate their use \nof the model retroactive to October 1, 2002, the beginning of FY 2003. \nThe bill before us today is designed to waive a key provision of the \nFederal Credit Reform Act that prohibits the Congress from changing a \ncredit subsidy rate estimate once it has been transmitted to the \nCongress as part of the President's annual budget submission. This may \nbe the first time this provision has been waived since implementation \nof the Act in FY 1992.\n  We would not be where we are today resolving this important matter \nwithout the tireless efforts of my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. Mr. Manzullo, Chairman of the House Committee \non Small Business, fought for this change every step of the way. The \nRanking Member, Ms. Velazquez, was especially vigilant in her efforts. \nIn the Senate, my colleague from Massachusetts and Chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, John Kerry, has kept \nthe Committee focused on resolving this issue for the past year and has \ninsisted that we resolve the credit subsidy rate controversy for FY \n2003.\n  Resolving the 7(a) credit subsidy rate issue is good for small \nbusinesses. It will mean more jobs and economic fuel to grow start-up \nand growing small businesses. I urge each of my colleagues to vote a \nresounding ``Aye'' for this important bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3172) was read three times and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3172\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SUBSIDY RATE FOR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS.\n\n         Notwithstanding section 502(5)(F) of the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990 and section 254(j) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget, in calculating the \n     Federal cost for guaranteeing loans during fiscal year 2003 \n     under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     636(a)) may use the most recently approved subsidy cost model \n     and methodology in conjunction with the program and economic \n     assumptions, and historical data which were included in the \n     fiscal year 2003 budget. After written notification to \n     Congress, the Small Business Administration shall implement \n     the validated, OMB-approved subsidy rate for fiscal year \n     2003, using this model and methodology. Such rate shall be \n     deemed to have been effective on October 1, 2002.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, we have passed tonight a bill to \nextend for one year the current provisions of the 1986 Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act which provides limited parity for insurance \ncoverage of mental illness.\n  But today is not a day to celebrate. Instead, it is a call to arms--a \ncall to pass the full and meaningful mental health parity bill that \nPaul Wellstone and Pete Domenici have fought for so tirelessly. It is a \nday to sound the battle cry for finally ensuring that no American is \ndiscriminated against because they suffer from a mental illness.\n  Mental illness is a pervasive problem in our society, and too often \nit is a problem that is swept under the rug\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\nwith an immense human cost. One out of five Americans will suffer from \nsome form of mental illness this year--but only one-third of them will \nreceive treatment.\n  The fight against discrimination is not new--it is as old as the \nRepublic and as fresh as today's headlines. All Americans deserve \nequality of opportunity and fundamental fairness.\n  Next year this fight begins anew. All of us are saddened that Paul \nWellstone is no longer with us to carry on this fight. But we intend to \nhonor his memory and continue to fight for the cause for which he \nworked so hard. We will not rest until we enact legislation that ends \nthe cruel discrimination that burdens so many Americans suffering from \nmental illness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11223-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 107-21\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on November 15, 2002, by the President \nof the United States:\n  Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, Treaty \nDocument No. 107-21; I further ask that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nwith a declaration, the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \nNuclear Damage done at Vienna on September 12, 1997. This Convention \nwas adopted by a Diplomatic Conference convened by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and was opened for signature at Vienna on \nSeptember 29, 1997, during the IAEA General Conference. Then-Secretary \nof Energy Federico Pena signed the Convention for the United States on \nthat date, subject to ratification. Also transmitted for the \ninformation of the Senate is the report of the Department of State \nconcerning the Convention.\n  The Convention establishes a legal framework for defining, \nadjudicating, and compensating civil liability for nuclear damage that \nresults from an incident in the territory of a Party, or in certain \ncircumstances in international waters, and creates a contingent \ninternational supplementary compensation fund. This fund would be \nactivated in the event of an incident with damage so extensive that it \nexhausts the compensation funds that the Party where the incident \noccurs is obligated under the Convention to make available.\n  The international supplementary fund would be made up largely of \ncontributions from Parties that operate nuclear power plants. The \nimproved legal certainty and uniformity provided under the Convention \ncombined with the availability of additional resources provided by the \ninternational supplementary fund create a balanced package appealing \nboth to countries that operate nuclear power plants and those that do \nnot. The Convention thus creates for the first time the potential for a \nnuclear civil liability convention with global application.\n  Prompt U.S. ratification of the Convention is important for two \nreasons. First, U.S. suppliers of nuclear technology now face \npotentially unlimited third-party civil liability arising from their \nactivities in foreign markets because the United States is not \ncurrently party to any international nuclear civil liability \nconvention. In addition to limiting commercial opportunities, lack of \nliability protection afforded by treaty obligations has limited the \nscope of participation by major U.S. companies in the provision of \nsafety assistance to Soviet-designed nuclear power plants, increasing \nthe risk of future accidents in these plants. Once widely applied, the \nConvention will create for suppliers of U.S. nuclear equipment and \ntechnology substantially the same legal environment in foreign markets \nthat they now experience domestically under the Price-Anderson Act. It \nwill level the playing field on which they meet foreign competitors and \neliminate the liability concerns that have inhibited them from \nproviding the fullest range of safety assistance.\n  Second, under existing nuclear liability conventions many potential \nvictims outside the United States generally have no assurance that they \nwill be adequately or promptly compensated in the event they are harmed \nby a civil nuclear incident, especially if that incident occurs outside \ntheir borders or damages their environment. The Convention, once widely \naccepted, will provide that assurance.\n  United States leadership is essential in order to bring the \nConvention into force soon. With the United States as an initial Party, \nother countries will find the Convention attractive and the number of \nParties is likely to grow quickly. Without U.S. leadership, the \nConvention could take many years to enter into force. The creation of a \nglobal civil liability regime will play a critical role in allowing \nnuclear power to achieve its full potential in the diverse and \nenvironmentally responsible world energy structure we need to build in \nthe coming decades.\n  The Convention is consistent with the primary existing U.S. statute \ngoverning nuclear civil liability, the Price-Anderson Act of 1957. \nAdoption of the Convention would require virtually no substantive \nchanges in that Act. Moreover, under legislation that is being \nsubmitted separately to implement the Convention, the U.S. contingent \nliability to contribute to the international supplementary fund would \nbe completely covered, either by funds generated under the Price-\nAnderson Act in the event of an accident covered by both that Act and \nthe Convention, or by funds contributed to a retrospective pool by U.S. \nsuppliers of nuclear equipment and technology in the event of an \naccident covered by the Convention but falling outside the Price-\nAnderson system. In either case, U.S. taxpayers would not have to bear \nthe burden of the U.S. contribution to the international supplementary \nfund.\n  The Convention allows nations that are party to existing nuclear \nliability conventions to join the new global regime easily, without \ngiving up their participation in those conventions.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2458, which is now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2458) to enhance the management and promotion \n     of electronic Government services and processes by \n     establishing a Federal Chief Information Officer within the \n     Office of Management and Budget, and by establishing a broad \n     framework of measures that require using Internet-based \n     information technology to enhance citizen access to \n     Government information and services, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to applaud passage by the House \nand Senate today of the E-Government Act of 2002. The E-Government Act \nis strong, bipartisan legislation that will help bring the Federal \nGovernment into the electronic age by improving the access of all \ncitizens to the government services and information they rely on every \nday in their work and personal lives.\n  The bill that we are passing today, H.R. 2458, represents a consensus \nbetween Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House, and with \nthe administration. It is the product of more than a year of \nnegotiations and cooperation between Senators Fred Thompson, Conrad \nBurns and me, and\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\nCongressmen Tom Davis, Jim Turner, Dan Burton, and Henry Waxman. It is \nalso the result of important input from a range of constituencies who \nsupport electronic government. This bill has won the support of the IT \nindustry, of the public access community, of privacy advocates, and of \nnon-profit groups interested in good government. There are many others \nwho have contributed to the legislation, too many to name here. The \nbill demonstrates what can happen when we put aside partisan interests \nand work together to improve the performance of our Government.\n  I introduced the E-Government Act, S. 803, on May 1, 2001, with \nSenator Burns as chief co-cosponsor, and many original co-sponsors from \nboth parties. This March after months of negotiations with the White \nHouse and with the help of my friend Senator Thompson, an amended \nversion of the bill was reported out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. The committee filed Report No. 107-174 with the bill; this \nreport provides important explanations and background on key concepts \nand terms in the legislation and should be referred to as relevant \nlegislative history. The E-Government Act first passed the Senate on \nJune 27 of this year. This fall, the House Government Reform Committee \ntook up H.R. 2458, companion legislation to S. 803 that had been \nintroduced by Rep. Jim Turner on July 11, 2001. The House Government \nReform Committee incorporated virtually all of the amended S. 803. It \nalso expanded upon several provisions and added new ones, some of them \ninitiatives that had been worked on for some time by Congressman Davis, \nTurner, Burton and Waxman. The revised E-government legislation was \npassed by the House by unanimous consent early this morning.\n  In less than a decade the tremendous growth of the Internet has \ntransformed the way industry and the public conduct their business and \ngain access to needed information. This, in turn, has spawned a growing \npublic expectation that government will make use of new information \ntechnologies, and a growing support for electronic government. \nInformation technology, and the Internet in particular, provide a \nunique opportunity to re-package government information and services, \nso they are offered to the public according to the needs of individual \ncustomers. They can also facilitate interagency cooperation without \nrequiring a major reorganization of government agencies. Ultimately, e-\ngovernment can transform the way government operates, essentially \neffecting a ``virtual'' reengineering of government. This paradigm \nshift requires systems based on function and the needs of the citizen \nrather than agency jurisdiction. If the government integrates processes \nacross agency boundaries, the public will experience government as a \nseamless web of offerings. Federal services and information on the \nInternet can even be consolidated with those of state and local \ngovernments.\n\n  The ``E-Government Act of 2002'' will facilitate this transformation \nto a government organized more appropriately according to the needs of \nthe public. The bill requires agencies to link their e-government \ninitiatives to key customer segments, and to work collectively in doing \nso. The E-Government Fund provides necessary funding for inter-agency \nprojects, overcoming the difficulty in securing appropriations for \ncooperative endeavors. The Federal Internet Portal provides ``one-stop \nshopping'' for citizens, businesses, and other governments: information \nand services will be integrated according to the needs of all users, \nall of it accessible from a single point on the Internet. The \nAdministrator of the Office of Electronic Government will oversee and \npromote this vital transformation.\n  Among its many provisions, the E-Government Act would: establish an \nOffice of Electronic Government, headed by a Presidentially-appointed \nAdministrator within the Office of Management and Budget; authorize \n$345 million over four years for an E-Government Fund to support \ninteragency e-government projects; improve upon the centralized Federal \nGovernment online portal that now exists so that it is more user \nfriendly and establish an online directory of Federal web sites, \norganized by subject matter; require Federal courts to post opinions \nand other information online, and regulatory agencies to conduct rule-\nmaking over the Internet; improve recruitment and training of \ninformation technology professionals in Federal agencies; and encourage \nelectronic interoperability so that different agencies can communicate \nwith one another more efficiently.\n  We have taken care to include significant privacy protections and we \nextend and improve successful information security provisions due to \nexpire this month. The Thompson-Lieberman Government Information \nSecurity Reform Act, which was enacted at the end of the last Congress, \nhas provided a sturdy management framework for protecting the security \nof government computers. Congressman Davis has authored a new version \nof the legislation, updating it and improving it.\n  As we are also in the process of debating homeland security \nlegislation, it is worth noting that the E-Government Act is directly \nrelevant to the goal of ensuring improved homeland security. The E-\nGovernment Act will give the Federal Government the tools and structure \nto transform its IT systems, one of the greatest vulnerabilities of \nagencies now tasked with homeland security missions. As we've seen \nthrough dozens of depressing revelations over the last year, we have \ndesperate need for more effective information systems at agencies like \nthe FBI, CIA, Department of State, the INS, and state and local \nauthorities. The E-Government Act will help the Federal Government get \nthat job done, by establishing more effective IT management, \nestablishing mandates for action, and authorizing funding.\n  The bill will also substantially enhance the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to quickly provide information and services to citizens to \nhelp them prepare for, and respond to, terrorism, natural disasters, \nand other homeland threats. In the hours and days after the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, Americans flooded government websites in \nrecord numbers, seeking information more targeted than what the media \nwas providing: what was happening; how they should respond to protect \nthemselves from possible future attacks; how they could help victims; \nand how people who were victims themselves could seek assistance. The \nE-Government Act will substantially enhance the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to quickly provide information and services to citizens to \nhelp them prepare for, and respond to, terrorism, natural disasters, \nand other homeland threats.\n  Mr. President, Congress's passage of this legislation will result in \na better Government and a stronger America.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate; and that any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2458) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/15/senate-section/article/S11228-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.
